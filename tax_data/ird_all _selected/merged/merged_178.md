This statement covers the income tax treatment of software for taxpayers who purchase, lease, licence, develop, or commission software for use in a business carried on for the purposes of deriving assessable or excluded income. The statement expressly refers only to taxpayers that are carrying on a business. However, except where otherwise stated, the principles in this statement also apply to taxpayers who incur expenditure on software in deriving assessable or excluded income (otherwise than in the course of carrying on a business). 2. This statement does not consider: Unclassified 2  the income tax treatment of software for taxpayers that develop software for third parties – e.g to earn income from the sale or licence of the software (software developers);  the treatment of software funded by a government grant and, in particular, the application of s DF 1; or  the application of any specific research and development provisions other than s DB 34; or  any potential withholding tax obligations that a taxpayer may have – for example, for royalties or interest paid to a non-resident software supplier, or for services provided by a non-resident contractor. These issues are covered in IG0007 “Non-resident software suppliers’ payments derived from New Zealand – Income tax treatment” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 11 (November 2003) (it is noted that this statement is due to be reviewed). Summary 3. The following is a brief summary of the main income tax implications of acquiring or developing software for use in a business. Further details are set out in the analysis section below. Software purchases  Software purchased will generally be a capital asset that must be depreciated at 50% diminishing value or 40% straight-line.  An immediate write-off for software costing less than $500 will be allowed where the conditions in s EE 38 are satisfied.  Maintenance costs may be deducted when incurred.  Upgrade costs must be capitalised and depreciated. Periodic payments for the right to use or access software  Periodic payments for the right to use or access software (often online software) are generally deductible when incurred. Software developed in-house for use in business  In limited situations a deduction may be allowed for expenditure in determining the feasibility of developing a piece of software for use in a business. Where such a deduction is not available, then unless another provision applies allowing a deduction (such as s DB 34), the expenditure should be capitalised until the software is either completed or abandoned.  If the software is completed for use in the taxpayer’s business, the cost of the software can be depreciated at 50% diminishing value or 40% straight-line.  If software is abandoned before it becomes depreciable property, a deduction may be allowed for the expenditure incurred in developing the software. Unclassified 3  Expenditure incurred in maintaining software once it has been completed will generally be deductible when incurred.  Upgrade costs must be capitalised and depreciated. Commissioned software  Expenditure on software commissioned by a taxpayer for use in its business should be capitalised until the software is complete. The costs can then be depreciated over the life of the item.  If the software is abandoned before it becomes depreciable property, a deduction may be allowed for the expenditure incurred in developing the software. Lease of software under finance lease  Software leased under a finance lease is treated as a sale of software by the lessor to the lessee. Also, the lessor is treated as giving a loan to the lessee for the software and the lessee is treated as using the loan to buy the software.  The Act then applies to the arrangement as recharacterised.  The financial arrangements rules apply to the loan.  The depreciation rules apply as if the lessee owned the software.  The treatment at the end of the finance lease depends on who acquires the rights to the software at the end of the lease term. Introduction 4. In 1993, the Commissioner published a policy statement setting out the income tax treatment of computer software (see Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 10 (May 1993)). A number of parts of that item were out of date. Consequently, “IS 16/01: Income tax – Computer software acquired for use in a taxpayer’s business” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 6 (July 2016) was issued to replace the 1993 item except for the parts of that item that deal with taxpayers carrying on a software development business. 5. In February 2017, the Commissioner issued a revised statement on feasibility expenditure (“IS 17/01: Income tax – Deductibility of feasibility expenditure” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 3 (April 2017)). That statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on the deductibility of expenditure incurred in determining the feasibility of acquiring or developing a capital asset. This item replaces IS 16/01, which has been updated to the extent that it applied the Commissioner’s previous view on feasibility expenditure. Analysis 6. This statement covers the income tax treatment of software for taxpayers who:  purchase software for use in their business;  make periodic payments for the right to use software (other than under a finance lease) in their business;  develop software in-house for use in their business;  commission software development for use in their business; or  lease software under a finance lease for use in their business. Unclassified 4 7. Each of these situations is considered below. As the depreciation provisions are relevant to four of the situations, a more general discussion on depreciation is included after the discussion of the specific scenarios. Software purchases 8. When software is purchased (whether “off the shelf” or online), generally the purchase price will be paid for the right to use the software (in the form of a licence). A taxpayer who acquires software for use in a business gets an enduring benefit. The expenditure incurred is capital in nature and non-deductible, but the taxpayer can claim depreciation on the software over its life. 9. The cost of maintaining the software is deductible expenditure under s DA 1. The cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. The depreciation treatment is discussed in more detail below (from \[35\]). Periodic payments for the right to use or access software 10. Where a taxpayer makes periodic payments for the right to use or access software (other than software leased under a finance lease), the payments will generally not give rise to a capital asset. This can occur, for example, where a taxpayer pays a periodic licence fee for the right to use software or where a taxpayer pays a subscription fee to access software online (also known as software as a service). The payments will be deductible under s DA 1 (subject to the general limitations in s DA 2). A deduction will be allowed in the income year that the expenditure is incurred, unless a specific timing provision applies. Software developed in-house for use in business 11. A business (not including a software development business) may develop software in-house for use in its own business. Developing software in-house will generally create a capital asset. The tax treatment of the costs incurred in the software development will differ for different phases of the development. In summary, the following principles apply. Expenditure developing the software 12. In limited cases, early stage feasibility expenditure (ie expenditure incurred analysing the feasibility of developing a piece of software for use in a business) may be deductible. The Commissioner’s view on the deductibility of feasibility expenditure is set out in the interpretation statement IS 17/01: “Income Tax – Deductibility of Feasibility Expenditure” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No. 3 (April 2017)). 13. Where a deduction is not available, expenditure should be capitalised until the software is either completed or abandoned. This includes both direct costs and indirect costs. Direct costs include personnel costs directly attributable to the project, and depreciation costs on hardware dedicated to the project. Indirect costs are overhead costs that cannot be directly linked to a particular project. These may include general overhead costs (such as rates, rent, insurance, and energy costs), indirect labour costs, and indirect material costs (such as paper, and printer toner). 14. Direct costs should be relatively easy to calculate (for example personnel costs can be calculated by recording the direct hours spent by staff on a project). 15. Indirect costs (including utility costs, rental or ownership costs of property etc...) should be allocated using a method that gives a fair and reasonable result. A possible allocation method might be based on the proportion of direct person hours allocated to the project. Where accurate time recording is not undertaken, a functional analysis of what each employee working on the project does may be Unclassified 5 appropriate. However, a taxpayer can use another method if it can be shown that it is appropriate. For example, in some circumstances, a method based on the proportionate time and space used for the project may be appropriate. 16. If the software is completed for use in the taxpayer’s business its cost can be depreciated (see from \[35\] below). To be depreciable, the software must be used or available for use. In the Commissioner’s view, a piece of software will be available for use when it is capable of being used for the purpose that it was developed. This is likely to be after it has been tested to determine that it works as intended and when it is ready (or materially ready) to ‘go live’. 17. For depreciation purposes, s EE 18B includes the amount of expenditure incurred in developing the software as part of the cost of the copyright in the software. The copyright in the software is the depreciable property, as it is listed in sch 14. If the software is developed as a series of modules that can be operated independently, each module can be depreciated as it is implemented. At that time it will be “depreciable property”, and will be used or available for use in the taxpayer’s business. 18. If the software is abandoned before there is an item of depreciable property, s DB 40B may allow a deduction (see from \[28\] below). Research and development (R&D) expenditure 19. An alternative treatment may be available where the expenditure on software is “research” or “development” and is recognised as an expense for financial reporting purposes 1 . 20. The main provision of the Act applicable to R&D expenditure is s DB 34. Section DB 34 allows a deduction for expenditure (other than expenditure excluded under s DB 34(6)) incurred on R&D by those persons who:  recognise the R&D expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes under either of two designated financial reporting standards (s DB 34(2));  recognise the R&D expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes because it is written off as an immaterial amount but, had it been material, would have been required to recognise it as an expense for financial reporting purposes under either of the two designated financial reporting standards (s DB 34(4)); or  incur R&D expenditure of $10,000 or less in an income year, have recognised it as an expense for financial reporting purposes (but not, necessarily, under either of the designated reporting standards) and have written the amount off as immaterial (s DB 34(5)). 21. “Research” and “development” are both defined in paragraph 8 of the New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38, in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place. 22. Taxpayers who incur R&D expenditure (excluding interest) can claim the deduction in the income year the expenditure is incurred or they can choose to allocate the expenditure to a later income year in accordance with s EJ 23. A deduction can only be made in a later income year if there is income that arises as a result of the R&D expenditure in that year (R&D income). A taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction under s DB 34 has the option of not taking the deduction. They have the 1 See Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 26, No 4 (May 2014) for a discussion of the relationship between the minimum financial reporting requirements for companies under the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014 and the references to financial reporting standards in the Income Tax Act 2007. Unclassified 6 option of returning their income and expenditure on the basis that the section does not apply (s DB 34(8)). 23. If applied, the R&D rules override the capital limitation but the general permission and other general limitations still apply (s DB 34(10)). Post-development maintenance and upgrades 24. Expenditure incurred in maintaining software once it has been completed will generally be revenue in nature and deductible under s DA 1. This would include expenditure such as fixing programming bugs, providing help desk facilities and making minor changes to the software - that is, routine changes that do not materially increase the capacity or performance of the software. 25. Expenditure on upgrades (or improvements) to the software will be capital in nature. A change will be an upgrade when it adds new features to the software, or increases its capacity, performance or life. The cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Other post-development expenditure 26. The capital cost of an item includes any expenditure on installation and getting the item ready for using to earn income (see BP Refinery (Kwinana) Ltd v FCT (1960) 12 ATD 204 and IS 10/06 “Deductibility of business relocation costs” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 8 (September 2010)). Therefore, any expenditure on installing or integrating the software with the taxpayer’s system will be capital. 27. Other post-development expenditure will usually be deductible under s DA 1. These costs could include, for example, producing instruction manuals and staff training. Unsuccessful software 28. Section DB 40B overrides the capital limitation and provides a deduction for expenditure incurred on unsuccessful software development (to the extent that a deduction has not already been allowed). It only applies where the software was being developed for use in the taxpayer’s business. The development of the software must be abandoned before the copyright in the software becomes “depreciable property”. Section DB 40B also requires that the copyright in the software would have been depreciable property if the development had been completed. 29. If the requirements of s DB 40B are met, a deduction (for both the current year expenditure and the expenditure capitalised in earlier income years) is allowed in the income year in which the development of the software is abandoned. Sale of copy of developed software 30. A taxpayer who has developed software for use in their business (and capitalised and depreciated the development costs) may also subsequently sell a copy to a third party. For example, a manufacturing business may sell a copy of the stock control software used in its business to another manufacturing business. The proceeds of the sale will be assessable income. 31. The taxpayer should continue to depreciate the development costs. If there are costs associated with producing the second copy of the software (for example, the costs of printing manuals and training materials), these will be deductible. Commissioned software 32. Commissioned software is treated the same as software developed in-house (see from \[11\] above). Software commissioned by taxpayers for use in their business Unclassified 7 will be a capital asset. The costs must be capitalised until the software is complete. The costs can then be depreciated over the life of the item. The depreciation treatment is discussed in more detail below (from \[35\]). 33. If the development is abandoned before the software is completed, s DB 40B may apply to allow a deduction for the costs incurred. See \[28\] and \[29\] above. The treatment of post-development expenditure is the same as for software developed in-house (see from \[24\] above). 34. Where the expenditure on the software is “research” or “development” expenditure, s DB 34 may apply to allow an earlier deduction. See from \[19\] above. Depreciation 35. Under s EE 6, for property to be depreciable, it must be property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used (or available for use) in a business. For intangible property to be depreciable, it must also be listed in sch 14. Schedule 14 includes the copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, and the right to use software (such as under a licence). The property must also not be subject to any of the exclusions in s EE 7 (for example, low value property that has been dealt with under s EE 38). 36. The depreciation rate for the copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, and the right to use software is 50% diminishing value or 40% straight- line. An immediate write-off for software costing less than $500 will be allowed where the conditions in s EE 38 are satisfied. 37. If a taxpayer has a number of low value items of depreciable property (each item being below the maximum pooling value in s EE 65 (generally $5,000)), the taxpayer may be able to use the pool method to depreciate the group of items. The requirements for using the pool method are set out in ss EE 20 to EE 24, EE 65 and EE 66. 38. The cost of software upgrades (improvements) must be capitalised and depreciated (at 50% diminishing value or 40% straight-line). Section EE 37 sets out how improvements should be depreciated. It provides for improvements to be treated as separate items of depreciable property from the item being improved. 39. If a taxpayer believes that their particular software should have a higher or lower rate than that set by the Commissioner, the taxpayer can apply to the Commissioner for a special rate under s 91AAG of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The requirements for an application, including the associated fees, are set out in the Income Tax (Depreciation Determination) Regulations 1993. For a special rate to be given, a taxpayer needs to demonstrate that the economic life of their software is either greater or less (as the case may be) than four years (which is the economic life on which the 50% diminishing value and 40% straight line rates are based). The consequences of obtaining a special rate are set out in s EE 36. When software disposed of or no longer used 40. Sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply where a person receives consideration from the disposal of an item of depreciable property in the circumstances described in ss EE 44 to EE 47. They set out how to calculate an amount of depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss and may give rise to an amount of income or deduction. Relevantly, however, ss EE 48 to EE 52 do not apply when a person disposes of an item of intangible property as part of an arrangement to replace it with an item of the same kind. 41. Section EE 39 applies when a person has an item of depreciable property (other than property that had been depreciated using the pool method) that is no longer Unclassified 8 used. Section EE 39(4) provides that a person will have an amount of depreciation loss if:  they no longer use the item in their business, and  neither they nor an associated person intends to use the item in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, and  the costs of disposing of the item would be more than any consideration they could derive from disposing of it. 42. When the above criteria are met, a taxpayer will have an amount of depreciation loss equal to the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year. The taxpayer will be entitled to a deduction for this amount under s DA 1. The item’s adjusted tax value at the end of the income year will then be zero. 43. Sometimes, taxpayers may not wish to or may not be able to dispose of their software when it is no longer useful. Also, sometimes, rather than being disposed of, old software may be incorporated into a new version. The Commissioner’s view is that, where the software is still capable of being used by the taxpayer, it can continue to be depreciated. Where the software is incorporated into a new piece of software, the Commissioner’s view is that the software is still used or available for use and can continue to be depreciated. Lease of software under finance lease Meaning of “finance lease” 44. “Finance lease” is defined in s YA 1: finance lease means a lease of a personal property lease asset entered into by a person on or after 20 May 1999 that— (a) when the person enters the lease, involves or is part of an arrangement that involves— (i) the transfer of the ownership of the asset to the lessee or an associate of the lessee during or at the end of the term of the lease: (ii) the lessee or an associate of the lessee having the option of acquiring the asset for an amount that is likely to be substantially lower than the asset’s market value on the date of acquisition: (iii) a right of an associate of the lessee to acquire the asset, or a right of the lessor to require an associate of the lessee to acquire the asset, during the term of the lease under an arrangement that does not entitle the associate to receive all of the personal property lease payments that may fall due after the acquisition: (b) when the person enters the lease or from a later time, involves a term of the lease that is more than 75% of the asset’s estimated useful life as defined in section EE 63 (Meaning of estimated useful life): (c) the person enters on or after 20 June 2007 and is, or is part of, an arrangement that, when the person enters the lease or when a change in the terms of the arrangement changes the allocation or size of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the lease asset,— (i) involves the use of the asset outside New Zealand for all or most of the term of the lease; and (ii) involves income of any person who is not the lessor, arising from the use of the asset by any person, that is exempt income, or excluded income, or non-residents’ foreign sourced income; and (iii) is a finance lease under NZIAS 17 for the lessor, or for a company that is in the same group of companies as the lessor and derives assessable income from the arrangement, or is an arrangement under which persons who do not include the lessor bear substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the lease asset, determined as at the time the person enters the lease and taking into account later changes to the arrangement Unclassified 9 45. The term “lease” is defined in s YA 1. Relevantly, for the purposes of the finance lease provisions, it treats two or more consecutive or successive leases of the same property (to the lessee or an associate) as a single lease. 46. Therefore, a lease will be a “finance lease” if it meets the criteria in one or more of paras (a), (b), or (c) of the definition. 47. Broadly, para (a) captures arrangements where ownership of the lease asset is transferred to a lessee (or an associate), or the lessee (or an associate) has an option to acquire the lease asset for substantially below market value. It also applies where the arrangement involves a right of an associate of the lessee to acquire the asset, or a right of the lessor to require an associate of the lessee to acquire the asset, during the term of the lease where the associate is not entitled to receive all of the lease payments after the acquisition. 48. Paragraph (b) applies where, either when the person enters the lease, or at a later date, the term of the lease is greater than 75% of the asset’s estimated useful life. 49. Paragraph (c) will apply less commonly. In particular, it only applies where the leased asset is used outside New Zealand for all or most of the term of the lease, and involves exempt income, excluded income or non-residents’ foreign sourced income arising from the use of the asset (other than by the lessor). Implications of having a finance lease 50. When personal property is leased under a finance lease, the lease is treated as a sale of the lease asset by the lessor to the lessee on the date on which the term of the lease starts (s FA 6). Also, the lessor is treated as giving a loan to the lessee for the lease asset and the lessee is treated as using the loan to buy the lease asset. The Act then applies to the arrangement as recharacterised. 51. As the lease is recharacterised as a sale with an associated loan, the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW apply. For the lessor, the amount of the loan is determined under s EW 32 (s FA 7(1)). For the lessee, the amount of the loan is determined under ss EW 32 and EW 33 (s FA 7(2)). 52. The depreciation rules in subpart EE also apply. The lessee is treated as the owner of the software (s FA 8(2)) and the lessor is not treated as the owner of the software. The depreciation treatment is discussed in more detail above (from \[35\]). 53. Where an operating lease becomes a finance lease, the lessor and lessee must both adjust their income and expenditure. Section FA 11 sets out the requirements and formula for the adjustments. Treatment when the lease ends 54. Section FA 9 sets out the treatment at the end of a finance lease where the lessee acquires the asset. When a lessee acquires the software by the end of the lease term, the acquisition is treated as the same sale that was previously treated as occurring under s FA 6. Where the lessee (or an associate) acquires the software and later disposes of it for more than the consideration they paid, the excess is income of the lessee under s CC 11 (unless it is income under another provision of the Act). The income must be returned in the income year in which the lessee (or associated person) disposes of the asset (s FA 9(3)(a)). 55. Section FA 10 sets out the treatment where the lessor is treated as acquiring the asset at the end of the lease (because the lessee has not acquired the lease asset by the end of the lease). Unclassified 10 Examples 56. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 – periodic payments for access to online software 57. United Chemists Ltd runs a chain of pharmacies. It uses online accounting software for financial reporting, invoicing, inventory management and payroll. United Chemists pays a subscription fee of $50 per month to access the software online. United Chemists wants to know whether this fee is deductible. 58. The fee is deductible under s DA 1. Example 2 – unsuccessful software developed in-house for use in taxpayer’s business 59. Sell To Me Ltd sells household goods online. It stores the goods in five large warehouses around New Zealand. In the 2014 income year Sell To Me Ltd decided to develop some new inventory management software. It employed a computer science student (Stanley) to undertake this work and purchased a computer that was used 50% by Stanley and 50% for other business purposes. 60. Stanley works on the software for three months during a holiday break from university. In total, Sell To Me Ltd incurred expenditure of $50,000 developing the software. This amount includes Stanley’s wages, 50% of the depreciation on the computer for the relevant period, and rent and utilities for the office space leased for Stanley to work in. Stanley was never able to make the software function correctly. After three months, he left Sell To Me Ltd and returned to university. In the 2015 income year, Sell To Me Ltd discovers that it is going to cost a further $50,000 to complete the software. It decides to abandon development of the software and purchase an off the shelf inventory management system instead. Sell To Me Ltd wants to know how the software development costs should be treated for income tax purposes. 61. The expenditure incurred in the 2014 is capital and cannot be deducted in that year. The expenditure is also not depreciable in the 2014 income year as there is no completed asset available to be used in the taxpayer’s business. In the 2015 income year, Sell To Me Ltd decides to abandon the software. It is entitled to a deduction for all of the expenditure incurred in the development of the unsuccessful software. Example 3 – software commissioned for use in taxpayer’s business 62. In the 2013 income year, Bank With Me Ltd contracts with XYZ Software Limited to design and implement a new app to allow its customers to undertake banking transactions from their smart phones. Bank With Me will receive all rights to the app once it is complete. The software is completed in the 2015 income year. After completion, XYZ runs a two day training course for Bank With Me’s staff to teach them how to use the new software. XYZ also provides ongoing maintenance services once the app is running. Bank With Me wants to know how to treat the payments that it makes to XYZ for income tax purposes. 63. The development costs incurred by Bank With Me on the app software must be capitalised until the 2015 income year when the app software is completed. At that time, it will be available for use in the taxpayer’s business and the costs can be depreciated. 64. Once the app software is complete, any payments for maintenance services will be deductible when they are incurred. Unclassified 11 65. The costs of training staff to use the app once it is complete are revenue in nature and are deductible when incurred. Maintenance 66. A short time later, one of the major mobile phone software providers upgrades its operating system. Bank With Me’s app will not run on the upgraded system so Bank With Me hires XYZ Software again to make the relatively minor modifications required so that the software will run on the new operating system. At the same time, XYZ Software also fixes a number of minor bugs. Bank With Me wants to know whether the costs of the changes should be treated as capital or revenue. 67. The changes to Bank With Me’s app are revenue and can be deducted when incurred. As operating system software is upgraded relatively frequently, making modifications to software so that it can run on the upgraded system is more in the nature of maintenance rather than an upgrade. The changes do not add any new functionality as such. Rather they allow the app to continue to run consistently with its original specifications. The fact that a few minor bugs were fixed at the same time does not change this conclusion. Upgrade 68. The following year, Bank With Me decides to make some modifications to the app to allow users to make payments directly to other app users via Bluetooth. Bank With Me again hires XYZ Software to make the changes. 69. The change adds a material new function to the software and, as such, is an upgrade and should be capitalised and depreciated in accordance with s EE 37. Example 4 – allocation of indirect costs for in-house developer 70. XYZ Insurance Ltd has an in-house operation which develops software for use in the insurance company’s business. In the last income year the software development operation worked on one major project and spent the rest of the time on maintenance work for existing software. 71. The in-house operation employs two staff for software development and maintenance work. Each staff member works 1,000 hours a year. Project Development work (hours) Maintenance work (hours) Total Jack 800 200 1,000 Jill 600 400 1,000 Total 1,400 600 2,000 Indirect overhead costs allocated to software development operation for income year: $100,000 Allocation of indirect overhead to project: Total hours worked =2,000 hours Proportion of hours worked for project =1,400 / 2,000 =0.7 Indirect overhead costs of project =$100,000 × 0.7 =$70,000 72. Therefore, besides the direct costs of the project, XYZ Insurance Ltd must capitalise an additional $70,000 of indirect overhead cost for the project. When Unclassified 12 the development is completed capitalised costs will be deductible under the depreciation regime. Example 5 – software still undergoing testing 73. XYZ Accounting Ltd is a large national accounting firm. It commissions Brittany to develop a new document management system. 74. At the end of April, Brittany completes the initial development and the software is operational. During May and June the software undergoes extensive testing by two of XYZ Accounting’s staff members. During this time a number of issues are identified that require further development. In July, Brittany completed the required changes. A final testing phase is carried out in August. On 1 September it is determined that the software is ready to go live. The actual rollout to all staff occurs on 1 October. A number of minor bugs are identified and Brittany fixes these on 1 November. 75. XYZ Accounting wants to know when it can start depreciating the software. The software was available for use in the taxpayer’s business from 1 September and can be depreciated from this date. Prior to this the software was not available for use as it was still being tested and it had not been determined that it could be used as intended. It is not necessary for XYZ Accounting to wait until the software is actually rolled out for use by staff (as long as it is capable of being used). Nor does it matter that the software still contains some minor bugs.

Partial use: formula (9) The deduction the person is allowed for the amount of depreciation loss is calculated using the formula— disposal depreciation loss x qualifying use days ÷ all days Definition of items in formula (10) In the formula in subsection (9),— (a) disposal depreciation loss is the amount resulting from a calculation made for the item under section EE 48(2): Unclassified 25 (b) qualifying use days is the number of days in the income year on which the person owns the item and uses it, or has it available for use, for a use that falls within subsection (8)(c)(i) or (ii): (c) all days is the number of days in the income year on which the person owns the item and uses it or has it available for use for any purpose. Other units of measurement (11) A unit of measurement other than days, whether relating to time, distance, or anything else, is to be used in the formula if it achieves a more appropriate apportionment. EE 51 Amount of depreciation recovery income when lost or stolen items recovered When this section applies (1) This section applies when an item of property to which section EE 47(3) applies— (a) is recovered in a later income year; and (b) is still owned by the person; and (c) is still used or available for use by the person. Person treated as acquiring item (2) The person is treated as having acquired the item, on the date of recovery, for its adjusted tax value at the start of the income year in which it was lost or stolen. Person treated as deriving income: amount (3) The person is treated as deriving an amount of depreciation recovery income equal to the amount of depreciation loss that the person has under section EE 48(2) for which they have been allowed a deduction. Person treated as deriving income: income year (4) The income year in which the person derives the depreciation recovery income is— (a) the income year in which the item is lost or stolen, if the person chooses that year; or (b) the income year in which the item is recovered, in any other case. EE 52 Amount of depreciation recovery income when compensation received When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person receives insurance, indemnity, or compensation for an item of property to which this section applies, as described in section EE 46, other than for an item that is lost, stolen, or irreparably damaged. Compensation subtracted (2) An amount must be subtracted from the item’s adjusted tax value. The amount is the amount by which the insurance, indemnity, or compensation that the person receives is more than the expenditure that the person incurs because of the event for which the person receives the insurance, indemnity, or compensation. Depreciation recovery income (3) If the item’s adjusted tax value becomes negative in an income year through the application of subsection (2), the negative amount is an amount of depreciation recovery income derived by the person in the income year. Compensation derived when item no longer owned (4) If, in the absence of this subsection, the person would derive the amount of insurance, indemnity, or compensation after ceasing to own the item, the person is treated as deriving the amount immediately before the person ceases to own the item. EE 65 Meaning of maximum pooling value Meaning (1) Maximum pooling value, for an item of depreciable property, means the greater of— (a) $5,000; and Unclassified 26 (b) the value set in a determination issued under section 91AAL of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applying to the item. Increase in specified sum (2) The Governor-General may make an Order in Council increasing the sum specified in subsection (1)(a). EE 66 Meaning of poolable property Meaning (1) Poolable property, for an income year, means an item of depreciable property that a person owns to which subsections (2) to (4) apply. Not a building (2) The item is not a building. Maximum pooling value or globo method (3) The item— (a) is acquired in the income year for a cost equal to or less than its maximum pooling value; or (b) was previously accounted for separately but has, as at the start of the income year, an adjusted tax value equal to or less than its maximum pooling value; or (c) was accounted for at the end of the 1992–93 income year using, with the Commissioner’s permission, the globo accounting method. Wholly used or subject to fringe benefit tax (4) The item— (a) is wholly used or available for use by the person in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income; or (b) to the extent to which it is not wholly used or available for use by the person in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, is used in a way that is subject to fringe benefit tax. 6. Section EJ 23 states: EJ 23 Allocation of deductions for research, development, and resulting market development When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person has— (a) a deduction for expenditure incurred on research or development that the person chooses to allocate under section DB 34(7) (Research or development): (b) a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for an item used for research or development, that the person chooses to allocate under section EE 1(5) (What this subpart does): (c) a deduction for expenditure incurred on market development for a product that has resulted from expenditure incurred on research or development that the person chooses to allocate under section EJ 22(2). Timing of deduction (2) The person must allocate the deduction to an income year— (a) in which the person derives an amount of income that is assessable income that the person would not have derived but for— (i) expenditure that gives rise to a deduction that may be allocated under this section: (ii) the use or disposal of an item for which the person has an amount of depreciation loss that may be allocated under this section: (b) to which under Part I (Treatment of tax losses) a loss balance is carried forward for the income year in which the expenditure or depreciation loss was incurred. Minimum amount of deduction allocated to income year Unclassified 27 (3) The person must not allocate to an income year (the current year) an amount of deductions referred to in subsection (1) that is less than the lesser of— (a) the amount of assessable income referred to in subsection (2)(a) that the person derives in the current year: (b) the amount of the deductions that have not been allocated to an income year before the current year. Maximum amount of deduction allocated to income year (4) The person must not allocate to an income year (the current year) an amount of deductions referred to in subsection (1) that is more than the greater of— (a) the amount of assessable income referred to in subsection (2)(a) that the person derives in the current year: (b) the amount of the deductions that— (i) arise in other income years from which a loss balance may be carried forward under Part I to the current year; and (ii) have not been allocated to income years before the current year. 7. The relevant provisions from subpart FA state: FA 6 Recharacterisation of amounts derived under finance leases When a personal property lease asset is leased under a finance lease, the lease is treated as a sale of the lease asset by the lessor to the lessee on the date on which the term of the lease starts, and— (a) the lessor is treated as giving a loan to the lessee for the lease asset; and (b) the lessee is treated as using the loan to buy the lease asset; and (c) subpart EE (Depreciation), the financial arrangements rules, and the other provisions of this Act apply to the arrangement as recharacterised. FA 7 Determining amount of loan Value to lessor (1) For a lessor under a finance lease, the amount of the loan is determined under section EW 32 (Consideration for agreement for sale and purchase of property or services, hire purchase agreement, specified option, or finance lease). Value to lessee (2) For a lessee under a finance lease, the amount of the loan is determined under sections EW 32 and EW 33 (which relate to the value of consideration under the financial arrangements rules). FA 8 Deductibility of expenditure under finance lease Lessee treated as owner (1) The lessee under a finance lease is treated as the owner of the personal property lease asset for the purposes of subpart EE (Depreciation). Lessor not treated as owner (2) The lessor under a finance lease is not treated as the owner of the personal property lease asset for the purposes of subpart EE. FA 9 Treatment when lease ends: lessee acquiring asset Acquisition treated as sale (1) When a lessee under a finance lease acquires the personal property lease asset by the date on which the term of the lease ends, the acquisition is treated as the same sale that is treated as occurring under section FA 6. When lessee or associated person acquires lease asset and later disposes of it Unclassified 28 (2) If a lessee under a finance lease, or a person associated with them, acquires the lease asset and later disposes of it for an amount that is more than the consideration they paid for it, the excess is income of the lessee under section CC 11 (Lessee acquiring lease asset on expiry of term of lease). Allocation and association (3) For the purposes of subsection (2),— (a) the excess is income of the lessee in the income year in which the lessee or associated person disposes of the asset: (b) association is determined at the time of acquisition by the associated person. Exception (4) Subsection (2) does not apply if the consideration derived on the disposal is income of the lessee or an associated person under a provision of this Act other than this section. FA 10 Treatment when lease ends: lessor acquiring asset When this section applies (1) This section applies when a finance lease ends by the date on which its term ends. Acquisition by lessor at end of lease (2) If the lessee does not acquire the personal property lease asset by the date on which the term of the lease ends, the lessor is treated as having acquired it on that date at its guaranteed residual value. If there is no guaranteed residual value, the consideration is treated as zero. In this section, the consideration is called the notional sale price. Further sale, assignment, or lease (3) Subsections (4) and (5) apply when the lessor sells, assigns, or leases the lease asset to another person under another finance lease on or after the date on which the term of the original lease ends. When consideration more than notional sale price (4) If the consideration is more than the notional sale price,— (a) to the extent to which it is paid by the lessor to the lessee under the original finance lease, the notional sale price is increased by the amount of the difference; and (b) to the extent to which it is not paid by the lessor to the lessee under the original finance lease, the amount of the difference is income of the lessor under section CC 12 (Lessor acquiring lease asset on expiry of term of lease) in the income year in which the original lease term ends. When consideration less than notional sale price (5) If the consideration is less than the notional sale price, and the lessee is required to pay the amount of the deficit to the lessor, the notional sale price is reduced by that amount. Acquisition by lessor when lease ends early (6) If the lease is terminated before the end of its term and the lessee does not acquire the lease asset, the lessor is treated as acquiring it for an amount calculated using the formula— outstanding balance − release payment. Definition of items in formula (7) In the formula,— (a) outstanding balance is the amount of the outstanding balance of the loan on the date on which the lease is terminated: (b) release payment is the amount the lessee paid to be released from their obligations under the lease. Relationship with section EE 45 (8) Subsections (2) to (6) override section EE 45 (Consideration for purposes of section EE 44). Unclassified 29 FA 11 Adjustments for leases that become finance leases When this section applies (1) This section applies when a lease is entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and— (a) the lease is a consecutive or a successive lease— (i) that is treated as 1 lease under the definition of lease; and (ii) with a term of the lease that the lessor and lessee do not contemplate, at the start of the term, will be more than 75% of the personal property lease asset's estimated useful life; and (iii) with a term of the lease that is more than 75% of the asset's estimated useful life: (b) the lease is an operating lease that becomes a finance lease under paragraph (c) of the definition of finance lease. Adjustment required (2) The lessor and lessee must each adjust their income and expenditure calculated for the lease by including an adjustment in a return of income for the tax year corresponding to the income year in which the lease becomes a finance lease. Amount of adjustment (3) The amount of the adjustment is calculated for the relevant person in relation to the period described in subsection (5) using the formula— finance income − finance expenditure − unadjusted income + unadjusted expenditure. Definition of items in formula (4) In the formula,— (a) finance income is the income that would have been derived by the person under the lease if the lease were a finance lease for the period: (b) finance expenditure is the expenditure that would have been incurred by the person under the lease if the lease were a finance lease for the period: (c) unadjusted income is the income derived by the person under the lease: (d) unadjusted expenditure is the expenditure incurred by the person under the lease. Adjustment period (5) The period starts on the date on which the lease starts and ends on the last day of the income year in which the lease becomes a finance lease. Adjustment positive (6) If the adjustment is positive, the amount is income of the relevant person under section CH 6 (Adjustments for certain finance and operating leases). Adjustment negative (7) If the adjustment is negative, the amount is a deduction of the relevant person under section DB 51B (Adjustments for leases that become finance leases). FA 11B Adjustments for certain operating leases When this section applies (1) This section applies when a lease is an operating lease that— (a) is entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and before 20 June 2007; and (b) is an arrangement, or part of an arrangement that, on 20 June 2007, meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(i) to (iii) of the definition of finance lease; and (c) has a term of the lease ending after the end of the income year in which 20 June 2007 falls (the adjustment year); and (d) does not meet the requirements of section FA 11(1) before the end of the income year after the adjustment year. Adjustment required Unclassified 30 (2) The lessor must adjust their income and expenditure calculated for the lease asset by including an adjustment in a return of income for the tax year corresponding to the income year after the adjustment year. Amount of adjustment (3) The amount of the adjustment is calculated using the formula— total depreciation losses ÷ 6 Definition of item in formula (4) In the formula, total depreciation losses is the total amount of depreciation loss for the lease asset for which the lessor is allowed a deduction in the period that begins with the start of the term of the lease and ends with the end of the adjustment year. Income (5) The amount of the adjustment is income of the lessor under the lease under section CH 6 (Adjustments for certain finance and operating leases) in the income year after the adjustment year. Adjusted tax value (6) The adjusted tax value of the lease asset at the beginning of the income year after the adjustment year is the total of the amount of the adjustment and the adjusted tax value that the lease asset would have in the absence of this section. Depreciation loss (7) For an income year beginning after 20 June 2007 in which the lease is an operating lease, the amount of depreciation loss allowed for the lease asset other than under section EE 48 (Effect of disposal or event) is five-sixths of the amount of depreciation loss that would be allowed for the lease asset in the absence of this subsection. 8.

This statement updates legislative references to reflect changes to income tax and patents legislation since 2006, in particular, the:  Income Tax Act 2007 replacing the Income Tax Act 2004; and  Patents Act 2013 replacing the Patents Act 1953. This statement also discusses legislative changes addressing “black hole” expenditure in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016. Some of the Commissioner’s views have changed because of the above legislative changes, including views on the treatment of:  renewal fees, which are now considered to be revenue expenditure and deductible in the year incurred (the previous statement treated renewal fees as part of the depreciable cost of the patent); and  expenditure for underlying intangible items after asset recognition, which are now considered to be depreciable. These changes are discussed in the statement.

This statement covers the income tax treatment of New Zealand patent applications, patents and patent rights, particularly:  their costs and depreciation (see \[36\]–\[72\]);  research and development (R&D) expenditure (see \[73\]–\[97\]);  patent maintenance and renewal fees (see \[98\]–\[107\]);  legal fees incurred in defending or attacking a patent (see \[108\]–\[129\]); UNCLASSIFIED 3  proceeds and allowable deductions on the sale of patent rights or a patent application (see \[130\]–\[139\]); and  patent-related expenses and proceeds under the old legislative rules, which still apply in some circumstances (see \[140\] and \[141\]). 2. This statement does not cover the income tax treatment of patents filed outside of New Zealand. Summary 3. This statement makes a number of conclusions relating to the income tax treatment of New Zealand patents. The major conclusions are summarised below. “Patent” means the legal rights obtained from the grant of that patent 4. References in the legislation to a “patent” refer to the legal rights that the owner of the patent obtains from the grant of that patent. In the case of New Zealand patents, these are the legal rights obtained as the result of a patent granted under the Patents Act 2013 (Patents Act) (or its predecessor, the Patents Act 1953). Other intellectual property rights are not patent rights 5. Other intellectual property rights are not patent rights. Legal, administrative and some other costs incurred in applying for a patent are depreciable 6. Depreciable patent costs include:  the legal and administrative costs incurred in applying for the patent;  additional costs incurred for a patent (s EE 19); and  expenditure incurred for underlying intangible items (s EE 18B). Tax treatment of research and development expenditure varies 7. The treatment of expenditure on R&D for tax purposes will be in accordance with:  ss BD 2 and DA 1 to DA 4;  s DB 33 for scientific research; and  ss DB 34 and DB 35 for other R&D, if the taxpayer complies with the requirements of the relevant reporting standard and chooses to apply these sections. Patent renewal and maintenance fees are revenue in nature and deductible 8. Patent renewal and maintenance fees are revenue in nature and deductible for income tax purposes in the year they are incurred. Legal expenses incurred in defending or attacking a patent are generally revenue in nature, so are deductible 9. Legal expenses incurred in defending or attacking a patent are generally revenue in nature, so are deductible. However, some legal expenses may be capital in nature (as discussed at \[124\] and \[125\]) and non-deductible. UNCLASSIFIED 4 Deduction may be allowed where a patent application is refused or withdrawn or not lodged 10. Where a patent application is refused or withdrawn or not lodged, the taxpayer may be allowed a deduction for expenditure they have incurred in relation to the application or intended application. This is in terms of s DB 37, which applies only if the taxpayer is not allowed a deduction for the expenditure under another provision. If a person devises an invention, then disposes of the patent rights, a deduction may be allowed for the expenditure incurred 11. If a person devises an invention and subsequently disposes of the patent rights relating to that invention, a deduction is allowed for the expenditure incurred in devising the invention. This is, in terms of s DB 38(3), to the extent that a deduction has not already been allowed under s DB 38(2) (expenditure before 1 April 1993). When patent applications or rights are sold, a deduction is allowed of the total cost less total amounts of depreciation loss 12. When patent applications or patent rights acquired on or after 1 April 1993 are sold, a deduction is allowed of the total cost to the person of those patent rights less total amounts of depreciation loss (s DB 40). Amount derived from the sale of patent applications or rights is income 13. An amount a person derives from the sale of patent applications (with a complete specification) or the sale of patent rights is income of the person (s CB 30). 14. This is despite the disposal of patent rights being the disposal of a capital item, unless it is the rare situation where the taxpayer is in the business of buying and selling patent rights. In that case, patent rights are trading stock, and their disposal is of a revenue item (amounts derived on their sale is still income). Patent rights that are trading stock are not depreciable. Introduction Meaning of “patent” 15. The Commissioner’s view is that the word “patent” in the Income Tax Act refers to the rights registered, granted and protected as a patent. For New Zealand patents, these are the rights registered, granted and protected under the Patents Act. This view accords with the:  ordinary meaning of “patent”; and  text of the legislation. 16. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (12th ed, 2011) defines “patent” as particular legal rights: Patent n. a government licence to an individual or body conferring a right or title for a set period, especially the sole right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention 17. The ordinary meaning of “patent” is the legal rights, granted to an applicant, to exclude others from using a particular mode of manufacture. 18. Although the Income Tax Act does not define “patent”, the term “patent right” is defined in s YA 1: UNCLASSIFIED 5 patent right means the right to do or authorise anything that would, but for the right, be an infringement of a patent 19. The Patents Act (s 5) distinguishes between a “patent” and a “patentable invention”: patent means letters patent for an invention patentable invention has the meaning set out in section 14: 20. In terms of s 14 of the Patents Act, an invention is a patentable invention if it: (a) is a manner of manufacture within the meaning of section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies; and (b) when compared with the prior art base— (i) is novel; and (ii) involves an inventive step; and (c) is useful; and (d) is not excluded from being a patentable invention under section 15 or 16. 21. In the context of patents, and this statement, an invention is a manner of manufacture (an intangible asset) and not the physical manifestation of that invention (for example, a prototype or saleable article). 22. The Income Tax Act refers to different types of intellectual property in specific terms. For example, sch 14 distinguishes, in some detail, between types of depreciable intangible property and lists separately from other depreciable intangible property (for example, a design registration) both:  “a patent or the right to use a patent” (item 3); and  “a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005” (item 4). 23. A reference to a patent application in this statement is (unless otherwise indicated) to “a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005”. Patents Act 2013 24. In New Zealand, the Patents Act governs the granting of patents. The Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand administers the Patents Act. Under s 13 of the Patents Act, a patent may be granted for only “patentable inventions” (defined as having the meaning set out in s 14 of the Patents Act). 25. By preventing others from using that patented specification for a term of 20 years, the grant of a patent provides the applicant, now the “patentee”, with the exclusive rights to exploit the invention (and to authorise another person to exploit the invention – see s 18 of the Patents Act) for the term of the patent. Patent application 26. A patent applicant usually engages a patent attorney to file the patent application. Amongst other things, the patent attorney will search published patent specifications in the database of the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand before the application is filed. 27. There are a number of ways to apply for a patent. These are:  An application with a provisional specification. UNCLASSIFIED 6  An application with a complete specification.  A Convention application.  A Treaty application.  A Divisional application. 28. In terms of s 36(1) of the Patents Act, every patent application must be accompanied by a complete specification or a provisional specification unless the application is a Convention application. A Convention application must be accompanied by a complete specification. 29. A provisional specification is a general description of the invention. A complete specification is a detailed description of the invention. If a patent application is accompanied by a provisional specification, then a complete specification must be filed within 12 months (extendable to 15 months, at the applicant’s request) of the filing date of the application. 30. After examining the application, the Commissioner of Patents must, if satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the requirements in the Patents Act and regulations have been met, accept and publish the complete specification. If no one opposes the application, the Commissioner of Patents must grant a patent. Patent date and term 31. In terms of s 103 of the Patents Act, the patent date is the:  filing date of the relevant complete specification; or  date determined under the regulations, if the regulations provide for the determination of a different date as the patent date. 32. Although the patent is not necessarily granted on this date, the 20-year term of the patent runs from this date. A patent is not in force until it is granted, although certain pre-grant rights are conferred under the Patents Act (see s 81 of the Patents Act) after the relevant complete specification becomes open to public inspection. As a result, the patent expires at some time less than 20 years after the patent is granted. This is in accordance with s 20 of the Patents Act, which states that the term of every patent is 20 years from the patent date. Effect of a patent 33. Following the grant of a patent, a patentee, as the patent holder, may commercially exploit the invention (or authorise another person to exploit the invention) for the term of the patent (up to 20 years). The term “exploit” is defined in s 18(2) of the Patents Act. The patentee has a number of options to exploit the invention, including:  licensing the patent rights to a third person (permitting that person to manufacture the patented article or use the patented process in return for a royalty);  using the patented process themselves or by merely retaining the patent rights; or  selling or assigning the patent rights to a third person to exploit similarly. In each case, the holder of the patent rights can exclude others from exploiting the particular patented invention. UNCLASSIFIED 7 Patents outside New Zealand 34. The Patents Act governs patents registered and applicable for use in New Zealand. Patents can also be registered in other countries, and the legislation in any particular country may give the patentee rights to exploit the invention in that country. 35. This statement applies only to the income tax treatment of patents and patent applications applied for or granted under the Patents Act. Patent applications, patents and patent rights – their costs and depreciation Summary – patents, the right to use a patent, and a patent application are all depreciable for income tax purposes 36. Patents, the right to use a patent and a patent application are all depreciable for income tax purposes. As mentioned in \[22\], they are all listed in sch 14 as items of depreciable intangible property. 37. The depreciable cost typically includes the legal and administrative costs. However, the depreciable cost can also include expenditure incurred for an underlying intangible item (for example, a method or formula giving rise to a patent), if s EE 18B is satisfied. Section EE 18B is discussed at \[65\]–\[67\]. 38. The original patentee or the purchaser of the patent application, patent or patent rights may depreciate the item using the straight-line method of depreciation. Under this method, the cost of the item is spread over its legal life. 39. Sections EE 33 and EE 34 provide the formulas for determining the annual depreciation rate for patent applications (and patents granted before the 2005/06 income year) and patents (granted in the 2005/06 or later income years) respectively. Depreciating a patent application, a patent or the right to use a patent What is depreciable 40. Under the Income Tax Act, “a patent or the right to use a patent” and “a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005” are “depreciable intangible property” (s YA 1 and sch 14). Section YA 1 states: depreciable intangible property is defined in s EE 62 (Meaning of depreciable intangible property) 41. Section EE 62 states: EE62 Meaning of depreciable intangible property Meaning (1) Depreciable intangible property means the property listed in schedule 14 (Depreciable intangible property). Criteria for listing in schedule 14 (2) For property to be listed in schedule 14, the criteria are as follows: (a) it must be intangible; and (b) it must have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its acquisition. UNCLASSIFIED 8 Schedule 14 prevails (3) Property that is listed in schedule 14 is depreciable intangible property even if the criteria are not met. 42. Schedule 14 lists intangible property that is depreciable. Items 3 and 4 on the list are: 3 a patent or the right to use a patent 4 a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005 43. Therefore, on the lodgement of a patent application with a complete specification (lodged on or after 1 April 2005), the taxpayer will have a depreciable intangible asset. If the patent application is refused or withdrawn or not lodged, the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for expenditure they have incurred in relation to the application or intended application (s DB 37 – see \[47\]–\[49\]). 44. Once the patent application is granted, the taxpayer will depreciate the patent itself. Alternatively, if the taxpayer purchases the right to use a patent, that right is depreciable provided the other requirements for depreciation are met. Depreciation of a patent or patent right can be claimed only when the patent or patent rights are used or available for use in deriving income. If an asset has not been used or is not available for use in deriving income or in a business, s EE 50 provides for an adjustment in the depreciation calculation to reflect this. 45. Section EE 50 contains the formula to reduce the depreciation deduction to reflect the period during which the patent or patent rights were used or available to derive income. This partial use formula is: depreciation loss × qualifying use days ÷ all days 46. The formula items are defined in s EE 50(3). A patent application is made but a patent is not granted 47. Section DB 37 provides that, in some situations, where the application for the grant of a patent made by a taxpayer is refused or withdrawn or not lodged, the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for expenditure they have incurred in relation to the application or intended application. The deduction is allowed:  for expenditure incurred that would have been part of the cost of the patent (or patent application) if the application or intended application had been granted; and  provided the taxpayer is not allowed a deduction for the expenditure under another provision. 48. The expenditure includes patent application fees, legal fees and expenditure for underlying intangible items (in terms of s EE 18B) incurred in relation to the application or intended application. 49. Section DB 37 applies only if the person is not allowed a deduction under another provision. For example, s EE 48 allows an amount of depreciation loss on the cessation of the rights in the intangible property where the patent is refused or the patent application is withdrawn (but not where a patent application is never lodged). Section DB 37 does not apply in this situation. UNCLASSIFIED 9 Depreciation method for patents generally 50. The following discussion relates to the depreciation method for patents generally. Sections EE 33 and EE 34 provide the formulas for determining the annual depreciation rate for patent applications (and patents granted before the 2005/06 income year) and patents (granted in the 2005/06 or later income years) respectively. 51. Section EE 12(2)(b)(ii) provides that the straight-line method of depreciation must be used to calculate depreciation for “fixed life intangible property”. The straight- line method is defined in s YA 1: straight-line method, for depreciation, is defined in section EE 67 (other definitions) Section EE 67 requires that each year, a constant percentage of the cost of the property to the taxpayer is deducted from the property’s adjusted tax value: straight-line method means the method of calculating an amount of depreciation loss for an item of depreciable property by subtracting, in each income year, a constant percentage of the item’s cost, to its owner, from the item’s adjusted tax value 52. Because a patent or the right to use a patent is depreciable property with a legal life that, on acquisition, can reasonably be expected to be the same as the property’s remaining useful life, a patent or the right to use a patent is also “fixed life intangible property” as defined in s YA 1: fixed life intangible property is defined in section EE 67 (Other definitions) Section EE 67 states that in the Act: fixed life intangible property means property that— (a) is depreciable intangible property; and (b) has a legal life that could reasonably be expected, on the date of the property’s acquisition, to be the same length as the property’s remaining estimated useful life 53. “Legal life” is defined in s YA 1: legal life is defined in section EE 67 (Other definitions) Section EE 67 states in paras (a) and (b) of the definition of legal life that in the Act: legal life,— (a) for an item to which paragraphs (b) to (d) do not apply, means the number of years, months, and days for which an owner’s interest in an item of intangible property exists under the contract or statute that creates the owner’s interest, assuming that the owner exercises any rights of renewal or extension that are either essentially unconditional or conditional on the payment of predetermined fees: (b) for an item that is a patent application, a design registration application, a patent, or a design registration, means the legal life under paragraph (a) that a patent or design registration would have if granted when the relevant application is first lodged: 54. Accordingly, the legal life of the patent or the right to use a patent is required to be calculated assuming rights of maintenance and renewal are exercised (see the discussion at \[98\]–\[107\]). The legal life of a patent is 20 years. Depreciation rates for patents and patent rights acquired before 2005/06 and patent applications 55. For patents or patent rights acquired before the 2005/06 income year and patent applications (lodged with complete specification on or after 1 April 2005), the annual depreciation rate is set out in s EE 33. UNCLASSIFIED 10 56. In terms of s EE 33(2), the annual depreciation rate is calculated using the formula: 1 ÷ legal life 57. For purposes of s EE 33, the definition of “legal life” differs according to whether s EE 18B (expenditure for an underlying intangible item) or s EE 19 (additional costs) applies . If s EE 18B or s EE 19 applies , then “legal life” is defined as the item’s remaining legal life from the start of the income year in which the relevant costs are recognised. If neither of the relevant sections applies, then “legal life” is defined as the item’s remaining legal life from the time it is acquired. 58. The depreciation loss is calculated, in terms of the standard calculation in s EE 16, by multiplying the depreciation rate by the value or cost of the property and the fraction of the year that the property is owned by the taxpayer. This formula is set out in s EE 16(1) annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 59. In summary, the depreciation of patents and patent rights (acquired before the 2005/06 income year) and patent applications:  is by the straight-line method (s EE 12);  with the annual rate calculated in accordance with s EE 33; and  the amount of depreciation loss calculated in terms of s EE 16. Depreciation rates for patents and patent rights acquired in the 2005/06 or later income years 60. For patents acquired in the 2005/06 or later income years, the annual depreciation rate is set out in s EE 34. Section EE 33, discussed above, specifically provides at s EE 33(1)(b) that fixed life intangible property to which that section applies does not include “a patent for which a rate is set out in section EE 34”. 61. The formula for calculating the annual depreciation rate is the same as that in s EE 33: 1 ÷ legal life 62. For purposes of s EE 34, the definition of “legal life” also differs according to whether s EE 18B (expenditure for an underlying intangible item) or s EE 19 (additional costs) applies, and whether a depreciation loss has been allowed for the patent application (the patent application depreciation loss is not a criterion for the formula in s EE 33). The different circumstances and resulting definition of “legal life” are set out in ss EE 34(4)–(7). 63. The depreciation loss is calculated similarly to patents acquired before the 2005/06 income year, in terms of s EE 16 (see at \[58\]): annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 64. In summary, the depreciation of patents or patent rights acquired in the 2005/06 or later income years:  is by the straight-line method (s EE 12);  with the annual rate calculated in accordance with s EE 34; and  the amount of depreciation loss calculated in terms of s EE 16. UNCLASSIFIED 11 Inclusions in the cost of a patent application, patent or patent rights 65. Included in the cost of a patent are:  the legal and administrative costs incurred in applying for the patent;  additional costs incurred for a patent (s EE 19); and  for the 2015/16 and later income years, expenditure for underlying intangible items (s EE 18B). Depreciation is calculated on these three costs. 66. Section EE 18B provides that the cost of the patent also includes expenditure by the taxpayer for underlying items of intangible property. To meet the requirements of s EE 18B, the underlying item must give rise to, support or be an item in which the person incurring the expenditure holds the patent. 67. An example of expenditure on an underlying item would be an invention supporting or giving rise to the patent. R&D costs incurred in devising an intangible invention, in respect of which a patent is sought, are included in the depreciable value of that patent or the right to use that patent. This is provided no other deduction has been allowed for the research and development expenditure. See Example 1, illustrating the operation of s EE 18B. Additional costs that are depreciable 68. Although s EE 19 provides for “additional costs” to be added to the depreciation cost base of an intangible asset, “additional costs” are not defined. 69. In terms of s EE 19, additional costs are costs that the taxpayer incurs in relation to fixed life intangible property that the taxpayer owns. The taxpayer must also have been denied a deduction for those additional costs, other than a deduction for depreciation loss. Additional costs are added to the relevant item’s adjusted tax value and depreciated over the remaining legal life of the item. Whether speculative patent applications, patents or the rights to use a patent are recognised as assets and depreciated 70. Sometimes a patent might be applied for or registered “just in case” the protection that a patent offers, for a particular invention, may one day prove to be valuable. The same situation could also occur with the acquisition of patent rights. 71. It can be argued that these patents or patent rights should not be treated as assets, until the feasibility of the invention is known. The Act, however, does not make this distinction. Sections EE 14, EE 16, EE 19, EE 33 and EE 34 provide rules for the depreciation of the cost of patents and patent rights, if these were used or available for use in deriving assessable income or in a business carried on for the purpose of deriving assessable income. The depreciable cost includes all of the costs incurred in acquiring the patent or the right to use a patent. 72. It has been held that the test of whether something is used in deriving income or in a business is satisfied not only if the asset directly produces income, but also if the asset is used in the course of deriving income or in a business (CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236). UNCLASSIFIED 12 Treatment of research and development expenditure 73. R&D costs incurred on an invention, before recognition of an intangible asset for accounting purposes, may be deductible under s DB 33 or s DB 34. 74. Once an intangible asset is recognised for accounting purposes, further development costs relating to the invention must be capitalised and may not be deductible under s DB 34. One exception is where the taxpayer’s development expenditure is less than $10,000 in the relevant income year. The further development costs, after recognition of the intangible asset, may form part of the cost of a patent (in terms of s EE 18B) and be depreciable (see \[65\]–\[67\]). 75. The following discussion considers the tax treatment of various types of invention expenditure. This treatment does not apply to a person who simply purchases a patent application, patent or right to use a patent from someone else. Research and development expenditure General principles 76. Section DB 33 allows a deduction for expenditure on scientific research. 77. Section DB 34 allows a deduction for expenditure on R&D. This deduction could apply to expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on R&D that leads to an invention (and potentially a patent application). Section DB 35(1) contains definitions applicable to s DB 34. Section DB 34 is not mandatory, so a taxpayer may choose not to apply it to their R&D expenditure in an income year. 78. If the relevant R&D expenditure is revenue in nature, that is, if the expenditure is incurred in deriving assessable income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income and it is not capital in nature (for example, expenditure on materials consumed in research related to a taxpayer’s business), the expenditure would be deductible without the benefit of s DB 34. In contrast, R&D expenditure contributing to the cost of an asset or related to establishing a new line of business is likely to be capital in nature and non-deductible (unless s DB 34 applies). 79. If a person who devised and patented an invention:  sells all of the patent rights relating to the invention, then s DB 38(3) allows a deduction for expenditure incurred in connection with devising the invention, whenever it is incurred, to the extent that it not already allowed under s DB 38(2) or some other provision (such as s DB 34); or  sells only some of the patent rights, then s DB 38(4) allows a proportional deduction of the expenditure incurred. Section DB 34 80. In terms of s DB 34, a taxpayer is allowed a deduction for R&D expenditure incurred, in the income year it is incurred, provided the taxpayer:  recognises the expenditure as an expense;  has derecognised expenditure on the non-depreciable asset;  recognises the expenditure otherwise; or  has minor R&D expenditure. UNCLASSIFIED 13 Taxpayer recognises the expenditure as an expense 81. The taxpayer must recognise the expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes under one of the relevant accounting standards (either the old or new standards), because the criteria for asset recognition in the standard have not been met (s DB 34(2)). 82. The accounting standard criteria for asset recognition, which includes demonstrating the technical feasibility of a product and the existence of a market for the product, are set out in:  the old reporting standard, Financial Reporting Standard No 13 1995 (FRS- 13), at \[5.3\]; and  the new reporting standard, New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38, at \[57\]. Taxpayer has derecognised expenditure on the non-depreciable asset 83. The taxpayer has incurred expenditure developing an intangible asset that is not depreciable intangible property, and that intangible asset is derecognised for accounting purposes (ss DB 34(3) and CG 7C). (See also discussion on s DB 34(3) and CG 7C at \[87\]–\[93\].) Taxpayer recognises the expenditure otherwise 84. The taxpayer recognises the expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes because it is an immaterial amount, and, if the amount were material, the taxpayer would be required to have recognised an asset under the old or new reporting standard (s DB 34(4)). Taxpayer has minor research and development expenditure 85. If the taxpayer’s annual R&D expenditure does not exceed $10,000, then the entire amount may be expensed in the year in which it is incurred (s DB 34(5)). 86. The expenditure must have been written off as immaterial and expensed for financial reporting purposes. Derecognition and the subsequent disposal or re-recognition of non-depreciable intangible assets Derecognition 87. Section DB 34(3) applies if a taxpayer has developed an intangible asset (recognised for accounting purposes) that is not depreciable for income tax purposes and the intangible asset is derecognised for accounting purposes. The taxpayer may obtain a one-off income tax deduction for capitalised development expenditure (incurred on or after 7 November 2013) that they have incurred on the asset on derecognition. 88. The taxpayer can deduct expenditure they incur in carrying out only development of an intangible asset (s DB 34(3)). Expenditure incurred on purchasing a non-depreciable intangible asset is not deductible to the purchasing taxpayer on derecognition of the asset for financial reporting purposes. A taxpayer who purchases a non-depreciable intangible asset can, however, claim a deduction, on derecognition of the asset, for any development expenditure they incurred on further developing the asset after purchasing it. See Example 2, illustrating the operation of s DB 34(3). UNCLASSIFIED 14 Disposal or re-recognition 89. Section CG 7C applies, if:  a taxpayer has been allowed a deduction under s DB 34 because s DB 34(3) applies; and  the previously derecognised non-depreciable intangible asset is subsequently:  disposed of for consideration that is not income under another provision of the Act; or  re-recognised for financial reporting purposes. 90. Under \[118\] of the new reporting standard, an entity is required to disclose information related to each class of its intangible assets. The entity is also required to distinguish between internally generated intangible assets and other intangible assets. In terms of \[118(e)(viii)\], the entity must disclose a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of a period showing other changes in the carrying amount during the period. Although this information is for a group of assets, to calculate the change in the carrying amount for the group of assets during a period, the entity would have to sum the changes in the carrying amounts of each individual asset in the group during the period. If a previously derecognised intangible asset has a positive carrying amount at the end of a period in which it had a carrying amount of zero at the beginning, this implies it must have been rerecognised for financial reporting purposes during the period. This amounts to a rerecognition for the purposes of s CG 7C. 91. When a taxpayer derives consideration from a disposal, the amount that will be treated as income is the lesser of the consideration derived from the disposal and the amount of the deduction previously taken. 92. When a taxpayer rerecognises an intangible asset, the entire amount of the deduction previously taken will be treated as income. For the purposes of the depreciation rules, the taxpayer is treated as never having had the deduction. Therefore, if the taxpayer eventually acquires an item of depreciable intangible property to which the expenditure relates (for example, if the intangible asset rerecognised by a taxpayer is an invention that they subsequently patent), they will be able to deduct the expenditure over time as depreciation. 93. An amount treated as income under s CG 7C is treated as income of the taxpayer in the income year of the disposal or rerecognition, as the case may be. Deductions allowable for expenditure incurred in devising an invention only to extent of total expenditure 94. Under s DB 38, a taxpayer who devises an invention to which the patent relates and then disposes of all or some of the patent rights is allowed a deduction of the amount of the expenditure (or part of the expenditure) incurred in connection with devising the invention that has not already been allowed under s DB 38(2). To the extent that the taxpayer who devised the invention has already claimed the invention costs in full (under s DB 33 or s DB 34), those costs would not be deductible again (s BD 4(5)). UNCLASSIFIED 15 Depreciation of assets used for or developed in the inventing process 95. Invention expenditure that forms part of the cost of an asset may be deducted by way of depreciation, if the asset is depreciable property that is used or available for use in deriving assessable income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. Intangible assets are depreciable only if they are listed in sch 14 as an item of “depreciable intangible property”. 96. However, s DB 34, by the application of the criteria in FRS-13 or the new reporting standard, provides for the cost of assets used on a project, in the inventing process up to the point of “asset recognition”, to be treated as revenue expenditure in the year in which the cost is incurred. Before the enactment of s EE 18B (see discussion below), after the point of asset recognition, such costs were required to be capitalised and, unless those costs were for an asset that was otherwise depreciable property, no depreciation allowance was available. (Where s DB 34(5) applies (that is, where the person incurs expenditure of $10,000 or less, in total, on R&D for an income year and the expenditure is not treated as material and is recognised as an expense for financial reporting purposes), the person is allowed a deduction for that expenditure.) 97. Section EE 18B, applying for the 2015/16 and later income years, specifies that the “cost” to a taxpayer of an item of depreciable intangible property for depreciation purposes includes expenditure they have incurred for an underlying item of intangible property. The underlying item must give rise to, support or be an item in which the person holds the item of depreciable intangible property. An amount of expenditure cannot be included in the depreciable cost of the item of depreciable intangible property, if a deduction for the expenditure has already been allowed. In the case of patents and patent applications, the person must have incurred the expenditure on or after 7 November 2013, for the expenditure to be included in the depreciable cost of the item of depreciable intangible property. Patent maintenance and renewal fees General principles 98. Patent maintenance fees and renewal fees are payable to the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand at intervals to keep patent rights in existence. Maintenance fees are due on the fourth and each succeeding anniversary date of the filing of a patent application with complete specification, before a patent is granted. Once a patent is granted, renewal fees become due on each anniversary date, until the 19th anniversary date. 99. Under transitional arrangements, for patents granted under the Patents Act 1953, the next renewal fee must be paid in accordance with the Patents Act 1953, but subsequent fees must be paid annually in accordance with the Patents Act 2013. 100. In the Commissioner’s opinion, patent renewal fees and patent maintenance fees (and service provider fees directly related to the renewal and maintenance fees) are revenue in nature and are deductible for income tax purposes in the year they are incurred. This is mainly because of the recurrent nature of the fees, being payable on an annual basis in terms of the Patents Act 2013. (This differs from the less frequent payment structure under the Patents Act 1953.) UNCLASSIFIED 16 What happens if patent maintenance fees or renewal fees are not paid? 101. A patent application is treated as having been abandoned if the applicant does not pay the maintenance fee within the prescribed period. If the patent renewal fees are not paid, the patent rights end (the patent is described as lapsing). 102. Abandoned patent applications and lapsed patents, where the right to request restoration has expired, are treated as having been disposed under the Income Tax Act. Therefore, the cost of the patent application, not already depreciated, is deductible. 103. The owner of an abandoned patent application or lapsed patent can no longer exercise the associated rights of the relevant asset. Section EE 47(9) provides that in that situation, ss EE 48 to EE 52 apply. Section EE 48(2) provides for an amount of depreciation loss. This is the amount “by which the consideration is less than the item’s adjusted tax value”. 104. Therefore, when patent rights are voided or disposed of, being the eighth event as described in s EE 47(9), any cost of the patent or patent rights that has not already been depreciated can be deducted under s EE 48. 105. Section EE 44 refers to consideration derived from the disposal of an item. In the case of a patent that is allowed to lapse (or patent application that is abandoned), s EE 45(2) provides that, for the purposes of s EE 44, the consideration may be zero or a negative amount. 106. However, s EE 44(2)(a) provides that ss EE 48 to EE 52 do not apply when a person disposes of an item of intangible property, if the disposal of that property is part of an arrangement to replace it with property of the same type. 107. In summary, subject to the exceptions above, the non-renewal of a patent and the abandoning of a patent application are events, for the purposes of s EE 48 to EE 52, and any costs, not already depreciated, can be deducted. Legal fees incurred in defending or attacking a patent 108. The Patents Act details how the validity of a patent can be challenged. Such a challenge is likely to involve legal fees, which may relate to:  an assertion (before acceptance); or  ex parte re-examination (before and after grant); or  pre-grant opposition action; or  post-grant revocation proceedings (before the Commissioner of Patents or High Court). 109. Assertions by third parties (which relate to the requirements for the invention to be a novelty and involve an inventive step) may be made in the prescribed period after a complete specification becomes open to public inspection. The prescribed period for assertions ends on the date that the notice of acceptance is issued. 110. An opposition action is taken when a patent has not yet been granted and the action is taken against another person’s application for a patent to prevent that patent being granted. UNCLASSIFIED 17 111. Re-examinations of a patent application (and the complete specification relating to the application) can be conducted before and after a patent is granted. Re-examination of an accepted (but not granted) patent application is an alternative to opposing an accepted application. A re-examination requestor takes no further part in the re-examination once the request has been filed (this is in contrast to opposition proceedings). The Commissioner of Patents may also institute re-examination without being requested to do so. 112. A revocation action is taken against someone who has had a patent granted to revoke that patent. 113. The Commissioner’s opinion is that the same principles apply to the above proceedings. In all cases, the relevant proceeding relates to an asset of the person, whether it is a patent or a patent application. The terms “defending” and “attacking” are used to mean, respectively, defending and taking a revocation action (including an opposition action, a re-examination or an assertion). General principles 114. Legal expenses incurred in attacking or defending a patent are generally incurred in the maintenance or preservation of a capital asset that, in the case of a patent, is a right. 115. The Privy Council in BP Australia v FC of T \[1965\] 3 All ER 209 has provided several factors to consider in the determination of whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. The Court of Appeal has since summarised the factors for consideration in CIR v McKenzies NZ Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233. In the judgment of the court, Richardson J said (at 5,235 and 5,236): Amongst the factors weighed by the Judicial Committee in BP Australia were: (a) the need or occasion which called for the expenditure; (b) whether the payments were made from fixed or circulating capital; (c) whether the payments were of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which were an enduring benefit; (d) how the payment would be treated on ordinary principles of commercial accounting; and (e) whether the payments were expended on the business structure of the taxpayer or whether they were part of the process by which income was earned. 116. The approach of the Privy Council in BP Australia has been adopted in other New Zealand cases: CIR v LD Nathan & Co Ltd \[1972\] NZLR 209, Buckley & Young v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA), Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206, Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001 and Birkdale Service Station v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. The most recent New Zealand Privy Council case in this area, CIR v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, also adopted the BP Australia approach. 117. Fundamental to the capital/revenue determination is the “enduring benefit” test of the House of Lords in British Insulated and Helsby Cables v Atherton \[1928\] AC 205, which has become the commonly accepted test in the English Courts (at 629): when an expenditure is made, not only once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade, I think that there is very good reason (in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital 118. The “enduring benefit” test that has been approved and affirmed by both the House of Lords (Lawson (Inspector of Taxes) v Johnson Matthey plc \[1992\] 2 All ER 647) and the Privy Council (in BP Australia) since the Atherton test was interpreted and applied in Southern v Borax Consolidated Ltd \[1940\] 4 All ER 412. UNCLASSIFIED 18 119. Moller J applied the BP Australia approach to the determination of expenditure as capital or revenue in the Supreme Court decision of CIR v Murray Equipment Ltd \[1966\] NZLR 360. In that case, the expenditure incurred on legal costs in attacking patent applications of others was held to be revenue in nature (at 369). In this instance it might well be that the identical situation might not have to be faced by the company again, but the very fact that this one arose is a clear indication that there might well occur, in the future, similar threats to the money-earning process. 120. It was considered that the payment would be made from circulating capital, and although an identical situation might not have to be faced by a business again, Moller J considered that the fact this one arose, indicates that a similar threat might well occur in the future. It was also considered that under ordinary principles of commercial accounting, the expenditure would be treated as being of a revenue nature. 121. Moller J’s comment in Murray Equipment could equally apply in a situation of attacking another’s patent or the defence of a patent. An identical situation might not arise for the company again, but the fact the situation arose indicates that a similar threat, requiring defence or attack, might arise in the future. Therefore, the expenditure was not incurred in the production of assets or advantages of an enduring benefit. 122. The approach taken following BP Australia is not consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Taxes v Ballinger and Co Ltd (1903) 23 NZLR 188. In that case, it was held that expenses, incurred in unsuccessfully defending the taxpayer’s patent against an action by the prior patent holder who claimed that the taxpayer’s patent had infringed the prior patent, were capital in nature (at 193, 194): the moneys expended have been lost in an unsuccessful endeavour to retain the means for earning additional profit for the company. Such expenditure has not resulted in a profitable investment, but it is none the less an investment of capital. 123. The Ballinger decision has been the subject of considerable criticism, particularly in the later patent case of Murray Equipment. The approach in Murray Equipment following BP Australia is to be preferred. 124. A further fundamental distinction between capital and revenue expenditure is whether the expenditure relates to the business structure or to the business process of the taxpayer. Expenditure of the former type is capital in nature. The Court of Appeal in Buckley & Young referred to this distinction (at 61,274): what is involved in the fundamental distinction between the source of income and the income earning process; between capital and income; between expenses affecting the business structure or entity and operating expenses. Whether the enquiry is under sec. 111 or sec. 112(a) \[what is now the general permission and capital limitation\] the essential question is as to the true character of the payments made and the benefits provided. 125. The Privy Council case of Ward v CT \[1923\] AC 145 is support for the proposition that expenditure incurred to protect the entire business from being extinguished is likely to be capital in nature. Although not a case involving patents, Ward does deal with the fundamental distinction of whether payments were expended on the business structure of the taxpayer or whether they were part of the process by which income was earned. UNCLASSIFIED 19 Conclusion on general principles 126. It is the Commissioner’s opinion that the application of BP Australia is the correct authority by which to determine whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. Accordingly, it is the Commissioner’s opinion that expenditure incurred on legal costs in actions either defending or attacking a patent, including infringement proceedings, are generally revenue in nature. A similar analysis would also apply in the case of the right to use a patent. 127. However, legal expenses may be capital in nature where, for example, the taxpayer’s business has only one patented asset from which it earns its income such that expenses incurred in defending that patent are incurred in protecting the taxpayer’s business structure as a whole. Specific deduction for legal fees 128. From 1 April 2009, s DB 62 has allowed a deduction for legal expenses where the taxpayer’s total legal expenses for an income year are equal to or less than $10,000. This section overrides the capital limitation. In other words, if a taxpayer incurs legal expenditure for attacking or defending a patent and the taxpayer’s total legal expenses are equal to or less than $10,000 in that income year, then the legal expenses are deductible regardless of whether they are capital in nature. This assumes the general permission is satisfied and the other general limitations are met. 129. If the legal expenditure does not satisfy the requirements of s DB 62, then the normal deductibility principles apply. (In other words, the expenditure will be deductible only if the general permission is satisfied and the general limitations do not apply.) In which case, the general principles discussed above apply, and the expenditure is likely to be revenue in nature. Proceeds and allowable deductions on the sale of patent rights or a patent application Amount derived is income 130. An amount derived by a taxpayer, in respect of a sale of any patent rights or a patent application with a complete specification, whether a capital asset or trading stock, is income of that taxpayer under s CB 30: CB 30 Sale of patent applications or patent rights If a person derives an amount from the sale of a patent application with a complete specification or from the sale of patent rights, the amount is income of the person. 131. Sections EE 44 to EE 52 may also apply to the disposal of depreciable property such as patents and patent applications other than by way of sale. Amount of deduction 132. The amount of allowable deductions on the sale of a patent application or patent rights depends on the circumstances of the taxpayer. If a taxpayer sells a patent application or patent rights that they acquired on or after 1 April 1993, s DB 40 will apply to the sale. In terms of s DB 40, the taxpayer is allowed a deduction on disposal of the patent application or patent rights. The amount of the deduction is calculated using the formula: total cost – total amounts of depreciation loss UNCLASSIFIED 20 133. The terms used in the formula are defined in s DB 40(4). For clarity, the “total cost” in the formula is the historic cost of the patent application or patent rights, not the book value of the item in the taxpayer’s financial statements. 134. Deductions under s DB 40 may also be allowable for a taxpayer in the business of buying and selling patent applications, patents or patent rights (that is, the items are the taxpayer’s trading stock). This could apply if the taxpayer retains a patent and derives income from it by licensing the patent rights to a third party to exploit. When those patent rights are sold, allowable deductions would be in accordance with s DB 40. The deductions are allowable despite the fact other patents or patent rights of that taxpayer may be trading stock. The trading stock patents must be treated in accordance with the trading stock rules in subpart EB (valuation of trading stock – including dealer’s livestock). 135. Similarly, if a taxpayer in the business of buying and selling patent applications, patents or patent rights also devises the invention to which a patent application or patent relates, but is not in the business of inventing, allowable deductions in respect of the sale of the patent application or those patent rights will be in accordance with s DB 38. 136. Sections EE 44 to EE 52 can also apply to the disposal of depreciable property, such as patents or patent applications, other than by way of sale. Timing of allowable deductions on the sale of a patent application, a patent or patent rights purchased for the purpose of resale 137. If a taxpayer not in the business of buying and selling patent applications, patents or patent rights buys a patent application, a patent or patent rights for the purpose of reselling them, then the cost is deductible when the taxpayer on-sells them. Section EA 2 requires deductions for “revenue account property” that is not trading stock to be deferred until those patent or patent rights are disposed of or cease to exist. Timing of allowable deductions on the sale of a patent application, a patent or patent rights, being trading stock of a business 138. If the proceeds of sale of property are income, then the property is “revenue account property” (as defined in s YA 1). In the rare case of a business dealing in patent applications, patents or patent rights, those items will also constitute trading stock. Accordingly, their cost, and any additional expenditure relating to them, is deductible and not depreciable. The deductions will be subject to the trading stock rules in subpart EB. 139. Similarly, if a person is in the business of buying and selling patent applications, patents or patent rights and in the business of inventing, then income and expenditure relating to research carried out for the business of inventing would be on revenue account and anything produced for sale would be subject to the trading stock rules. Treatment of patent-related expenses and proceeds under the old rules 140. In terms of s DB 36, if a patent was acquired before 23 September 1997, a taxpayer may claim a deduction for expenditure incurred in connection with the grant, maintenance or extension of a patent used by the taxpayer in the production of the taxpayer’s income for that year. 141. If a patentee devised an invention and derived income from the use of its patent, s DB 38(2) provides for a deduction for expenditure incurred before 1 April 1993 in connection with the devising of an invention. UNCLASSIFIED 21 Examples 142. The following examples help to explain the application of the law. Example 1: Operation of s EE 18B – expenditure for underlying items of intangible property 143. Business C begins an R&D project during May 2016. After 18 months of R&D, Business C recognises an invention resulting from the R&D as an intangible asset for financial reporting purposes. The R&D expenditure incurred by Business C, up to the point of asset recognition, may be deductible under the general permission (s DA 1) or under the specific R&D provisions in s DB 33 or s DB 34 (refer discussion at \[75\]-\[102\]). 144. Subsequently, Business C incurs some capitalised development expenditure further refining the invention. An invention is an intangible asset that is not an item of depreciable intangible property. 145. Business C then applies for a patent for the invention, filing a patent application with a complete specification. A patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005 is an item of depreciable intangible property. The depreciable cost of the patent application comprises the administrative and legal fees Business C incurred in applying for the patent and the capitalised development expenditure Business C incurred on refining the intangible invention. 146. The capitalised development expenditure is included in the depreciable cost of the patent application because the invention is an underlying item of intangible property in which Business C holds the patent application. If the patent is subsequently granted, the depreciable cost of the patent will also include the capitalised development expenditure Business C incurred on refining the invention, if it has not already been deducted as depreciation of the patent application. 147. On the granting of a patent, the patent application costs form part of the adjusted tax value of the patent and the amounts continue to be depreciated over the legal life. In terms of s EE 44(2)(b), there is no disposal of the patent application when that application has “concluded because a patent is granted to the person in relation to the application”. 148. If the taxpayer has purchased the patent application, patent or patent rights, then the cost to the taxpayer is depreciable. In this case, the taxpayer has purchased either the application for or the right to use a particular invention, which is protected by a patent, and to exclude others from such use. It is the cost incurred in buying that application or right that is depreciable. There is no disposal of the patent application when the patent is granted (in the case of a taxpayer purchasing a patent application). Example 2: Operation of s DB 34(3) – derecognition 149. Business A begins an R&D project during March 2016. After 24 months of R&D, Business A recognises an intangible asset for financial reporting purposes, which has been created from the R&D. In the six months after recognising the intangible asset for financial reporting purposes, Business A incurs $200,000 in capitalised development expenditure further developing the asset. The intangible asset is not listed in sch 14, so it is not depreciable for tax purposes. UNCLASSIFIED 22 150. Business A then sells the incomplete intangible asset to Business B (which intends to continue the R&D and complete the asset) for $10 million. Business A is not in the business of buying and selling those intangible assets (that is, the intangible assets are not trading stock). Business A makes an untaxed capital gain of $9.8 million from the sale. Business B incurs $300,000 in capitalised development expenditure further developing the asset before abandoning the project and derecognising the asset for financial reporting purposes. 151. Business B is allowed a deduction under s DB 34(3) for the $300,000 it incurred in capitalised development expenditure. Business B is not allowed a deduction for the $10 million cost of purchasing the asset from Business A. Example 3: How depreciation is calculated and what happens when a patent is not renewed 152. The relevant sections in this example are ss EE 12, EE 14, EE 16, EE 33 and EE 34. 153. A company devises an invention for a new energy-efficient light bulb. The company has a 31 March balance date. The company files the patent application with the complete specification for the new light bulb on 20 October 2016. It spends $250 on filing fees and $10,000 on patent attorney fees. The company’s total legal fees for the 2016/17 income year exceed $10,000. The Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand grants a patent for the invention on 3 December 2017. The company begins making the light bulbs in June 2018. 154. The term of the patent rights under the Patents Act 2013 is 20 years (240 months) and runs from the patent date, being the filing date of the complete specification. The patent life is, therefore, from 20 October 2016 to 20 October 2036. The patent will expire on 20 October 2036. 155. The patent rights are available for use by the company in the 2017/18 income year to derive income or to carry on the business, although the company begins manufacturing the light bulbs only in the 2018/19 income year. 156. Therefore, the depreciation calculations are for the three income years:  2016/17 – the year in which the patent application is filed with complete specification;  2017/18 – the year in which the patent is granted; and  2018/19 – a typical year following the grant of the patent. 2016/17 – the year the patent application is filed with complete specification Depreciation of the patent application (with complete specification) Annual rate (s EE 33) = 1 ÷ legal life = 1 ÷ 20 = 0.05 157. The patent application is designated as a form of depreciable intangible property (and fixed life intangible property as defined in s EE 67), because it was lodged on or after 1 April 2005 with a complete specification. 158. Therefore, for the 2016/17 income year, the annual depreciation rate is calculated in terms of s EE 33. The legal life is as defined in s EE 67, being the 20-year term of a patent under the Patents Act. UNCLASSIFIED 23 Depreciation loss (s EE 16) = annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 = 0.05 x $10,250 x 5/12 = $214 159. The depreciation loss for the patent application is calculated using the standard calculation in s EE 16. The cost of the patent application comprises the legal and administrative costs incurred ($10,250). The patent application was owned for five whole calendar months in the taxpayer’s 2016/17 income year (see s EE 16(7)). 2017/18 – the year the patent is granted 160. In the 2017/18 income year, the year the patent is granted, depreciation calculations need to be performed for the:  patent application (held for eight months in 2017/18 before the grant of the patent); and  patent (held for four months in 2017/18 ). Depreciation of the patent application Annual rate (s EE 33) = 1 ÷ legal life = 1 ÷ 20 = 0.05 161. For the 2017/18 income year, the patent application has been owned for eight whole calendar months. The conclusion of the patent application because a patent was granted is excluded from being a disposal under s EE 44(2)(a). Therefore, the company is not denied a deduction for depreciation loss for the application under s EE 11. Depreciation deduction (s EE 16) = annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 = 0.05 x $10,250 x 8/12 = $342 Depreciation of the patent or patent rights Annual rate (s EE 34) = 1 ÷ legal life = 1 ÷ 20 = 0.05 162. For the 2017/18 income year, s EE 34(6) provides that the annual depreciation rate for the patent or patent rights is calculated on the basis of the legal life being the remaining legal life of the patent application from the start of the income year in which the person acquires the patent application (that is, 20 years). UNCLASSIFIED 24 Depreciation deduction (s EE 16) = annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 = 0.05 x $9,694 x 4/12 = $162 163. In terms of s EE 16(4)(b)(i), the patent’s value or cost is its adjusted tax value at the start of the month the company acquired it (at 1 December 2017). The adjusted tax value is the cost ($10,250) less the depreciation loss on the patent application up to 1 December 2017 ($214 + $342). The adjusted tax value is $9,694. 164. Therefore, for 2017/18, the taxpayer has a depreciation loss of $342 for the patent application and $162 for the ensuing patent or patent rights (that is, $504 in total for that income year). 2018/19 – a typical year in which the patent or patent rights are owned Depreciation of the patent or patent rights Annual rate (s EE 34) = 1 ÷ legal life = 1 ÷ 20 = 0.05 165. For the 2018/19 income year, in terms of s EE 34(6), the legal life is still the remaining legal life of the patent application from the start of the income year in which the person acquires the patent. Depreciation deduction (s EE 16) = annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 0.05 x $9,694 x 12/12 $485 166. For 2018/19, the taxpayer has a depreciation loss of $485 for the patent. Subsequent income years 167. For the 2019/20 income year, the depreciation for the patent is again for a full 12 months and the depreciation deduction is as for the 2018/19 year (that is, $485). 168. Before the fourth anniversary of the filing of the patent application with complete specification (that is, 20 October 2020), the company decides not to renew the patent. The patent, therefore, expires on 20 October 2020. Under s EE 44 and EE 47(9), this is an event to which s EE 48 applies. 169. The taxpayer can deduct the cost of the patent not already depreciated. Section EE 11(1) provides that depreciation for the last year is not claimed twice (that is, once as the year’s depreciation and once under s EE 48(2) for a loss on disposal). UNCLASSIFIED 25 170. Section EE 11(1) provides that a person does not have a depreciation loss for the income year in which they dispose of the depreciable property. Section EE 48 applies so that the taxpayer can deduct the remaining cost of the patent that has not already been depreciated. 171. The depreciation already claimed for the year ended is: 31 March 2018 $162 31 March 2019 $485 31 March 2020 $485 Total depreciation claimed $1,132 172. Therefore, for the 2020/21 income year, the taxpayer can deduct the following amount from assessable income for loss on disposal of the patent: Cost of the patent $9,694 Less depreciation claimed $1,132 Deduction for loss on disposal $8,562 Example 4: How depreciation is calculated if a patent application with complete specification is lodged after 1 April 2005, but the application is later withdrawn or refused 173. The relevant sections in this example are ss EE 11, EE 12, EE 14, EE 16, EE 33, EE 44 and EE 47. 174. The facts in example 4 are the same as in example 3, except that the patent application for the light bulb was not granted but was refused on 3 December 2017. 2016/17 – the year the patent application is filed with complete specification 175. The calculation for the depreciation for the patent application in the 2016/17 income year, the year the patent application is filed with complete specification, is the same as in example 3. 2017/18 – the year the patent is refused 176. Section EE 11(1) provides that a person does not have a depreciation loss for the year in which they dispose of the depreciable property. 177. Under s EE 44 and EE 47(9), the refusal of the patent application on 3 December 2017 is an event to which s EE 48 applies. The taxpayer can deduct the cost of the patent application not already depreciated as in example 3. 178. Depreciation already claimed for year ended 31 March 2017, being the total depreciation claimed, is: 31 March 2017 $214 179. Therefore, the amount that the taxpayer can deduct from assessable income for loss on disposal of the patent application is: Cost of the patent $10,250 UNCLASSIFIED 26 Less depreciation claimed $214 Deduction for loss on disposal $10,036 Example 5: How depreciation is calculated when the patent or patent rights are purchased from another person 180. The relevant sections in this example are ss EE 16 and EE 33. 181. On 1 May 2016, a taxpayer purchased the patent rights to manufacture and sell a therapeutic bed. The taxpayer paid $240,000 for the patent rights, which expire on 31 October 2020. The taxpayer begins making and selling the beds. The taxpayer’s balance date is 31 March. Because the patent was granted before the 2005/06 income year, s EE 33 determines the annual rate. 182. The remaining legal life of the patent rights, from the time at which the taxpayer acquires the patent, is 4 years and 6 months (that is 4.5 years). Annual rate (s EE 33) = 1 ÷ legal life = 1 ÷ 4.5 = 0.22 (to two decimal places) 183. The annual depreciation deduction on the patent rights in the 2016/17 income year is: Depreciation deduction (s EE 16) = annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 = 0.22 x $240,000 x 11/12 = $48,400 184. The annual depreciation deduction on the patent rights in the 2017/18 income year is: Depreciation deduction (s EE 16) = annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 = 0.22 x $240,000 x 12/12 = $52,800 Example 6: Additional costs for a patent 185. The relevant section in this example is s EE 19. 186. A taxpayer manufacturing locks devises an invention for a lock that will respond to only a personal voice signal. The taxpayer lodges a patent application with a complete specification for a patent in New Zealand on 30 October 2016. The taxpayer incurs costs in relation to the patent application, including patent attorney fees. These costs form part of the cost of the patent application. The taxpayer has a 31 March balance date. UNCLASSIFIED 27 187. Some further costs are incurred, and the taxpayer’s patent attorney, on 1 March 2017, charges an additional fee of $2,500 for reporting and responding to an examiner’s report. The taxpayer’s total legal fees for the 2016/17 income year exceed $10,000. 188. The Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand grants the patent on 15 April 2017, and the taxpayer immediately begins manufacturing the new locks. 189. The taxpayer pays the annual renewal fee of $100 in October 2020. 190. Section EE 19 provides that the costs are added to the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year for purposes of the depreciation loss formula in s EE 16 when a person:  owns an item of fixed life intangible property; and  incurs additional costs in an income year for the item; and  is denied a deduction for the additional costs (other than a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss). 191. Once this taxpayer lodged a patent application with complete specification after 1 April 2005, they owned an item of fixed life intangible property. 192. Therefore, although the taxpayer’s patent attorney fees were incurred only at the end of the 2016/17 income year, the additional fee of $2,500 can be added to the patent application’s adjusted tax value at the start of the 2016/17 income year, for the purposes of s EE 16. This is because the fees are an additional cost incurred in the income year in which the taxpayer owned the patent application. 193. The renewal fees for the patent, incurred in the 2020/21 income year, are considered to be a revenue expense and deductible in the income year incurred. Example 7: Income and deductions on sale of patent rights 194. The relevant sections in this example are ss CB 30, EE 18B and DB 40. 195. The light bulb company in example 3 spends $45,000 in the 2018/19 income year refining the light bulb components. The company filed for a patent with a complete specification on 20 October 2016. The patent was granted on 3 December 2017, and production began on 20 June 2018. Instead of letting the patent expire on 20 October 2020, the company renews the patent and eventually sells it on 20 October 2022 for $750,000. 196. The company cannot claim depreciation for the 2022/23 income year, because s EE 11(1) says that depreciation cannot be claimed in the year a depreciable asset is sold. 197. The proceeds of $750,000 from the sale is income, under s CB 30. The company can claim the cost of the patent, less depreciation already deducted, as a deduction, under s DB 40. 198. The depreciable cost of the patent to the company was $9,694 and the depreciation loss for the 2017/18 income year is the same as for example 3 (that is, $162). 199. In the 2018/19 income year, the taxpayer has incurred expenditure ($45,000) on an item (components making up the new light bulb) on which the taxpayer holds a patent. Therefore, $45,000 is included in the cost of the patent for depreciation purposes in terms of s EE 18B. In the 2018/19 income year the depreciation calculation, in terms of s EE 16, would be as follows. UNCLASSIFIED 28 2018/19 income year Depreciation of the patent or patent rights. Annual rate (s EE 34) = 1 ÷ legal life = 1 ÷ 18.55 = 0.05 (rounded to two decimal places) 200. For the 2018/19 income year, in terms of s EE 34(4), the legal life is the patent’s remaining legal life from the start of the income year in which the relevant costs (the $45,000 under s EE 18B) are recognised under s EE 18B. The patent’s remaining legal life at 1 April 2018 is 18 years, 6 months and 20 days (that is, 18.55 years). Depreciation deduction (s EE 16) = annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 = 0.05 x $54,694 x 12/12 = $2,735 201. For the 2018/19 income year, the taxpayer has a depreciation loss of $2,735 for the patent. 202. For the 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22 income years, the depreciation for the patent is again for a full 12 months, and the depreciation deduction is as for the 2018/19 (that is, $2,735 in each year). 203. Depreciation already deducted up to and including the 2019/20 income year is $8,367. 204. Therefore, the deduction on sale is: Cost of the patent $54,694 Less: Depreciation already claimed $8,367 Deduction $46,327 Example 8: Legal expenses incurred in defending and attacking a patent 205. The relevant section in this example is s BD 2. 206. A pharmaceutical company, Company A, was granted a patent on 1 April 2016 for a cold medication. The medication was a syrup that is a combination of known substances (analgesics and decongestants) and a new substance. Company B, another pharmaceutical company that manufactured cold medications, applied to the Commissioner for the revocation of the patent on the ground that it was not a patentable invention under s 14 of the Patents Act. Both companies held numerous patents. The court held that the patent was valid. 207. Company A spent $300,000 in defending the attack on its patent, and Company B spent $225,000 in attacking the patent. 208. The amounts spent by Company A and Company B are deductible under s BD 2. UNCLASSIFIED 29 Example 9: Research and development expenses incurred in devising an invention 209. The relevant sections in this example are ss DB 34, EE 16, EE 18B, EE 33 and EE 34. 210. A tyre manufacturing company, in its income year ended 31 March 2017, spends $10,000 on research and development into coloured snow tyres. The company hopes eventually to obtain a patent for the new tyres. The $10,000 is the total amount of expenditure the company has incurred in that year on research and development. The company recognises the expenditure as an expense and writes it off as immaterial for financial reporting purposes. 2016/17 income year 211. For income tax purposes, in terms of s DB 34(5), the company can deduct the $10,000 in full in its 2016/17 income year. 2017/18 income year 212. In the 2017/18 income year, the same company spends $50,000 on equipment to assist the research (the equipment is not an asset in its own right and nor is it otherwise depreciable). The company treats the amount as an expense for financial reporting purposes (because the project has not yet satisfied the criteria for asset recognition under either the old or new reporting standard). 213. For income tax purposes, in terms of s DB 34(1) and (2), the company can expense all research and development expenditure on the project for the 2017/18 income year. 2018/19 income year 214. In June 2018, the project satisfies the criteria for “asset recognition”, but additional development is required before the company’s application for a patent for the coloured snow tyres. On 1 October 2018, after additional development expenditure of $100,000, the company lodges a patent application with complete specification, incurring $15,000 in application costs. The patent is granted on 1 December 2018. 215. For income tax purposes, the treatment of the company’s research and development costs for the 2018/19 income year is as for 2016/17 and 2017/18: under s DB 34, the taxpayer company can expense all research and development expenditure incurred before asset recognition in June 2018. 216. The $100,000 of development expenditure, incurred after the point of “asset recognition”, cannot be deducted under s DB 34. However, as the development expenditure gives rise to the patent application and is incurred on or after 7 November 2013, the development expenditure is included in the depreciable cost of the patent application (and subsequent patent) in terms of s EE 18B. 217. A patent application with complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005 is an item of sch 14 depreciable intangible property. Section EE 33 provides the calculation for the rate at which the $15,000 patent application costs and $100,000 underlying development costs incurred can be depreciated. 218. Depreciation of the patent application for the period 1 October 2018 to 1 December 2018 (that is, two whole calendar months) is as follows. Annual rate (s EE 33) = 1 ÷ legal life UNCLASSIFIED 30 = 1 ÷ 20 = 0.05 219. As s EE 18B applies to the patent application, s EE 33(a) determines the patent application’s legal life, being 20 years from the start of the 2018/19 income year. For 2018/19, the patent application has been owned for two whole calendar months. Depreciation deduction (s EE 16) = annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 = 0.05 x $115,000 x 2/12 = $958 Depreciation of the patent for the period 1 December 2018 to 31 March 2019 (that is, four whole calendar months) is as follows. Annual rate (s EE 34) = 1 ÷ legal life = 1 ÷ 20 = 0.05 220. As s EE 18B applied to the patent application, s EE 34(7) determines the patent’s legal life, which is still 20 years. For the 2018/19 income year, the patent has been available for use for four whole calendar months. Depreciation deduction (s EE 16) = annual rate x value or cost x months ÷ 12 = 0.05 x $114,042 x 4/12 = $1,901 221. The value or cost of the patent is determined under s EE 16(4)(b)(i), being the patent’s adjusted tax value at the start of the month it is acquired (that is, $115,000 – $958). Therefore, for the 2018/19 income year, the taxpayer has a depreciation loss of $958 for the patent application and $1,901 for the ensuing patent.

Section BD 1 provides: BD 1 Income, exempt income, excluded income, non-residents' foreign-sourced income, and assessable income Amounts of income (1) An amount is income of a person if it is their income under a provision in Part C (Income). Exempt income (2) An amount of income of a person is exempt income if it is their exempt income under a provision in subpart CW (Exempt income) or CZ (Terminating provisions). Excluded income (3) An amount of income of a person is excluded income if— (a) it is their excluded income under a provision in subpart CX (Excluded income) or CZ; and (b) it is not their non-residents’ foreign-sourced income. Non-residents’ foreign-sourced income (4) An amount of income of a person is non-residents’ foreign-sourced income if— (a) the amount is a foreign-sourced amount; and (b) the person is a non-resident when it is derived; and (c) the amount is not income of a trustee to which section HC 25(2) (Foreign-sourced amounts: non-resident trustees) applies. Assessable income (5) An amount of income of a person is assessable income in the calculation of their annual gross income if it is not income of any of the following kinds: (a) their exempt income: (b) their excluded income: (c) their non-residents’ foreign-sourced income. 2. The general provision, s BD 2, states in respect of allowable deductions: BD 2 Deductions An amount is a deduction of a person if they are allowed a deduction for the amount under Part D (Deductions). 3. Section BD 4(5) provides: Allocation (5) If an expenditure or loss gives rise to more than one deduction, the deductions are allocated to income years to the extent that their total is no more than the amount of the expenditure or loss. 4. Section CB 30 provides: CB 30 Disposal of patent applications or patent rights If a person derives an amount from the disposal of a patent application with a complete specification or from the disposal of patent rights, the amount is income of the person. UNCLASSIFIED 33 5. Section CG 7C provides: CG 7C Disposal or rerecognition of derecognised non-depreciable assets When this section applies (1) This section applies when, for a non-depreciable intangible asset, a person has been allowed a deduction under section DB 34 (Research or development) because section DB 34(3) applies and— (a) the intangible asset is disposed of in an income year for consideration that is not income under another provision of this Act: (b) the intangible asset is rerecognised for financial reporting purposes in an income year. Disposal for consideration (2) If subsection (1)(a) applies, an amount equal to the deduction described in subsection (1) is income of the person for the income year, unless subsection (3) applies. Special case: disposal for consideration less than deduction (3) If subsection (1)(a) applies and the consideration is less than the deduction described in subsection (1), then, despite subsection (2), an amount equal to the consideration is income of the person for the income year. Rerecognition (4) If subsection (1)(b) applies, an amount equal to the deduction described in subsection (1) is income of the person for the income year. Relationship with subpart EE (5) For the purposes of subpart EE (Depreciation), the person is treated as never having the deduction described in subsection (1). 6. Section DA 1 sets out the general permission. Section DA 1(1) and (2) states: Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. 7. Section DA 2 sets out general limitations in respect of deductions. Section DA 2(1) and (7) state: Capital limitation (1) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. ... Relationship of general limitations to general permission (7) Each of the general limitations in this section overrides the general permission. UNCLASSIFIED 34 8. Section DA 3 provides for the effect of specific rules on general rules. The section states: DA 3 Effect of specific rules on general rules Supplements to general permission (1) A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ may supplement the general permission. In that case, a person to whom the provision applies does not have to satisfy the general permission to be allowed a deduction. Express reference needed to supplement (2) A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ takes effect to supplement the general permission only if it expressly states that it supplements the general permission. Relationship of general limitations to supplements to general permission (3) Each of the general limitations overrides a supplement to the general permission in any of subparts DB to DZ, unless the provision creating the supplement expressly states otherwise. Relationship between other specific provisions and general permission or general limitations (4) A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ may override any one or more of the general permission and the general limitations. Express reference needed to override (5) A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ takes effect to override the general permission or a general limitation only if it expressly states that— (a) it overrides the general permission or the relevant limitation; or (b) the general permission or the relevant limitation does not apply. Part E (6) No provision in Part E (Timing and quantifying rules) supplements the general permission or overrides the general permission or a general limitation. 9. Section DA 4 provides for the treatment of an amount of depreciation loss. The section states: DA 4 Treatment of amount of depreciation loss The capital limitation does not apply to an amount of depreciation loss merely because the item of property is itself of a capital nature. 10. Section DB 33 provides for a deduction for expenditure incurred in connection with scientific research. The section states: DB 33 Scientific research Deduction: scientific research (1) A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure they incur in connection with scientific research that they carry on for the purpose of deriving their assessable income. Exclusion (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to expenditure that the person incurs on an asset that— (a) is not created from the scientific research; and (b) is an asset for which they have an amount of depreciation loss for which— (i) they are allowed a deduction; or (ii) they would have been allowed a deduction but for the Commissioner’s considering that incomplete and unsatisfactory accounts were kept by or for them.

Section EE 33 provides: EE 33 Annual rate for fixed life intangible property What this section is about (1) This section is about the annual rate that applies to an item of fixed life intangible property, not including - (a) an item of excluded depreciable property, for which a rate is set in s EZ 15 (Annual rate for excluded depreciable property: 1992–93 tax year): (ab) a design registration for which a rate is set out in section EE 34B: (b) a patent for which a rate is set in section EE 34. Rate (2) The rate is the rate calculated using the formula— 1 ÷ legal life Definition of item in formula (3) In the formula, legal life is,— (a) if section EE 18B or EE 19 apply, the item’s remaining legal life from the start of the income year in which the relevant costs are recognised under the section: (b) if sections EE 18B and EE 19 do not apply, the item’s remaining legal life from the time at which a person acquires it. How rate expressed (4) The rate given by the formula is expressed as a decimal and rounded to 2 decimal places, with numbers at the midpoint or greater being rounded up and other numbers being rounded down. 26. Section EE 34 provides: EE 34 Annual rate for patent granted in 2005–06 or later income year When this section applies (1) This section applies to an item that is a patent when the patent is acquired by a person in their 2005–06 income year or a later income year.

Partial use: Formula (2) The deduction the person is allowed for the amount of depreciation loss must not be more than the amount calculated using the formula— depreciation loss × qualifying use days ÷all days Definition of items in formula (3) In the formula in subsection (2),— (a) depreciation loss is the amount of depreciation loss for the income year: (b) qualifying use days is the number of days in the income year on which the person owns the item and uses it, or has it available for use, for a use that falls within subsection (1)(b)(i) or (ii): (c) all days is the number of days in the income year on which the person owns the item and uses it or has it available for use. Other units of measurement (4) A unit of measurement other than days, whether relating to time, distance, or anything else, is to be used in the formula if it achieves a more appropriate apportionment. When subsection (6) applies (5) Subsection (6) applies when— (a) a person has an amount of depreciation loss for an item of depreciable property arising under s EE 48(2); and (b) the item was, at any time during the period the person owned it, dealt with in— (i) subsection (2); or (ii) any applicable paragraph in s EZ 11 (Amounts of depreciation recovery income and depreciation loss for part business use up to 2004-05 income year); and (c) the item is not a motor vehicle to which subpart DE applies. Deduction for depreciation loss: formula (6) The deduction the person is allowed for the amount of depreciation loss is calculated using the formula— disposal depreciation loss x all deductions ÷ (base value − adjusted tax value at date). Definition of items in formula (7) In the formula in subsection (6),— (a) disposal depreciation loss is the amount resulting from a calculation made for the item under s EE 48(2): (b) all deductions is all amounts of depreciation loss relating to the item for which the person has been allowed a deduction in each of the income years in which the person has owned the item: (c) base value has whichever is applicable of the meanings in s EE 57 to EE 59: (d) adjusted tax value at date is the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or event occurs. 31. Section EE 62 provides: UNCLASSIFIED 44 EE 62 Meaning of depreciable intangible property Meaning (1) Depreciable intangible property means the property listed in schedule 14 (Depreciable intangible property). Criteria for listing in schedule 14 (2) For property to be listed in schedule 14, the criteria are as follows: (a) it must be intangible; and (b) it must have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its acquisition. Schedule 14 prevails (3) Property that is listed in schedule 14 is depreciable intangible property even if the criteria are not met 32. Section YA 1 includes the following definitions: depreciable intangible property is defined in s EE 62 (Meaning of depreciable intangible property) patent right means the right to do or authorise anything that would, but for the right, be an infringement of a patent 33. Schedule 14 lists depreciable intangible property, including at items 3 and 4: 3 a patent or the right to use a patent 4 a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005 Patents Act 2013 34. Section 5 of the Patents Act 2013, defines a “patent” as follows: patent means letters patent for an invention 35. “Invention” is not defined, but “patentable invention” is defined in s 5 as follows: patentable invention has the meaning set out in section 14 36. In terms of s 14 of the Patents Act 2013, an invention is a patentable invention if it: (a) is a manner of manufacture within the meaning of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies; and (b) when compared with the prior art base— (i) is novel; and (ii) involves an inventive step; and (c) is useful; and (d) is not excluded from being a patentable invention under section 15 or16. 37. Section 20 of the Patents Act 2013provides: 20 Term of patent (1) The term of every patent is 20 years from the patent date. (2) However, a patent ceases to have effect on the expiry of the period prescribed for the payment of any renewal fee if that fee is not paid within that period or within that period as extended under section 21. (3) Subsection (2) applies despite anything in the patent or any other provision in this Act. 38. Section 103(1) provides: 103 Patent date (1) Every patent must be given a patent date that is— (a) the filing date of the relevant complete specification; or UNCLASSIFIED 45 (b) if the regulations provide for the determination of a different date as the patent date, the date determined under the regulations Reporting standards 39. Relevant parts of the old reporting standard, Financial Reporting Standard No 13 (FRS-13), to which s DB 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007 refers, follows. 4 DEFINITIONS STANDARD The following terms are used in this Standard with these meanings: 4.1 “Development” is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services prior to the commencement of commercial production or use. 4.2 “Research” is original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. 40.

However, not all payments of directors’ fees are schedular payments. Whether a payment of a director’s fee is a schedular payment largely depends on who has contracted to provide the directorship services you are paying the director’s fee for. If a director’s fee is not a schedular payment then there is no requirement to withhold tax from the payment. If you are paying a director’s fee that is a schedular payment, the rate of tax at 3. which you must withhold will depend on who you are paying, and the information they give you. The flow chart at Appendix 1 will help you determine whether you are required to 4. withhold tax from a payment of a director’s fee, and if so, at what rate you must withhold. This Interpretation Statement does not discuss the withholding treatment for 5. directors’ fees paid to non-resident taxpayers. Non-resident tax issues turn on the facts of the particular case, and the outcomes may vary depending on whether a Double Tax Agreement applies to the particular non-resident taxpayer. This Interpretation Statement updates and replaces Interpretation Statement – Tax 6. deductions from directors’ fees paid to GST registered person – Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 8, No 4 (September 1996). Paying a director’s fee – what do you need to know? Generally, a director’s fee is a “schedular payment”. When you make a schedular 7. payment you are required to withhold tax from that payment and pay the tax you withhold to Inland Revenue. However, there are exceptions to this general rule. Whether any of these exceptions will apply largely depends on who has contracted to provide the directorship services you are paying the director’s fee for. If a director’s fee is not a schedular payment then there is no requirement to withhold tax from the payment. While the Companies Act 1993 requires the person holding the office of director to 8. be a natural person, this does not mean contracts for directorship services must be with an individual director. Other entities can contract to provide the services of an individual as a director, for example, an employee of a company or a partner in a law firm. As such, an individual holding the office of director will not necessarily be the person (or entity) that has contracted with you to provide the directorship services. Who have you contracted with to provide directorship services? Directorship services will either be provided by an individual, or a non-individual 9. entity, such as a company, partnership, or authority. The following paragraphs discuss: 10.  what to do when you pay an individual a fee for being a director;  what to do when you pay a non-individual entity a fee for providing directorship services; and  your administrative obligations regarding withholding tax from payments of directors’ fees. 3 UNCLASSIFIED This statement is intended to complement Public Ruling BR Pub 15/10: Goods and 11. services tax – Directors’ fees TIB Vol 27, No 7 (August 2015) by using some of the same fact scenarios and examples. Payments of directors’ fees to individuals Individuals providing directorship services commonly do so as independent 12. contractors. In most cases, when you pay directors’ fees to an individual who is providing directorship services to you as an independent contractor, these directors’ fees will be schedular payments from which you must withhold tax, and pay the tax withheld to Inland Revenue. It is possible, although less common, that an individual will provide directorship 13. services as an employee. An individual will provide directorship services as an employee if directorship duties are included in the terms of their employment, usually recorded in the employee’s employment agreement. These duties may be in addition to other non-directorship duties. For example, a person employed as a managing director may have both management duties and directorship duties. If you employ someone as a director, amounts you pay them for performing their 14. directorship duties will be either “salary or wages” (regular payments), or an “extra pay” (a lump sum payment), not schedular payments. You will need to deduct PAYE from these payments, as you would for any other payments of “salary or wages” or “extra pay” made to an employee. In some cases, you may have both employees and independent contractors acting 15. for you as directors. If so, you will need to treat the payments differently depending on whether you are paying an employee or an independent contractor. Example 1: Directors’ fees paid to contractor (See Example 1 in BR Pub 15/10.) Ophelia is a human resources consultant in business on her own. Reynaldo Ltd approaches Ophelia to be a director. Ophelia contracts (as an independent contractor) to provide her services as a director of Reynaldo Ltd and in return she receives directors’ fees. When Reynaldo Ltd pays directors’ fees to Ophelia, it must withhold tax from those payments (as schedular payments) and pay that tax to Inland Revenue. Example 2: Directors’ fees paid to an employee Voltimand is the managing director of Royal Norway Ltd. His employment agreement with Royal Norway Ltd states that his duties include managing the day- to-day operations of the company, as well as acting as a director. Any payment Voltimand receives for performing the duties set out in his employment agreement will be “salary or wages” or an “extra pay” because it is paid to him in connection with his employment. “Salary or wages” or an “extra pay” cannot, by definition, be a schedular payment. Royal Norway Ltd will therefore need to deduct PAYE from Voltimand’s “salary or wages” or “extra pay” as it would for any other employee. 4 UNCLASSIFIED GST registration does not affect the requirement to withhold In the past, some taxpayers believed they were not required to withhold any tax 16. from directors’ fees they paid to a GST-registered director. This is not the case. Whether a person is registered for GST is irrelevant when determining if you are required to withhold tax from directors’ fees you are paying to that person. The “shareholder-employee” exception If you are paying directors’ fees to a shareholder-employee, you may not be 17. required to withhold tax from those payments. There is a shareholder-employee exception that will apply if you are not a look-through company and:  you are a close company; or  you are a company with 25 or fewer shareholders; and  the directors’ fees are paid to the shareholder-employee in the circumstances set out in s RD 3B. The circumstances set out in s RD 3B include the situation where the shareholder-18. employee is not paid regular salary or wages, or they are not paid for regular periods. In that situation, all amounts paid by the company to the shareholder- employee in their capacity as an employee, can be treated as other than a PAYE income payment. If you pay directors’ fees to a shareholder-employee in these circumstances, you are not required to withhold tax from those payments. Payments of directors’ fees to non-individuals The most common non-individuals you are likely to contract with for the provision 19. of directorship services include:  companies;  partnerships; or  public, local, or Māori authorities. Example 3: Directors’ fees paid to employees and independent contractors In addition to employing Voltimand as the managing director of Royal Norway Ltd, the company also contracts Francisco to be a director. Francisco is an independent contractor and has directorships with a number of other companies. As discussed above, when Royal Norway Ltd pays Voltimand for acting as a director these payments are “salary or wages”. Royal Norway Ltd must therefore deduct PAYE as it would for any other employee. However, because Francisco is an independent contractor, the payments he receives from Royal Norway Ltd for acting as a director are schedular payments, not “salary or wages”. Therefore, when Royal Norway Ltd pays Francisco his directors’ fees’, Royal Norway Ltd must withhold tax from those payments and pay the tax to Inland Revenue. 5 UNCLASSIFIED Companies As a general rule, if you are paying directors’ fees for directorship services provided 20. by a company, these payments will not be schedular payments and you are not required to withhold tax from them. However, there are exceptions in the Act to this general rule. If you are paying directors’ fees for directorship services provided by an agricultural, horticultural, viticultural company, or a company that is a non- resident contractor or non-resident entertainer, these directors’ fees will be schedular payments. If you are a labour-hire business, and you make payments to a company, which you have contracted with to provide directorship services to one of your clients under a labour-hire arrangement , those payments will also be schedular payments. These exceptions are discussed below at \[ 24\]-\[ 28\]. Companies are the most common non-individual provider of directorship services. 21. In many cases, these companies are “personal services companies” owned and operated by a professional director. The professional director is employed by their personal services company and you contract with the company to provide the directorship services, not the director personally. The definition of “company” under the Act is broad and includes entities you may 22. not ordinarily think of as companies. For example, the definition of “company” includes:  listed limited partnerships;  incorporated societies; and  other body corporates. If you make payment of directors’ fees for directorship services provided by such 23. entities, these payments will not be schedular payments and you are not required to withhold tax from them. Exceptions As noted at \[20\], under the Act, you may need to withhold tax from directors’ fees 24. paid for directorship services provided by:  an agricultural, horticultural, or viticultural company;  a company that is a non-resident contractor; or  a company that is a non-resident entertainer. Example 4: Directors’ fees paid for services provided by a company (See Example 3 in BR Pub 15/10.) Polonius Ltd, a financial management company, contracts to provide directorship services to Osric Ltd. It is agreed that Marcellus, one of Polonius Ltd’s specialist employees, will act as a director for Osric Ltd. Osric Ltd pays directors’ fees to Polonius Ltd for the directorship services it has provided. Because the directors’ fees Osric Ltd pays are for services provided by a company, those fees are not schedular payments and Osric Ltd is not required to withhold tax from them. 6 UNCLASSIFIED For the reasons noted at \[5\], the treatment of directors’ fees paid to non-residents 25. is not covered in this statement. A payment of a director’s fee for directorship services provided by an “agricultural, 26. horticultural, or viticultural company” is a schedular payment and you will need to withhold tax from it and pay that tax to Inland Revenue. The term “agricultural, horticultural, or viticultural company” is defined in the Act. 27. Essentially, it means a company that supplies labour for the cultivation of fruit crops, vegetables, orchards, or vineyards. This exception to the general rule only applies to companies that supply labour to one of those industries. It does not apply to other companies in those industries. As also noted at \[20\], if you are a labour-hire business, and you make payments to 28. a company, which you have contracted with to provide directorship services to one of your clients under a labour-hire arrangement, those payments will be schedular payments. You must therefore withhold tax from those payments and pay the tax withheld to Inland Revenue. It may appear unusual that the labour-hire exception potentially applies to the provision of directorship services. However, a labour-hire arrangement is framed broadly under the Act, and involves the performance of both “work or services”. It therefore follows that should a labour-hire arrangement involve the performance of directorship services this exception will apply. Partnerships If you pay directors’ fees for directorship services provided by a partnership, these 29. will generally be schedular payments. Unless the partnership has an exemption certificate, you will need to withhold tax from those payments. It is not uncommon for companies to appoint a professional director from a legal, 30. accounting or other professional firm. These professional firms are usually set up as partnerships. Because of the arrangements partners have with their professional partnerships, you might contract with the partnership to provide the directorship services rather than with the individual partner you wish to appoint. Commonly, these types of professional partnerships hold exemption certificates, in which case, you will not need to withhold tax from the directors’ fees you pay to them. Exemption certificates are discussed further below at \[ 48\]-\[ 51\]. 7 UNCLASSIFIED Public, local, and Māori authorities If you pay directors’ fees for directorship services provided by a public, local, or 31. Māori authority, these payments will not be schedular payments and you will not need to withhold tax from them. The terms “public authority”, “local authority”, and “Māori authority” are defined in 32. s YA 1 of the Act. Public authorities include government departments, the Public Trust and the Māori 33. Trustee. Local authorities include regional councils, airport authorities, Auckland Transport and various museum trust boards. Māori authorities are defined as those entities that have elected to be Māori authorities. Situations in which an authority might provide directorship services include where a 34. regional council holds shares in a company and those shares carry a right to appoint a director to the board of that company. The regional council may decide to appoint one of its own employees as a director of the company. The regional council is likely to contract with the company so that it is the entity providing the directorship services (by supplying the employee) to the company. A ny directors’ fees paid to the regional council would be for directorship services provided by a local authority. Therefore, the company paying directors’ fees would not be required to withhold. Example 5: Directors’ fees paid for services provided by a partnership with an exemption certificate (See Example 6 in BR Pub 15/10.) Dane & Co, a legal partnership, provides legal advice to Rosencrantz Ltd. A partner in the partnership, Gertrude, is approached by Rosencrantz Ltd to be a director on their board. Gertrude discusses the opportunity with her fellow partners and they all agree it is a good idea. Dane & Co draws up a one-year contract between the partnership and Rosencrantz Ltd for the provision of directorship services. After signing the contract, Dane & Co provides Rosencrantz Ltd with a copy of an exemption certificate issued by the Commissioner. When Rosencrantz Ltd pays directors’ fees to Dane & Co, it will not be required to withhold from those payments. If Dane & Co did not have an exemption certificate, Rosencrantz Ltd would have been required to withhold tax from the directors’ fees. 8 UNCLASSIFIED Voluntary schedular payments If you are going to be paying directors’ fees that are not schedular payments, the 35. person or entity you are paying may nonetheless want you to withhold tax from those payments. If you agree to this, those directors’ fees may be treated as “voluntary schedular payments”. An agreement to treat non-schedular payments as voluntary schedular payments must be recorded in writing. If you have agreed in writing to treat certain payments of directors’ fees as voluntary schedular payments, you must withhold tax from those payments and pay the tax withheld to Inland Revenue, as you would for any other schedular payments. Your obligations when you are required to withhold from directors’ fees Withhold at the time of payment If the directors’ fees you are paying are schedular payments, and you are required 36. to withhold tax from them, you must withhold at the time you make the payment. You are then required to pay the tax withheld to Inland Revenue. You will also need to record details of the person or entity you are paying, the payment, and the tax withheld in your employer monthly schedule. What rate should you withhold at? Depending on who you are paying, and the information they give you, the 37. withholding rate you should use may vary. It is therefore important you determine the appropriate rate for each person or entity you pay. Before you pay a schedular payment to someone, they should give you a Tax Rate 38. Notification for Contractors (IR330C) form. The IR330C will record both the person’s name and tax number. If the person you are paying wants to elect their own withholding rate, they also need to record this in the IR330C. Elected rates are discussed below. If a person has been given a prescribed rate/additional deduction rate by the Commissioner, they are required to notify you of this in their IR330C form. Prescribed rates/additional deduction rates are also discussed below. Example 6: Directors’ fees paid for services provided by an authority A regional council has a 50% shareholding in a tourism promotion company. The tourism promotion company produces marketing material on the region’s natural tourist attractions. Under the company’s constitution, the regional council has the right to appoint a director to the tourism promotion company’s board. The regional council decides to appoint Daniel, a tourism expert employed in the council’s tourism team. Because Daniel is an employee and will perform his director duties on the council’s time, the regional council contracts to provide Daniel as a director of the tourism promotion company. The tourism promotion company will pay directors’ fees to the regional council. Because those directors’ fees are for directorship services provided by the regional council (a local authority) the tourism promotion company is not required to withhold tax from the directors’ fees. 9 UNCLASSIFIED If you are making schedular payments to a person, and before 1 April 2017, that 39. person provided you with a Tax Code Declaration (IR330) form recording their name and tax number, they do not need to provide you with an IR330C as well. However, if that person wants to elect their own withholding rate for schedular payments you make to them on or after 1 April 2017, they will need to notify you of their elected rate using an IR330C. “No notification” rate If the person you are about to pay has not provided you with an IR330C (or, prior 40. to 1 April 2017, an IR330) recording both their name and tax number, you should withhold at a rate of 45%. This is called the “no notification” rate. Standard rate If the person you are about to pay provides you with an IR330C recording their 41. name and tax number with no elected rate, and they are not subject to a prescribed rate/additional deduction rate, you should withhold tax at a rate of 33%. This is the standard withholding rate for directors’ fees. Elected rates A person entitled to receive a schedular payment is allowed to elect their own 42. withholding rate. However, this elected rate cannot be less than 10% (or 15% for non-residents and temporary visa holders). For the purposes of this statement, we will only be referring to the 10% minimum rate, which will apply to most New Zealand residents. A person who wants to elect their own withholding rate must do so in their IR330C. 43. As long as the elected rate is not less than 10%, you should withhold at that rate. A person can subsequently change their elected rate. However, if that person has 44. already elected to change the withholding rate twice in the last 12-month period, you are not required to withhold at the newly elected rate unless you agree to. What if the person you are paying has a certificate from the Commissioner? You may be obliged to withhold tax at a different rate if the person you are paying 45. holds a certificate from the Commissioner. Taxpayers can apply to the Commissioner for a special tax rate certificate or for an exemption certificate. Special Tax Rate Certificates A person can only elect a withholding rate below the minimum rate of 10% if the 46. Commissioner has issued them with a special tax rate certificate for that rate. If the person you are paying directors’ fees to has elected a rate less than 10%, you should only deduct at that rate if they have provided you with a corresponding special tax rate certificate. Where a person has a 0% special tax rate certificate, the directors’ fees you pay to 47. them will still be schedular payments even though you will not need to withhold any tax. Because they are schedular payments, you must still record the payments and details of the person you are paying in your employer monthly schedule. 10 UNCLASSIFIED Exemption certificates Generally, if the person you are paying a schedular payment to holds an exemption 48. certificate, you will not need to withhold tax from that payment. However, exemption certificates have no effect on payments made under labour-hire arrangements. Therefore, if you are a labour-hire business making payments to a person under a labour-hire arrangement, you are still required to withhold tax even if they hold an exemption certificate. There is an exception to this. If you are a labour-hire business making payments to 49. a person under a labour-hire arrangement, and that person holds an unexpired exemption certificate issued before 1 April 2017, you will not need to withhold tax from such payments you make to them between 31 March 2017, and the earlier of:  1 April 2018; or  the expiry date of the exemption certificate. This is because, in those particular circumstances, an unexpired exemption 50. certificate issued before 1 April 2017 is treated as a 0% special tax rate certificate. As noted at \[47\], if the person you are paying holds a 0% special rate certificate 51. you do not need to withhold tax from the payments you make to them. However, you will still need to record the details of those payments in your employer monthly schedule, together with the details of the certificate holder. If the person you are paying holds an exemption certificate, you do not need to withhold any tax, or enter details about the payments you make to them in your employer monthly schedule. Prescribed rates/additional deduction rates Occasionally, the person you are paying will have outstanding tax liabilities with 52. Inland Revenue. In this situation, the Commissioner may have prescribed a specific withholding rate for that person, and may have also prescribed an additional deduction rate for you to withhold and pay to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue applies the additional deduction rate amounts to reduce a person’s outstanding tax liabilities. You will be notified of this type of prescribed rate/additional deduction rate either 53. by the person you are paying or Inland Revenue directly. If you are notified of a prescribed rate/additional deduction rate, you must withhold at those rates even if the person you are paying has elected a different rate. Once you have decided the rate, what amount do you apply it to? Once you have determined the appropriate withholding rate for a payment, you 54. must then apply that rate to the total amount of the schedular payment, exclusive of any GST charged. If you reimburse a director for an amount they have incurred as a necessary part of 55. performing their role as director, for example, the cost of flights to attend a board meeting, that payment is not considered to be a director’s fee. Accordingly, the reimbursement payment will not be a schedular payment and you will not need to withhold tax from it. 11 UNCLASSIFIED Example 7: Directors’ fees paid to an individual together with a reimbursement of expenses (See Example 2 in BR Pub 15/10.) Ophelia who contracted to act as a director of Reynaldo Ltd is also GST registered. Withholding rate Reynaldo Ltd provides Ophelia with a “Tax Rate Notification for Contractors” form to complete. Ophelia fills out the form, providing her name, tax number and elects to use a 20% withholding rate. Calculating the amount to withhold Ophelia issues the following tax invoice to Reynaldo Ltd for her first month’s attendances as a director of Reynaldo Ltd: Reynaldo Ltd needs to withhold tax from the payment it makes for Ophelia’s director’s fee. Reynaldo Ltd applies Ophelia’s elected withholding rate of 20% to $1,000, being the gross amount of Ophelia’s director’s fee (excluding GST). Accordingly, Reynaldo Ltd needs to deduct $200 of withholding tax and pay this to Inland Revenue. However, Reynaldo Ltd does not need to withhold tax from the payment it makes reimbursing Ophelia for the cost of her taxi fares to attend the board meeting. Reynaldo Ltd will therefore pay Ophelia $1,033.60 (being $1,000 – $200 tax + $150 GST +$83.60 reimbursement).

This Interpretation Statement is intended to be a general guide as to how income derived by the trustees of a trust is taxed. It also provides an overview of the various compliance obligations imposed on settlors, trustees and beneficiaries of trusts under tax law. Trusts generally 1.2 A trust is a creation of the law of equity. A trust is not a legal entity distinct from its trustee. Instead, a trust is a fiduciary relationship where a trustee holds property for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust or, where the trust is a charitable trust, for the specified charitable purposes. Although a trustee has legal ownership over the trust property, it holds the property subject to the beneficial interests of the beneficiaries and must act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the trust. A trustee may be an individual (or natural person) or an entity such as a company (entity). There may also be multiple trustees, who can be removed and replaced from time to time. 1.3 A trust can be established by a natural person, who settles the trust property on the trust while they are alive (inter vivos) or by way of their will (a testamentary trust). A trust may also be settled by an entity. Alternatively, a trust may arise by operation of law (eg, a constructive trust). The property settled on the trust is known as the corpus of the trust. The trustees will often use the corpus to derive income and capital gains. 1.4 The operation of a trust and the specific duties imposed on trustees are governed by the law of equity relating to trusts and by the Trustee Act 1956. For each individual trust, the operation may also be governed by the trust deed (or functional equivalent document). The trust deed, or functional equivalent document, specifies the ability of a trustee to deal with trust property and the ability to make distributions to beneficiaries for each individual trust relationship. The trust rules in the ITA 2007 apply to determine the tax consequences that flow from the operation of the trust under trust law. 1.5 References in this Interpretation Statement to “a trust” or “the trust” are references to the trustee(s) of a particular trust, as appropriate. Trust rules 1.6 The “trust rules” definition in the ITA 2007 sets out most of the rules for taxing income derived by trustees of a trust and the amounts distributed to beneficiaries of a trust. The trust rules also contain various rules relating to the compliance obligations of trustees, settlors and beneficiaries of trusts. Since the rewrite of the income tax legislation, the rules that relate to trusts are contained in different parts of the ITA 2007, but most of the rules are in subpart HC. 1.7 The “trust rules” are expressly defined in s YA 1 as meaning the rules contained in: ss DV 1 to DV 7 (which relate to superannuation funds); (a) 5 UNCLASSIFIED s DV 9 (which provides rules relating to how trusts can claim deductions); (b) s GB 22 (which contains a specific anti-avoidance rule relating to (c) beneficiary income); subpart HC (which contains the general rules relating to trusts); (d) subpart HZ (Terminating provisions); (e) ss LE 4, LE 5, LF 2, LF 3 and LO 2 (which relate to tax credits and minor (f) beneficiaries); and ss 43B, 59 and 93B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) (which relate (g) to trustee filing and disclosure requirements). 1.8 Aside from the trust rules as defined the following sections are fundamental to the operation of the trust regime: ss BD 1(4)(c), CV 13, CW 53, CW 54 and CX 59. They set out the treatment of amounts derived from trusts as taxable, exempt or excluded income depending on their character. 1.9 The current trust regime was introduced in 1988 through an amendment to the Income Tax Act 1976 (ITA 1976) with application for income derived by a trustee of a trust in the income year beginning 1 April 1988 and in subsequent income years. Rewrite of the income tax legislation 1.10 Since the introduction of the trust rules, the income tax legislation has been reordered, reformatted, and progressively reviewed and rewritten over several years on a part-by-part basis. This work resulted in the introduction of the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA 1994), the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 (the Core Provisions Act), the Income Tax Act 2004 (ITA 2004) and the ITA 2007. The purpose of the rewrite project was to reorganise and consolidate the law relating to income tax and to rewrite the tax legislation in plain language. 1.11 The trust rules were rewritten in the ITA 2007 as part of the third phase of the rewrite project. While the project reorganised the provisions dealing with the taxation of trusts and changed the way the trust rules were written, no substantive changes to the law occurred. Any intended legislative changes are noted in sch 51 of the ITA 2007. However, additions have been made to the trust rules since the introduction of the regime in 1988, such as the introduction of the minor beneficiary rule, discussed in Part 6 of this Interpretation Statement. Core provisions 1.12 The trust rules have been affected by the introduction of the Core Provisions Act that represented the first phase of the rewrite of the ITA 1994. The core provisions (in part B of the ITA 2007) set out the fundamental principles on which the rest of the income tax legislation is based, including the purposes of the ITA 2007, those to whom it applies, and the rules to be used in interpreting the ITA 2007. 1.13 The Core Provisions Act introduced a consistent “global/gross” approach to the calculation of income tax liabilities generally. This approach is consistent with the approach that has always been taken for the taxation of trusts, where 6 UNCLASSIFIED trustees were assessed on gross income less deductions and income was distributed gross to beneficiaries with tax credits. From the perspective of the trust regime, the charging provisions were moved into part B of the ITA 2007 (Core provisions) and the trust rules were left to focus on defining the circumstances arising from a trust which give rise to income or exclusions from income. In particular the trust rules under the Core Provisions Act provided for: when settlors became agents; (a) elections when the settlor’s residence changed; (b) marshalling rules for taxable distributions; (c) certain administrative requirements and elections; and (d) clarification of how the trust rules interface with the core provisions. (e) 1.14 The structural change made by the Core Provisions Act for the taxation of trustees was that they became taxed under the core provisions under the same source and residence rules that apply to any “person” rather than under a charging regime contained within the trust rules. Then foreign-sourced amounts derived by trustees were treated under the core provisions as either: exempt income if the foreign-sourced amounts were derived by a resident (a) trustee (only one trustee need be resident to qualify) where no settlor was New Zealand resident during the income year; or assessable income where the settlor was a New Zealand resident at any (b) time in the income year, whether the trustees are resident or non- resident. 1.15 As a consequence of the core provisions global/gross approach, two new provisions were also introduced (now s DV 9(1) and (2)) to clarify that the trustee, and not the beneficiary, is allowed deductions. Overview of the operation of trust rules 1.16 A trust will usually have at least one settlor, trustee and beneficiary. The meaning of these terms for tax purposes is discussed in Part 2 and Part 3 of this Interpretation Statement. 1.17 Income derived by a trustee of a trust is taxed either as “beneficiary income” or “trustee income”. 1.18 Beneficiary income is (s HC 6): income derived by the trustee of a trust that is vested absolutely in (a) interest in a beneficiary in the income year when it was derived; or income derived by the trustee of a trust that is paid to a beneficiary during (b) the income year or within the extended period allowed for in the ITA 2007. 1.19 Trustee income is (s HC 7): all the income derived by the trustee of a trust in an income year, other (a) than income that is beneficiary income. 7 UNCLASSIFIED 1.20 There are special rules for the taxation of foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee or a beneficiary. Foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee that are trustee income are taxed based on the residence of the settlor. Where there is no resident settlor, foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee are generally not taxed in New Zealand (provided that, where the trust is a foreign trust, any New Zealand resident trustees comply with the registration requirements discussed in Part 13 of this Interpretation Statement). Foreign-sourced amounts distributed to non-resident beneficiaries as either beneficiary income or as taxable distributions are not subject to tax in New Zealand. 1.21 The rules for taxing foreign-sourced amounts derived by non-resident and resident trustees, in ss HC 25 and HC 26 respectively, interface with the core provisions (see s BD 1), but the resulting income amounts are provided for under part C of the ITA 2007 not by subpart HC where the trust rules are mainly set out. Subpart HC does not make an amount income under the ITA 2007. 1.22 These concepts, along with specific rules that apply where beneficiary income is paid to minors, are discussed in Part 4 (Income derived by trustees), Part 5 (Beneficiary income), Part 6 (Minor beneficiary rule) and Part 7 (Trustee income) of this Interpretation Statement. 1.23 The tax treatment of distributions to beneficiaries of amounts that are not beneficiary income depends on the classification of the trust. For tax purposes, trusts are classified as: complying trusts – essentially trusts where tax has always been paid in (a) New Zealand on the worldwide income derived by the trust, whether by obligation or election, and the tax obligations relating to the trustees’ income tax liability have been satisfied. foreign trusts – trusts that have not had a New Zealand resident settlor (b) at any time since 17 December 1987; and non-complying trusts – trusts that are neither complying nor foreign (c) trusts. It is also possible for a trust to satisfy the requirements to be a complying trust, and to have only a non-resident settlor(s) so that it is also a foreign trust. These types of trusts are referred to in this Interpretation Statement as “dual status trusts”. 1.24 These different types of trusts are discussed in Part 8 of this Interpretation Statement. 1.25 Distributions to beneficiaries of a trust, other than distributions that are beneficiary income, will be one of: exempt income, where the distribution is made by a complying trust or (a) dual status trust; a taxable distribution, where the distribution consists of income, or capital (b) gains derived through a transaction with an associated person distributed by a foreign trust, or income or capital gains distributed by a non- complying trust; or 8 UNCLASSIFIED a non-taxable distribution, where the distribution consists of capital gains (c) (other than capital gains derived through a transaction with an associated person) of a foreign trust, or corpus of a foreign or non-complying trust. 1.26 The tax treatment of distributions to beneficiaries of a trust is discussed in Part 8 of this Interpretation Statement. 1.27 The general tax treatment discussed above applies to most trusts, including the standard family or trading trust structures often used in New Zealand. However, in some situations different tax rules apply to specific types of trusts, including: charitable trusts; (a) deceased estates; (b) community trusts; (c) superannuation funds; (d) lines trusts; (e) licensing trusts; (f) bare trusts; (g) unit trusts; (h) Maori authorities; (i) foreign investment funds; and (j) foreign superannuation schemes. (k) 1.28 The taxation of these entities is discussed briefly in Part 9 of this Interpretation Statement. Residence 1.29 The trust rules are a settlor-based taxation regime. The trust rules interact with the core provisions to tax income derived by the trustees of a trust based on the residence of the settlors, rather than the residence of the trustees. All New Zealand-sourced amounts are taxed in New Zealand regardless of the residence of the settlor. However, foreign-sourced amounts are generally taxable in New Zealand only where the settlor is resident in New Zealand. This is discussed in Part 7 (Trustee income) of this Interpretation Statement. For more information see “IS 16/03: Tax Residence”, Part 3: Residence and trusts (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2). 1.30 The trust rules contain specific rules for trusts that change their status due to a change in the residency of their settlor or settlors. These rules are discussed in Part 10 and Part 11 of this Interpretation Statement. 1.31 The residence rules for financial institution trusts that must comply with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) or Common Reporting Standards (CRS) due diligence and reporting requirements in New Zealand are slightly different from the residency regime applied to the trust rules for income tax 9 UNCLASSIFIED purposes. Guidance in other Inland Revenue publications on the FATCA and CRS requirements for trusts is referred to at \[13.35\] and \[13.36\]. 1.32 The settlor-based taxation approach is a change from the rules that applied before 1 April 1988. Previously, foreign-sourced amounts derived by the trustees of a trust with New Zealand resident settlors were not subject to tax in New Zealand where the trustees were non-resident. The settlor-based taxation regime was chosen because it was considered too easy to avoid tax on foreign- sourced amounts under the old regime by appointing non-resident trustees. It was also considered that, in economic terms, the residence of the settlor provides a more appropriate basis for taxing foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee. Associated persons 1.33 The associated persons rules as they apply to trusts are discussed in Part 12 of this Interpretation Statement. In particular, that part considers situations where settlors, trustees and beneficiaries will be associated for tax purposes. Compliance obligations 1.34 The trust rules contain various rules relating to the compliance obligations of settlors, trustees and beneficiaries of trusts. These rules include: settlor disclosure obligations; (a) trustee disclosure obligations; (b) beneficiary disclosure obligations; (c) records that must be kept by trustees of foreign trusts; (d) sanctions for non-compliance; (e) filing of tax returns; (f) allocation of tax credits; (g) withholding tax obligations; and (h) agency obligations. (i) 1.35 These compliance issues are considered in Part 13 of this Interpretation Statement. Previous statements 1.36 This Interpretation Statement replaces “Appendix: Explanation of Taxation of Trusts”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 1, No 5 (November 1989) and “Withholding Tax and Payments to Overseas Beneficiaries”, Public Information Bulletin No 29 (February 1966): 4. 1.37 The statement in “Consequential amendments to Part H – Treatment of net income of certain entities”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 9 (November 1996): 23 concerning amendments to the definition of “qualifying trust” that: “The amended definition is also intended to ensure that a foreign trust cannot be 10 UNCLASSIFIED a qualifying trust under the global/gross approach” is also replaced by the discussion of dual status trusts in this Interpretation Statement. 11 UNCLASSIFIED Part 2 Settlors Introduction to the term “settlor” 2.1 The term “settlor” is defined broadly in the ITA 2007. The core meaning of “settlor” is a person who transfers value to a trust. The definition also contains extensions, clarifications and exceptions to this core meaning. 2.2 The definition of “settlor” in the ITA 2007 is broad enough to include the common law meaning, but also extends beyond that meaning. At common law, a “settlor” is a person who “settles” property on a trust and this creates equitable obligations on a trustee in relation to the property. Location of “settlor” definition 2.3 The definition of “settlor” is in ss YA 1 and HC 27. Section HC 27 contains a general definition, which applies for the purposes of the ITA 2007 as a whole unless otherwise stated. 2.4 Section YA 1 incorporates the s HC 27 definition and provides some qualifications to the s HC 27 definition for the purposes of particular sections (relating to minor beneficiaries and associated persons). Significance of the term “settlor” in the ITA 2007 2.5 The definition of “settlor” is important in several respects, including: determining when foreign-sourced amounts derived by non-resident (a) trustees will be assessable income (s HC 25); determining when foreign-sourced amounts derived by resident trustees (b) will be exempt income (s HC 26); determining whether a trust is a foreign trust (s HC 11), which is relevant: (c) (i) in determining whether a distribution from the trust is a taxable distribution under s HC 15(4); (ii) to the ordering rules for distributions from the trust (s HC 16); (iii) in determining whether a trust is a non-complying trust, since a trust that is a foreign trust will not be a non-complying trust (s HC 12); determining whether a settlor may be liable for the income tax liability of a (d) trustee (s HC 29); understanding the minor beneficiary rules (ss HC 36 and HC 37); (e) understanding the associated person provisions relating to trusts (ss YB 7 (f) to YB 9); and calculating income for social assistance purposes (eg, s MB 7 (Family (g) scheme income of settlor of trust)). 2.6 The definition of “settlement” in s YA 1 is linked to the term “settlor”. Essentially, a settlement is an act or a failure to act by a person, or a transaction or series of transactions entered into by a person, that has the effect 12 UNCLASSIFIED of making the person a settlor. There cannot be a settlement without a person being, or being treated as being, a settlor. 2.7 Note that under trust law, each settlement is the creation of a new trust. However, for the purposes of the trust rules, if multiple settlements are made on the same terms, a trustee of the trust may treat all the settlements as one trust (s HC 3). Comparison with definition of “settlor” in the ITA 2004 2.8 The current definition of “settlor” was introduced with the enactment of the ITA 2007. Although the definition was extensively rewritten, Parliament did not intend to change the meaning of settlor. There was only one identified legislative amendment in relation to the definition and even that was described as a clarification rather than a change. Schedule 51 of the ITA 2007 states: The definition of settlor is clarified so that any transfer to a trust that increases the net assets of the trust is a settlement on the trust and any deductible payments settled on a trust are included in trustee income. 2.9 The view that Parliament did not intend to widen the definition of settlor is also supported by Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Income Tax Bill (30 April 2007). The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (as it was then) submitted that the transfer of value concept should be removed from the definition of “settlor” in the Income Tax Bill. In response, officials stated at 46: The drafting style adopted is again the generalised approach with specific exclusions. If specific examples of transfers of property or services are identified, they will be incorporated as an exclusion from the rule. The definition of “settlor” in the 2004 Act is extensive and covers all dispositions by a person to or for the benefit of a trust (in terms of the trust) of property, making available of property at less than market value, services at less than market value. It also extends to a person who uses property or services of a trust for consideration greater than market value, and includes the abstaining of entering into transactions and also is extended further in specific situations set out in section HH 1. Neither the submission nor officials have been able to identify any particular situation that would fall outside the current definition that falls within the meaning of “transfer of value”. 2.10 The new definition was also discussed in “Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft—Part H” (Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, 4 March 2005). The Exposure Draft stated at 7: Transfer of value and terms “distribution”, “settlor” and “settlement” The defined terms “distribution”, “settlor” and “settlement” rely on the common law but also extend the common law concepts for certain classes of transaction or event. In reviewing the effect of these two terms, it seems that both a “distribution” and a “settlement” involve a transfer of value in a very similar way to the concept used in subpart CD of the \[ITA 2004\]. In rewriting the dividend rules in subpart CD, a transfer of value is a transaction or event that leads to a value passing from one person to another for an unequal consideration (if any) in return. These two concepts have been re-drafted on the basis they are a transfer of value which is intended to simplify and harmonise concepts that have similar effect throughout the Act. 13 UNCLASSIFIED 2.11 The Exposure Draft indicates that the transfer of value concept was adopted from the dividend rules. It states that both a “distribution” and a “settlement” involve a transfer of value in a very similar way to the concept used in subpart CD of the ITA 2004 (relating to dividends). 2.12 The Exposure Draft also indicates that the intention in adopting the transfer of value concept was to simplify and harmonise the concepts that have similar effect throughout the income tax legislation. Features of the definition of “settlor” 2.13 The definition of “settlor” in s HC 27 has the following features: the core concept of a person who transfers value to a trust; (a) a legislative response to the decision in Re Marshall (Deceased), CIR v (b) Public Trustee \[1965\] NZLR 851 (CA) (Re Marshall) discussed below \[2.57\] to \[2.59\]; rules that help in determining whether a transfer or provision has been (c) made; and exceptions for: (d) (i) trusts for retirement benefits of employees; (ii) employee share purchase agreements; and (iii) contributions to foreign superannuation schemes. 2.14 A person can also be treated as a settlor under s HC 28. In particular: a person who has a control interest in a company that settles an amount (a) on a trust is treated as a settlor of the trust; where a trustee settles an amount on a sub-trust, the settlor of the head (b) trust will also be a settlor of the sub-trust; a person can be treated as a settlor of a trust, if they have control over a (c) trustee or a settlor of the trust; and a person can be treated as a settlor, if s HC 28(2), an anti-avoidance (d) provision, applies. 2.15 Although not part of the definition of “settlor”, a person may be treated as a settlor under s YB 21, if someone else settles a trust as nominee for the person. 2.16 Finally, as previously noted, the definition of settlor is qualified for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rules and the associated person rules. Person who transfers value to a trust 2.17 As noted above, the core meaning of “settlor” is a person who transfers value to a trust. In particular, a person will be a settlor of a trust under s HC 27(2)(a) if they transfer value: to the trust; (a) 14 UNCLASSIFIED for the benefit of the trust; or (b) on the terms of the trust. (c) 2.18 For simplicity, this part of the Interpretation Statement will generally refer to transfers of value “to” a trust despite the definition also applying to transfers for the benefit of the trust or on the terms of the trust. 2.19 It is noted that a person will be a settlor, if they transfer value “at any time”. This means a person will be a settlor of a trust if they have transferred value to the trust at any time in the past. To avoid any doubt, this includes transfers that occurred before and since the introduction of the 1988 amendments to the trust rules. Definition of “transfer of value” 2.20 The definition of “settlor” uses the definition of “transfer of value” in s YA 1. The definition of “transfer of value” features: a general meaning; (a) a specific inclusion relating to the release of an obligation to pay money; (b) a reference to a specific definition in s CD 5, which applies to transfers (c) made by companies; and confirmation that “transfers value”, which is used in the settlor definition, (d) has a corresponding meaning. General meaning of “transfer of value” 2.21 Often a transfer of value from a person to a trust will simply involve the payment of an amount, or the transfer of property, by the person to the trust with the trust providing nothing in return. In such cases, a transfer of value equal to the market value of the property will be transferred. 2.22 However, a transfer of value to a trust can also occur where a transaction occurs between a person and a trust and the trust does provide something in return. 2.23 Essentially, under the general definition of “transfer of value”, there is a transfer of value from one person (person A) to another person (person B) when person A provides money or money’s worth to person B and receives in return money or money’s worth that has a lower market value than what was provided (para (b) of the definition in s YA 1). In net terms, money or money’s worth is being transferred from person A to person B. 2.24 “Money’s worth” means something that is convertible into money (Wilkins (Inspector of Taxes) v Rogerson \[1961\] 1 All ER 358 (CA) at 361). 2.25 “Market value” is an important concept in the definition of “transfer of value” and is defined in s YA 1. 2.26 Note that s YA 1 provides two definitions of “market value” that apply to a share or option (depending on whether the share or option is quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange). These definitions apply for the purposes of the ITA 2007 as a whole unless otherwise stated. Therefore, these definitions may be 15 UNCLASSIFIED relevant in the context of a transfer of value involving a share or option. The definition of “market value” in s YA 1 also provides meanings that apply for the purposes of specific provisions. However, the settlor definition is not one of the specific provisions. 2.27 Therefore, in many situations, the ordinary meaning of “market value” will apply. Generally, the market value of something is the price that would be agreed between a willing but not anxious seller and a willing but not anxious buyer. It is important to identify the relevant market for the property or service being provided. Also, in determining the market value, surrounding circumstances that might reasonably be expected to affect the price agreed on must be taken into account. The market value of property or services is determined objectively. The subjective value placed on property or services by the person transferring or receiving the property is not relevant (Edge v CIR \[1958\] NZLR 42 (CA); Hatrick v CIR \[1963\] NZLR 641 (CA) at 661; R v Islam \[2009\] UKHL 30 (HL)). Where the settlement is denominated in foreign currency, the market value will be the value in New Zealand dollars on the date of settlement. 2.28 In the case of a transaction between a person and a trust involving the provision of money’s worth in exchange for money, a transfer of value to the trust could arise in two ways: Firstly, where a person is providing money’s worth to a trust, a transfer of (a) value could arise as a result of the trust paying a below market value consideration. Example 1. Transfer of value – below market consideration Sara sells her car to a family trust to be used in a business carried on by the trust. The sale price is $6,000, but the market value is $10,000. Sara has transferred value of $4,000 to the trust because she has sold her car to the trust for a discounted price. Secondly, where a trust is providing money’s worth to a person, a transfer (b) of value could arise as a result of the person paying an above market value consideration. Example 2. Transfer of value – inflated consideration Erica acquires management services from a trust. She pays $10,000 for the services, but the market value is only $1,000. Erica has transferred value of $9,000 to the trust because she has paid an inflated price to the trust for the management services. These facts could also raise other issues (involving potential avoidance considerations and the amount of income derived by the trust). However, this example is intended merely to illustrate the operation of the settlor definition. 2.29 Generally, in an arms-length transaction, the Commissioner is likely to accept that the price paid for property is a market value consideration. 2.30 As noted above, in determining whether there has been a transfer of value, the Commissioner will take into account the surrounding circumstances of a transaction. For instance, the Commissioner acknowledges that in some situations a purchaser may pay a premium for property, for example because they are in a hurry to purchase. Similarly, in some situations a vendor may discount the sale of property because they urgently need funds. It is unlikely that Parliament would have intended such transactions, when entered into with trustees, to result in settlements. However, the onus will be on the taxpayer to 16 UNCLASSIFIED show that there are special circumstances that have led to the premium or discount. 2.31 For simplicity, in discussing the transfer of value concept, this part of the Interpretation Statement generally assumes that a trust does not provide anything in return, and the part will generally refer to only what is provided by a person to a trust. This is despite the importance of considering both the value provided by the person to the trust and the value, if any, provided by the trust in return. Specific inclusion relating to the release of an obligation to pay money 2.32 As well as the general definition above, a “transfer of value” also specifically includes the release of an obligation to pay money. The release may be by agreement or by operation of law. Example 3. Settlement made by release of obligation Dory sells her house to a family trust, which was settled by her parents. The purchase price is satisfied by a loan from Dory to the trust. Dory later forgives the loan owed by the trust. By forgiving the loan, Dory has transferred value to the trust equal to the loan balance. Therefore, Dory is a settlor of the trust. 2.33 There may be situations where the obligation to pay money will have no value (eg, because the trust and trustees are insolvent). Whether this is so will be a question of fact to be determined in each situation. If the obligation to pay money has no value, no settlement will result from the release of the obligation. Transfers of value made by a company to a person 2.34 A special definition of “transfer of value” is also provided in s CD 5 for transfers of value made by a company to a person. The difference between the general definition and the definition in s CD 5 is that under the general definition the provision of services for less than market value is a transfer of value. 2.35 The definition in s CD 5 applies only for the purposes of the dividend rules in subpart CD. This is implicit from the legislative history of the definition (the term “transfer of value” was originally relevant to only the dividend rules) and the placement of s CD 5 in subpart CD. 2.36 For the purposes of the definition of “settlor”, a company will transfer value to a trust if the requirements of paras (b) or (c) of the definition of “transfer of value” in s YA 1 are satisfied, even if the company would not be treated as transferring value under the definition in s CD 5. Therefore, for the purposes of the settlor definition, a company will transfer value to a trust if the company provides services to the trust for less than market value. Situations included under the previous definition of “settlor” 2.37 The transfer of value concept in the current settlor definition is wide enough to include situations that were expressly included under the previous definition of “settlor” (in the ITA 2004 and previous Income Tax Acts). These situations are discussed below and include: making a “disposition of property” to a trust (from \[2.39\]); (a) 17 UNCLASSIFIED making property available to a trust (ie, where there is no disposal) (from (b) \[2.41\]); providing financial assistance to a trust (from \[2.42\]); and (c) providing services to a trust (from \[2.45\]). (d) 2.38 Again, for simplicity, in discussing the transfer of value from a person to a trust it is generally assumed in this part of the Interpretation Statement that something is being provided to the trust, but nothing is provided by the trust in return. This is so, even though a transfer of value could also occur if the trustee did provide something in return with a market value lower than that provided to the trust. Disposition of property 2.39 The previous definition of “settlor” included a “disposition of property” made to a trust. The term “disposition of property” was defined for the purposes of the settlor definition. The transfer of value concept in the current settlor definition is wide enough to include the situations that were covered in the definition of “disposition of property”. These situations include: Transferring property to a trust when it is first set up. A trust is created (a) when property is transferred to a trustee to hold subject to the terms of the trust. If a person transfers property to a trustee to hold on trust (even a minor amount), and thereby creates a trust, the person will be a settlor of the trust. Transferring ownership of property to a trust. (b) Providing a trust with the right to use property. This includes a lease or (c) licence. Granting an interest in or over property in favour of a trust (eg, a (d) mortgage or charge). Providing a loan to a trust at a less than market interest rate (CIR v Dick (e) (2001) 20 NZTC 17,396 (HC) at 17,402; Rossiter v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 195 (CA)). Issuing shares in a company to a trust. (f) Where there is a release, discharge, surrender, forfeiture, or abandonment (g) of any debt, contract, or thing in action, or of any right, power, estate, or interest in or over any property. A debt or any other right, estate or interest is deemed to be released when it becomes irrecoverable or unenforceable by action or for any reason ceases to exist. Where a person grants a power over any property to a trustee (eg, a (h) power to dispose of the person’s shares to anyone in a specified group of persons). Although the trustee does not have legal ownership of the property, the effect may be similar to a more standard trust relationship. A similar effect could be achieved by transferring property to the trustee on trust with discretions corresponding to the powers (eg, to distribute the property to beneficiaries in the specified group). The exercise by a person of a general power of appointment over property (i) (ie, someone else’s property) in favour of a trust. This applies only if the 18 UNCLASSIFIED person has the ability to deal with the property for their own benefit. The exercise of such a power in favour of a trust would be equivalent to the person exercising it in their own favour to acquire the property and then disposing of the property to the trust. 2.40 The above transfers could also be made by will or by virtue of intestacy. However, where a person attempts to transfer an interest in property and the trustees disclaim that interest (ie, if the trustees reject their right to receive the property), then there will be no transfer of value. Making property available to a trust 2.41 The previous definition of “settlor” also included any person who makes property available to a trust (eg, a lease of property). The transfer of value concept in the current definition of settlor is wide enough to cover this situation. Providing financial assistance to a trust 2.42 The previous definition of “settlor” stated that making property available included the provision of financial assistance. Again, the transfer of value concept is wide enough to cover this situation. Financial assistance could be provided to a trust by, for instance: providing an interest-free loan or a loan with a below market interest rate; (a) guaranteeing the repayment of an amount borrowed by a trust; and (b) providing a trust with security for the purposes of borrowing. (c) 2.43 If a person provides financial assistance to a trust, then there will be a transfer of value and the person will be a settlor. This can apply to a person who is a trustee of the trust, for example if a trustee provided their own personal property as security for money borrowed by the trust. Example 4. Providing financial assistance Solid Ltd guarantees a loan made by a bank to a trust carrying out a property investment business. Solid Ltd is not paid a guarantee fee. The market value for the provision of the guarantee would have been $10,000. In this situation, Solid Ltd will be a settlor because it has given a guarantee for no consideration. 2.44 A specific provision in the current definition of “settlor” (s HC 27(2)(b)) deals with the situation where a person provides financial assistance to a trust and has the right to demand payment from the trust, but the right to demand payment is not exercised or is deferred. This is discussed from \[2.51\]. Providing services to a trust 2.45 A transfer of value occurs if a person provides services to a trust for less than market value. This includes any investment advisory services, legal and accounting services, or services relating to any business carried on by the trustees of the trust. 2.46 If a trustee of a trust provides services that are incidental to the operation of the trust, there will be no transfer of value and, therefore, no settlement. However, there may be a transfer of value if services that are not incidental to the operation of the trust are provided. 19 UNCLASSIFIED 2.47 The above is also true for people other than trustees who have rights and obligations in relation to a trust, for example a person with the power of appointment. 2.48 The Commissioner considers that Parliament would not have intended trustees (or other right holders) to be settlors merely by providing services that are incidental to the operation of the trust. This would cause a significant number of trustees (and other right holders) to be settlors. This would be an absurd result. Therefore, it is appropriate in this case to read down the definition of settlor so that trustees (and right holders) who provide services that are incidental to the operation of the trust are not treated as settlors. 2.49 Examples of services that are incidental to the operation of a trust include attending trust meetings and reviewing trust documents. An example of a service that is not incidental to the operation of a trust is the day to day management of a business carried on through a trust. 2.50 The Commissioner’s approach to the treatment of services that are incidental to the operation of a trust, that is excluding them from being settlements, is intended to be confirmed in a Taxation Amendment Bill (expected to be introduced in the near future). The same Bill proposes that a person who provides other services to a trust for less than market value will be a settlor to correct an unintended legislative change arising from the rewrite of the trust rules. Responding to the decision in Re Marshall 2.51 Under s HC 27(2)(b), a person will be a settlor if: they provide financial assistance (eg, a loan) that involves an obligation to (a) pay on demand (eg, a loan that bears interest if demanded); and the right to demand is not exercised or is deferred. (b) 2.52 “Financial assistance” is not defined. However, it is considered that it will include the provision of loans, guarantees, security, and other types of financial assistance. 2.53 In the case of loans, the amount payable on demand could be the interest or the principal or both. In the case of a guarantee or security, the amount payable on demand could be a fee for the guarantee or security. 2.54 In the case of a loan with interest and principal repayable on demand, s HC 27(2)(b) could apply even if the interest rate is set at a market rate. 2.55 Where a person is a settlor under s HC 27(2)(b) there will be a “settlement” for the purposes of the trust rules (see definition of “settlement” in s YA 1). 2.56 Where the right to demand payment of an amount is deferred, the value transferred will be the product of the amount that could be demanded, the length of the deferral, and an appropriate rate of return. The whole amount of the payment will only be transferred if the right to demand payment of the amount is surrendered or lost. 20 UNCLASSIFIED 2.57 Section HC 27(2)(b) is the equivalent of s 226(2)(b) of the ITA 1976. The purpose of s 226(2)(b) was to respond to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re Marshall . Re Marshall concerned a situation where a person had lent an amount to a trust with interest payable on demand. The question was whether the failure by the person to demand the interest was a “disposition of property” in terms of para (d) of the definition of “disposition of property” in s 2 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. The court held that the right to make a demand for interest was a thing in action. The failure to make a demand did not result in a release, a discharge, a surrender, an abandonment, or a forfeiture of the thing in action. The thing in action was just not exercised. 2.58 The result in Re Marshall was that the failure to demand interest did not amount to a disposition of property, so was not a gift under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Parliament was concerned that this decision would be applied in the context of the income tax legislation and that an easy avenue would be available for transferring value to a trust without being treated as a settlor. Therefore, Parliament introduced s 226(2)(b) of the ITA 1976. 2.59 It is noted that s HC 27(2)(b) does not cover the provision of financial assistance generally. The provision of financial assistance is covered under the general definition of “settlor” in s HC 27(2)(a), based on the transfer of value concept. Determining whether a transfer or provision is made 2.60 The definition of “settlor” has two components in s HC 27(4) and (5) that help in determining whether a transfer or provision has been made. 2.61 Firstly, s HC 27(4) states that a person may make a transfer or provision directly or indirectly, by one transaction or a number of transactions, whether connected or otherwise. 2.62 For s HC 27(4) to apply to a person, the person must “make” the transfer or provision. This suggests that the person must have some influence or control over the transactions involved so that it can be said that the person causes the transfer or provision to occur. A conclusion that a person “makes” a transfer or provision indirectly or by a number of transactions is more likely to be reached where associated parties are involved. Example 5. The person must “make” the transfer or provision Peter makes an unconditional gift of $100 to Ed and Ed then gives the $100 to a trust. Peter does not have any control over what Ed does with the $100 and, therefore, does not cause the transfer to occur. Therefore, s HC 27(4) would not treat Peter as a settlor of the trust. If Peter gave the $100 to Ed as part of a plan or understanding that Ed would settle the amount on the trust, then Peter could be said to have “made” the transfer (by a number of transactions) and, therefore, will be treated as a settlor. Ed might also be treated as making the settlement for Peter as a nominee under s YB 21 (discussed further below), in which case, Peter would be treated as making the settlement. 2.63 Note also that a person may be a settlor if they transfer property to an entity owned by a trust. Value is effectively transferred to the trust in these circumstances because the value of the trust’s ownership of the entity will increase with the transfer of the property to the entity. This would be an indirect transfer of value. The trust receives a transfer of value indirectly 21 UNCLASSIFIED through its ownership of the entity, rather than receiving a direct transfer of value (s HC 27(4)). The transfer would also be a transfer “for the benefit of the trust” in terms of s HC 27(2)(a)(ii). 2.64 Secondly, s HC 27(5) provides that the fact that a person is or will become a beneficiary of a trust does not mean that they have given or received any value. 2.65 Section HC 27(5) is intended to forestall an argument that might otherwise be made about whether a person transfers value to a trust when the person provides money or money’s worth to a trustee. The argument being that the person, if they are or become a beneficiary of the trust, receives value by having a claim on the property that they settle on the trust; meaning that there is no transfer of value and, therefore, no settlement. Exceptions 2.66 As noted above, the definition of “settlor” has two exceptions that apply to: trusts for retirement benefits of employees (s HC 27(3)); and (a) contributions to foreign superannuation schemes (s HC 27(3C)). (b) Exception— trusts established to provide retirement benefits 2.67 Under s HC 27(3), a person will not be a settlor of a trust if: The person is a New Zealand resident; and (a) The person makes a settlement on a trust as an employer for the benefit (b) of one or more employees; and The trust is established or created mainly to provide retirement benefits to (c) natural persons (which if satisfied would also make the trust a “superannuation scheme”); and The trust is not a “foreign superannuation scheme” (which is a (d) superannuation scheme constituted outside New Zealand); and The trust is not a “superannuation fund” (one of a number of registered (e) schemes referred to in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013). 2.68 Further, under s HC 27(3C), a person will not be a settlor if they make a contribution to a trust that is a foreign superannuation scheme. 2.69 Therefore, s HC 27(3) applies to certain superannuation scheme trusts settled in New Zealand and s HC 27(3C) applies to contributions made to superannuation schemes settled outside New Zealand. 2.70 One situation in which s HC 27(3) will be relevant is where: there is an existing trust settlement which would have satisfied the (a) requirements of the exclusion in s HC 27(3); no settlor or trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand (ie, the settlor (b) has left New Zealand since settling the trust and the trustee is also non- resident); and 22 UNCLASSIFIED a New Zealand resident employer makes a further settlement on the trust (c) as an employer for the benefit of one or more employees. 2.71 In this situation, the effect of the exclusion is that the New Zealand resident employer would not be treated as a settlor of the trust as a result of the settlement. This would help to ensure that the trustee would not lose its exemption from income tax under s HC 25 and that the New Zealand resident employer would not be liable for the income tax payable by the trustee. Exception— contributions to foreign superannuation schemes 2.72 Under s HC 27(3C), a person who makes a contribution to a trust that is a foreign superannuation scheme is not a settlor of the trust. 2.73 As noted at \[2.67\](d), a “foreign superannuation scheme” means a superannuation scheme constituted outside New Zealand. These schemes are trusts in an offshore jurisdiction that are mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural person members. Treated as a settlor under s HC 28 2.74 In other situations, a person may be treated as a settlor of a trust under s HC 28: A person can be treated as a settlor of the trust, if they have a control (a) interest in a company that settles an amount on a trust. A person can be treated as a settlor of a sub-trust if they are the settlor of (b) a head trust and a trustee of the head trust settles an amount on the sub- trust. A person can be treated as a settlor of a trust if they have control over a (c) trustee or a settlor of the trust. A person can be treated as a settlor of a trust if s HC 28(2), an anti-(d) avoidance provision, applies. 2.75 These situations are discussed further below. Person who has a control interest in a company that settles an amount on a trust 2.76 Under s HC 28(3), a person is treated as a settlor of a trust if: a controlled foreign company (CFC) settles an amount on the trust; and (a) at the time of settlement the person has a control interest of 10% or more (b) in the CFC. 2.77 If the person has a control interest of 10% or more in the CFC at any time in the CFC’s accounting period, the person is treated as having a control interest of 10% or more for the whole of the CFC’s accounting period (s EX 1(3)). 2.78 CFCs and control interests are defined in subpart EX. Briefly, a CFC must be a foreign company. This means it must not be resident in New Zealand or treated as not being resident under a double tax agreement. A CFC must also be controlled by New Zealand residents. The ITA 2007 contains rules relating to 23 UNCLASSIFIED the type and extent of control required for a company to be a CFC. Rules also aggregate the control interests of associated persons. 2.79 Under s HC 28(4), the same treatment that applies under s HC 28(3) applies to a company that would have been a CFC at the date of settlement if it had been a foreign company at the time. 2.80 For ease of reference, in this part of the Interpretation Statement, a company described in either s HC 28(3) or (4) is referred to as a “controlled company”. 2.81 The objective of s HC 28(3) and (4) is to ensure that the trust rules will apply where a person uses a controlled company to establish a trust and then winds up the controlled company. The provisions recognise that where a controlled company is used to settle a trust, the controlled company is being used as a vehicle for the settlement. Therefore, it is appropriate to look through the controlled company to the real settlor. 2.82 This rule may be significant in determining whether the trust has a New Zealand resident settlor. Having a New Zealand resident settlor is significant for several reasons, as discussed later in this Interpretation Statement. For example, having a New Zealand resident settlor is relevant in determining whether a trustee is liable for tax on their worldwide income. 2.83 It is possible that more than one person could be treated as a settlor of a trust as a result of a settlement by a controlled company. This is because more than one person may have a control interest of 10% or more in the controlled company. 2.84 In addition, this settlor treatment can apply through multiple layers of controlled companies. A “person” that has a control interest of 10% or more in a controlled company might, itself, be a controlled company. Further, a “control interest” of a person includes direct and indirect control interests as calculated in subpart EX. Example 6. Settlor—multiple layers of controlled companies Jack has a direct control interest of 15% in Holdings Ltd, which is a controlled company. Holdings Ltd has a direct control interest of 100% in Operations Ltd. Operations Ltd settles an amount on a trust. Jack is treated as a settlor of the trust for two reasons. Firstly, Jack has an indirect control interest in Operations Ltd (via Holdings Ltd) of 15%, which is more than the 10% required to be a settlor under s HC 28(3). Secondly, Jack has a control interest in Holdings Ltd of 10% or more and Holdings Ltd is treated as having settled the trust that was settled by Operations Ltd (because it has a control interest in Operations Ltd of 10% or more). Operations Ltd (who made the actual settlement) and Holdings Ltd (who has a control interest of 10% or more in Operations Ltd) would also be treated as settlors. 2.85 In addition, the controlled company provisions can work in tandem with other parts of the settlor definition. For example, a settlement may be made by a nominee of a company with the result that the company is treated as a settlor. And if a person has a control interest of 10% or more in that company, they may also be treated as a settlor. Settlor of head-trust also settlor of sub-trust 2.86 Under s HC 28(5), a person is treated as a settlor of a trust (sub-trust) if: 24 UNCLASSIFIED the person is a settlor of a trust (head-trust); and (a) a trustee of the head-trust: (b) (i) settles an amount on the sub-trust; or (ii) makes a distribution to or on the terms of the sub-trust. 2.87 Note that “sub-trust” is a term used in s HC 28(5) of the ITA 2007. For taxation purposes this is a wider term than for trust law purposes. 2.88 Where s HC 28(5) applies the settlor of the head-trust will be treated as the settlor of the sub-trust. The trustee of the head-trust will also be a settlor of the sub-trust under s HC 27(2) (as the person who made the settlement or distribution). 2.89 A Taxation Amendment Bill (expected to be introduced in the near future) proposes an amendment to ensure a New Zealand resident trustee of a head trust is not treated as a settlor for a resettlement of an amount on, or a distribution to, a sub-trust if the head trust has no settlor resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement. The amendment is intended to have effect from Royal assent with a savings provision for positions already taken. 2.90 The purpose of s HC 28(5) is to treat a person as settlor if they use one trust as a vehicle to settle, or to make distributions to, another trust. It means that the sub-trust will continue to have a settlor (the settlor of the head trust) in existence even if the head trust is wound up. This is particularly relevant to the potential liability of a settlor for income tax payable by a trustee under s HC 29. 2.91 “Distribution” is defined in s HC 14. Generally, a trustee of a trust makes a distribution when the trustee transfers value to a person because the person is a beneficiary of the trust. 2.92 Section HC 28(5) can apply through multiple layers of trusts. In other words, s HC 28(5) can apply to a settlor of a head-trust who is treated as settlor of the head-trust by virtue of an earlier application of s HC 28(5). Example 7. Settlor–multiple layers of trusts If Gene settles the Original Trust and the trustee of the Original Trust settles the Next Generation Trust and the trustee of the Next Generation Trust settles the Deep Space Trust, then Gene will be treated as settlor of all three trusts. 2.93 Section HC 28(5) applies only if the settlement or distribution made by the trustee of the head trust was made on or after 1 April 1988. However, s HC 28(5) can apply to a person who is a settlor of the head trust, regardless of when that person became a settlor of the head trust, ie before or after 1 April 1988. Control over a trustee or a settlor 2.94 Under s HC 28(6), a person is treated as a settlor if: they acquire, directly or indirectly, rights or powers in relation to a trustee (a) or a settlor of a trust; and 25 UNCLASSIFIED the purpose or effect of that acquisition is to enable the person to require (b) the trustee to treat the person, or a nominee, as a beneficiary of the trust. 2.95 The word “acquire” is not defined in the ITA 2007. It is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York (2011)) as “come to possess (something)...”. This ordinary meaning is wide and suggests that a person could acquire something actively or passively. In addition, the words “directly or indirectly” following “acquire” support a wide interpretation of “acquire”. 2.96 A person could acquire rights or powers in relation to a trustee of a trust by obtaining ownership of a corporate trustee. This could allow the person to appoint themselves, or a person who will follow their instructions, as the sole director of the corporate trustee. A person could acquire rights or powers in relation to a settlor by acquiring the settlor (if it is a company, which could include the corporate trustee of another trust). 2.97 A person could also acquire rights or powers in relation to a trustee by being given the right to appoint and remove trustees. This is because the person could remove the trustees, appoint themselves (or an entity that they control) as trustee. If, as trustee, they had the power to appoint or remove beneficiaries, the effect of the acquisition would be to enable the person to require the trustee to treat the person, or a nominee, as a beneficiary of the trust. 2.98 A person could acquire rights or powers in relation to a trustee of a trust by being appointed as a protector of the trust. The powers that are conferred on a protector under the terms of a trust can vary from trust to trust. Whether those powers enable the person to require the trustee to treat the person, or a nominee, as a beneficiary of the trust will depend on the extent of the powers given to the person. Not all protectors will be affected. If, for example, the powers given to a protector are limited to approving major transactions then the appointment of the person as a protector would not result in the person being a settlor under s HC 28(6). 2.99 It is sufficient that the purpose or effect of the acquisition is to “enable” the person to require the trustee to treat the person, or a nominee, as a beneficiary of the trust. It is not necessary that the person uses the ability. 2.100 “Require” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as “v ...2 instruct or expect (someone) to do something.” 2.101 For s HC 28(6) to apply, the trustee referred to in para (b) would need to have or be given the discretion under the terms of the trust to treat a person as a beneficiary. If a person acquires rights or powers in relation to only one trustee and the approval of more than one trustee is necessary to treat a person as a beneficiary of the trust, then this requirement will not be met. 2.102 A person would be able to require a trustee to treat the person, or a nominee, as a beneficiary of the trust if they appointed themselves as the sole trustee, assuming that, as trustee, they had the required power. 2.103 Section HC 28(6) could apply to a person who is already a beneficiary. This is because the requirements of the section could be satisfied if the purpose or 26 UNCLASSIFIED effect of that acquisition is to enable the person to require the trustee to treat a nominee as a beneficiary of the trust. 2.104 The use of the phrase “purpose or effect” in s HC 28(6)(b) suggests an objective test. It is not necessary to show that the person has a subjective purpose or intention. The phrase “purpose or effect” in this context also suggests that the provision has an anti-avoidance nature. 2.105 Taking into account the above, s HC 28(6) could, if interpreted literally, apply in situations in which Parliament would not have intended, for example, where a professional advisor is given the right to appoint or remove trustees on the death of the previous right holder. Given this, and the apparent anti-avoidance nature of the provision, the Commissioner will take a purposive interpretation of s HC 28(6) to ensure that the provision does not apply in situations in which Parliament would not have intended. 2.106 The Commissioner will take into account the purpose of the provision and the circumstances of the acquisition of the rights or powers. 2.107 The purpose of s HC 28(6) is to treat a person as a settlor if they acquire rights or powers in relation to an existing trust. 2.108 The Commissioner will take into account the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the rights or powers, including: Any existing relationships between the person and the settlor, trustee, and (a) beneficiaries of the trust. The absence of such relationships may support the application of the provision. Whether consideration was provided by the person for the rights or powers (b) acquired. Whether the acquisition of the rights or powers by the person could have (c) been expected as an ordinary incident of the administration of the trust. Whether the person is in the business of providing trust administration (d) services. It might be that the appointment of such a person could be expected under the terms of the trust. 2.109 The 1989 Explanation stated that s HC 28(6) was intended to apply to situations where a person has “informal” rights or powers over a trustee or settlor of a trust. However, arguably this intention is not reflected in the wording of s HC 28(6). Nevertheless, even if s HC 28(6) does not apply in this situation, it may be that s HC 28(2) (an anti-avoidance provision, considered further below) will apply to treat the person as a settlor. 2.110 Note that the situation addressed by s HC 28(6) is different from the situation addressed in s YB 21 (the nominee settlor rule). A trust to which s HC 28(6) applies may have been settled on the original settlor’s own initiative. Nevertheless, the person to whom s HC 28(6) applies is effectively in the same position as if they had settled the trust directly. 27 UNCLASSIFIED Example 8. Control over a trustee A Hong Kong resident, Jenny, makes an initial settlement of $990,000 on the Dragon Trust, which is a discretionary trust. The trustee of the Dragon Trust, Dragon Co, is a company owned by Jenny. Dragon Co has the power to appoint and remove beneficiaries. Apart from the $990,000 of trust property, Dragon Co does not have any assets. A New Zealand resident, Steve, acquires Dragon Co for $1 million. Steve appoints himself as director of Dragon Co. There is no indication that Jenny settled the trust as a nominee for Steve. By acquiring Dragon Co and appointing himself as director, Steve has acquired rights or powers over the trustee that enables him to require Dragon Co to treat Steve, or his nominee, as a beneficiary of the Dragon Trust. This is an “effect” of the acquisition of the rights or powers. In addition, the fact that Steve paid $1 million to acquire Dragon Co, a company that does not have any assets of its own, suggests that the purpose of the acquisition was to enable him to require Dragon Co to appoint Steve, or his nominee, as a beneficiary of the Dragon Trust. In this example, Steve has not transferred any value to the Dragon Trust and in the absence of s HC 28(6) would not be treated as a settlor. Nevertheless, under s HC 28(6) Steve is treated as a settlor. Example 9. Acquiring rights under the terms of the trust The original settlor of the Mete Trust dies and triggers a provision in the trust deed passing on the power to appoint or remove trustees to Grace, the Trust’s lawyer. Under the trust deed the power to appoint or remove beneficiaries passes to the trustees. As a result, Grace has acquired rights or powers over the trustees of the Trust. The acquisition of these powers would enable Grace to remove the existing trustees and appoint herself as the sole trustee of the Trust. Grace could then appoint herself, or a nominee, as a beneficiary of the Trust. Grace may have no intention of doing this, but it is an effect of the acquisition that she could require the trustee to treat herself, or a nominee, as a beneficiary. Therefore, it might appear at first that s HC 28(6) would apply to treat Grace as a settlor of the Trust. However, taking into account the purpose of the provision and the circumstances of Grace’s acquisition of the right, it is considered that Parliament would not have intended s HC 28(6) to apply. Grace is in the business of providing trust administration services. The appointment of Grace could have been expected under the terms of the trust as an ordinary incident of the administration of the trust. The circumstances do not suggest that Grace was attempting to avoid settlor status by acquiring rights or powers in relation to an existing trust. Therefore, Grace would not be treated as a settlor in this situation. Anti-avoidance provision 2.111 Under s HC 28(2), a person is treated as a settlor if, in relation to a trust: they act, refrain from acting, or enter into a transaction or series of (a) transactions; and this has the effect of defeating the intent and application of the trust rules. (b) 2.112 This provision is an anti-avoidance rule to reinforce the definition of “settlor”. 2.113 Historically, the provision was intended to cover transactions of the type described in para (f) of the definition of “disposition of property” in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. However, it was also intended to cover actions and 28 UNCLASSIFIED transactions falling outside that definition as the definition of “disposition of property” in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 was seen as being defective. 2.114 Section HC 28(2) may apply to a unilateral action (or inaction) of a person. No requirement exists for there to be a transaction (which generally implies the existence of two parties). The section may also apply where a person has entered into a transaction or a series of transactions. 2.115 The intention of the person who acts, refrains from acting, or enters into a transaction or transactions is not relevant. The focus is on the effect of the action, inaction, transaction or series of transactions. 2.116 For s HC 28(2) to apply, the action, inaction, transaction or series of transactions must have the effect of defeating the intent and application of the trust rules. 2.117 One of the intentions of the trust rules is to treat any person who transfers value to a trust as a settlor. 2.118 As discussed above, one situation in which s HC 28(2) could potentially apply is in a situation where a person is not caught by s HC 28(6) because their rights or powers are “informal”. Example 10. Avoidance arrangement Ace Ltd is owned by Harriet and James, with each holding 100 shares. Harriet and James are also the directors of Ace Ltd. Harriet would like to transfer half of her ownership interest in Ace Ltd to Harry’s Trust, a trust of which she and her family are beneficiaries. However, Harriet would prefer not to become a settlor of the trust. At a shareholders meeting for Ace Ltd, Harriet proposes a resolution to issue 100 new shares to Harry’s Trust and 100 new shares to Jimmy’s Trust (a trust of which James and his family are beneficiaries), in each case for no consideration. James abstains from voting and the resolution is passed. James is indifferent to whether he or Jimmy’s Trust owns shares in Ace Co. After the issue of the new shares, Harriet and James’ interest in the company is diluted by 50% and valuable shares are now owned by Harry’s Trust and Jimmy’s Trust. This example is given to illustrate the application of s HC 28(2). It is difficult to imagine situations where s HC 28(2) would apply, where a person would not be treated as a settlor under a different part of the settlor definition. It is noted that Harriet and James would both be treated as settlors of the trusts under s HC 28(4) (shareholders in companies). Nevertheless, this example can be used to illustrate how s HC 28(2) would apply if not for s HC 28(4). If not for s HC 28(4), s HC 28(2) would apply. This is because: - Harriet has acted by proposing a resolution and voting in favour of it. James has refrained from acting by abstaining from the vote. - What has been done (or not done) would (if not for s HC 28(4)) have had the effect of defeating the intent and application of the trust rules. One of the intentions of the trust rules is to treat a person who transfers value to a trust as a settlor. The commercial and economic reality of what has been done, or not done, is that Harriet and James have each transferred value to the two trusts. In this example, Harriet arguably has a purpose of avoiding settlor status. James, on the other hand, may not be aware of the implications of the arrangement for the trust rules and may have no purpose of avoiding settlor status. Nevertheless, Harriet and James will both be treated as settlors of the trusts because s HC 28(2) involves an objective test that focuses on the purpose or effect of the action or inaction, not the subjective purpose of the party involved. 29 UNCLASSIFIED Nominee settlor 2.119 Although not located with the settlor definition, s YB 21 is relevant to the concept of settlor in the ITA 2007. Under s YB 21(1), if a person (person A) makes a settlement on a trust as a nominee for another person (person B), person B is treated as having made the settlement and person A is ignored. (However, as discussed from \[2.126\], person A may still have disclosure obligations in relation to the settlement.) 2.120 Person A settles an amount on a trust as a nominee for person B if person A does so “on behalf of” person B. However, if person A is a trustee, person A will be a nominee only if they are a bare trustee in relation to the amount (s YB 21(2)). 2.121 The nominee rule is extended to situations involving nominal (small) settlements. Under s YB 21(3), a person making a nominal settlement (eg, a settlement of $10) at the request of another person is treated for the purposes of the ITA 2007 as a nominee in relation to the settlement. The Commissioner is likely to regard a settlement worth less than $100 as a nominal settlement. 2.122 The objective of this provision is to ensure that persons acting as nominees are not treated as settlors. Often professional advisers or relatives will assist in establishing a trust by settling a nominal sum on trust on behalf of another person. In these circumstances it is not appropriate to expose the professional adviser or relative to a potential tax liability under s HC 29 (settlor liable for income tax liability of trustee). The professional adviser or relative is not the real settlor of the trust, but is in effect only an intermediary or facilitator. The real settlor is the person on whose behalf the professional adviser or relative acted in making the settlement. Therefore, s YB 21 treats the person for whom the nominee acted as the settlor rather than the nominee. 2.123 The nominal settlement rule applies only where the settlement was made at the request of another person. Therefore, if a person settles a nominal amount on trust on that person’s own initiative, they will not be a nominee. This is also implicit in the nominee concept generally. 2.124 Note that a direction or request to settle an amount on trust could be made directly or indirectly. Example 11. Settlement by a person’s lawyer—delegated A client of a law firm may ask their lawyer to establish a trust by making a settlement on their behalf. If the lawyer then delegated this request to a colleague, the colleague would be regarded as having settled the trust at the direction or request of the client. 2.125 Section YB 21 makes it clear that a person can be a settlor if they use nominees to establish trusts. Disclosure obligations on nominee settlor 2.126 As noted above, if a person (person A) settles an amount on a trust as a nominee for another person (person B), person B is treated as having settled the amount and person A is ignored. However, person A may still have disclosure obligations in relation to the settlement under s 59(2) of the TAA. A disclosure obligation will arise for a nominee settlor if at the time of the settlement: 30 UNCLASSIFIED they were resident in New Zealand; and (a) no trustee of the trust was resident in New Zealand. (b) 2.127 This will apply, for example, to a New Zealand resident advisor that settles a trust for a foreign client with a non-resident trustee. 2.128 If the obligation applies, the nominee settlor will be required to disclose: the fact of the settlement; (a) the name and address of the person who is deemed to be the settlor of the (b) trust under s YB 21; and such further details as the Commissioner may require and for which the (c) Commissioner has created the form Settlors of Trusts Disclosure IR 462 (January 2008), which requires further details such as the trust’s name, IRD number, and address, a full description of the nature and date of the settlement, and the names and addresses of the trustees and beneficiaries of the trust. 2.129 The disclosure must be made within 3 months of the date of each settlement. Minor beneficiary rule 2.130 The definition of “settlor” in s YA 1 is narrowed for the purposes of the exclusions from the minor beneficiary rules. The effect of this is to make it easier to fall within the exclusions to the minor beneficiary rule. The minor beneficiary rule is discussed further in Part 6 of this Interpretation Statement. Associated person rules 2.131 The definition of “settlor” in s YA 1 provides that for the purposes of ss YB 7 to YB 9 (which relate to associated persons), “settlor” has the meaning given to it in s HC 27 modified by s YB 10. 2.132 Section YB 10 provides that for the purposes of ss YB 7 to YB 9 a person will not become a settlor by providing services to a trust for less than market value. This is significant because it may mean the person is not associated with a trustee or a beneficiary of the trust under ss YB 7 to YB 9. 2.133 Section YB 10 applies to any person who provides services to a trust for less than market value. Notably, an example would be a professional advisor or trustee who provides services to a trust at no charge (or for less than market value). Resettlements 2.134 A resettlement occurs when the trustee of one trust makes a settlement of the trust’s property on a new trust. 2.135 A distinction should be made between the following two situations:  A resettlement that is made on behalf of a beneficiary that coincides with the trustee transferring an absolute interest in the property to the beneficiary. 31 UNCLASSIFIED  A resettlement that does not coincide with the trustee transferring an absolute interest in the property to the beneficiary, but which may give a beneficiary an interest in the property as a beneficiary of the new trust. 2.136 The first situation involves:  A “payment” made by the trustee to the beneficiary for the purposes of the definitions of “beneficiary income” and “distribution”. There is a “payment” because the trustee has transferred an absolute interest in the property to the beneficiary by dealing with the amount in their interest or on their behalf (see the definition of “pay” in s YA 1).  A settlement by the beneficiary on the new trust. Having transferred an absolute interest in the property to the beneficiary, the trustee is a bare trustee in relation to the property. This means that s YB 21 (transparency of nominees) can apply to the trustee. Because the trustee makes the settlement on behalf of and, therefore, as nominee for the beneficiary, the beneficiary is treated as the settlor of the trust under s YB 21(1). 2.137 Resettlements are discussed further in Part 8. This includes a discussion of the relationship between resettlements and corpus (and amounts excluded from corpus), trustee income, distributions, and the ordering rules. See also \[2.86\], which discusses s HC 28(5). 2.138 A resettlement of trust assets may constitute a disposal under s FC 1(1)(f) and, under s FC 2, these trust assets may be treated as being disposed of for market value. This may have implications for the settlor and the recipient trustees under other provisions in the legislation, for example, depreciation recovery income. These implications are outside the scope of this Interpretation Statement, but trustees should be aware of the potential implications. 32 UNCLASSIFIED Part 3 Trustees and beneficiaries Trustees 3.1 A trust is not a legal person for income tax purposes. The trustee as the legal owner of the trust property derives the income and is liable for the tax obligations of the trust in most situations, including as agent for the beneficiary’s tax obligations. 3.2 The ITA 2007 recognises that a trustee is a person with a capacity that is separate from the individual capacity of the person or entity that fills the role. “Trustee” is defined in s YA 1 to mean “the trustee only in the capacity as trustee of the trust” and includes all the persons who are trustees from time to time. If trustees change from time to time, the tax status of the trustee of that trust does not change. The same tax number is retained for each trust despite a change in trustees. 3.3 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 introduced a general rule from 29 March 2018 (with some exceptions) distinguishing between a trustee’s personal or body corporate capacity and their separate trustee capacity. This is reflected in the definitions of both “company” and “natural person” in s YA 1, which generally do not apply to trustees. However, the definitions of “company” and “natural person” remain relevant for the purposes of determining the residence of a company or natural person who is a trustee. In the TAA a “natural person” is defined in s 3 to not include a person in their capacity as a trustee (with some exceptions). 3.4 Under s HC 2 joint trustees are treated as a notional single person with each being jointly and severally liable for the tax obligations of the trustees to calculate and return income. Trustees are also jointly and severally liable for tax as agent on beneficiary income and taxable distributions. This liability will cease for a person from the date that the person ceases to be a trustee, eg if they resign (note that different rules apply for GST purposes under s 57(3B) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985). The Commissioner recommends that trustees advise of any retirements or resignations as soon as possible to make sure that Inland Revenue records are kept up to date. 3.5 Based on trust law a trustee is treated as liable up to the date of resignation. In practice, as endorsed in Case 5/2013 \[2013\] NZTRA 05, (2013) 26 NZTC 2-004, the Commissioner will generally hold a trustee liable to the end of the tax period prior to resignation because that is the last period in which the trustee had any control over the tax position taken. This will be the case unless the features of a particular situation require an alternative approach. 3.6 The trustee definition also extends to the role of executors and administrators of deceased estates for tax administration purposes. While an estate is not a trust at common law, there are specific rules in subpart HC that apply to estates. For detail on deceased estates, see Part 9 of this Interpretation Statement. 3.7 A trustee’s tax obligation is described in s HC 24 as being a requirement to satisfy the liability for taxable income “as if they were an individual beneficially entitled to the trustee income”. As a consequence, it makes no difference to the tax treatment if a trustee is a company, another type of entity or an individual. 33 UNCLASSIFIED The rate of tax on trustee income is the same and set at 33% for most trusts that are not in special categories. 3.8 Because s HC 24 treats a trustee as liable for tax like an individual, subpart CV (Income specific to certain entities) deals only with the income treatment of a trustee in a few special situations. There is now no specific charging provision for the New Zealand-sourced and foreign-sourced income of trustees as there once was. In contrast, subpart CV specifically lists the amounts derived from a trust that will be included as income. 3.9 New Zealand-sourced income derived by a trustee is always subject to tax in New Zealand. However, there is special treatment for foreign-sourced amounts. The rules determining whether foreign-sourced amounts are taxable in New Zealand are complex, and depend on a number of factors. In summary, however: Foreign-sourced amounts derived by a non-resident trustee will generally (a) be taxed in New Zealand if a settlor is resident in New Zealand (other than a transitional resident) at any time during that income year. Foreign-sourced amounts derived by a resident trustee will generally not (b) be taxed in New Zealand if no settlor is resident in New Zealand (other than a transitional resident) at any time during the income year in which that amount was derived. For detail on trustee income, see Part 7 of this Interpretation Statement. 3.10 With regard to passive income, for example, interest and dividends that have a New Zealand source, taxation is based on the residence of the trustee (based on a notional single person). If the trustee is non-resident, and so derives non- resident passive income as defined in s RF 2, non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) will be payable on the amount. In contrast, unless an exemption certificate is held, resident withholding tax (RWT) is deducted from passive income paid to resident trustees. 3.11 New Zealand does not determine the tax residency of a trust based on the tax residence of its trustees as some countries do such as the United Kingdom. However, as discussed above, the residence of the trustee is relevant in a number of situations, in particular for compliance and enforcement. The residence of the trustee is determined under the rule in s YD 1 for natural persons and under s YD 2 for companies. When a trust has co-trustees, the trustees are treated as a notional single person under s HC 2. Where one of the trustees is resident, then all of the co-trustees as the notional single person under s HC 2 are resident in that capacity. If all of the co-trustees (or a single trustee if there is only one) are non-resident, then the notional single person under s HC 2 will be non-resident. 3.12 These results are supported by the definition of “non-resident” in s YA 1 which means a person who is not a New Zealand resident. This means that if one or more of the trustees is a resident the ‘non-resident’ test is failed. The corollary is that if all of the trustees (or the single trustee if there is only one) are non- resident then the test is satisfied. Some support for this approach to determining the residency of the notional single person is also obtained from the joint and several liability of trustees. A resident trustee whose co-trustees are non-resident will be severally liable for the tax obligations of the notional single 34 UNCLASSIFIED person. That is consistent with the liability of the notional single person having a link to the New Zealand residency of any of the trustees for enforcement purposes. 3.13 In a practical sense, if trustees have mixed residency, the filing and return obligations will typically fall on the resident trustee(s). If all the trustees are non-resident, a tax agent in New Zealand would usually attend to the obligations for a complying trust. 3.14 Trustees are included in the parties treated as associated persons in several relationships under subpart YB. Other provisions in the ITA 2007 can then treat such associated persons as aggregated parties or as having common interests to prevent possible manipulation of taxing transactions between or using related parties. More details on associated person rules and their impact on trusts are in Part 12 of this Interpretation Statement. Beneficiaries 3.15 Beneficiaries are the objects of a trust. The trust property is held for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The term “beneficiary” is not defined in the ITA 2007 except for the purposes of s DX 1, which deals with only testamentary annuities. However, s YA 1 defines “beneficial interest” for tax purposes and this “includes an interest that is contingent, discretionary or unvested”. Section YA 1 also defines “beneficiary income”, which simply refers to the relevant provision s HC 6. This is discussed in Part 5 of this Interpretation Statement. 3.16 The entitlements of beneficiaries stem from the terms of the trust deed, or functional equivalent document, and the exercise of discretions by the trustees. As a result, the nature of a beneficiary’s interest in trust property varies accordingly. 3.17 The trust rules impact on a person who is a beneficiary when they derive beneficiary income or receive a distribution from a trust. Beneficiary income is defined in s YA 1 by reference to its meaning in s HC 6 and then classified as income of the beneficiary under s CV 13(a). Distributions to beneficiaries may be taxable depending on the category of trust they are received from and the makeup of the distribution. The tax impact on beneficiaries is discussed in Part 5, Part 6 and Part 8 of this Interpretation Statement. 3.18 Beneficiaries are treated as associated persons of trustees and settlors if they have benefited or are eligible to benefit under a trust. This includes any person named as a beneficiary as well as discretionary beneficiaries both named and within a class. A person who could become a beneficiary by the exercise of a power of appointment is not treated as one until the power is exercised. For the detail on how a beneficiary is treated under the associated person rules, see Part 12 of this Interpretation Statement. 35 UNCLASSIFIED Part 4 Income derived by trustees Introduction 4.1 The trust rules are largely concerned with the taxation of “income” derived by trustees. They determine whether the income is “trustee income” or “beneficiary income” for the purposes of determining tax liabilities. 4.2 The concepts of “beneficiary income” and “trustee income” are discussed in Part 5 and Part 7 of this Interpretation Statement respectively. 4.3 However, generally, before an amount can be beneficiary income or trustee income, it must first be “income derived by a trustee”. This part makes several preliminary points about the requirement for there to be “income derived by a trustee”. “Income derived by a trustee” compared with “trustee income” 4.4 It is important to remember that the concept of “income derived by a trustee” is not the same as the concept of “trustee income” used in the trust rules. Generally, “trustee income” is income derived by a trustee that is not beneficiary income. “Income” is a gross concept 4.5 “Income” means an amount that is income under a provision in part C (see the definition of “income” in ss YA 1 and BD 1(1)). Being defined as “income under a provision in part C” means “income” is a gross concept and does not take into account any deductions that may be claimed in the calculation of “net income”. The ability to claim deductions is discussed further in Part 7, which discusses “trustee income”. Income includes deemed income 4.6 Income also includes amounts that are treated as income under a provision in part C, whether or not the amounts are treated as income under trust law (sometimes referred to as “deemed income”). For a fuller explanation of deemed income, see “IS 12/02: Income Tax – Whether Income Deemed to Arise Under Tax Law, But Not Trust Law, Can Give Rise to Beneficiary Income”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 49. Dual derivation 4.7 In a sense, an amount of income derived by a trustee that is vested in or paid to a beneficiary as beneficiary income is derived twice: firstly, by the trustee, and secondly, by the beneficiary. However, the income is taxed only once (ie, to the beneficiary). “Beneficiary income” is included in the beneficiary’s “income” for the purposes of calculating their net income (s CV 13(a)). The income derived by the trustee that is beneficiary income is not included in the trustee’s “income” for the purposes of calculating the trustee’s net income. Only income that is “trustee income” is included for this purpose. 4.8 In contrast, where a foreign trust or non-complying trust makes a taxable distribution to a beneficiary (eg, a distribution of prior years’ income), this 36 UNCLASSIFIED income may be taxed twice, once to the trustee and then again to the beneficiary. 37 UNCLASSIFIED Part 5 Beneficiary income Introduction 5.1 As noted above, income derived by a trustee is either “beneficiary income” or “trustee income”. 5.2 Income derived by a trustee is “beneficiary income” if the requirements in s HC 6 (Beneficiary income) are satisfied; otherwise, the income will be “trustee income”. 5.3 Beneficiary income is included in the income of the beneficiary and, if assessable, will be subject to tax at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. An exception to this is beneficiary income to which the minor beneficiary rule applies. Income subject to the minor beneficiary rule is treated as trustee income for the purposes of determining the rate of tax that applies. The trustee income tax rate is set out in sch 1 of the ITA 2007 and is currently 33%. The minor beneficiary rule is discussed in Part 6 of this Interpretation Statement. 5.4 Generally, the obligation to satisfy the income tax liability on beneficiary income is on the trustee acting as agent for the beneficiary (see from \[13.69\]). Definition of “beneficiary income” 5.5 “Beneficiary income” is defined in s HC 6 as “income” derived in an income year by a trustee to the extent to which it: “vests absolutely in interest” in a beneficiary of the trust in the income (a) year; or is “paid” to a beneficiary in the income year or within the extended time (b) period described in s HC 6(1B). 5.6 “Beneficiary income” also includes an RWT substitution payment made under s RE 2(7) (discussed further from \[13.48\]). 5.7 However, “beneficiary income” does not include: income derived by a trustee of a trust that is a superannuation fund; or (a) income derived by a trustee to which ss CC 3(2) and EW 50 apply (these (b) sections relate to income that may arise under the financial arrangement rules where debt owed by a trustee of a trust is forgiven). These amounts are treated as trustee income. 5.8 Also, an amount treated as trustee income under s HC 7(3) cannot be treated as beneficiary income, despite being income of the trustee under s CV 13(b) (see \[7.5\] and \[7.6\] for further explanation of this rule). 5.9 The following topics and elements of the definition of “beneficiary income” are discussed further below: the need for there to be income derived by a trustee first for there to be (a) beneficiary income (from \[5.11\]); 38 UNCLASSIFIED general comments on vesting and paying amounts (from \[5.15\]); (b) what “vesting absolutely in interest” means (from \[5.20\]); (c) what “paid to” a beneficiary means (from \[5.28\]); and (d) the extended time period for payment in s HC 6(1B) (from \[5.47\]). (e) 5.10 This is followed (from \[5.53\]) by a brief discussion of s GB 22, an anti-avoidance provision that deals with situations where a trustee enters into an arrangement to defeat the intent and application of the rules relating to beneficiary income and taxable distributions. Income derived by a trustee 5.11 For there to be “beneficiary income” there must first be an amount of “income” derived by a trustee. “Income” means an amount that is income under a provision in part C (see the definition of “income” in ss YA 1 and BD 1(1)). Therefore, if a trustee derives an amount from the sale of a rental property, for example, and the amount is not income under part C, then the amount cannot be beneficiary income if vested in or paid to a beneficiary. 5.12 As noted above at \[4.5\], income is a gross concept. When a trustee distributes income to a beneficiary they are distributing gross income derived by the trustee. With some trusts, the amount of income that can be distributed by a trustee is limited by the terms of the trust to an amount equal to the net income (income less expenditure) of the trust. However, if it is permitted by the terms of a trust, a trustee could distribute all of the income (gross income) derived by the trustee to a beneficiary. This would mean that, if the trustee incurred any expenditure, the trustee would have to pay for the expenditure out of previous years’ income, capital funds or corpus. It could also lead to the trustee making a net loss for the income year (see \[7.21\] for further discussion on losses). 5.13 If an amount of income derived by a trustee is of a particular character in the hands of the trustee (eg, interest income), the income will retain this character in the hands of the beneficiary when the amount becomes beneficiary income. The character of the income could be significant in some situations. For example, if a trustee pays interest income to a non-resident beneficiary, the payment will be characterised as a payment of interest, and the trustee may be required to withhold NRWT from the payment (see \[13.56\] for more information on the NRWT withholding obligations of trustees). 5.14 Similarly, if an amount of income derived by a trustee has a source in New Zealand, the income will have the same source in the hands of the beneficiary when the amount becomes beneficiary income (s YD 4(13)). This may determine whether the beneficiary income will be assessable income for the beneficiary. General comments on vesting and paying amounts 5.15 In order to be a valid distribution, an amount must be vested or paid in accordance with the terms of the trust. The terms of the trust will dictate what can be distributed to each beneficiary. Subject to this, the following principles need to be taken into account. 39 UNCLASSIFIED 5.16 The amount that is vested in or paid to the beneficiary can take the form of money or money’s worth. For example, a trustee could derive income in the form of cash sales, but vest or pay that income in or to the beneficiary by transferring assets of an equivalent value to the beneficiary (provided it is clear that the distribution is of the income derived by the trust). However, the distribution of the assets might give rise to further income tax consequences for the trustee (eg, income on the disposal of revenue account property). 5.17 The exact amount that is vested in or paid to a person does not need to be specified at the time of vesting or payment, as long as the amount can be calculated when the assessment of income is made for the income year. For example, the trust deed, or a resolution by the trustee during an income year, may state that two-thirds of the income derived by the trustee in the income year is allocated to a particular beneficiary. When the income derived by the trustee for the year is known it will be possible to calculate the amount and make an assessment of the trustee and beneficiary income for the income year (Davidson v CIR \[1976\] 2 NZLR 705 (SC) at 713). 5.18 Where an amount is future property or an expectancy, the vesting or payment of the amount will not be effective until the amount is received or receivable (Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,155 (HC)). 5.19 The language used to vest or pay an amount varies. An amount could be “vested in” or “paid to” a beneficiary without using those words. What is important is that the words used have the effect of vesting or paying. For example, a trustee resolution could vest an amount in a beneficiary by resolving that income derived by the trustee is allocated to the beneficiary. Vesting absolutely in interest 5.20 As noted above, income derived by a trustee in an income year will be beneficiary income to the extent to which it “vests absolutely in interest” in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year. 5.21 An amount may vest in a beneficiary as a result of a clause in a trust deed or as a result of the exercise of a discretion given to a trustee to allocate an amount to a beneficiary. 5.22 An amount will vest in a beneficiary for the purposes of the “beneficiary income” definition only if the beneficiary is given an indefeasible right to the amount (CT v Johnson and Maeder \[1946\] NZLR 446 (SC)). Vesting an amount in a beneficiary means the trustee cannot later change their mind and decide not to give the amount to the beneficiary. On vesting, the beneficiary obtains an absolute interest in the amount. 5.23 Vesting “in interest” means that the right given to the beneficiary can be a right to present or future possession of the amount. In other words, an amount can be vested in interest even if the beneficiary is not entitled to possession of the amount until a future date. 5.24 Even if there is a right to present possession, the trustee may hold the amount until the beneficiary demands it. There is no longer any requirement for the amount to be placed beyond the possession and control of the trustee. See the 1989 Explanation at Part 5, for more historical detail on changes in this area when the current regime was introduced. 40 UNCLASSIFIED 5.25 The vesting cannot be subject to a condition being met or to an event occurring. Example 12. Vesting in interest—not conditional A trustee might allocate an amount of income to an 8 year old beneficiary with a right to possess the amount in 10 years, when the beneficiary would be aged 18. The amount would be vested in interest as the beneficiary has immediately received an indefeasible right to the amount, despite not having a right to possess the amount. After making the allocation, the trustee could not change their mind about giving the income to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary died before reaching 18, the income would become part of the beneficiary’s estate and would not revert to the trust. Example 13. No vesting—conditional allocation A resolution by a trustee that an amount of income will be allocated to a beneficiary if they reach the age of 18 will not vest that amount of income in the beneficiary unless and until that condition is satisfied. The resolution, as worded, is conditional on the beneficiary reaching the age of 18. If the beneficiary died before reaching the age of 18, the condition in the resolution would not be met and the amount would remain trust property. In that case, the income will be trustee income in the year it is derived. Example 12differs from this example in that the allocation of the income to the beneficiary is not conditional on the beneficiary reaching the age of 18. If the beneficiary referred to in Example 12 died before reaching 18, the income would become part of the beneficiary’s estate and would not revert to the trust. 5.26 The word “absolutely” reinforces the indefeasible nature of the vesting and the fact that the vesting results in the beneficiary receiving the beneficial ownership of the amount. 5.27 The phrase “vests absolutely in interest” is discussed in more detail in “IS 12/02: Income Tax — Whether Income Deemed to Arise Under Tax Law, But Not Trust Law, Can Give Rise to Beneficiary Income”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 49. Paid to a beneficiary 5.28 The definition of “beneficiary income” was rewritten with the introduction of the ITA 2007. The rewrite particularly affected the payment paragraph in the definition. 5.29 Prior to the introduction of the ITA 2007, the definition of “beneficiary income” referred to income derived by a trustee to the extent to which the trustee “pays or applies” the income to or “for the benefit of” the beneficiary. Also, the earlier legislation did not define “pay” for the purposes of the definition of “beneficiary income”. 5.30 The definition of “beneficiary income” in the ITA 2007 now refers to income derived by a trustee during an income year to the extent that it is “paid to” a beneficiary. Also, the definition of “pay” in the ITA 2007 has been extended to apply for the purposes of the definition of “beneficiary income” (it now applies for the purposes of the IA 2007 generally). The definition of “pay” states that, for an amount and a person, to “pay” includes to: distribute the amount to the person; (a) credit the person for the amount; or (b) 41 UNCLASSIFIED deal with the amount in the person’s interest or on their behalf in some (c) other way. 5.31 The definition of “pay” in the ITA 2007 includes grammatically associated terms such as “pays”, “paid” and “payment”. The definition expands the ordinary meaning to include situations where amounts are distributed, credited or dealt with in some way. 5.32 This rewording of the definition of “beneficiary income” was not intended to change the meaning of “beneficiary income”; rather, the change was intended to simplify the definition by relying on the definition of “pay” in s YA 1. 5.33 Because there was no intended change in the meaning of beneficiary income, cases dealing with the previous definition are still relevant. 5.34 Although the definition of “beneficiary income” suggests that the income must be paid “to” the beneficiary, the extended definition of “pay” means that the test is satisfied if the income is dealt with in the beneficiary’s interest or on their behalf in some other way. Although this is largely dependent on the facts of each case, in general terms a transaction will be in the interest of a beneficiary if it improves the material situation of the beneficiary (Re Pilkington’s Will Trusts \[1964\] AC 612 (HL); CIR v Simpson (1989) 11 NZTC 6,140 (CA) at 6,144). 5.35 An amount is dealt with in a minor beneficiary’s interest and, therefore, “paid” to the beneficiary, if it is transferred to the beneficiary’s parents or guardians for expenditure on behalf of the beneficiary. This will be a distribution to the beneficiary, and not to the parent or guardian. Receipt of the income by the parent or guardian is sufficient to discharge the trustee’s obligations, and the trustee does not have to ensure the parent or guardian pays the income to the beneficiary or uses it to maintain and support them. However, distributions to minors may be subject to the minor beneficiary rule, in which case they will be taxed at the trustee tax rate. 5.36 An amount is dealt with on the beneficiary’s behalf, and, therefore, “paid” to the beneficiary, if the trustee makes a payment of income to a person other than the beneficiary that discharges the beneficiary’s obligation. In Re Clore’s Settlement Trusts \[1966\] 2 All ER 272 (Ch), the court rejected a submission that a payment to a person other than the beneficiary was for the benefit of the beneficiary only if there was a direct benefit to the beneficiary. Instead, the court held (at 274) that there was a benefit to the beneficiary if the payment resulted in “the discharge ... of certain moral, or social, obligations on the part of the beneficiary, for example towards dependants”. Therefore, in some situations, a payment by a trustee to a dependant of a beneficiary that discharges an obligation of the beneficiary to the dependant may be treated as a payment to the beneficiary. 5.37 A payment of an amount of income does not require possession of the amount to be transferred to the beneficiary. The trustee can “pay” an amount to a beneficiary by giving the beneficiary an absolute indefeasible interest in the amount, even if the trustee retains possession of the amount. In this regard, the definition of “pay” and “vest absolutely in interest” overlap significantly. 5.38 In CIR v Ward \[1970\] NZLR 1, the Court of Appeal considered s 155 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. This provision was a forerunner of various trust taxation provisions in the ITA 2007, including s HC 6. It dealt with the taxation 42 UNCLASSIFIED of trustee income that was also income derived by a beneficiary entitled in possession to the receipt of the income. The question in Ward was whether a resolution by a trustee that a certain amount of income be held for the credit of particular beneficiaries was a “payment or an application” of the income to or for the benefit of the beneficiaries in terms of s 155 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. 5.39 Under the trust deed the trustee held the trust property, including any income arising from it, on trust for the children of Mr and Mrs Ward. A child would become entitled to a share of the trust property provided that they reached the age of 21 years. The trust deed provided that if any such child dies before the trust property is distributed and the child leaves behind children of their own those children would take the interests that their parent would have taken. The trust deed also allowed the trustee to make a payment of the trust property to any of the children entitled under the trust notwithstanding that the children may not have reached the age of 21 years. The resolution in question was consistent with this later ability. 5.40 The court held that the resolution was an effective application of the income because it resulted in the income becoming the absolute property of the children. Having the absolute property meant that if one of the children had died, the income distributed to the child would have become part of the child’s estate, even if they died before reaching the age of 21 years. That is, the children’s interests in the income was no longer contingent on them reaching the age of 21 years. 5.41 Ward demonstrates that a resolution by a trustee that results in the income becoming the absolute property of a beneficiary is sufficient for the income to be “applied” to the beneficiary. It is not necessary for the resolution to be reflected in the books of the trust in the relevant time period, nor is it necessary for possession of the amount to be immediately transferred to the beneficiary. Also, it is not necessary that the income be separated from the trust fund (eg, be paid into a separate bank account). 5.42 The making of a loan to a beneficiary will not constitute a payment for the purposes of the beneficiary income definition. This is because the beneficiary has an obligation to repay the loan amount. This is the case even if the loan is repayable on demand. Although a loan itself will not give rise to “beneficiary income”, consideration should be given to whether the financial arrangements rules apply to the loan. 5.43 The court in Ward focused on the word “applied” rather than “paid”. However, in CIR v Albany Food Warehouse (2009) 24 NZTC 23,532 (HC) a decision similar to that in Ward was reached on the word “paid”. In that case, the High Court held that a resolution by the directors of a company declaring a dividend was sufficient to result in a dividend being “paid” within the extended definition of “paid” (being essentially the same as the definition of “pay” that applies for the purposes of s HC 6). 5.44 The decision in Albany Food Warehouse on the meaning of “paid” suggests that the decision in Ward, which focused on the word “applied”, is still good authority. This is despite the removal of the word “applied” from the phrase “paid or applied” in the definition of “beneficiary income”. 43 UNCLASSIFIED 5.45 Where a beneficiary has a discretionary interest in income, and not a vested or fixed interest, it is necessary for the trustee to pass a resolution that initiates the making of a payment of income to that beneficiary. In Montgomerie v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1965\] NZLR 951 the Supreme Court (now the High Court) found income was not applied where there was merely an entry in the trust account crediting amounts to beneficiaries and no resolution. The Court in Ward confirmed that it is the resolution which is the trigger for application of income not the book entries as these merely record earlier decisions of the trustees. 5.46 A record of a trustee resolution can be prepared after trustees have made a decision. However, such a record cannot be used as a means of backdating such a decision. See for example Re Samarang Developments Limited (in liquidation); alt cit Walker v Campbell (unreported HC, Christchurch, CIV 2003- 409-2094, 30 September 2004, John Hansen J) where the court would not give effect to attempts to back date dividend resolutions and confirmed that any dividend would not arise until the actual date of the resolution. The extended time period for payment in s HC 6(1B) 5.47 Income derived by a trustee during an income year will be taxed as beneficiary income if it is paid to the beneficiary within the extended time period described in s HC 6(1B) (if the trust deed permits). 5.48 The extended time period is the later of: 6 months following the end of the income year in which the trustee derived (a) the income (s HC 6(1B)(a)); and the earlier of: (b) (i) the date on which the trustee files the return of income for the income year (s HC 6(1B)(b)(i)); and (ii) the date by which the trustee is required to file a return of income for the income year under s 37 of the TAA (s HC 6(1B)(b)(ii)). 5.49 The date by which the trustee is required to file a return may vary. Most trustees with tax agents have a return filing extension until 31 March in the following year. Trustees who do not have tax agents may also apply for an extension of time. For trustees without an extension, the extended time period will likely be 6 months following the end of the income year because the standard time for filing returns is shorter (just over 3 months). 5.50 This extended time period enables the trustee to calculate the income derived by the trustee for the relevant year before paying any income to a beneficiary. This is especially relevant for trustees who receive farming income or are trading trusts that may be unable to calculate the amount of income available for distribution to the beneficiaries until after the end of the income year. 5.51 Beneficiary income that is paid to a beneficiary within the extended time period is treated as being derived by the beneficiary in the same tax year as that corresponding to the trustee’s income year. This may be a different income year than the income year in which the beneficiary is paid the amount. 44 UNCLASSIFIED 5.52 It is the Commissioner’s view that a beneficiary paid in the extended period must exist as a beneficiary in the income year preceding the extended period. The purpose of the extended period is to provide trustees with additional time to finalise the trust’s financial statements for an income year before making payments of income to the beneficiaries. Section GB 22—anti-avoidance 5.53 A specific anti-avoidance provision is included in s GB 22 to deal with situations where a trustee enters into an arrangement to defeat the intent and application of the rules relating to beneficiary income and taxable distributions. Section GB 22 applies where: an arrangement exists that involves a trustee transferring property or (a) providing services or other benefits to a person other than a beneficiary of the trust; the arrangement has the effect of defeating the intent and application of (b) ss HC 17 to HC 23 (which deal with the tax consequences arising from a receipt of beneficiary income or taxable distributions by a beneficiary); and the trust is not a Maori authority. (c) 5.54 If s GB 22 applies, the beneficiary of the trust is treated as receiving the property or enjoying the services or benefits provided to the other person for the purposes of ss HC 17 to HC 23 and will be taxed accordingly. 5.55 Section GB 22 is intended to limit opportunities for distributions to be made tax- free to a person who is not a beneficiary of the trust where a beneficiary of the trust benefits from the distribution. In many cases, these types of transactions will be treated as beneficiary income or a distribution to the beneficiary anyway. This is because of the broad definition of “pay”, which includes dealing with an amount in a person’s interests or on their behalf. Therefore, s GB 22 effectively operates to buttress the “beneficiary income” and “distribution” definitions in situations where a transaction may not technically be a “transfer of value” or a “payment” to the beneficiary, but where the beneficiary still benefits from the transaction. 5.56 Section GB 22 is also relevant to taxable distributions (discussed from \[8.62\]). 45 UNCLASSIFIED Part 6 Minor beneficiary rule Source of content for this part 6.1 The minor beneficiary rule was discussed when it was enacted in “Taxing Beneficiary Income of Minors at 33% – the ‘Minor Beneficiary Rule’”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001): 28. This part of this Interpretation Statement draws from that commentary and also includes additional analysis and clarification. Purpose 6.2 The purpose of the minor beneficiary rule is to limit the tax benefits that could otherwise be achieved by distributing the income of a trust to a minor beneficiary. This tax benefit could arise because of the different tax rates that may apply to trustee income, minor beneficiaries and other beneficiaries. The trustee tax rate is 33%. A minor beneficiary is likely to be on the lowest marginal tax rate of 10.5%. Other natural person beneficiaries may be on marginal tax rates of up to 33%. 6.3 The rule addresses the concern that a family with a trust could gain a tax advantage over a family without a trust by using the income of a trust to meet the family expenses. Beneficiary income of a minor is treated as excluded income of the minor 6.4 Where the minor beneficiary rule applies, beneficiary income derived by a minor is treated as excluded income of the minor under s CX 58. This means that no income tax liability will arise in the minor’s name. Treated as trustee income 6.5 Instead, the trustee will be liable to pay the tax at the trustee tax rate (33%). The trustee will also be liable to include the beneficiary income in their income tax return. This is achieved in s HC 35(2)(b) by treating the beneficiary income derived by a minor beneficiary as if it were trustee income for the purposes of: determining the tax rate that will apply (ie, the trustee tax rate of 33%); (a) paying the tax; and (b) providing returns of income. (c) 6.6 This means the income must be included in the trustee’s income for provisional tax purposes along with other trustee income. Also, use of money interest may apply on underpayments by a trustee. Penalties may also apply (eg, late payment penalties). 6.7 For the purposes of debiting and crediting a beneficiary’s account with a trust, a trustee may treat income tax paid by the trustee as paid on behalf of the beneficiary. That the trustee has to return and pay the tax does not change the fact the tax is on the beneficiary income derived by the beneficiary. 46 UNCLASSIFIED Example 14. Tax treated as paid on behalf of beneficiary A trustee distributes $2,000 to a minor beneficiary and pays tax of $660 on that distribution as if it were trustee income. T he beneficiary would have a credit of $1,340 in their account with the trust. The beneficiary could not demand payment of the whole $2,000 on the basis that the liability to pay tax was on the trustee. 6.8 If a trustee of a foreign trust distributes foreign-sourced amounts to a minor (defined as, a New Zealand resident) as beneficiary income and the minor beneficiary rule applies, the beneficiary income will be treated as if it were trustee income only for the purposes of determining the tax rate, paying the tax, and providing returns. These purposes do not include characterising income as non-residents’ foreign-sourced amounts under s BD 1 or exempt income under s CW 54. The income is still income (albeit excluded income) of a New Zealand resident minor and is taxable in New Zealand. Therefore, a trustee of a foreign trust will be liable to pay tax on the beneficiary income. Imputation credits and foreign dividend payment credits 6.9 As noted above, an amount of beneficiary income to which the minor beneficiary rule applies is treated as if it was trustee income for the purposes of paying tax on that income. This means, in the case of dividend income distributed by a trustee to a beneficiary, the dividend will be included in the trustee’s assessable income. The trustee will then be able to use any imputation credits that are attached to the dividend (ss LE 1 and LE 4). 6.10 The trustee is also treated as deriving the minor’s beneficiary income as a beneficiary to the extent that s HC 7(2) applies (s LE 4). This is important for the calculation under s LE 5 of the imputation credits of beneficiaries of the trust. 6.11 Similar rules apply in relation to foreign dividend payment credits under ss LF 1 to LF 3. Definition of “minor” 6.12 The minor beneficiary rule applies where a person who is a “minor” derives an amount of beneficiary income from a trust. A “minor” is defined in s HC 35(3) as a person who is: a natural person; and (a) on the trust’s balance date for the income year, is; (b) (i) a New Zealand resident; and (ii) under the age of 16. 6.13 If the person does not possess all three of the above characteristics, the minor beneficiary rule will not apply. Exclusions 6.14 There are three types of exclusion to the minor beneficiary rule: a $1,000 de minimis exclusion in s HC 35(4)(a); (a) 47 UNCLASSIFIED exclusions relating to income derived from particular sources (b) (s HC 35(4)(b)(iii) to (v)); and exclusions based on settlements on a trust (ss HC 36 and HC 37). (c) A $1,000 or less de minimis exclusion 6.15 A de minimis rule is provided in s HC 35(4)(a). This section provides that the minor beneficiary rule does not apply to an amount of beneficiary income derived by a minor from a trust in an income year if the total amount of beneficiary income derived by the minor from the trust in the income year is $1,000 or less. The minor’s marginal tax rate will apply instead. 6.16 If the total is more than $1,000, no amount of beneficiary income is excluded under the de minimis rule. In other words, the rule does not provide an exclusion for the first $1,000 derived by the beneficiary. 6.17 This exclusion applies on a per trust basis. This means the exception may still apply to a distribution if the beneficiary derives beneficiary income from multiple trusts that in total exceed $1,000 in the income year. There is no express limit on the number of trusts that can make distributions of $1,000 or less to the same minor beneficiary and still benefit from the s HC 35(4)(a) exclusion. However, where the use of multiple trusts has the effect of producing a greater than $1,000 exemption for a minor beneficiary, the Commissioner might consider the application of the general anti-avoidance rule in s BG 1. Income derived from particular sources 6.18 The minor beneficiary rule does not apply to an amount of beneficiary income derived from a Māori authority or directly derived from a group investment fund. The minor beneficiary rule also does not apply if the minor is in receipt of a child disability allowance under the Social Security Act 1964 (s HC 35(4)(b)). 6.19 The exclusion from the minor beneficiary rule for beneficiary income derived from a Māori authority is now redundant as the trust rules (and, therefore, the minor beneficiary rule) do not apply to distributions from Māori authorities (s HC 1(2)(c)). From 2003, a distribution from a trust that is a Māori authority is taxed at a special Māori authority tax rate (17.5%). 6.20 The minor beneficiary rule will not apply to beneficiary income directly derived by a minor from a group investment fund. This is targeted at group investment funds that are structured in the form of a trust. The income must be directly derived by the minor from the fund. If income from the group investment fund is first derived by another trust (which is not a group investment fund) and is then distributed to the minor, the minor beneficiary rule may apply. 6.21 The minor beneficiary rule will not apply to beneficiary income derived by a minor who is in receipt of a child disability allowance under the Social Security Act 1964. This means any beneficiary income derived by such a minor will be taxed at the minor’s marginal income tax rates. The exemption for a minor in receipt of such a child disability allowance is intended to exempt trusts set up for children with severe disabilities. The receipt of a child disability allowance is intended to provide an objective basis for determining whether a child has a severe disability. 48 UNCLASSIFIED Exclusions based on settlements on a trust 6.22 Sections HC 36 and HC 37 provide exclusions from the minor beneficiary rule based on the source and nature of settlements that have been made on the trust. 6.23 These exclusions are discussed in more detail below. However, two points are worth noting first: A trustee may treat multiple settlements made on the same terms as one (a) trust. The meaning of “settlement” is narrowed for the purposes of these (b) exclusions. Trustee may treat multiple settlements made on the same terms as one trust 6.24 Sections HC 36(1) and HC 37(1) impose requirements that must be met in relation to “all settlements on the trust”. 6.25 The reference to “all settlements on the trust” may at first appear inconsistent with trust law. This is because under trust law, each settlement may create a separate trust, even if each settlement is made on the same trustee and on the same terms. 6.26 However, under s HC 3 a trustee may treat multiple settlements made on the same terms as one trust. 6.27 Section HC 3 is consistent with the common practice in trust administration of treating multiple settlements on the same terms as one trust. 6.28 The imposition of requirements in relation to “all settlements on the trust” in ss HC 36 and HC 37 takes into account the possibility that the trustee of the trust may have treated multiple settlements made on the same terms as one trust, as allowed under s HC 3. Interpreted in this way, the reference to “all settlements on the trust” is not inconsistent with trust law. Meaning of “settlement” is narrowed 6.29 The meaning of “settlement” for the purposes of the exclusions from the minor beneficiary rule in ss HC 36 and HC 37 is narrower than the general meaning under the ITA 2007. The effect of this narrower meaning is to make it easier to meet the requirements of ss HC 36(1) and HC 37(1), which must be satisfied for “all settlements on the trust”. 6.30 The modification is actually made to the term “settlor” (“settlement” is defined in relation to the term “settlor”). “Settlor” is defined in s YA 1. Section YA 1 refers to s HC 27 for the general definition, which defines “settlor” as a person who, among other things, transfers value to, for the benefit of, or on the terms of a trust. This general definition of “settlor” is modified (in s YA 1) for the purposes of the exclusions to the minor beneficiary rule in ss HC 36 and HC 37. The definition is modified by providing that there will be no transfer of value and, therefore, no settlement, if the transfer of value in s HC 27(2) is: The provision of financial assistance by way of a loan for less than market (a) value, and either of the following is true: 49 UNCLASSIFIED (i) The loan ceased to exist before 1 April 2002; or (ii) If the loan existed on or after 1 April 2002, in each tax year of the trust’s existence, interest has been paid at a rate that is equal to or greater than the interest rate prescribed under the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Regulations 1995 on 31 March of the previous tax year. (Although this interest rate is generally regarded as high, it may be lower than the market interest rate that would apply to certain high risk loans.) The provision of financial assistance by way of guarantee and the (b) guarantee has not been called on. The provision of security and the security has not been called on. (c) The provision of services that are incidental to the operation of the trust (d) (eg, bookkeeping services, accounting services, or services as a trustee). 6.31 These excluded settlements are, therefore, ignored when determining whether “all the settlements on the trust” meet the requirements of ss HC 36(1) and HC 37(1). See Example 18. Settlements made by a relative, a guardian, or their associate (s HC 36) 6.32 Generally, the minor beneficiary rule is intended to apply only to trusts on which a settlement has been made by a relative or guardian of the minor or by a person associated with a relative or guardian of the minor (referred to below as a “relative, guardian, or their associate”). If no such settlements have been made, then the minor beneficiary rule will not apply. This means the rule applies only in those situations where families can potentially gain a tax advantage from using a trust. 6.33 Therefore, an exclusion from the minor beneficiary rule is provided if no settlements have been made on the trust by a person who is a relative, guardian, or their associate (s HC 36(1)(a)). 6.34 For these purposes, a “relative” means a person connected with another person by being: within the second degree of blood relationship with the other (eg, a (a) grandfather and granddaughter or a sister and brother); in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship with the other; (b) in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship with a person who is (c) within the second degree of blood relationship with the other (ie, a person can be related to their de facto partner’s grandfather under this test); adopted as a child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the (d) first degree of relationship to the other (eg, a person will be associated with a child who is adopted by their daughter – essentially, a grandparent through adoption); in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship with a person who is (e) connected with another person through adoption as described in (d) (ie, a person will be related with a child who is adopted by their civil union 50 UNCLASSIFIED partner’s daughter – essentially, a grandparent through civil union and adoption); or the trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to (f) benefit. 6.35 “Guardian” has the meaning set out in s 15 of the Care of Children Act 2004, but does not include certain “guardians” appointed under various statutes (ie, the chief executive of the Ministry of Social Development, a court or an agent of a court, or the Public Trustee). Essentially, a guardian of a child is a person who has all the duties, powers, rights and responsibilities that a parent of the child has in relation to the upbringing of the child. 6.36 Further, for the purposes of s HC 36, an associated person does not include a person associated under only ss YB 4 or YB 5. These provisions relate to relatives who are treated as associated persons. 6.37 Some types of settlement can be made by the relative, guardian, or their associate that will not disqualify the trust from the exclusion. The exclusion from the minor beneficiary rule will still apply in the following situations (s HC 36(1)(b)): The relative, guardian, or their associate is acting as an agent of the minor (a) and has received the property from a person other than a relative, guardian, or their associate. This exception would apply, for example, if accident compensation were paid on behalf of a disabled child to the child’s parent, who settles the money on a trust. The settlement is of an amount of damages or compensation that a court (b) order required the relative, guardian, or their associate to pay to the minor. The minor is a protected person (as defined in s 2 of the Domestic Violence (c) Act 1995), in relation to a protection order, and the settlement is made before the protection order is made or during the time the protection order is in force. A settlement made after the protection order is removed will not qualify. Settlements made before the protection order is removed will continue to satisfy the requirements of the exclusion after the protection order is removed. A settlement that is made jointly by two persons (eg, both parents) will satisfy the requirements of the exclusion even if the protection order is in force against only one of the settlors. 6.38 Further, if a settlement does not meet the requirements of s HC 36(1)(a) or (b), the exclusion from the minor beneficiary rule may still apply if the mixed trust rule in s HC 36(3) applies. This is discussed at \[6.44\]. Settlement made on the death of a settlor (s HC 37) 6.39 Section HC 37 deals with settlements made under a will, a codicil (an amendment to a will), an intestacy or a court variation. The purpose of this is to exclude beneficiary income derived by a minor from a trust where the trust was settled on the settlor’s death to provide for the minor. For this exclusion to apply, the minor must be alive within 12 months after the settlor’s death. The exclusion will also apply to beneficiary income derived by a minor who has a sibling who was alive within 12 months after the settlor’s death. 51 UNCLASSIFIED 6.40 This exclusion allows for children who were alive at the time of the settlor’s death and any children whose birth may have been contemplated on the settlor’s death. The exclusion was extended to beneficiary income derived by other siblings because it was considered unfair if two siblings in a family received different treatment merely because of when they were born. Example 15. Extension to siblings Richard Stark dies on 1 January 2000. In his will, he directs that the Winterfell farm be settled on the Grey Wolf Trust. Richard’s grandson, Rob, is born in the same year, on 5 December 2000. Rob’s brother, Brandon Stark, is born 5 years later. In 2017, the current trustee makes a distribution of beneficiary income to Brandon, who is now 12 years old. The only settlement that has ever been made on the trust is the transfer by Richard Stark of the Winterfell farm under the will. The minor beneficiary rule will not apply to the beneficiary income derived by Brandon in 2017. This is because all settlements (there was only one) were made under a will and Brandon has a brother (Rob) who was alive within 12 months after the settlor’s death. 6.41 If there is a settlement that does not meet the requirements of s HC 37(1), the exclusion from the minor beneficiary rule can still apply if the mixed trust rule in s HC 36(3) applies. The relationship between ss HC 36 and HC 37 6.42 Sections HC 36 and HC 37, as currently drafted, both require that all settlements on the trust meet their respective requirements. However, the Commissioner accepts that this is an unintended legislative change arising in the rewrite of the provision. The corresponding provision in the ITA 2004 (s HH 3C(1)) shows that it was intended that a trust could be excluded from the minor beneficiary rules if some of the settlements were excluded under s HC 36 and the other settlements were excluded under s HC 37. 6.43 A Taxation Amendment Bill (expected to be introduced in the near future) is intended to address this. Mixed trust rule (s HC 36(3) and (4)) 6.44 Generally, the mixed trust rule allows the exclusions from the minor beneficiary rule in ss HC 36 and HC 37 to still apply if some settlements do not meet the requirements of those sections, but at least one does (and the settlements are treated by the trustee as being one trust). For this rule to apply, the settlements that do not meet the requirements must be of a relatively small value. 6.45 If there is more than one settlement on a trust and one or more, but not all, of the settlements fail to meet the requirements of ss HC 36(1) or HC 37(1), the exclusions from the minor beneficiary rule under those provisions may still apply. They may still apply if all of the settlements that failed to meet the requirements of s HC 36(1) or s HC 37(1) meet the requirements of s HC 36(3) and (4). Section HC 36(3) and (4) require: The settlements were made through either: (a) (i) the disposal of property for less than market value, where the total value of settlements made in this way (in the current and in previous income years) is $5,000 or less at the end of the trust’s income year 52 UNCLASSIFIED (value of each settlement is to be determined as at the date of settlement) (s HC 36(3)(a)); or (ii) providing financial assistance for less than market value in the form of a loan if the total amount loaned is not greater than $1,000 on any day in the trust’s income year (s HC 36(3)(b)). No services are provided to the trust by a relative, guardian, or their (b) associate. This requirement applies whether or not the trust pays for the services. For the purposes of this requirement, services do not include services that are incidental to the operation of the trust, for example, bookkeeping, accounting, or trustee services (s HC 36(4)). The purpose of this is to exclude trading trusts from the mixed trust rule. Trading trusts are intended to be subject to the minor beneficiary rule if any settlement on the trust fails to satisfy the requirements of ss HC 36(1) or HC 37(1). Example 16. Mixed trust rule requires at least one qualifying settlement A minor derives beneficiary income of $1,500 from a trust in an income year. There have been two settlements on the trust: (a) a settlement of $5,000 by a parent of the minor; and (b) the parent loans the trust $800 interest free in the income year. Neither settlement would meet the requirements of ss HC 36(1) or HC 37(1). The mixed trust rule requires at least one settlement that meets the requirement of those provisions. Therefore, the minor beneficiary rule will apply. However, if there had been a third settlement that did satisfy the requirements of ss HC 36(1) or HC 37(1), then the two settlements above would not prevent the exclusion from applying. The mixed trust rule would apply. The first settlement above would meet the requirement of s HC 36(3)(a) as it is a disposal for less than market value of property (money) and the total value of settlements on the trust of this nature is not more than $5,000. The second settlement would meet the requirements of s HC 36(3)(b) because the loan was not more than $1,000 on any day in the income year. Example 17. Settlor provides services to trust A minor derives beneficiary income of $1,500 from a trust in an income year. There have been two settlements on the trust: (a) An initial settlement of $100 by a parent of the minor (being a disposal of property for less than market value under s HC 36(3)(a)). (b) A second settlement was made by the grandmother of the minor. This settlement was made under the terms of the grandmother’s will. The child was alive when the grandmother died. The parent is also a full-time employee of the trust and is paid a market salary. Because the parent is paid market value, the provision of employee services by the parent is not a settlement on the trust. The first settlement fails the requirements of s HC 36(1) because it is a settlement by a relative. The second settlement meets the requirements of s HC 37. Therefore, this is a mixed trust situation. The minor beneficiary rule will apply unless the mixed trust rule applies. The settlement by the parent will satisfy s HC 36(3)(a) because the total value of settlements made by disposal for less than market value of property is no more than $5,000. However, the mixed trust rule will not apply because the parent provides services to the trust that are not incidental to the operation of the trust. It does not matter that the parent is paid a market value salary. Therefore, the minor beneficiary rule will apply to the beneficiary income derived by the minor. 53 UNCLASSIFIED Example 18. Some settlements can be disregarded A minor derives beneficiary income of $1,500 from a trust in an income year. There have been three settlements on the trust: (a) On 4 May 2000, a parent of the minor provided a $2,000 interest-free loan to the trust. The trust repaid this loan on 31 March 2002. (b) The parent made a further $1,000 interest-free loan to the trust, which is still outstanding. (c) A third settlement was made by the grandmother of the minor. This settlement was made under the terms of the grandmother’s will. The child was alive when the grandmother died. The first settlement does not come within the definition of “settlement” for the purposes of ss HC 36 and HC 37. The settlement is the provision of financial assistance by way of loan for less than market value and the loan ceased to exist before 1 April 2002 (para (b)(i) of the definition of “settlor” in s YA 1). Therefore, this settlement can be disregarded. The second settlement does not meet the requirements of s HC 36(1) because it is a settlement by a relative. The third settlement meets the requirements of s HC 37(1). Overall, one settlement meets the requirements of ss HC 36(1) or HC 37(1) and one does not. Therefore, this is a mixed trust. Because the interest-free loan is for no more than $1,000 the mixed trust rule will apply and the minor beneficiary rule will not apply to the beneficiary income derived by the minor. 54 UNCLASSIFIED Part 7 Trustee income Definition of “trustee income” 7.1 “Trustee income” is defined in s HC 7 as an amount of income derived by the trustee of a trust, to the extent to which it is not “beneficiary income”. New Zealand-sourced amounts that are trustee income are always taxed in New Zealand. Foreign-sourced amounts that are trustee income are generally taxed based on the residence of the settlors of the trust, rather than the residence of the trustees. Income 7.2 Income derived by the trustees of a trust is determined according to the general rules contained in part C (s BD 1). As discussed above, “trustee income” is the portion of the total income derived by the trustees that is not “beneficiary income” (s HC 7). 7.3 New Zealand-sourced income derived by a trustee of a trust is generally assessable income (where it is not exempt or excluded income) regardless of the residence of the trustee or settlor (s BD 1). Sections YD 4 (Classes of income treated as having a New Zealand source) and YZ 1 (Source rules for interest) apply to determine whether income has a New Zealand source. 7.4 However, the trust rules contain specific provisions dealing with the tax treatment of foreign-sourced amounts derived by trustees. The general rule is that foreign-sourced amounts will be assessable as trustee income when the settlor is resident in New Zealand. Section HC 25 deals with situations where the trustee is not resident in New Zealand. Section HC 26 deals with situations where the trustee is resident in New Zealand. 7.5 Section HC 7(3) extends “trustee income” to include the market value of any property settlement a trust receives that is excluded from “corpus” under s HC 4(3) to (5). Section CV 13(b) includes such amounts in the income of the trustee. As noted above, an amount included under s HC 7(3) is income that cannot be treated as “beneficiary income”. 7.6 The original provision corresponding with s HC 7(3), s 226(9A) of the ITA 1976, was introduced in 1991 and, therefore, is not discussed in the 1989 Explanation. The purpose of ss HC 7(3) and CV 13(b) is to ensure that settlements subject to the provision are taxed to the recipient trustee (ie, at the trustee tax rate) in the income year that the property is settled. In the absence of s HC 7(3), the settlement could be beneficiary income if distributed to a beneficiary in the income year of settlement or within the extended time period specified in s HC 6(1B). Foreign-sourced amounts – non-resident trustees 7.7 Where the trustees of the trust are non-resident, foreign-sourced amounts are assessable as trustee income (subject to the exceptions discussed at \[7.10\]) if, at any time in the income year (s HC 25(2)): a settlor of the trust is a New Zealand resident who is not a transitional (a) resident; or 55 UNCLASSIFIED the trust is a superannuation fund; or (b) the trust is a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust, of which any (c) trustee is resident in New Zealand and a settlor died resident in New Zealand (whether or not they died in the income year). 7.8 Section HC 25(2) applies so that foreign-sourced amounts are assessable if any one of the settlors of the trust (if there is more than one settlor) is resident in New Zealand at any time during an income year. An entire year of residency is not required. 7.9 Where there is a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust, and a settlor died resident in New Zealand, foreign-sourced amounts derived by non-resident trustees are assessable income in New Zealand only for income years where any trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand (s HC 25(2)(c)). For example, if a New Zealand resident settlor of a trust that had non-resident trustees died in New Zealand in 2016, and any one of those trustees became resident in New Zealand for any part of the 2018 income year, any foreign-sourced amounts derived during the 2018 income year would be assessable income in New Zealand. 7.10 Even if a settlor of a trust is a New Zealand resident who is not a transitional resident, foreign-sourced amounts derived by a non-resident trustee are not assessable as trustee income if the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times in the income year, and: no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987 and an (a) election has not been made by the trustee under s HZ 2 for the trust to pay tax on all income so that it will be treated as a complying trust (s HC 25(3)); or if a settlement were made on the trust after 17 December 1987, it was (b) made by a settlor who was not resident in New Zealand at the date of the settlement and at any time between 17 December 1987 and the date of the settlement (s HC 25(4)). 7.11 Although s HC 25(3) and (4) means certain non-resident trustees are not required to pay tax on foreign-sourced amounts, the application of those provisions does not affect the settlor’s income tax liability under the trust rules (s HC 25(5)). Therefore, a New Zealand resident settlor may still be liable as agent of the non-resident trustee for income tax payable by the trustee under s HC 29, subject to the exceptions in s HC 29(5) (discussed below from \[13.81\]), or under other provisions in the trust rules, such as s HC 33. 7.12 Section HC 25(3) and (4) also has no effect when determining whether a trust has met the requirements to be a complying trust under s HC 10(1)(a)(ii) (s HC 25(5)). To maintain complying trust status, it is still necessary for the trustee to pay tax on the trustee’s world-wide income. A trustee, settlor or beneficiary of a trust can elect, under s HC 33, to satisfy the income tax liability on the world-wide income of a trust in order to satisfy the requirements to maintain complying trust status (this is discussed further in Part 10 of this Interpretation Statement). 7.13 Where the trustees of the trust are non-resident and foreign-sourced amounts are assessable as trustee income under s HC 25(2), s HC 25(6) confirms that, 56 UNCLASSIFIED for the purposes of calculating the taxable income of the trustee, the non- resident trustee will be treated as resident in New Zealand for the purposes of: ss EW 9 and EW 11 (which state the situations where the financial (a) arrangements rules will or will not apply); s LJ 2 (which states when a person can claim a tax credit for foreign (b) income tax paid); s OE 1 (which states when a person can choose to be a branch equivalent (c) tax account (BETA) person); and the international tax rules (which are defined in s YA 1 as including the (d) rules relating to controlled foreign companies, foreign investment funds and foreign tax credits). 7.14 New Zealand does not determine the tax residency of a trust based on the tax residence of its trustees as some countries do. Under s HC 2, joint trustees are treated as a notional single person with each being jointly and severally liable for the tax obligations of trustees to calculate and return income. As a result of this approach, if one trustee is based in New Zealand with others offshore, the resident trustee will still be responsible for return obligations. Where all the trustees are not New Zealand resident a tax agent in New Zealand would usually attend to the obligations for a complying trust. Foreign-sourced amounts – resident trustees 7.15 Foreign-sourced amounts derived by trustees resident in New Zealand are exempt income under ss HC 26 and CW 54, if: at all times in the income year no settlor of the trust is a New Zealand (a) resident who is not a transitional resident; and the trust is not a superannuation fund, a testamentary trust or an inter (b) vivos trust where the settlor died resident in New Zealand (whether or not they died in the income year); and where the trust is a foreign trust: (c) (i) the trust has a trust deed; and (ii) the trust is a registered foreign trust under s 59B of the TAA at the beginning of the income year, and when the foreign-sourced amounts are derived; and (iii) the New Zealand resident trustee complies with the foreign trust disclosure requirements in ss 22, 59B, 59C and 59D of the TAA (discussed in Part 13 of this Interpretation Statement) during the income year. 7.16 For foreign trusts that are not registered foreign trusts at the beginning of an income year, transitional rules apply. The New Zealand resident trustee will qualify for the exemption in ss HC 26 and CW 54 for all foreign-sourced amounts derived if:  the New Zealand resident trustee applies to have the trust registered within the application period described in s 59C of the TAA (generally 30 days from the date the trust first had a resident foreign trustee); and 57 UNCLASSIFIED  the trust is not de-registered before the foreign-sourced amount is derived. 7.17 If the New Zealand resident trustee does not apply to have the trust registered within the application period described in s 59C of the TAA, the trust will not qualify for the exemption under ss HC 26 and CW 54 until the first full income year after the trust is formally registered. Deductions 7.18 Section DV 9(2) applies for the purposes of calculating the trustees’ deductions from trustee income (s HC 24(4)). 7.19 Section DV 9(2) states that, for the purposes of determining the deductions that the trustees are allowed in an income year, beneficiary income in the income year is treated as trustee income. This provision supplements the general permission in s DA 1, but the general limitations in s DA 2 still apply. By treating the beneficiary income as trustee income, s DV 9(2) makes it possible for a trustee to establish the required nexus for expenditure incurred in deriving this income. 7.20 Under s DV 9(1), a person who derives beneficiary income is denied a deduction for expenditure or loss that a trustee incurs in deriving the income. Instead, any deductions relating to this income are deducted from trustee income. Losses 7.21 Where a trustee’s annual total deductions are more than their annual gross income in an income year, the difference is their net loss for the income year (s BC 4(3)). This net loss can be carried forward to be subtracted from the net trustee income (being the portion of the total income that has not been distributed as beneficiary income, less the annual total deductions) for a future year in accordance with the provisions in part I (s BC 4(4)). A trustee cannot distribute net losses to beneficiaries. Example 19. Calculation of trustee income The trustees of the Dublin Trust derive $5,000 of rental income, $500 of dividend income and $200 of interest income in the 2017 tax year (total income $5,700). The trust deed requires that $1,000 must be distributed to each of the four beneficiaries of the trust as beneficiary income each year. In the current year, this leaves the trustees with trustee income of $1,700. The trustees incur expenditure in the 2017 tax year of $800 in rates and $1,000 of interest (total expenditure $1,800). All of the expenditure must be deducted from the trustee income, leaving a loss to carry forward for the Dublin Trust of $100. Tax liability of trustee 7.22 The trustee of a trust is liable to satisfy the income tax liability on trustee income as if they were an individual beneficially entitled to it (s HC 24(1)). While this may indicate that the trustee must return trustee income in their individual return, a trustee is defined in s YA 1 as being the trustee “only in the capacity of trustee of the trust” and “includes all trustees, for the time being, of the trust”. Therefore, the trustee, which is deemed to include all trustees of the trust at any given time, derives the trustee income in a separate capacity, so 58 UNCLASSIFIED must return the taxable income separately. Trustee income is taxed at a flat rate of 33% (sch 1, part A, cl 3). 7.23 In calculating a trustee’s tax liability, the trustee is not entitled to have a tax credit under subparts LC and LD (which relate to tax credits for natural persons and for certain gifts) (s HC 24(2)). 7.24 Under s HC 29, the settlor is liable as agent of the trustee for income tax payable by the trustee, with some exceptions. This is discussed further from \[13.77\]. 7.25 Under s HC 35, beneficiary income derived by a minor is treated as if it were trustee income for the purposes of determining the tax rate (being the trustee tax rate of 33%), paying tax on the income, and providing returns of income. This is discussed further in Part 6 of this Interpretation Statement. 59 UNCLASSIFIED Part 8 Distributions from complying, foreign and non- complying trusts Introduction 8.1 The income tax treatment of amounts that are beneficiary income is discussed in Part 5 of this Interpretation Statement. This part discusses the income tax treatment of distributions generally, including the different categories of trust for distribution purposes, taxable distributions, and the application of the ordering rules. 8.2 In determining the tax treatment of distributions made by trustees to beneficiaries, trusts are classified into three main categories: complying trusts; (a) foreign trusts; and (b) non-complying trusts. (c) 8.3 A distribution from a complying trust of an amount that is not beneficiary income is exempt income of the beneficiary. However, this may not apply if the trust is a community trust (community trusts are discussed in Part 9 of this Interpretation Statement). 8.4 Certain distributions from foreign and non-complying trusts may be “taxable distributions” and taxed to the beneficiary. The definition of “taxable distribution” in relation to foreign and non-complying trusts is discussed in detail below. Other distributions are not taxable (eg, a distribution of the corpus of a trust). 8.5 This part discusses: the definition of “distribution” (from \[8.6\]); (a) the three categories of trust (ie, complying, foreign and non-complying (b) trusts, and also dual status trusts) (from \[8.14\]); taxable distributions (from \[8.62\]); (c) the ordering rules (from \[8.108\]); and (d) resettlements (from \[8.158\]). (e) Definition of “distribution” 8.6 It is noted that the definition of “distribution” was re-written with the introduction of the ITA 2007. As discussed at \[2.20\], the transfer of value concept was adopted to simplify the definitions of “settlor” and “distribution” and to harmonise concepts that have similar effect throughout the legislation. The change to the definition of distribution was not intended to change the meaning of “distribution”. 8.7 A trustee makes a “distribution” when the trustee “transfers value” to a person because the person is a beneficiary of the trust (s HC 14). 60 UNCLASSIFIED 8.8 “Transfers value” is defined in s YA 1. It is a net concept in the sense that it takes into account the market value of what is provided by, in this context, the trustee and the market value of what (if anything) is provided in return by the beneficiary. The definition is discussed in detail from \[2.20\] in the context of the definition of “settlor”. 8.9 A “distribution” can include a settlement by the trustee of a trust on another trust (resettlement) for the benefit of a beneficiary of the first trust, but only if: the amount or the property being settled would have been beneficiary (a) income or a taxable distribution for a beneficiary had it been distributed at the time to a beneficiary resident in New Zealand; or s EW 50 or s EZ 39 (which relate to forgiveness of debt) apply, and the (b) property settled is an amount forgiven and treated as paid under ss EW 44(1) or (2) or EZ 39(1). 8.10 Resettlements are discussed further at \[8.158\] below. 8.11 A distribution is made to a person when what is transferred vests absolutely in interest in the person or is paid to the person (see \[5.20\] to \[5.46\] for further discussion on these concepts). A distribution may be made directly or indirectly, or by one transaction or a number of transactions, whether related, connected or otherwise. 8.12 Under s HC 14(5), in determining whether there is a transfer of value, the fact a person is, or will become, a beneficiary of a trust does not constitute the giving or receiving of value. This is intended to forestall an argument that might otherwise be made about whether a trustee transfers value to a beneficiary when the trustee vests or pays an amount to the beneficiary. The argument being that a beneficiary’s existing claim on the trust property is of value and this is given up as consideration when a trustee vests or pays the property to the beneficiary; meaning that there is no transfer of value and, therefore, no distribution. 8.13 An example of a distribution occurring is when a trustee permits beneficiaries to reside in a property owned by a trust without paying market value rent. For a complying trust such a distribution will be exempt income under s HC 20 but for a foreign trust or a non-complying trust the distribution may be treated as a taxable distribution with the tax status determined by ss HC 18 and HC 19 respectively. Categories of trust 8.14 As noted above, in determining the tax treatment of distributions made by trustees to beneficiaries, trusts are classified into three main categories: complying, foreign and non-complying trusts. There is also a type of trust that is referred to in this Interpretation Statement as a dual status trust. These categories are discussed below. Complying trusts 8.15 Complying trusts are essentially trusts where tax has always been paid in New Zealand on the worldwide income derived by the trust, whether by obligation or 61 UNCLASSIFIED election, and the tax obligations relating to the trustees’ tax liability have been satisfied. Significance 8.16 Distributions from complying trusts of amounts other than amounts of beneficiary income are exempt income of beneficiaries (s HC 20). This contrasts with foreign trusts and non-complying trusts where distributions of amounts other than beneficiary income may be taxable. The reason for this different treatment is that trustee income of complying trusts has already been liable to New Zealand income tax. In contrast, income derived by trustees of foreign trusts and non-complying trusts may not have been liable to New Zealand income tax. Consequently, income accumulated by such trustees is taxed when it is distributed to a resident beneficiary. Requirements 8.17 A trust will be treated as a complying trust for a distribution if: over the life of the trust until the time of the distribution: (a) (i) the trustee income does not include any non-resident passive income, non-residents’ foreign-sourced income, or exempt income under s CW 54 and s HC 26 (discussed further from \[8.20\]); and (ii) the tax obligations relating to the trustee’s income tax liability have been satisfied for every tax year (discussed further from \[8.31\]) (s HC 10(1)(a)); or a person makes an election under s HC 33, and for the life of the trust up (b) to the time of distribution, the tax obligations relating to the trustee’s income tax liability for the trustee income are satisfied for each tax year (discussed further from \[8.28\]) (s HC 10(1)(ab)); or the trust is a superannuation fund (for more details on superannuation (c) funds see Part 9 of this Interpretation Statement) (s HC 10(1)(b)). 8.18 Most trusts established by resident settlors with trustees who are resident in New Zealand will satisfy the requirements of (a) above. For example, if a resident individual settles funds or income-producing property on the terms of a trust and resident trustees are appointed, the trust will most likely be a complying trust. This is because the trustee income will have been liable to tax from the date on which the settlement was first made. Consequently, for such trusts distributions of amounts that are not beneficiary income will be exempt income and, therefore, not assessable (s HC 20). 8.19 The requirements of (b) above allow trusts that have non-resident trustees and/or settlors to elect to be a complying trust. Rules exist that allow a foreign trust of an immigrating settlor to become a complying trust, and a complying trust with an emigrating settlor to retain its complying trust status. For more details, see Part 10 and Part 11 of this Interpretation Statement. 62 UNCLASSIFIED No non-resident passive income, non-residents’ foreign-sourced income or exempt income under s CW 54 8.20 For a trust to be a complying trust under s HC 10(1)(a), it is a requirement that, over the life of the trust until the time of distribution, “trustee income” must not have included: non-resident passive income (defined in s RF 2); or (a) non-residents’ foreign-sourced income (defined in s BD 1(4)); or (b) exempt income under ss CW 54 and HC 26, which is foreign-sourced (c) income derived by a New Zealand resident trustee of a trust that: (i) has no New Zealand resident settlors; and (ii) is not a superannuation fund or a trust (whether testamentary or inter vivos) of which a settlor died tax resident in New Zealand; and (iii) if it is a foreign trust, is a registered foreign trust and complies with the foreign trust disclosure rules (discussed in Part 13 of this Interpretation Statement). 8.21 In other words, the trustee’s income must have always been liable to New Zealand income tax in the same manner as a New Zealand resident individual beneficially entitled to the income would have been. 8.22 This requirement applies to “trustee income”. That is, income derived by the trustee that is not “beneficiary income”. (For a discussion of “beneficiary income” and “trustee income”, see Part 5 and Part 7 of this Interpretation Statement.) If a trustee of a complying trust derives income that is non- resident passive income, non-residents’ foreign-sourced income, or exempt income under s CW 54, then to retain complying trust status under s HC 10(1)(a) the trustee must ensure the income is distributed as beneficiary income so that the amount does not become trustee income. Alternatively, a person may be able to make an election under s HC 33 (discussed from \[8.28\]). 8.23 Trustee income is a gross concept. This means that a trustee will have trustee income even if available deductions exceed the trustee’s income for the income year or the trustee has losses available to offset their net income. 8.24 The fact that a trustee may have no trustee income (whether this is because the trustee derives no income or because all income is distributed as beneficiary income) in an income year will not prevent the trust from being a complying trust. 8.25 The fact that a trustee may have trustee income that is exempt income will not prevent the trust from being a complying trust. 8.26 The requirement applies over the life of the trust. Where relevant, this includes income years falling before the 1989 income year when the present trust regime began. 8.27 The New Zealand income tax liability of trustees is determined under subpart BC, and ss HC 7 and HC 24. For the treatment of trustee income before 1 April 1988, when the current regime was introduced, see the 1989 Explanation at \[4.77\]. 63 UNCLASSIFIED Election under s HC 33 8.28 Where a trust does not satisfy the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a)(i) because it derives non-resident passive income, non-residents’ foreign-sourced income or exempt income under s CW 54, a trustee, settlor or beneficiary of the trust may be able to make an election under s HC 33, so that the trust can be a complying trust under s HC 10(1)(ab). 8.29 Under s HC 33, a trustee, settlor or beneficiary of a trust can elect to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee of the trust by notifying the Commissioner within the time allowed for filing a tax return for the relevant income year. Alternatively, a trustee will be treated as having made an election if the trust has previously been a complying trust, ceases to be a complying trust because they cease to satisfy the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a)(i), and the trustee continues to indicate that the trust is a complying trust in its tax returns. 8.30 If a person makes an election under s HC 33, the person must satisfy the income tax liability that the trustee would have as if the trust had a New Zealand resident as settlor and the trustee were a New Zealand resident at all times. The person is not required to satisfy the income tax liability of any beneficiaries, however, the trustee will still have a liability as agent for the beneficiaries under s HC 32 (discussed from \[13.62\]). Tax obligations relating to the trustee’s income tax liability must have been satisfied for every tax year 8.31 For a trust to be a complying trust, it is also a requirement that, over the life of the trust until the time of distribution, the tax obligations relating to the trustee’s income tax liability have been satisfied for every tax year. 8.32 This requires the satisfaction of the trustee’s obligations, but not necessarily the actual payment of all income tax for which the trustee is liable. This ensures that a trust may still be a complying trust where the trustees have entered into deferred payment arrangements with the Commissioner. 8.33 If all of the trustee income has been liable to New Zealand income tax but the trustee’s obligations have not been satisfied it is possible to convert the trust into a complying trust by satisfying the trustee’s obligations retrospectively (taking into account the application of the time bar in s 108 of the TAA, if applicable). For example, if the trustees had failed to declare income from a particular source for several years, the trust would still be a complying trust if the Commissioner accepted a request by the trustees under s 113 of the TAA to have the earlier assessments amended, and the trustees satisfied their resulting obligations (see “Qualifying Trust Status”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004): 85). 8.34 Section HC 32 requires that, in their capacity as agent, the trustee must satisfy the income tax liability of the beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived. If the tax paid by the trustee fell short of the amount actually payable by the beneficiary, the beneficiary must file a return and pay the shortfall. If the beneficiary did not pay the shortfall, the trustee would be liable for this jointly and severally. A trust would retain its complying trust status in these circumstances under s HC 10 regardless of whether the shortfall was paid. This is because the tax obligation of the trustee as agent for 64 UNCLASSIFIED the beneficiary’s income tax liability is not an obligation relating to the trustee’s income tax liability. 8.35 As noted above, to be a complying trust, a trust must satisfy the requirements of s HC 10 “for the life of the trust” until the time of distribution. This includes income years before the present trust rules were introduced. 8.36 Nevertheless, trusts with non-resident trustees that were settled before the trust rules were introduced that had foreign-sourced income or non-resident passive income sourced in New Zealand in the 1988 and earlier income years, were able to become complying trusts. This required an election under s 228(7) of the ITA 1976 to be liable for income tax on trustee income for the 1989 and subsequent income years. The election had to be made on or before 31 May 1989 by a settlor, trustee, or beneficiary of the trust. 8.37 A trust for which an election was made in accordance with s 228(7) is effectively treated as satisfying the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a)(i) and (ii) for the income years prior to the introduction of the trust rules (s HZ 2). 8.38 In addition, a trust where the settlor has migrated to New Zealand can elect to become a complying trust under s HC 30 (discussed further from \[10.8\]). Foreign trusts 8.39 Foreign trusts are trusts that have not had a New Zealand resident settlor at any time since 17 December 1987. Significance 8.40 A distribution of accumulated income (ie, income that is not beneficiary income) by a trustee of a foreign trust to a beneficiary is a taxable distribution and is included in the beneficiary’s income. However, distributions of capital gains (unless made with parties associated with the trustee) and corpus are not. The terms “capital gain” and “corpus” are discussed in more detail below from \[8.73\] when discussing the term “taxable distribution”. Current year income distributed to a beneficiary is taxed as beneficiary income. Requirements 8.41 A trust is a foreign trust under s HC 11 if no settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time in the period that starts on the later of 17 December 1987 and the date on which a settlement was first made on the trust and ends at the moment in time at which it is necessary to determine if the trust is a foreign trust. 8.42 Prior to 21 February 2017 a foreign trust only existed when a distribution was made, but the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 amended s HC 11 to clarify that the definition of foreign trust applies to all trusts with only foreign settlors at a point in time regardless of whether a distribution has been made. 8.43 A trust settled by a New Zealand resident before 17 December 1987 may be a foreign trust, but only if the settlor (and any other settlors) were not resident in New Zealand at any time from 17 December 1987. 65 UNCLASSIFIED 8.44 A trust may be a foreign trust if a settlor was resident in New Zealand after the later of 17 December 1987 or the date of first settlement of the trust, but the settlor was not a settlor of the trust while resident in New Zealand. Example 20. Not a settlor while resident Maria, a non-resident, settles a trust on 1 June 2014 with a resident trustee while Joseph is resident in New Zealand. Joseph, after ceasing to be resident in New Zealand and moving offshore, settles property on the same trust on 1 October 2015. In this example, the trust will be a foreign trust because Joseph was not a settlor of the trust while Joseph was resident in New Zealand. 8.45 Where a non-resident settlor of a trust becomes a transitional resident, the trust will remain a foreign trust under s HC 30 for distributions made of income derived prior to the earlier of the date an election is made to convert that trust into a complying trust and the expiry of that option. That is, one year after the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. This is despite the transitional resident being tax resident in New Zealand throughout that period. 8.46 Where a trust was first settled before 17 December 1987 and the settlor died resident in New Zealand before 17 December 1987 the trust will technically be a foreign trust, but for so long as it satisfies the definition of complying trust it will be treated as one. Dual status trusts 8.47 For the purposes of this Interpretation Statement, dual status trusts are trusts that satisfy the requirements to be a complying trust from inception and have only a non-resident settlor(s) so that they are also foreign trusts. Typically such trusts hold New Zealand property, have at least one New Zealand trustee, and only derive New Zealand-sourced trustee income. Significance 8.48 A dual status trust is effectively treated like a complying trust in relation to the income tax treatment of distributions. A distribution of other than beneficiary income from a dual status trust is not assessable income. 8.49 A taxable distribution from a foreign trust that has a dual status is not assessable income under s BD 1(5) because its character as exempt income from a complying trust is retained despite it also having a status as income from a foreign trust. 8.50 Where a dual status trust makes a distribution sourced from capital gains or corpus these are excluded from being taxable distributions from a foreign trust under s HC 15(4) and are not income for a beneficiary of a foreign trust. The same distribution is exempt income for a beneficiary of a complying trust. As a consequence, a beneficiary of a dual status trust need not include such a distribution in their assessable income. Requirements 8.51 A complying trust may also have a dual status as a foreign trust where it has only a non-resident settlor(s). All trustee income of a dual status trust is taxable at 33% and the tax obligations relating to the trustees’ income tax liability must have been satisfied since the trust’s inception. 66 UNCLASSIFIED Non-complying trusts 8.52 Non-complying trusts are trusts that are neither complying nor foreign trusts. Significance 8.53 Distributions from a trustee of a non-complying trust to a beneficiary of accumulated income (amounts other than beneficiary income) and capital gains, but not corpus, are taxable distributions. The terms “capital gain” and “corpus” are discussed in more detail below from \[8.73\] when discussing the term “taxable distribution”. These taxable distributions are taxable to the beneficiary. As with other categories of trust, current year income derived by the trustee that is beneficiary income is also included in the beneficiary’s income and is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal rates (unless the minor beneficiary rule applies, in which case it is treated as if it was trustee income and taxed at the 33% trustee rate). Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts are taxed at a rate of 45% (ss HC 19, HC 34 and BF 1(b)). This penal rate, and the inclusion of capital gains in taxable distributions for non-complying trusts, reflects that New Zealand income tax may have been deferred through the use of this type of trust. Requirements 8.54 Non-complying trusts are all trusts other than complying trusts and foreign trusts. 8.55 Non-complying trusts are those where there has been a settlor (or settlors) resident in New Zealand since the later of 17 December 1987 or the date of first settlement of the trust and: any of the trustee income from the income year in which the trust was first (a) settled up to the income year in which the relevant distribution is made has included non-resident passive income or non-resident’s foreign- sourced income or exempt income under s CW 54, unless the trustee, settlor or beneficiary has made an election under s HC 33; and/or the tax obligations relating to the trustees’ income tax liability have not (b) been satisfied for every tax year. 8.56 A non-complying trust can also arise where no election is made before the election expiry date under s HC 30(5). This arises for the pre-migration trust of a settlor who has become a New Zealand resident that has been treated as if it was a foreign trust for a period (until the exercise or expiry of that option), in respect of distributions made of income derived prior to that time. 8.57 As noted above at \[8.19\], rules exist that allow a foreign trust to become a complying trust and a complying trust with an emigrating settlor to retain complying trust status. These rules require a trustee, beneficiary or settlor of the foreign trust to make an election. A foreign trust or a complying trust, as the case may be, will become a non-complying trust if an election is not made within the required timeframe. For more details, see Part 10 and Part 11 of this Interpretation Statement. 67 UNCLASSIFIED Streaming 8.58 General trust law, not tax law, determines the powers of a trustee to decide which beneficiaries of a discretionary trust are entitled to receive a distribution and the amount and source of such a distribution. Trustees may prefer some beneficiaries over others. Trustees have a fiduciary obligation to consider what is in the best interests of beneficiaries before exercising any discretion and the tax position of each beneficiary is a relevant consideration. 8.59 Once a distribution is made subpart HC, and where relevant part B (Core provisions), will mainly govern the tax consequences for the beneficiary. These tax consequences arise in the context of the core provisions from which income tax obligations and entitlements are determined, taking into account such things as tax rates, credits and deductions. 8.60 Distributions made by a discretionary complying trust are not subject to the same constraints under subpart HC as distributions from foreign and non- complying trusts. The ordering rules override a trustee’s resolution when determining the components of distributions from foreign and non-complying trusts. Furthermore s HC 16(5) has specific income and capital gain anti- streaming rules for both foreign and non-complying trusts and s GB 22 is a specific anti avoidance provision that applies to beneficiary income where property or services are provided to a third party. 8.61 Refer to QB 15/11 “Income Tax–Scenarios on Tax Avoidance-2015” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 10 (November 2015): 27, “Scenario 3-Use of a Discretionary Trust” for an analysis considering if certain distributions of beneficiary income from a discretionary complying trust, would result in s BG 1 applying. Taxable distributions Introduction 8.62 Essentially, a “taxable distribution” is a distribution from a foreign or non- complying trust to a beneficiary that is included in the beneficiary’s income. The taxable distribution concept is relevant to the taxation of amounts that are not “beneficiary income” under s HC 6. 8.63 The concept of a “taxable distribution” applies only in relation to foreign and non-complying trusts. It is not relevant to distributions from complying trusts. A distribution from a complying trust is taxable to a beneficiary only if it is a distribution of beneficiary income. All other distributions from a complying trust to a beneficiary are exempt (with the exception of distributions from community trusts). Definition of “taxable distribution” 8.64 A “taxable distribution”, for a foreign trust and a non-complying trust, is defined in s HC 15. The definition is wider for a non-complying trust. The wider definition for a non-complying trust reflects the risk that New Zealand income tax may have been avoided or deferred by having income accumulated in such a trust. 68 UNCLASSIFIED 8.65 In relation to a foreign trust, a distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent to which it is not a distribution of: an amount that is beneficiary income; (a) a part of the corpus of the trust; (b) a profit from the realisation of a capital asset or another capital gain (other (c) than a capital gain or other capital profit made with an associated person); a foreign superannuation withdrawal; or (d) a payment or transaction that represents a distribution of either the corpus (e) of the trust or a capital gain. 8.66 In relation to a non-complying trust, a distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent to which it is not a distribution of: an amount that is beneficiary income; (a) a part of the corpus of the trust; or (b) a payment or transaction that represents a distribution of the corpus of the (c) trust. 8.67 A taxable distribution will generally be made up of accumulated income or capital gain amounts. As can be seen from the above discussion, distributions of amounts that are beneficiary income and corpus from non-complying and foreign trusts, and distributions of capital gains in the case of foreign trusts, are not taxable distributions. 8.68 A trustee of a foreign or non-complying trust has limited control over whether a distribution is of income, a capital gain, corpus or otherwise. The nature of the distribution can depend on several factors, including the timing of the distribution and the ordering rules discussed from \[8.108\]. Therefore, the definition of “taxable distribution” in s HC 15 must be interpreted together with the ordering rules in s HC 16. 8.69 A distribution may also be a taxable distribution to the extent to which: the distribution is made by a foreign or non-complying trust by disposing (a) of property at less than market value or providing services at less than market value (s HC 15(6)); or inadequate records are kept by the trustee (see the discussion from (b) \[8.155\]) . 8.70 The reference to a disposal of property at less than market value implies that the provision is aimed at property other than money. A distribution made by disposing of property at less than market value will occur, for example, where a trust asset is sold or leased to a beneficiary at a discounted price. 8.71 A distribution will not be a taxable distribution if it is a distribution of income or a capital gain from a trust (other than a unit trust, a group investment fund, or a superannuation scheme) that was derived in the 1988 or earlier tax years (ss HZ 1 and HC 1(2)(d)). 69 UNCLASSIFIED 8.72 The discussion above on “taxable distributions” refers to “capital gains” and “corpus”. These concepts are discussed next. Capital gains 8.73 In determining whether a distribution from a foreign trust is a taxable distribution, it is important to understand what is included in the concept of “capital gain” for the purpose of the definition of “taxable distribution”. 8.74 Despite referring to a specific type of capital gain (a “profit” that the trustee derives in the income year from “the realisation of a capital asset” of the trust), the definition of taxable distribution takes into account all types of capital gain. This is clear from the words “or another capital gain” in s HC 15(4)(c) and the reference to capital gain in s HC 15(4)(d). 8.75 The determination of a capital gain for the purposes of the definition of “taxable distribution” is modified under s HC 15(5). Firstly, for these purposes, a capital gain does not include a gain that is required to be taken into account for the purpose of calculating a person’s income. For example, s CB 6 provides that an amount that a person derives from disposing of land is income of the person if they acquired the land for a purpose of disposing of it. In the absence of s CB 6, such an amount might be regarded as a capital amount. However, it is included in the person’s income under s CB 6, so cannot give rise to a capital gain for the purposes of the definition of “taxable distribution”. 8.76 In addition, a capital gain for the purposes of the definition of taxable distribution does not include a gain that a trustee derives through a transaction (or series of transactions) between the trustee and a person associated with the trustee. For example, if a trustee sells a capital asset of the trust to a beneficiary and realises a capital gain on the sale, this capital gain will not be a “capital gain” for the purposes of the definition of “taxable distribution”. This is because a trustee of a trust is associated with a beneficiary of the trust (s YB 6). 8.77 A Taxation Amendment Bill (expected to be introduced in the near future) proposes an amendment to limit most of the associated party capital gains made by a trustee of a foreign trust, which would be included under the ordering rules as taxable distributions, to situations where a CFC is a settlor of that trust. Gains in excess of market value made by a trustee of a foreign trust in transactions with associated parties who are not natural persons or corporate trustees will also be treated as tainted capital gains included as taxable distributions under the ordering rules. Such tainted gains will then be treated as income under the ordering rules restoring their treatment prior to the rewrite. The amendment is expected to apply from Royal assent but with a savings provision for tax positions taken that are consistent with the changes. 8.78 The Taxation Amendment Bill also proposes an amendment to s FC 2 to confirm that the market value treatment under this provision does not apply for the purpose of determining whether a transfer of property is a distribution under s HC 14. This will clarify that once a distribution of property has been made to a beneficiary only then is it treated as made in a market value exchange between the trustee and the beneficiary recipient under ss FC 1 and FC 2. 8.79 Another point to note about the determination of a “capital gain” for the purposes of the definition of “taxable distribution” is that the amount of the capital gain is reduced by any capital loss that the trustee incurs in the income 70 UNCLASSIFIED year in which the capital gain was derived. Therefore, if in an income year a trustee makes a $100 capital gain on one transaction and a $100 capital loss on another transaction, there is no capital gain to take into account for the year. 8.80 Finally, the capital gains taken into account are those that have been “realised”. A capital gain is realised when it has been converted into money or money’s worth. A capital gain that has accrued, but that has not been converted into money or money’s worth, will not be realised. As noted above, capital gains are reduced by capital losses “incurred” during the income year in which the distribution was made. In this context, a loss that has accrued, but has not been realised, will not be “incurred”. Corpus 8.81 In determining whether a distribution is a taxable distribution it is also important to understand the meaning of “corpus”. A distribution will not be a taxable distribution to the extent that it is a distribution of corpus. 8.82 “Corpus” is defined in s HC 4. Subject to the exclusions discussed below, “corpus” means an amount that is equal to the market value of a settlement of property on the trust. Generally, the market value of something is the price that would be agreed between a willing but not anxious seller and a willing but not anxious buyer (see \[2.27\]). The market value is measured at the date of the settlement. Where the settlement is denominated in foreign currency, the market value will be the value in New Zealand dollars on the date of settlement. Therefore, a change in the value of property settled on a trust will not change the value of the corpus of the trust. 8.83 Corpus requires a “settlement of property”. A “settlement of property” is not the same as a “transfer of value”. Some “transfers of value” do not result in the trust receiving “property”. One example is the provision of services. Although there is a transfer of value and, therefore, a settlement on the trust, there is not necessarily any property created by the provision of the services. Another example is the provision of an interest-free loan to a trust. Again, although there is a “transfer of value” and, therefore, a “settlement”, there is arguably no “property” settled on the trust. Although the trust as borrower enjoys an economic benefit from being able to enjoy the use of the loan principal for the term of the loan, this is arguably not a form of property in itself. This differs from the position that was accepted in argument by the Commissioner in Case Y25 (2008) 23 NZTC 13,270. 8.84 Whether a settlement will give rise to corpus has implications for the value of corpus held by a trust, which is relevant in determining whether a distribution from a foreign or non-complying trust will be a taxable distribution. 8.85 The three exclusions from the general definition above are discussed next. Property settlement by another trust 8.86 Firstly, corpus does not include a property settlement by a trustee of another trust to the extent to which, if the property were distributed to a beneficiary of the other trust and the beneficiary were resident in New Zealand, the distribution would be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary. 71 UNCLASSIFIED 8.87 The purpose of this exclusion is to prevent the creation of corpus by resettling amounts of income or capital gains accumulated in one trust on the terms of another trust. Without this exclusion it would be possible to avoid tax on distributions of amounts accumulated in foreign and non-complying trusts simply by settling those amounts on other trusts and then distributing them from those other trusts as tax-free corpus. 8.88 The exclusion applies only to the extent that the property settled would have been income (beneficiary income or a taxable distribution) to a resident beneficiary if distributed to such a beneficiary at the time of settlement. Therefore, the exclusion will not apply if the distribution from the other trust was of an amount of corpus of the other trust or, if the other trust was a foreign trust, a capital gain. In determining whether this exclusion applies, the ordering rules (discussed below) apply to determine the character of the amount distributed (ie, whether it is a distribution of income, a capital gain, or corpus). 8.89 There does not have to be a resident beneficiary for the exclusion to apply. The reference to a resident beneficiary is to a hypothetical person. Property settlement for which the settlor is allowed a deduction 8.90 Secondly, property settled on trust is not corpus when the settlor is allowed a deduction for the settlement for New Zealand tax purposes. This might arise, for example, where a person pays an above market price for goods or services acquired from a trust. The difference between the market value of the goods and the price paid will be a transfer of value and, therefore, a settlement. 8.91 The purpose of this exclusion is to ensure that where a deduction is claimed for property settled on a trust a further benefit cannot be obtained in the form of a tax-free distribution of corpus. Property settlement that would otherwise have been income to the settlor 8.92 Thirdly, s HC 4(5) states that a property settlement is excluded from corpus if, but for the fact of the settlement, it would be income of the settlor (or would be income if the settlor were resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement). 8.93 This exclusion will have limited application. If an amount is income of a person, the settlement of that amount on a trust will not prevent that amount from being their income. A person cannot avoid assessment of income that they derive by assigning that income to another person (Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,155 (HC)). The same would apply to a settlement of that income. Property settlement excluded from corpus treated as “trustee income” and a “distribution” 8.94 As noted at \[7.5\], a property settlement a trust receives that is excluded from “corpus” under s HC 4(3) to (5) is treated as “trustee income” under s HC 7(3). And, as noted at \[8.9\], the settlement will also be a “distribution” as defined in s HC 14. 8.95 The exclusion from the definition of “corpus” in s HC 4(3) is discussed further from \[8.158\] below when discussing resettlements. 72 UNCLASSIFIED Taxation of taxable distributions 8.96 Taxable distributions from a non-complying trust have a special tax treatment outside the usual tax treatment where income is included in assessable income. 8.97 Section HC 19 provides that such a taxable distribution: is excluded income under s CX 59; and (a) may be reduced by tax losses calculated under s HC 22; and (b) will be taxed at the rate set out in s HC 34(1) under s BF 1(b) (presently (c) at 45%). 8.98 If the distribution is a foreign-sourced amount which is derived by a non-resident beneficiary then s BD 1(3) in the core provisions removes that non-residents’ foreign-sourced income (as defined in s BD 1(4)) from having the status as excluded income. 8.99 Section BD 1(5) then removes non-residents’ foreign-sourced income from being treated as assessable income. 8.100 Only taxable distributions that are excluded income are taxed under s BF 1(b) at the rate of 45%. Section CA 2(3) confirms that excluded income under s CX 59 does not include non-resident’s foreign-sourced income. Consequently only taxable distributions that remain as excluded income after consideration of source and residency are taxable under s BF 1(b) at the current rate of 45%. 8.101 The end result is that all taxable distributions from non-complying trusts are taxed at 45% to New Zealand resident beneficiaries but only New Zealand-sourced taxable distributions from non-complying trusts are taxed at 45% to non-resident beneficiaries. 8.102 If a CFC derives a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust then under s EX 19 the income is excluded from the CFC’s income and is attributed instead to those persons with an income interest in the CFC at the 45% tax rate. 8.103 A different approach is adopted for taxable distributions from foreign trusts as these distributions are included in assessable income in the ordinary way. A taxable distribution to which s HC 18 applies is income of the beneficiary recipient under s CV 13. However, s BD 1(5)(c) operates to remove from assessable income any taxable distributions derived by non-resident beneficiaries that are ”foreign-sourced amounts” under s BD 1(4). 8.104 A foreign-sourced amount is defined in s YA 1 as meaning an amount of income that is not treated as having a New Zealand source under ss YD 4 and YZ 1 (Section YZ 1 is a terminating provision dealing with source rules for interest). Section YD 4(13) directs that income derived by a beneficiary from a trust fund has a New Zealand source to the same extent as the income of the trust fund has. Section YD 4(13) will apply to the extent that a taxable distribution is treated under the ordering rules as income accumulated by the trustee in a prior year. Where the taxable distribution consists under the ordering rules of a capital gain amount (associated party gains of the trustee only for foreign trusts) then s YD 4(18) applies. The gain will be treated as having a New Zealand source under s YD 4(18) by reference to the source of the actual gain 73 UNCLASSIFIED being distributed, rather than by reference to the proportion of all capital gains made by the trust that are New Zealand-sourced. 8.105 If a New Zealand resident beneficiary (in their capacity as a beneficiary) derives a taxable distribution, they may be allowed a tax credit for any foreign tax paid on the amount under s LJ 6. To qualify for the tax credit the foreign tax must be of substantially the same nature as NRWT (ie, a withholding tax on a distribution to a non-resident). It therefore will not extend to underlying tax paid by a trustee on accumulated foreign-sourced amounts subsequently distributed. Section GB 22— anti-avoidance 8.106 Section GB 22 contains a specific anti-avoidance provision to deal with situations where a trustee enters into an arrangement to defeat the intent and application of the rules relating to beneficiary income and taxable distributions. This provision is discussed from \[5.53\]. 8.107 The Commissioner may also consider the application of s BG 1 to arrangements that have a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance. For example, s BG 1 might apply to an arrangement that involves a loan to a beneficiary of an amount that would, if the amount had been distributed to the beneficiary, have resulted in a taxable distribution taxed at 45%. Section BG 1 would not apply to all such arrangements. In determining whether s BG 1 applies, relevant factors would include (but are not limited to) the relationship between the trustee and the beneficiary, the term of the loan, the interest and repayment terms, the history of payments made on the loan, and the commercial reality of the beneficiary making payments. Ordering rules Introduction 8.108 Because some distributions will be taxable and some not, opportunities could arise for avoiding or deferring tax on income accumulated in trusts by distributing taxable amounts to non-resident beneficiaries or by distributing non-taxable amounts before taxable amounts. The ordering rules for distributions in s HC 16 limit opportunities for manipulating distributions from foreign and non-complying trusts in this manner. This is achieved by providing a series of ordering rules that determine the order in which amounts are treated as having been distributed from such trusts. 8.109 These ordering rules override the treatment of the distributions that would otherwise apply based on the terms of the trust or the exercise of the trustee’s discretion. The rules can affect whether a distribution is treated as a distribution of income, a capital gain or corpus, and so determine whether a distribution will be a taxable distribution or not. Therefore, as noted earlier, it is necessary to interpret the definition of taxable distribution and the ordering rules together. 8.110 The ordering rules in s HC 16 apply when a trustee of a foreign or non- complying trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary. The four exceptions to the ordering rules are discussed from \[8.143\]. 74 UNCLASSIFIED 8.111 Where they apply, the ordering rules treat a distribution as being made up of the following elements in the following order: income derived by the trustee in the current income year; (a) income derived by the trustee in an earlier income year; (b) a capital gain derived by the trustee in the current income year; (c) a capital gain derived by the trustee in an earlier income year; and (d) the corpus of the trust. (e) 8.112 The ordering rules apply on an end of year basis. That is, a distribution is not characterised at the time at which it is made. Rather, distributions are characterised at the end of the income year in which they are made by reference to the total income and capital gains derived in that income year (and previous income years). When the ordering rules are applied, they are applied individually to each distribution made by the trustee in the order in which the distributions are made (subject to potential reordering under s HC 16(5), as discussed from \[8.129\]). 8.113 The amount of each element (eg, current year income) is finite. Once an amount of an element has been treated under s HC 16 as included in a distribution that amount is no longer available to be treated as included in another distribution. This means that the order in which the distributions are made can be significant. 8.114 For each distribution, the elements must be applied in the order above. The next element is relevant only to the extent that the total of the available amounts in the elements so far considered is less than the amount of the distribution. 8.115 The ordering rules apply to distributions made in the income year. However, a distribution made in the income year can be treated as if it was made in the previous income year if it is a payment of income derived by the trustee in the previous income year that is paid within the extended time period allowed under s HC 6(1B). This approach allows the distribution to be treated as consisting of the income derived by the trustee in the previous income year and, therefore, allows the income to be treated as beneficiary income. Otherwise, the ordering rules would potentially treat the distribution as consisting firstly of income derived in the current income year under s HC 16(1)(a). This approach is appropriate as it resolves the potential conflict between s HC 6(1B) and the ordering rules, gives effect to the extension of time contemplated in s HC 6(1B), and is not inconsistent with the purpose of the ordering rules. Distribution firstly treated as being made up of income derived by the trustee in the current income year 8.116 The first element that a distribution is treated as being made up of is an amount of income derived by the trustee in the income year in which the distribution is made (s HC 16(2)(a)). 8.117 An amount must not be treated as included in the distribution if the amount has been treated under s HC 16 as being included in an earlier distribution (ie, earlier in the year) or a distribution made at the same time. 75 UNCLASSIFIED 8.118 An amount of “income” derived by a trustee in an income year, referred to in s HC 16(2)(a) and (b), is determined after subtracting any deduction that is taken into account in the calculation of net or taxable income for the corresponding income year. 8.119 “Income” otherwise has its normal meaning, being income of the trustee under a provision in part C. It means income under New Zealand income tax law, not the law under any other jurisdiction where for instance the amount may or may not be liable to tax. Income under part C may in fact be exempt to the trustee, for example FIF income derived by a resident trustee of a foreign trust treated as exempt under ss HC 26 and CW 54. If subsequently distributed to a resident beneficiary it would comprise a taxable distribution under the ordering rules. 8.120 Section HC 16(2)(a) does not make any distinction between trustee income and beneficiary income. This is because the ordering rules may cause a distribution that would otherwise be a distribution of beneficiary income to not be a distribution of beneficiary income. This is caused by the combination of the way the ordering rules work, the definition of beneficiary income, and the timing of distributions a trustee makes. Example 21. Change to beneficiary income During an income year the trustee of a non-complying trust derives $100 of income and a $100 capital gain. The trustee has discretion under the terms of the trust to distribute income or capital to any of the beneficiaries of the trust. The trustee makes two distributions. In the first distribution, on 1 February, the trustee pays the $100 capital gain to a non-resident beneficiary. In the second distribution, on 1 March, the trustee pays the $100 of income to a resident beneficiary. In the absence of the ordering rules, the $100 of income will be beneficiary income to the resident beneficiary because it is income that is paid to a beneficiary. The $100 capital gain could not be beneficiary income because it is not “income” derived by the trustee. However, applying the ordering rules, and remembering that the trustee pays the $100 capital gain first and the $100 of income second, the result is different. Applying the ordering rules, when the trustee makes the first payment, the distribution is treated as consisting of the $100 of income derived by the trustee (because income comes before a capital gain in the ordering rules). And because the payment is treated as consisting of the trustee’s current year income and is paid to a beneficiary, it will be beneficiary income under s HC 6. This means that when the trustee pays the second $100 to the resident beneficiary, the only available element left is the $100 capital gain. As a result, the ordering rules have changed which beneficiary has derived beneficiary income. 8.121 In the case of contemporaneous distributions, the trustee can generally decide how current year income will be apportioned between distributions. However, the total current year income treated as being included in the distributions cannot exceed the current year’s income. 76 UNCLASSIFIED Example 22. Contemporaneous distributions A trustee of a non-complying trust wishes to distribute $60 each to beneficiary A and beneficiary B on 24 December. The trustee has derived only $100 of income in the current income year. However, the trustee derived $20 of income 2 years earlier that has not yet been treated under s HC 16 as being included in a distribution. Given that the distributions are contemporaneous, the trustee can effectively decide how the current year income will be divided between the beneficiaries. The trustee can treat the distribution to beneficiary A as including $60 of current year income and the distribution to beneficiary B as including $40 of current year income and $20 of previous year income. As a result, beneficiary A will have beneficiary income of $60 and beneficiary B will have beneficiary income of $40 and a taxable distribution of $20. The $20 will be a taxable distribution and not beneficiary income because, by definition, beneficiary income must be distributed in the income year it is derived by the trustee (or by the date after the end of the income year referred to in s HC 6(1B)). The beneficiary income will be taxed at the beneficiaries’ marginal tax rates, and the taxable distribution will be taxed at the 45% non-complying trust distribution rate. Distribution secondly treated as being made up of income derived by the trustee in an earlier income year 8.122 The second element that a distribution is treated as being made up of is an amount of income, other than beneficiary income, that the trustee has derived in an earlier income year (s HC 16(2)(b)). 8.123 Again, an amount must not be treated as included in the distribution if the amount has been treated under s HC 16 as being included in an earlier distribution (earlier in the income year or in a previous income year) or in a distribution made at the same time. Example 23. Accumulated income available for distribution The trustee of a non-complying or foreign trust derived $100 of income in the previous income year. Of that amount, $60 was treated, under s HC 16(2)(a), as being included in a distribution in the previous income year. As a result, only $40 of that income is available to be treated, under s HC 16(2)(b), as being included in a distribution in the current year. Distribution thirdly treated as being made up of current year’s capital gains 8.124 The third element that a distribution is treated as being made up of is a capital gain that the trustee derives in the income year (s HC 16(2)(c)). 8.125 The concept of a capital gain is considered from \[8.73\] in the context of s HC 16 and the definition of taxable distribution. “Capital gain” has the same meaning in the ordering rules: A capital gain does not include any capital gain that is required to be taken (a) into account for the purpose of calculating a person’s income. These amounts will be covered by s HC 16(2)(a). An example, noted above, is a gain captured under s CB 6, which provides that an amount a person derives from disposing of land is income of the person if they acquired the land for a purpose of disposing of it. As an amount of income, the amount will be covered by s HC 16(2)(a). For the purposes of s HC 16(2)(a), the income amount will be adjusted by the deduction that the person is allowed under ss DA 1 and DB 23 for the cost of acquiring the land (s HC 16(4)(a)). In this way, the gain from the disposal of land is taken into account as income. 77 UNCLASSIFIED A capital gain does not include a gain that the trustee derives through a (b) transaction (or series of transactions) between the trustee and a person associated with the trustee. A capital gain is adjusted by subtracting the amount of any capital loss (c) that the trustee incurs in the income year. A capital gain is an amount that has been realised. Similarly, a capital loss (d) is an amount that has been realised and incurred. Distribution fourthly treated as being made up of previous years’ capital gains 8.126 The fourth element that a distribution is treated as being made up of is a capital gain that the trustee derived in an earlier income year (s HC 16(2)(d)). 8.127 The comments made above on s HC 16(2)(c) and the calculation of a capital gain also apply to s HC 16(2)(d). Distribution fifthly treated as being made up of corpus 8.128 The fifth element that a distribution is treated as being made up of is the corpus of the trust (s HC 16(2)(e)). “Corpus” is discussed from \[8.81\]. Subject to some exclusions, “corpus” means an amount that is equal to the market value of a settlement of property on the trust. Transactions that are not genuine and other ordering adjustments 8.129 Section HC 16(5) allows the order of amounts distributed to be amended in certain situations. 8.130 As noted above, if an amount of income or capital gain has been treated as being included in an earlier distribution or a distribution occurring at the same time, then the amount is not available to be treated as included in the distribution currently being considered. Whether an amount is available will depend on the order of distributions and, in the case of distributions made at the same time, the discretion of the trustee. Because of this, some scope to manipulate distributions still exists. For example, a foreign trust could distribute income to non-resident beneficiaries (who as non-residents may not be liable to tax on the income) and capital gains to resident beneficiaries. The s HC 16(2) ordering rules would not prevent the streaming of income and capital gains in this manner if the distribution to the non-resident was made before or contemporaneously with the distribution to the resident. 8.131 However, under s HC 16(5), in certain situations the streaming and availability of income and capital gain amounts can be modified. Section HC 16(5) acts as a type of anti-avoidance provision. Where the requirements of the section are met, the subsection can apply so that, when determining the elements of a distribution to a beneficiary (beneficiary A), amounts of income or capital gain previously distributed to another beneficiary (beneficiary B) must be ignored. This results in the amount of income or capital gain still being available to be included in determining the elements of a distribution to beneficiary A. 8.132 If s HC 16(5) applied in the example in \[8.130\] above, it would treat the income as not having been distributed to the non-resident beneficiary and as still being 78 UNCLASSIFIED available to be included in the distribution to the resident beneficiary, for whom the amount may be a taxable distribution. 8.133 Section HC 16(5) will apply if: some or all of a distribution to beneficiary A would not be treated as a (a) taxable distribution, because of a previous distribution to beneficiary B of income and capital gains; unless, the distribution to beneficiary B: (b) (i) is a genuine transaction entered into and carried out in good faith; and (ii) places the amount beyond the possession and control of the trustee in their capacity as trustee; and (iii) is not a settlement. Effect requirement 8.134 If the treatment of the distribution to beneficiary B would have no effect on whether the distribution to beneficiary A would be a taxable distribution (eg, if both distributions were of current year income), then s HC 16(5) will not apply and there will be no change to the ordering under s HC 16(2). The important consideration is the effect of the treatment of the earlier distribution, rather than the subjective purpose of the trustee in making the distribution. Distribution not a genuine transaction entered into and carried out in good faith 8.135 Section HC 16(5) applies where the distribution to beneficiary B is not a genuine transaction entered into and carried out in good faith. 8.136 This requirement was reworded with the introduction of the ITA 2007. This expression of the requirement replaced the earlier expression, which referred to a distribution not being a “bona fide transaction”. No policy change was intended with this rewording. The Courts have held that a transaction is a bona fide transaction if it is real and genuine to all intents and purposes (CIR v Simpson (1989) 11 NZTC 6,140 (CA)). Not placing the amount beyond the possession and control of the trustee 8.137 Section HC 16(5) applies where the distribution to beneficiary B does not place the amount distributed beyond the possession and control of the trustee. 8.138 A distribution would not place an amount beyond the possession and control of a trustee of a trust if, for example, the trustee made the distribution by recording a credit in a beneficiary’s current account with the trust and the amount was retained and used as working capital by the trustee (this type of distribution featured in CIR v Ward \[1970\] NZLR 1 (CA)). Where the distribution is a settlement 8.139 The third situation in which s HC 16(5) applies is where the distribution is a settlement. 79 UNCLASSIFIED 8.140 Example 24 illustrates this requirement. Example 24. Reordering where there is a settlement The trustee of a foreign trust settles all of the income derived by the trustee on a sub- trust for the benefit of a non-resident beneficiary. The trustee then makes a distribution to a resident beneficiary on the basis that only capital gains and the corpus of the trust remain to be distributed. Section HC 16(5) will apply. It will treat the amount settled on the sub-trust for the benefit of a non-resident beneficiary as still being available for inclusion in the distribution to the resident beneficiary. It does not matter that the transaction may have been genuine and that the distribution to the non-resident placed the income beyond the possession and control of the trustee. Section HC 16(5) applies only to the extent necessary to re-order distributions 8.141 Section HC 16(5) applies only to the extent necessary to determine the elements of the distribution to beneficiary A (as identified and discussed at \[8.131\] to \[8.133\]). This means the treatment of the distribution to beneficiary B, will not necessarily be modified completely. Example 25. Distribution only partially modified A trustee of a non-complying trust derives a $10,000 capital gain in an income year. The trust also has corpus of $10,000. During the income year, the trustee distributes $10,000 to Non-stick Ltd, a beneficiary of the trust (assume Non-stick Ltd is not taxable on this amount because it is a trustee of a registered charity). This is followed by a distribution of $8,000 to Cast Iron Ltd, another beneficiary of the trust. Cast Iron Ltd is a New Zealand resident and would be liable for tax on any distribution of income or capital gain from the non-complying trust. The $10,000 distribution to Non-stick Ltd is made by crediting Non-stick Ltd’s current account with the trust. The amount remains in the trustee’s possession and control. Applying the ordering rules under s HC 16(2), because of the order in which the distributions were made, the capital gain of $10,000 is treated as being included in the distribution to Non-stick Ltd and $8,000 of corpus is treated as being included in the distribution to Cast Iron Ltd. However, these distributions will be reordered under s HC 16(5). This is because if the $10,000 capital gain had not been treated as being included in the distribution to Non- stick Ltd, that amount would have been available to be treated as included in the distribution to Cast Iron Ltd and the amount would have been taxable income to Cast Iron Ltd. Further, the distribution to Non-stick Ltd did not place the amount distributed beyond the possession and control of the trustee. The effect of s HC 16(5) applying is that the $10,000 capital gain is available to be treated as included in the $8,000 distribution to Cast Iron Ltd. This means that $8,000 of the capital gain will be treated as included in the distribution to Cast Iron Ltd. This leaves $2,000 of the capital gain amount, which will still be treated as being included in the distribution to Non-stick Ltd. The remainder of the distribution to Non-stick Ltd ($8,000) will be treated as being made up of corpus. Therefore, the result is that the $8,000 distribution to Cast Iron Ltd is treated as including $8,000 of capital gain. This will be a taxable distribution. And the distribution to Non-stick Ltd will be treated as including $2,000 of capital gain and $8,000 of corpus. If an additional distribution of $2,000 is later made to Cast Iron Ltd, the remaining $2,000 of capital gain will also be treated as not being included in the distribution to Non-stick Ltd and will be available to be treated as included in the additional distribution to Cast Iron Ltd. 80 UNCLASSIFIED Exceptions to the ordering rules 8.142 Section HC 16(6) contains exceptions to the ordering rules. Distribution by the trustee of a complying trust (s HC 16(6)(a)) 8.143 The exception in s HC 16(6)(a) confirms that the ordering rules do not apply to a distribution by the trustee of a complying trust. This is consistent with s HC 16(1), which states that s HC 16 applies only when a distribution is made by a trustee of a non-complying trust or a foreign trust. 8.144 Section HC 16 does not apply to distributions from complying trusts. Generally, a trust will be a complying trust only if, over the life of the trust up to the distribution, the trustee’s worldwide income has been liable to New Zealand income tax and the trustee’s obligations in relation to that liability have been satisfied for every tax year (s HC 10(1)). As this income will have been taxed either to the beneficiary as beneficiary income or to the trustee as trustee income it is not necessary to apply the ordering rules to limit opportunities for manipulation of distributions. 8.145 The overriding exclusion from the ordering rules for distributions from complying trusts that are treated as exempt (that is all distributions except beneficiary income) means that these distributions made by dual status trusts will also not be subject to the ordering rules. Distribution from a non-discretionary trust (s HC 16(6)(b)) 8.146 Section HC 16 does not apply to a distribution if: the trust is a “non-discretionary trust”; and (a) one of the following applies: (b) (i) the trust was created by will or codicil (an amendment to a will) or by an order of court modifying a will or codicil; (ii) the trust was created on an intestacy or partial intestacy; or (iii) no settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987. 8.147 A “non-discretionary trust” is a trust where the trustee has no discretion to determine the source, nature and amount of distributions to beneficiaries. This means, among other things, that the trustee has no discretion to classify trust property as capital or income. 8.148 In these circumstances there is less scope for distributions to be manipulated deliberately to avoid New Zealand income tax. This is because: the trustee of the trust has no discretion to direct distributions to (a) beneficiaries in a manner that results in the avoidance of New Zealand income tax; and the trusts are of a type where it is unlikely that the provisions governing (b) distributions (eg, the terms of a trust deed) would have been structured with a view towards avoiding New Zealand income tax. 81 UNCLASSIFIED 8.149 Non-discretionary trusts on which a settlement has been made after 17 December 1987 (apart from those created by will or codicil or on any intestacy or partial intestacy) are outside the scope of the exception. If this were not the case, it would be possible to create non-discretionary trusts or to use non-discretionary trusts established on or before 17 December 1987 to avoid the ordering rules. Distribution made by disposing of property or providing services at less than market value 8.150 The ordering rules do not apply to a distribution to which s HC 15(6) applies (s HC 16(7)). Section HC 15(6) is discussed at \[8.69\]. 8.151 Where a distribution like that described in s HC 15(6) is made there may be no amounts derived by the trustee that correspond to the distributions. Although it is appropriate to recognise these transactions as distributions, it is not appropriate to apply the ordering rules to the distributions because the distributions are not actually made from a trust’s income, capital gains or corpus. Distribution where a foreign trust becomes a complying trust 8.152 Section HC 16(6)(c) relates to trusts that were foreign trusts before a settlor of the trust became resident in New Zealand. It provides that the ordering rules in s HC 16 will not apply to a distribution from such a trust if the distribution is made subsequent to the settlor becoming resident and the trust is treated (under s HC 30(3)) as a complying trust in relation to the distribution. This is consistent with the fact that the ordering rules do not apply to distributions made from complying trusts. 8.153 This exception applies to only a distribution from a trust that is settled by a natural person. 8.154 Also, the exception applies only if an election has been made under s HC 30(2) (treatment of foreign trusts when settlor becomes resident). Elections made under s HC 30(2) are discussed in Part 10 of this Interpretation Statement. Taxable distribution where records are inadequate 8.155 If the records of a foreign or non-complying trust do not allow an accurate determination of the elements of a distribution under s HC 16 (ie, current and previous year income and capital gain amounts and the corpus of the trust), the distribution is a taxable distribution (s HC 15(7)). 8.156 Section HC 15(7) does not apply to a distribution if the ordering rules in s HC 16 do not apply to the distribution. 8.157 Section HC 15(7) applies where the records of a trust do not permit an accurate determination of the components of a taxable distribution when applying the ordering rules in s HC 16. The focus is on the accuracy of records relating to a particular distribution. This means for example that if a trust had inaccurate records for its income and capital gains but accurate ones for its corpus, it could still be possible to make a distribution of solely corpus as its final act on windup and not have it treated as a taxable distribution. Where however a trust had inaccurate records relating to income, but accurate records in relation to capital 82 UNCLASSIFIED gains and it purported to make a distribution of a capital gain amount, there would be no certainty that the trust had distributed all of its current and accumulated income so as to properly characterise the distribution as a capital gain under the ordering rules. Consequently, s HC 15(7) would operate to treat the amount as a taxable distribution. Resettlements 8.158 A resettlement occurs when the trustee of one trust (the first trust) makes a settlement of property on a new trust (the recipient trust). 8.159 As noted at \[2.136\], a distinction should be made between:  A resettlement that is made on behalf of a beneficiary that coincides with the trustee transferring an absolute interest in the property to the beneficiary.  A resettlement that does not coincide with the trustee transferring an absolute interest in the property to the beneficiary, but which may give a beneficiary an interest in the property as a beneficiary of the new trust. Resettlement made on behalf of a beneficiary 8.160 The first situation involves:  A “payment” made by the trustee to the beneficiary for the purposes of the definitions of “beneficiary income” and “distribution”.  A settlement by the beneficiary on the new trust. 8.161 The tax treatment of this type of resettlement will follow from the two elements above. Depending on the type of trust, the operation of the ordering rules, and the available income and capital gains of the first trust, the “payment” may be treated as beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to the beneficiary. For the trustee of the new trust, the property settled by the beneficiary will normally be corpus, subject to any of the exclusions in s HC 4(3) to (5) applying. Resettlement not made on behalf of a beneficiary 8.162 The following discusses the tax treatment of resettlements that do not coincide with the trustee transferring an absolute interest in the property to a beneficiary. Corpus 8.163 The tax treatment of this type of resettlement largely depends on whether the resettlement is treated as “corpus” of the recipient trust. 8.164 The definition of “corpus” has already been discussed from \[8.81\] to \[8.83\]. In the context of a resettlement, to describe again briefly, subject to the exclusions discussed below, “corpus” means an amount that is equal to the market value of a settlement of property by the first trust on the recipient trust. A property settlement is excluded from the corpus of the recipient trust:  To the extent to which, if the property was distributed to a beneficiary of the first trust and the beneficiary was resident in New Zealand, the 83 UNCLASSIFIED distribution would be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary (s HC 4(3)).  If the settlor is allowed a deduction for the settlement (s HC 4(4)).  If, but for the fact of the settlement, it would be income of the settlor (or would be income if the settlor was resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement) (s HC 4(5)). 8.165 If a property settlement from one trust to another is corpus (ie, it is not excluded under s HC 4(3)), then the settlement will not give rise to income for the trustee of the recipient trust. It will also not be a distribution under s HC 14. 8.166 If a property settlement from one trust to another is excluded from corpus, then the settlement will be:  “trustee income” under s HC 7(3); and  a “distribution” under s HC 14. Trustee income 8.167 As covered at \[7.5\], s HC 7(3) extends trustee income to include the market value of any property settlement a trust receives that is excluded from “corpus” under s HC 4(3) to (5). Section CV 13(b) includes such amounts in the income of the trustee. An amount included under s HC 7(3) is income that cannot be treated as “beneficiary income”. Distribution 8.168 A resettlement of property from one trust to another that is excluded from corpus under s HC 4(3) is also a “distribution” under s HC 14. 8.169 Section HC 14(1) provides that a trustee makes a “distribution” when the trustee transfers value to a person because the person is a beneficiary of the trust. This includes a situation where one trust (the first trust) settles property on another trust (the recipient trust). In this situation, the recipient trust is a beneficiary of the first trust. 8.170 Section HC 14(2) provides that a resettlement will only be a distribution if the amount or the property settled would have been beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to a beneficiary of the first trust, had it been distributed at the time to a beneficiary resident in New Zealand. These are the same circumstances as described under s HC 4(3). Tax consequences for the recipient trustee 8.171 As noted at \[8.167\], for the recipient trustee, a resettlement of property from one trust to another that is excluded from corpus under s HC 4(3) will be “trustee income” under s HC 7(3) and “income” under s CV 13(b). 8.172 If the resettlement was made by a non-complying trust, the income will be excluded income for the recipient trustee and, therefore, not included in the recipient trustee’s assessable income and not taxed at the 33% trustee rate. Instead the income will be taxed under s BF 1(b) at 45%. Therefore, the 84 UNCLASSIFIED treatment of the settlement as trustee income and a distribution does not result in double taxation of the settlement (however, as discussed below, it is possible for beneficiaries of the recipient trust to be taxed on subsequent distributions from the recipient trustee). 8.173 If the resettlement was made by a complying or foreign trust, the income may be assessable income (subject to other exclusions from assessable income applying) for the recipient trustee and taxed at the 33% trustee tax rate. Subsequent distributions by the recipient trustee 8.174 The following discusses the tax implications of a subsequent distribution by the recipient trustee that includes an amount settled on the recipient trustee, being an amount that was excluded from corpus under s HC 4(3) to (5). 8.175 As noted above at \[8.167\], the market value of the property settled will be treated as “trustee income” of the recipient trustee and cannot be treated as “beneficiary income”. The treatment of these amounts as “trustee income” was introduced in 1991, after the 1989 Explanation was published. 8.176 If the recipient trust is a complying trust, then a subsequent distribution by the recipient trustee of the resettlement amount to a beneficiary of the recipient trust will be exempt income of the beneficiary under s HC 20. 8.177 Although a subsequent distribution by the recipient trustee of the resettlement amount cannot be “beneficiary income”, it will be a taxable distribution if the recipient trust is a foreign trust or a non-complying trust. This is because the resettlement amount is income derived by the trustee of the recipient trust that is treated as not being beneficiary income. This would be a taxable distribution under s HC 15 for a foreign or non-complying trust. This means that the amount resettled could be taxed twice:  once to the trustee of the recipient trust as assessable income (if the first trust is a complying or foreign trust) or as a taxable distribution at 45% (if the first trust is a non-complying trust); and  again as a distribution to the beneficiary of the recipient trust at either the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate (if the recipient trust is a foreign trust) or at 45% (if the recipient trust is a non-complying trust). The nature of a settlement excluded from corpus for the purposes of the ordering rules 8.178 The following discusses the nature of a settlement excluded from corpus for the purposes of applying the ordering rules to a subsequent distribution made by the trustee of the recipient trust. 8.179 Again, a resettlement of property that is excluded from corpus under s HC 4(3) to (5) is “trustee income” of the recipient trustee derived in the income year of settlement under s HC 7(3) and is included in the “income” of the trustee under s CV 13(b). 8.180 This means that a resettlement of property that is excluded from corpus under s HC 4(3) to (5) is an amount of income that the recipient trustee derives or has derived for the purposes of the ordering rules in s HC 16(2)(a) and (b). 85 UNCLASSIFIED 8.181 Note that the settlement amount is treated as income for the purposes of the ordering rules, even if the amount was a capital gain in the hands of the first trust. On being resettled on the recipient trust, the amount, which is excluded from corpus under s HC 4(3), is recharacterised as “trustee income” and “income” under ss HC 7(3) and CV 13(b). 86 UNCLASSIFIED Part 9 Other types of trusts Introduction 9.1 The general tax treatment discussed in the above parts of this Interpretation Statement applies to most trusts, including the standard family or trading trust structures often used in New Zealand. However, in some situations, different tax rules apply to specific types of trusts including: charitable trusts; (a) deceased estates; (b) community trusts; (c) superannuation funds; (d) lines trusts; (e) licensing trusts; (f) bare trusts; (g) unit trusts; (h) Maori authorities; (i) foreign investment funds; and (j) foreign superannuation schemes. (k) 9.2 The tax treatments of these entities are considered in the next sections. Charitable trusts 9.3 Section HC 13 defines a charitable trust, for the purposes of the trust rules, as a trust: for which all income derived or accumulated, in the current or any earlier (a) income year, is held for charitable purposes; and any income derived in the current year is exempt income under (b) s CW 41(1) or s CW 42(1). 9.4 For the exemptions to apply, the trust must be a ”tax charity” (discussed further at \[9.11\] and \[9.12\] below). Charitable purposes 9.5 For a trust to be a charitable trust, all income derived or accumulated by the trustee must be held for charitable purposes. This test must be satisfied for each income year. 9.6 “Charitable purpose” is defined in s YA 1 as including every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community. The definition in s YA 1 also confirms that: 87 UNCLASSIFIED a trust will be charitable for the purposes of the ITA 2007 if it meets the (a) public benefit requirement apart from the fact that the beneficiaries are related by blood; and a marae has a charitable purpose if the physical structure is situated on (b) land that is a Māori reservation and the funds of the marae are not used for a purpose other than the administration and maintenance of the land and physical structure of the marae or for a purpose that is not otherwise a charitable purpose. 9.7 The definition of “charitable purpose” in s YA 1 is the same as the definition in s 5(1) and (2) of the Charities Act 2005. 9.8 The general definition of “charitable purpose” in s YA 1 and the Charities Act 2005 is a statutory restatement of the established common law classification of charitable purposes stated by Lord Mcnaughten in Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v Pemsel \[1891\] AC 531 (HL). In Re Greenpeace of New Zealand Inc \[2014\] 26 NZSC 105, the Supreme Court said that charitable purposes must be recognised on a case-by-case basis by analogy with previous common law authorities. 9.9 Section 5(3) of the Charities Act 2005 confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that if the purposes of an entity include a non-charitable purpose that is merely ancillary to a charitable purpose of the entity (eg, advocacy), the presence of that non-charitable purpose does not prevent the entity from qualifying for registration as a charitable entity. This provision restates an established common law principle (see, for example, Molloy v CIR \[1981\] 1 NZLR 688 (CA)). Exemption under ss CW 41 and CW 42 9.10 Under ss CW 41 and CW 42, income derived for charitable purposes is exempt income. However, these provisions apply only if the entity carrying on the charitable purposes is a “tax charity”. 9.11 A “tax charity” is defined as an entity that is registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 (and includes any entity that has been removed from the register for the period that it was eligible to be registered) (s CW 41(5)). An entity will qualify for registration under the Charities Act 2005 where it is established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes and is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual (s 13 of the Charities Act 2005). 9.12 In addition, an entity can be a “tax charity” if it is a non-resident entity that carries out its charitable purposes outside New Zealand and the Commissioner has approved it as a tax charity in circumstances where registration under the Charities Act 2005 is unavailable (s CW 41(5)(c)). 9.13 Under s CW 41, an amount of income derived by a trustee of a trust for charitable purposes will be exempt income, provided the trust is a tax charity. However, this provision does not apply to income derived from a business carried on by, for, or for the benefit of the trust. 9.14 Section CW 42 applies to exempt income derived directly or indirectly from a business carried on by, for, or for the benefit of a trust, if: 88 UNCLASSIFIED the trust carries out its charitable purposes in New Zealand; and (a) the trustee of the trust is a tax charity; and (b) no person with some control over the business is able to direct or divert, (c) to their own benefit or advantage, an amount derived from the business, unless the person with control is the trustee of a trust that is a tax charity, and the amount is used for the purposes of the trust. 9.15 The exemption in s CW 42 applies only to the extent to which the charitable purposes of the trust are carried out in New Zealand (s CW 42(4)). 9.16 Under s CW 42(3), a trustee will be treated as carrying on a business if they acquire a revenue producing asset from a person of a kind discussed immediately below at \[9.17\] (b) and that person retains or reserves an interest in the asset, or the asset will revert to that person. 9.17 A person is treated as having some control over the business and as being able to direct or divert amounts from the business to their own benefit or advantage, if (s CW 42(5)): they are in any way, whether directly or indirectly through another person (a) or entity, able to determine or materially influence the determination of the nature or extent of a relevant benefit or advantage, or the circumstances in which a relevant benefit or advantage is to be given or received; and that ability or influence arises because they are: (b) (i) a settlor or trustee of the trust carrying on the business, or of a trust that is a shareholder of the company that is carrying on the business; (ii) a director or shareholder of the company that is carrying on the business; or (iii) associated with any relevant trustee, settlor, director or shareholder. 9.18 This requirement will be satisfied if there is an ability to direct or divert an amount from the business to the person’s own benefit or advantage. It is not necessary that this actually occurs. 9.19 For the purposes of s CW 42(5), a person is treated as a settlor of a trust where they have disposed of an asset to the trust that is used by the trust in carrying on its business and they retain or reserve an interest in the asset or the asset will revert to them (s CW 42(6)). 9.20 A person is not treated as having some control over the business merely because they provide professional services to the trust or company carrying on the business (s CW 42(7)). This is the case where the person’s ability to determine the nature or extent of a relevant benefit or advantage arises because they: provide services in the course of their professional public practice; or (a) are a statutory trustee company, Public Trust or the Māori Trustee. (b) 89 UNCLASSIFIED 9.21 A relevant benefit or advantage may or may not be something that is convertible to money and includes: deriving an amount that would be income under the ITA 2007; or (a) retaining or reserving an interest in an asset disposed of to a trust or (b) where the asset disposed of will revert to them. 9.22 However, a relevant benefit or advantage will not arise merely because a person earns interest on money lent at current commercial rates (s CW 42(8)). Distributions 9.23 While many charitable trusts will not have “beneficiaries”, and will instead use funds for charitable purposes, the definition of “charitable purpose” for tax purposes is broad enough to include trusts that will have beneficiaries. Trust law determines the tax treatment of distributions from charitable trusts. Therefore, distributions from a charitable trust that is a complying trust, of amounts that are not beneficiary income, are exempt income under ss HC 20 and CW 53. Distributions of beneficiary income from a charitable trust retain their exempt income character, under s CW 41 or s CW 42, in the hands of the beneficiary. Settlor liability 9.24 A settlor can be liable as agent of the trustee for the tax liabilities of the trustee where no trustee is resident in New Zealand. However, this rule does not apply to settlors of charitable trusts (s HC 29(4)). This rule ensures residents who make donations to charitable trusts that have non-resident trustees are not liable for any tax liabilities of the trust. Deceased estates 9.25 The mere fact that a person has died and an executor has been appointed to manage their estate does not give rise to a trust relationship. Trustees and executors have different capacities (Re Hayes \[1971\] 1 WLR 758 (Ch)). However, it will often be the case that a trust will be created by will (referred to as a testamentary trust). This can occur expressly by way of a statement in a will that specific property of the deceased will be held on trust for a named beneficiary. This could also occur where property is left for a minor beneficiary that needs to be held until the beneficiary is of age. Property that is intended to be the subject of a testamentary trust will vest in the trustees of that trust on the date of assent, after the “final distribution” of the deceased’s estate (Nevill’s Law of Trusts, Wills and Administration (10th ed, Lexis Nexis, Wellington (2010)) at \[1.2.6\]). 9.26 Under s 43 of the TAA, an executor or administrator is responsible for filing a return on behalf of the deceased covering the period from the beginning of the income year until the date of the taxpayer’s death, assuming a return is required. Income derived by the taxpayer’s estate after their death is accounted for by the estate in its return. Despite an estate (up until assent) not being a trust, “trustee” is defined in s YA 1 of the ITA 2007 as including an executor and administrator (as noted in Part 3 of this Interpretation Statement). The trust rules also contain specific rules that apply to estates for administrative convenience. 90 UNCLASSIFIED 9.27 Section HC 8 provides that an amount received in an income year by the trustee of an estate of a deceased person for the period after death is treated under s CV 12 as assessable income derived by the trustee during that income year. The estate trustees must file the form Income Tax Return: Estate or trust IR 6 (March 2016). 9.28 As a result, there is a need to correctly account for different sources of income when derived. The trustee is required to register the estate as a new taxpayer and apply for an Inland Revenue Department (IRD) number in the name of the estate. 9.29 Section HC 8 overrides the common law principle that income earned but not derived for tax purposes by a deceased person before death is capital in the hands of the beneficiary of that person’s estate. This situation could arise, for example, where the deceased person returned income on a receipts basis and the person performed services before death for which payment was not received until after death. Employees, barristers and doctors may fall into this category. 9.30 Section HC 8 applies only where the amount received by the trustee of the estate is not income derived by the deceased person during their lifetime. Any income derived by the deceased during their lifetime should be returned on behalf of the deceased in a return under s 43 of the TAA, as discussed at \[9.26\]. Section HC 8 also applies only if the amount received by the trustee would have been included in the deceased person’s income, if they had been alive when it was received. That is, the amount must be one that would have had the character of income in the hands of the deceased person, if it had been received by the deceased person while alive. 9.31 The effect of s HC 8 is that the amount the trustee of the estate receives is deemed to be income derived by the trustee. Because the amount is treated as income derived by the trustee, and not trustee income it can be vested absolutely in interest in a beneficiary of the estate, or can be paid to a beneficiary of the estate, so can become beneficiary income where there is an interim distribution of the estate. If there is no such vesting or payment, the income will be taxed as trustee income. 9.32 The trustee of the estate is liable for income tax owed by the deceased as well as for any tax liability as trustee of the estate. But the deceased’s tax liability is limited to the net assets of the estate, and the Commissioner is empowered to write off any outstanding tax, if an estate has been distributed, under s 177C(2) of the TAA. 9.33 A final tax return must be prepared for the period up to the date of distribution when the estate is wound up. The trustee of the estate routinely secures an indemnity from beneficiaries to ensure there is cover for any tax liabilities that might arise in excess of those expected before making or completing distributions. 9.34 The tax treatment of property transfers after a person dies was clarified by the asset transfer rules introduced by the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005. Subject to exceptions for close relatives, transfers of property following death are treated as disposals at market value. There is a transfer from the deceased to the estate and again when the estate is distributed. When the death occurred before 1 October 2005, transitional rules apply to preserve the pre-existing regime. 91 UNCLASSIFIED 9.35 For details about the asset transfer regime following death, see “Death and Asset Transfers”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 7 (September 2005): 41. Deduction of irrecoverable book debts (s DB 32) 9.36 Section DB 32 applies where a debt owing to a person at the date of their death is written off, in whole or in part, by the trustee because it is not recoverable. This applies only to amounts written off as bad debts where the amount written off was earlier included in the deceased’s assessable income or in the assessable income of the trustee of the deceased’s estate. 9.37 In these circumstances, the amount written off is allowed as a deduction in this order: first, against any income derived by the trustee as trustee income during (a) that income year; second, any balance is deductible against income derived by or in trust for (b) a beneficiary who has a vested interest in the capital of the estate to the extent that the loss is chargeable against the capital of that beneficiary; and third, any balance is carried forward to the next income year and offset (c) against trustee income and beneficiary income according to the rules outlined above, with any further excess being carried over to subsequent income years and offset according to the same rules. 9.38 Therefore, to apply s DB 32 it is necessary first to calculate the trustee income and the beneficiary income in the income year in question, ignoring the loss incurred by the debt write-off. 9.39 The amount written off is not deductible against beneficiary income derived by beneficiaries who have an interest in the income of the trust only. Community trusts 9.40 Section YA 1 defines a “community trust” as a trust established under s 4 of the Community Trusts Act 1999 as a result of the restructuring of a trustee bank. The income derived by the trustees of a community trust is exempt under s CW 52. 9.41 Distributions from community trusts that are “beneficiary income” are taxed in the ordinary way under ss HC 17 and CV 13. Other distributions from community trusts are also taxable to recipients at their marginal rates under ss HC 21(3) and CV 14. The income exemption in s HC 20 for distributions from complying trusts that are not beneficiary income does not apply to community trusts. 9.42 Exceptions to the general rule that community trust distributions are taxable are in ss HC 21(2) and s CZ 19. These exceptions relate to: amounts derived by the trustees before the 2004 income year; (a) distributions of corpus or capital gains; and (b) 92 UNCLASSIFIED distributions, settlements or dividends made or paid to the trust in the (c) 2005 and 2006 income years on the winding up of a trust or company in particular circumstances. 9.43 Contrary to the usual position, trustees of community trusts are not liable for tax as agents for recipients of distributions from community trusts under ss HC 32(3) and HD 12(1). Consequently, the obligation lies on the recipient of the distribution to include such income in a return and pay tax on it. Superannuation funds 9.44 A “superannuation fund” is defined in s YA 1 as a retirement scheme within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. 9.45 Superannuation funds are complying trusts under s HC 10(1)(b). All income derived by a superannuation fund is assessable as trustee income under the trust rules. In contrast to other complying trusts, superannuation funds cannot make distributions of beneficiary income (s HC 6(2)(a)). The effect of this is that all distributions to members of a superannuation fund are exempt income for the beneficiaries (ss HC 20 and CW 53). 9.46 Under s HC 24(5), the general rules for calculating trustee income are modified by ss CX 40 and DV 1 to DV 4. Under s CX 40, amounts derived from investments in life insurance policies entered into in New Zealand are excluded income. Sections DV 1 to DV 4 provide for specific deductions for superannuation funds relating to promotion costs and transfers of costs to master funds. 9.47 The income of a superannuation fund, including foreign-sourced amounts, is always assessable trustee income even where there is no New Zealand resident trustee (ss HC 25(2) and HC 26(1)). Trusts not taxed under the trust rules Lines trusts 9.48 A “lines trust” is defined in s YA 1 to mean a trustee of a trust that: has had shares allocated, transferred or vested in it, being shares in: (a) (i) an energy company as defined in s 2(1) of the Energy Companies Act 1992 under an approved establishment plan under that Act; (ii) a company under s 76 of the Energy Companies Act 1992; or (iii) a company that has had assets and liabilities of the Crown transferred to it under s 16 of the Southland Electricity Act 1993; and continues to hold those shares. (b) 9.49 There are no specific rules in the ITA 2007 for the taxation of lines trusts. Therefore, they will generally be taxed as complying trusts, provided they qualify to do so. However, some lines trusts are registered charities, so will be taxed as charitable trusts (discussed above from \[9.3\]). 93 UNCLASSIFIED Licensing trusts 9.50 A “licensing trust” is included in paragraph (a) of the definition of “company” in s YA 1 as they are a body corporate under ss 302 and 303 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012. This means they have a legal existence separate from their members. A licensing trust may convert to be a community trust under ss 351 to 358 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act but if they do their status as a body corporate is preserved under ss 359 and 360 of that Act and so they will continue to be treated as a company under the ITA 2017. 9.51 Consequently both licensing trusts and community trusts regulated by the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act are not taxed as complying trusts. Bare trusts 9.52 “Bare trust” is not a defined term in the ITA 2007. Under common law, a bare trust is a trust where the trustee has no obligations or duties to perform other than to maintain or transfer the property held by the trustee to, or as directed by, the beneficiary. The duties of a bare trustee are passive in the sense that a bare trustee must comply with the directions of the beneficiary and has no independent power, discretion or responsibility in connection with the trust property (Estate of Frank Hillyer King and Ors v CIR \[2007\] NZCA 474, Herdegen v FCT (1988) 20 ATR 24 (FCA)). 9.53 Under s YB 21, where a person holds something or does something as a bare trustee for another person, the bare trustee is ignored, and the other person is treated as holding or doing that thing for tax purposes. Unit trusts 9.54 A “unit trust” is defined in s YA 1 as being: a scheme or arrangement that is made for the purpose or has the effect of providing facilities for subscribers, purchasers or contributors to participate as beneficiaries under a trust, in income and capital gains arising from the property that is subject to the trust. 9.55 Section HC 1(2)(a) excludes unit trusts from the trust rules. Unit trusts are treated as companies for tax purposes. The tax treatment of distributions from and interests in unit trusts is determined largely under the dividend rules in subpart CD. Unit trusts can also elect to become portfolio investment entities (PIEs), which have their own tax regime in subpart HM. Maori authorities 9.56 Section HF 2 sets out the persons who are eligible to become a “Maori authority” by making an election under s HF 11. The trusts eligible to make an election to become a “Maori authority” are the: trustees of a trust established by an order made under Te Ture Whenua (a) Maori Act 1993; trustees of a trust who own land that is subject to Te Ture Whenua Maori (b) Act 1993; trustees of a trust that is recognised by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustees Ltd as (c) a mandated iwi organisation under s 13(1) of the Maori Fisheries Act 2004; 94 UNCLASSIFIED trustees of a trust that is established by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustees Ltd as (d) a mandated iwi organisation under ss 79 and 92 of the Maori Fisheries Act; trustees of a trust who receive and manage assets that are transferred by (e) the Crown as part of a settlement of a claim under the Treaty of Waitangi on behalf of Māori claimants and are contemplated by the deed of settlement; and Māori Trustee in their capacity as an agent for the owner of land that is (f) subject to Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. 9.57 Section HC 1(2)(c) excludes Maori authorities from the trust rules. In addition, under s HC 35(4), the minor beneficiary rules do not apply to a distribution from a Maori authority. The ITA 2007 contains specific rules (mostly in subpart HF) relating to the tax treatment of Maori authorities and distributions from Maori authorities. Taxation of investments in trusts Foreign investment funds 9.58 A “foreign investment fund” (FIF) is defined in s EX 28 as: a “foreign company”; (a) a “foreign superannuation scheme”; (b) an insurer under a life insurance policy that is offered or entered into (c) outside New Zealand; or an entity described in sch 25, part A (no entities are currently listed). (d) 9.59 A “foreign company” includes a “foreign unit trust”, which is essentially a unit trust that is non-resident. A “foreign superannuation scheme” is defined in s YA 1 as a superannuation scheme constituted outside New Zealand. A “superannuation scheme” is defined in s YA 1 as including a trust established for the purposes of providing retirement benefits to members or beneficiaries. Therefore, trusts that are constituted and/or administered outside New Zealand have the potential to fall within the definition of a FIF. 9.60 However, distributions from FIFs are taxed under specific rules in subparts EW and CQ and not under the trust rules. Several methods are available to calculate FIF income, but the principal ones are the fair dividend rate and comparative value. For more information on FIFs, see Inland Revenue Department NZ, A Guide to the Foreign Investment Fund Rules and the Fair Dividend Rate IR 461 (May 2016). Foreign superannuation schemes 9.61 Distributions from foreign superannuation schemes that are trusts in foreign jurisdictions set up mainly to provide retirement benefits to natural persons, are taxed either under the FIF rules or the foreign superannuation scheme rules in s CF 3, and not under the trust rules. 95 UNCLASSIFIED Part 10 Entry to the trust regime Overview 10.1 When an individual (a natural person) immigrates to New Zealand or a returning New Zealander resumes residency, there are tax implications when that person is a settlor, trustee or beneficiary of a foreign trust. This part of the Interpretation Statement explores the options available to settlors to deal with their foreign trust, and the tax implications for all three categories of persons when they become New Zealand resident. 10.2 Also discussed in this part is an individual’s right to become a transitional resident. Transitional residence status applies for at least 48 months after becoming tax resident, plus the part remaining of the month in which the person becomes a transitional resident. During this period, they enjoy an exemption on foreign-sourced passive income. Transitional resident status affects the timing for the settlor to elect to turn a foreign trust into a complying trust, and the treatment of income from a foreign trust. Settlor’s residence determines on-going foreign trust status 10.3 A trust a non-resident settles before immigrating to New Zealand is a foreign trust under s HC 11 until the day before the settlor becomes resident. Trustee and non-resident beneficiary income of such a trust is taxed only if it has a New Zealand source. 10.4 Once a settlor with a pre-migration trust becomes resident, distributions from the trust are treated under s HC 30 as made by a foreign trust for income derived up to a year after the settlor is resident and is not (or no longer is) a transitional resident. Income derived by the trust after that time, when distributed, is treated as from a complying trust if an election is made in time, but if not, then from a non-complying trust. This is discussed further at \[10.15\]. Transitional resident status 10.5 A transitional resident is a natural person who is resident after being previously non-resident for at least 10 continuous years and who has not been a transitional resident before. They are exempt from tax under ss HR 8 and CW 27 on foreign-sourced amounts (other than employment and services income) for a period:  beginning on the earliest day they acquired New Zealand tax residency (through either having a permanent place of abode or the first day of the 183-day rule, as applicable); and  ending at the earlier of: o the end of the 48th month after the month in which they acquired a permanent place of abode; or o the end of the 48th month after the last day on which they satisfied the 183 day test. The consequence of this rule is that the period will frequently exceed 48 months. 96 UNCLASSIFIED 10.6 A person can elect to stop being a transitional resident under s HR 8(4) and an election once made is irrevocable. If an application is made under s 41 of the TAA for tax credits for families by a person eligible to be a transitional resident they and their spouse, partner or de facto (if also a transitional resident) are treated as having made an application under s HR 8(4). 10.7 The regime was introduced from 1 April 2006 to reduce the tax barriers to international recruitment. For more information, see “Temporary Exemption from Tax on Foreign Income for New Migrants and Certain Returning New Zealanders”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006): 103 and “IS 16/03: Tax Residence”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2 at \[206\] to \[219\]. Elections into the complying trust regime 10.8 A non-resident settlor who is a natural person has one year after becoming tax resident and ceasing to be a transitional resident to elect under s HC 30 that any foreign trust they have settled becomes a complying trust. If the election is not made in this timeframe, any such trust will be classified as a non-complying trust for any distribution made of amounts derived after the term has expired. If the settlor is a company or other entity the election under s HC 30 is not available. A dual status trust is not treated as subject to the requirements of s HC 30 (see \[10.19\]). 10.9 To qualify for the election under s HC 30(1), the trust must be a foreign trust for a distribution if it were made immediately before the settlor became resident. This requirement will be satisfied, if no settlor was resident at any time between: the later of 17 December 1987 and the date the trust was first settled; and (a) the date of deemed distribution on the day before the settlor becomes (b) resident. 10.10 Under s HC 30(2), a settlor, trustee or beneficiary of a foreign trust can choose to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee under s HC 33 by making an election before the expiry date using the form Election to Pay Income Tax on Trustee Income IR 463 (June 2008). The effect of an election is that the elector is liable to pay income tax on trustee income, including foreign-sourced amounts (but not on beneficiary income for which a trustee is liable as agent), and the trust is treated as a complying trust for distributions of amounts derived by the trustees after the date of the election. 10.11 The trust is treated as a foreign trust in relation to distributions of amounts derived before the election (s HC 30(3). If a transitional resident who is a settlor makes a further settlement on their trust during the period they are a transitional resident, distributions from that trust will still be treated as coming from a foreign trust. This is because even though s HC 11 will not be satisfied, s HC 30 continues to apply to treat the trust as a foreign trust for distribution purposes for so long as its requirements are met. 10.12 An election can also be made under s HC 33 to pay tax on trustee income of foreign or non-complying trusts if this requirement would not otherwise exist. The due date for making the election in these circumstances is the due date for filing the tax return for the income year of settlement. For more detail see the 97 UNCLASSIFIED discussion from \[8.28\] to \[8.30\] and also Election to pay income tax on trustee income IR 463 (June 2008). 10.13 The liability of any other person to tax on the trustee income is not removed because a party has made an election under s HC 33. For example, if a newly resident settlor (who was not or was no longer a transitional resident) made the election, a non-resident trustee of the trust would also remain liable for tax on New Zealand-sourced income (or worldwide income if the settlor continued to make settlements on the trust after becoming resident). The Commissioner is not constrained from pursuing any of the liable parties jointly or severally when assessing or collecting that tax. However, because the settlor has made the election, the Commissioner will only pursue the trustee if the settlor failed to satisfy the liability of the trustee. The Commissioner would not use these powers to collect any more than 100% of tax due. 10.14 A trustee is also a person able to make an election under s HC 33(1). If the trustee makes the election, then only the trustee will be liable for the trustee’s income tax. A trustee can make the election even though they will be the person liable in any event once the trust is a complying trust. 10.15 If an election is not made within the period, the trust becomes a non-complying trust under s HC 30(4)(b) for distributions of amounts derived by the trustee after the election expiry date, even if the trustee has paid tax on trustee income under s HC 24(1). Distributions of amounts derived before that date continue to be treated as derived from a foreign trust. 10.16 Section HC 30(6) sets out two options for calculating income derived before the election is made or when it has expired. One option tracks the actual date of income derivation in the period and the other is a time-based apportionment method. No options are prescribed for calculating the income derived in the period after the election is made or has expired (as the case may be), but the Commissioner will accept either of the same two methods for this or any other reasonable method of apportionment adopted. 10.17 When applying the ordering rules to distributions made by a pre-migration trust subject to s HC 30, the trust fund must still be treated as a single fund. This is despite the distributions being treated as sourced from different types of trusts depending on when it was derived. For example, if current year income was all derived after the election expiry date, the first distribution made after the expiry date would be deemed to consist of that current year income and be treated as from a non-complying trust if no election was made. The trustee could not override the ordering rules and designate that as being from accumulated income derived in the period before the expiry date sourced from a foreign trust. 10.18 If an election is not made and no further settlements are made on the trust after the settlor becomes tax resident in New Zealand, the settlor is not liable for tax on trustee income. This is the result of s HC 29(1) for trusts settled on or before 17 December 1987 and of s HC 29(5) for trusts on which a settlement has been made after 17 December 1987. 10.19 If the trust of a settlor who is a new or returning resident or transitional resident has a dual status as both a complying trust and a foreign trust immediately prior to the settlor becoming resident in New Zealand, it will not be treated as meeting the requirements of s HC 30(1)(b) such that s HC 30 will not apply. The Commissioner considers that provision applies to trusts that are only a 98 UNCLASSIFIED foreign trust,and not also a complying trust. As a consequence, such a dual status trust will lose its status as a foreign trust on the day the settlor becomes resident and continue as a complying trust for so long as it meets the requirements of s HC 10. If subsequently the status of complying trust was lost such a trust would not then be able to rely on s HC 30 as the prerequisite condition of s HC 30(1)(b) would never have been satisfied. 10.20 If a transitional resident establishes a trust whilst they are a transitional resident, that trust will not be a foreign trust. This is because s HC 11 cannot be satisfied as a transitional resident is resident in New Zealand under s HR 8(2). Moreover, s HC 30(1)(b) cannot apply to treat distributions as being from a foreign trust as the trust does not exist immediately prior to the settlor becoming a resident. Whether the trust is a complying or non-complying trust depends on whether the requirements of s HC 10 have been met. These are set out at \[8.17\]. Application of s HC 30 – examples 10.21 Example 26 discusses new migrants with an existing trust. Example 27 to Example 29 illustrate the application of s HC 30 in the three circumstances contemplated by that section. The three circumstances being: where an election is made to pay tax on trustee income and the trustee’s obligations are satisfied, where an election is made but the trustee’s obligations are not satisfied, and where no election is made. Example 26. New immigrants with existing trust Facts Anna settled property on trust on 1 June 1986 when she was resident in Australia having been born there. The trust has two trustees: one is Anna’s Australian partner (Rick) and the other is an Australian solicitor. The trust property earns Australian- sourced income. Rick became resident in New Zealand for the first time on 1 October 2011 when he immigrated here with Anna, and his status as a transitional resident ended on 31 October 2015. He continues to be resident in New Zealand after his transitional residency stops. Result Rick, as a trustee of the trust, is liable to pay tax in New Zealand on the Australian- sourced trustee income from the income year commencing on 1 April 2015. This is because a settlor of the trust, Anna, is a New Zealand resident who stops being a transitional resident during this income year (s HC 25(2)). The exception in s HC 25(3) for a non-resident trustee does not apply, because Rick is not resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year. Even though Anna is the settlor, she is not liable as agent of the trustee for tax on trustee income because the trust was settled before 17 December 1987 and no further settlements were made after she became resident ( s HC 29(1)). (If the trust had been settled after 17 December 1987, s HC 29(5) would still ensure Anna would not be liable for tax on trustee income.) However, Anna can make an election under ss HC 30(2) and HC 33 to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee from the date of the election. This is because Anna is a natural person who is a New Zealand resident. And, if a distribution had been made from the trust on the day before she became resident in New Zealand, the trust would have been a foreign trust for the distribution (s HC 30(1)). If Anna, Rick, the Australian solicitor trustee or any beneficiary of the trust makes an election, the tax treatment of distributions will be: 99 UNCLASSIFIED • Where the amount (being distributed) was derived before the election was made, the trust will be treated as a foreign trust (s HC 30(3)(a)); • Where the amount was derived after the election was made and the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a) are met, the trust will be treated as a complying trust (s HC 30(3)(b)); • Where the amount was derived after the election date and the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a) were not met, the trust will be treated as a non-complying trust (s HC 30(3)(c)). If an election is not made under ss HC 30(2) and HC 33, the tax treatment of distributions will be: • Where the amount (being distributed) was derived before the election expiry date (ie, before 31 October 2016), the trust will be treated as a foreign trust (s HC 30(4)(a)); • Where the amount was derived after the election expiry date, the trust will be treated as a non-complying trust (s HC 30(4)(b)). Rick being a New Zealand resident trustee will continue to be liable for tax in New Zealand on Australian-sourced amounts of trustee income if the trust becomes non- complying as the exemption in ss HC 26(1) and CW 54 will not apply from the income year in which Anna as settlor ceased to be a transitional resident. In the event that the facts changed such that both trustees were always non-resident then the trustees as a notional single person would be treated as non-resident with the consequence that foreign-sourced trustee income would not be assessable income under ss HC 25(3) or HC 25(4) provided no further settlements were made on the trust by a New Zealand resident or by a person that had been a New Zealand resident at any time between 17 December 1987 and the date of settlement. Once the trust becomes a non-complying trust under s HC 30(4)(b) it can never subsequently adopt a status as a complying trust because it is unable to satisfy any of the requirements of s HC 10. Example 27. Election made and trustee’s obligations satisfied Facts Len settled $100,000 on trust on 1 April 2007 when he was resident in Hong Kong. The trustees are all resident in Hong Kong. Two members of Len’s family ( Kim and Jack) are beneficiaries of the trust. The trustees have discretion to pay income or capital to Kim and Jack. No further settlements were made on the trust after 1 April 2007. Len, Kim and Jack all became resident in New Zealand on 1 May 2007 and were transitional residents for a 4-year period. None had previously been resident in New Zealand. On 1 November 2011, Len made an election under ss HC 30(2) and HC 33 to pay tax on trustee income. All of the income the trustees derived was from outside New Zealand. The amounts the trustees derived and accumulated were: Income year Income Capital gains 2008 $1,000 Nil 2009 $10,000 $5,000 2010 $11,000 $5,000 2011 $13,000 $2,000 2012 $8,000 $3,000 2013 $10,000 $3,000 100 UNCLASSIFIED On 1 April 2013, the trustees made distributions to Kim of $51,000 and to Jack of $30,000. Len had paid tax on the trustee income derived between 1 November 2011 (the date of election) and 1 April 2013. Kim and Jack were still resident in New Zealand on 1 April 2013. Tax consequences: Entitlement to make election Len is entitled to make an election under ss HC 30(2) and HC 33. This is because he is a natural person who became resident in New Zealand, and the trust would have been a foreign trust for a distribution made on 30 April 2007 (the day before Len became resident). Kim and Jack, as beneficiaries of the trust, are also entitled (but not required) to make an election under ss HC 30(2) and HC 33, as are the Hong Kong trustees. The election must be made within one year of the day on which the settlor became resident and ceased being a transitional resident. Len stopped being a transitional resident on 31 May 2011. The election may be made at any time on or before 31 May 2012. Therefore, Len’s election on 1 November 2011 is within time. Trustee income Before Len stopped being a transitional resident, the trustee income was not liable to New Zealand tax because no settlor of the trust had stopped being a transitional resident and the income was all derived from outside New Zealand ( ss BD 1(4) and HC 25(2)). Also, the trustees are not liable for tax on the trustee income derived in the income year when Len stopped being a transitional resident and in later income years. This is because the income derived by the trustee was from outside New Zealand and the trustees are non-resident at all times during those income years and the settlor was not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement (s HC 25(4)). The exclusion for non-resident trustees in s HC 25(4) does not affect a settlor’s liability (or the requirements for a complying trust) ( s HC 25(5)). However, Len is not liable as agent for the trustees for tax on trustee income. This is because Len was not resident in New Zealand when the settlement was made on the trust (s HC 29(5)). Len is liable to meet the income tax liability of the trustees from the date of his election under s HC 33(1) and the consequential assumption of any income tax liability the trustee would have if the settlor and trustees were New Zealand residents (s HC 33(2)). The effect of the election is that Len is liable to pay tax on the trustee income derived from the date of election. No method is prescribed for calculating the income derived in the year of election after the date on which the election is made. However, methods modelled on s HC 30(6), namely either a time-based apportionment or a calculation based on income actually derived, will be acceptable as will any other reasonable apportionment method. Assuming that a time-based apportionment is made, the trustee income on which Len is liable for tax for the 2012 income year is: $8,000 x (151 ÷ 365) = $3,310 Len is also liable to tax on trustee income derived in all subsequent income years. However, the $10,000 derived by the trustees in the 2013 income year is distributed to Kim as beneficiary income so there is no trustee income. Distributions The trust is a discretionary trust, and an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made under ss HC 30(2) and HC 33. The ordering rules in s HC 16(2) do not apply to the distributions to Kim and Jack, and the distributions are deemed to reflect the terms of the exercise of the trustees’ discretion (see the exclusion from the ordering rules in s HC 16(6)). If it is assumed that Kim is an income beneficiary only, that Jack is an income and capital beneficiary, and that the trustees exercised their discretion to pay capital to Jack, the treatment of the distributions is as follows: 101 UNCLASSIFIED (a) $51,000 distribution to Kim The trustees exercise their discretion to distribute income derived in the 2008 to 2013 income years. The $10,000 derived in the 2013 income year is assessable as beneficiary income (s HC 17). An amount of $33,000 from the $35,000 of income derived in the 2008 to 2011 income years is distributed with the remaining $2,000 left in the 2009 income year. The $33,000 and the portion of income derived in the 2012 income year before the election (ie, $8,000 x (214 ÷ 365) =$4,690) are assessable as a taxable distribution of $37,690 from a foreign trust (ss HC 30(3)(a) and HC 15(4)). The taxable distribution is taxed at Kim’s normal marginal rates. The remaining portion of income derived in the 2012 income year, $3,310, is not assessable. This is because it is a distribution of income from a complying trust of an amount other than beneficiary income (ss HC 30(3)(b) and HC 20). (b) $30,000 distribution to Jack The trustees exercise their discretion to distribute capital to Jack. The distribution is of the $18,000 of capital gains derived by the trustees in the 2009 to 2013 income years and $12,000 of corpus. Capital gains of $12,000 derived in the 2009 to 2011 income years and the portion of capital gains derived in the 2012 income year before the election are not assessable (ie, $3,000 x (214 ÷ 365) =$1,759). This is because they are distributions of capital gains from a foreign trust (ss HC 30(3)(a) and HC 15(4)). The portion of capital gains derived in the 2012 income year after the election, $1,214, and capital gains of $3,000 in the 2013 income year are also not assessable. This is because they are distributions from a complying trust of amounts other than beneficiary income (ss HC 30(3)(b) and HC 20). The distribution of corpus is not assessable. The result is that no part of the $30,000 distribution is taxable to Jack. Example 28. Election made but trustee’s obligations not satisfied Facts The facts are the same as in Example 27, except that the trustee’s income tax obligations are not satisfied in the 2013 income year. Tax consequences: Trustee income The trustee income for the 2012 income year remains liable for tax as in Example 27. There is no liability to tax for the trustee income derived before the election to pay tax on trustee income was made (ie before 1 November 2011); but the settlor, Len, is liable to tax on trustee income derived after that date (ie, $3,310). Len is also liable to tax on trustee income derived in all subsequent income years. Len is liable to satisfy the tax on trustee income from his date of election on the deemed basis under s HC 33 that the trustee is resident when in fact the trustees are not resident. 102 UNCLASSIFIED Distributions Any distributions made in the income year in which the trustee’s obligations are not satisfied and in any subsequent income year are treated as distributions from a non-complying trust except where they are of amounts derived before the day on which the election was made (s HC 30(3)(c)). Also, the ordering rules apply to such distributions because the trust is treated as a non-complying trust ( s HC 16(1)). The ordering rules govern the order in which income, capital gains and corpus are deemed to be distributed. The distributions made to Kim and Jack on 1 April 2013 are in an income year after the one in which the trustee’s obligations are not satisfied (ie, the 2014 income year). Therefore, the trust is treated as a non-complying trust for the distributions, except where they are of amounts derived by the trustees before the election was made, and the ordering rules in s HC 16(2) apply. The distributions are made at the same time. Rules for how contemporaneous distributions are to be ordered are in s HC 16(3). If an amount is included in an earlier or contemporaneous distribution, then it is not treated as included in the relevant distribution. The characterisation of distributions made at the same time is generally for the trustee to decide, subject to the ordering rules in s HC 16(2) and (3). In this case, it is assumed that the trustee has by resolution recorded the distribution in the order reflecting its decision. The resolution first of all allocated $51,000 of the income from the 2008 to 2013 income years to Kim. The remaining $2,000 of the income from the 2009 income year is then allocated to Jack because s HC 16(3)(b) treats all income as having been distributed before capital gains are distributed. The treatment of the distributions is as follows. (a) $51,000 distribution to Kim As noted earlier, it is assumed the trustees make distributions to Kim first and then Jack. The trustee’s discretion to pay out earlier years’ income is overridden by s HC 16(2). Under s HC 16(2)(a) the current year’s income must be paid out first and then the earlier years’ income. In this case, none of the income was derived by the trustee in the same year it was distributed to the beneficiaries. Therefore, the treatment of the income is determined by the ordering rules in s HC 16(2)(b) and by the extended period for paying beneficiary income in s HC 6(1B). The ordering rules do not specify that preceding years’ income must be regarded as having been distributed to the beneficiaries in any particular order, and it is the order in which the trustees resolve to make distributions that applies. If the income is distributed to Kim from the same income years identified in Example 27, $37,690 of the distribution to Kim is assessable as a taxable distribution from a foreign trust at Kim’s normal marginal rates. The $37,690 comes from the same income years and amounts identified in Example 27. This is the combined effect of the ordering rules at s HC 16(2) and the calculation required by s HC 30(6) at the date of election under s HC 33(3) and s HC 30(3). The remaining portion of income derived in the 2012 income year after the election was made, $3,310, is also assessable, but as a taxable distribution from a non- complying trust at 45% ( ss HC 30(3)(c) and HC 34(1)). The $10,000 derived in the 2013 income year is assessable as beneficiary income. Although the amount was paid on 1 April 2013 and the 2013 income year ended on 31 March 2013 it was still within the extended period available under s HC 6(1B) in which beneficiary income can be allocated. (b) $30,000 distribution to Jack The distributions are recorded by the trustee as first going to Kim and then to Jack. Therefore, the distribution to Jack cannot be of amounts that are deemed to have been distributed to Kim, including all the income from the 2008 income year. Consequently, Jack is deemed to receive $2,000 of the income remaining from the 2009 income year, the capital gains of $18,000 derived in the 2009 to 2013 income years, and corpus of $10,000. 103 UNCLASSIFIED The distribution of corpus is not assessable. The capital gains derived in the 2009 to 2011 income years and the portion of the capital gain derived in the 2012 income year before the election are also not assessable. This is because they are distributions of capital from a foreign trust (ss HC 30(3)(a) and HC 15(4)). However, the remaining portion of capital gains derived in the 2012 income year after the election was made, $1,241, and the capital gain of $3,000 derived in the 2013 income year, are assessable as a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust at 45%. The $2,000 of income derived from the 2009 income year is also assessable, but as a taxable distribution from a foreign trust at Jack’s normal marginal rates. Example 29. No election to pay tax on trustee income Facts The facts are the same as in Example 27 except that no election is made to pay tax on trustee income. The election expiry date is one year from the date on which Len stopped being a transitional resident. Len stopped being a transitional resident on 31 May 2011. Therefore, the election expiry date is 31 May 2012. Tax consequences: Trustee income Because no election has been made, the trustee income is not liable to tax, and Len is not liable as agent for the trustees ( for the reasons set out in Example 27 under the heading “trustee income” that explains he was not resident when the settlement was made). Distributions The trust is deemed to be a foreign trust for any distribution of amounts derived before the election expiry date and a non-complying trust where the distribution is of amounts derived after that date (s HC 30(4)). The ordering rules in s HC 16 apply to determine the different elements of the distribution. The distributions to Kim and Jack are made on the same date of 1 April 2013, and it is assumed that the trustees followed the order they adopted in their resolution as treating $51,000 of the income from the 2008 to 2013 income years as having been distributed to Kim first and the remaining $2,000 from the 2009 income year as having been distributed to Jack, because this is the order in which the relevant trustees’ resolution dealt with it. (a) $51,000 distribution to Kim The ordering rules at s HC 16(2) will apply to any distribution to Kim. The $33,000 from the income derived in the 2008 to 2011 income years is assessable as a taxable distribution from a foreign trust at Kim’s normal marginal rates (ss HC 30(4)(a) and HC 15(4) and HC 16(2)(b)). The $8,000 of income derived in the 2012 income year is also assessable as a taxable distribution from a foreign trust. This is because the income in the 2008 to 2012 income years was derived before the election expiry date of 1 May 2012. The $10,000 derived in the 2013 income year is assessable as beneficiary income. Although the amount was paid on 1 April 2013 and the 2013 income year ended on 31 March 2013 it was still within the extended period available under s HC 6(1B) in which beneficiary income can be allocated. 104 UNCLASSIFIED If it were not beneficiary income (ie the distribution was made outside of the scope of s HC 6(1B)) then it is a taxable distribution and it would have been necessary to apportion the amount. The portion derived before the election expiry date would be a taxable distribution from a foreign trust ( s HC 30(4)(a) and (6)). The portion derived after the election expiry date would also be a taxable distribution but from a non-complying trust ( s HC 30(4)(b)). (b) $30,000 distribution to Jack Once again the ordering rules apply to Jack’s distribution. Jack is deemed to receive $2,000 of the income remaining from the 2009 income year, the capital gains of $18,000 derived in the 2009 to 2013 income years, and corpus of $10,000 ( s HC 16(2)(b), HC 16(2)(d) and HC 16(2)(e)). The distribution of corpus is not assessable. The capital gains derived in the 2009 to 2012 income years and the portion of the capital gain derived in the 2013 income year before the election expiry date (ie, $3,000 x (30 ÷ 365) = $246.57) are also not assessable. This is because they are distributions of capital from a foreign trust that are not taxable distributions (ss HC 30(4)(a) and HC 15(4)). However, the remaining portion of capital gains derived in the 2013 income year after the election expiry date, $2,753.43, is assessable as a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust at 45% (ss HC 30(4)(b) and HC 15(2)). The $2,000 of income derived from the 2009 income year is also assessable, but as a taxable distribution from a foreign trust at Jack’s normal marginal rates. Valuation of property, trading stock and financial arrangements on becoming a complying trust 10.22 Trustee income may become subject to New Zealand income tax some time after a trust was first established. This will occur, most commonly, when a non- resident settlor becomes resident in New Zealand and an election is made under ss HC 30 and HC 33 for a foreign trust to be a complying trust. When this happens, it is necessary to establish, at the date of change, the cost of trading stock and depreciable assets the trust owns, and to ensure income or expenses that would have already been accrued for financial arrangements of the trust (had the trustee income been liable to New Zealand income tax) are not accrued after the trustee income becomes liable to income tax. This is achieved by the rules in s HC 31. Application of s HC 31 10.23 Section HC 31(1) has application when an amount a trustee derives on a date is assessable income when immediately before that date the income was not liable to New Zealand income tax other than as non-resident passive income. For ease of reference, this is referred to as the “change date.” 10.24 Section HC 31(1) also applies when trustee income was previously liable to New Zealand income tax as non-resident passive income and subsequently becomes liable to New Zealand income tax as income of another type. For example, if the trustee income of a trust settled by a non-resident included interest paid by a New Zealand company, the interest would cease to be liable to income tax as non-resident passive income if the settlor and trustee became resident in New Zealand and an election was made under ss HC 30(2) and HC 33 to pay tax on trustee income. 105 UNCLASSIFIED 10.25 Section HC 31 also applies when some trustee income was previously liable to New Zealand income tax while another portion was not, and the latter portion then becomes liable. In this situation, s HC 31 will apply only to the assets and financial arrangements used to produce income that was not previously liable to income tax. For example, if a trustee of a trust settled by a non-resident had trading income from within and outside New Zealand, only the profits from New Zealand would be liable to income tax. However, if the settlor became resident in New Zealand and an election was made to pay tax on trustee income, both the New Zealand and foreign business profits would be liable to income tax. Then, s HC 31 would apply in relation to the assets and financial arrangements used to earn the foreign-sourced business profits. 10.26 Section HC 31(1B) confirms that from 14 April 2014, s HC 31 does not apply to charitable trusts that fail to meet the requirements for deriving exempt income under ss CW 41 or CW 42. From that date, such charities are subject to the provisions of ss HR 11 and HR 12 relating to non-exempt charities ceasing their tax-exempt status and entering the tax base. Premises, plant, machinery, equipment and trading stock 10.27 Section HC 31(3) sets out the method for determining the “cost” of premises, plant, machinery, equipment and trading stock on the change date. For premises, plant, machinery and equipment, the “cost” determined forms the basis for any depreciation losses that are deductible from trustee income. Cost also establishes an opening value for the trading stock provisions. 10.28 Either of two methods may be used to calculate the cost of the premises, plant, machinery, equipment or trading stock. The person liable for income tax on trustee income chooses the method and should indicate the method taken in the trust income tax return. 10.29 The first method is the historical cost of the asset, less accumulated depreciation or other value at that date (not exceeding market value) used to calculate income tax in a country (or territory) in which the trustee income has been liable to income tax. That is, the person may elect to use the depreciated basis or other value of the asset that is used for the purpose of income tax calculations in another country. If the relevant date falls within the income year in the other country, rather than at year end, it will be necessary to calculate the depreciated value by apportioning the depreciation allowed in the foreign country to the before and after periods in that income year. It will also be necessary to value the trading stock on the change date according to the methods used for income tax purposes in the foreign country, even if a valuation is not required under that country’s tax laws on that date. 10.30 For this first method to be available, the trustee income must have been liable to income tax in another country, and the asset must have a value (whether historical cost less depreciation or any other value but not exceeding market value) for the purposes of income tax calculations in that country. 10.31 Under the second method, the person may use the value that would be used for the ITA 2007 at the relevant date as if the trustee income had always been assessable other than only as non-resident passive income. For premises, plant, machinery and equipment the “cost” under this option is calculated in two steps: 106 UNCLASSIFIED The first step is to establish the value of the asset that would have been (a) used for New Zealand depreciation purposes when the asset was first available to produce income that would have been liable to New Zealand tax. The second step is to deduct from the original depreciation basis calculated (b) in step 1, the total amount of depreciation that would have been allowed as a deduction up to the change date, assuming a liability to New Zealand tax had always existed. 10.32 For trading stock, the person may use any of the applicable valuation methods in subpart EB to obtain a value on the date on which the trustee income became liable to New Zealand income tax. 10.33 Under the second method, it is assumed that the trustee income had at all times been liable to New Zealand income tax. This does not, however, include an assumption that assets are located in New Zealand and that, therefore, any special rates of depreciation historically available in New Zealand are applicable. If, for example, assets were used to carrying on a business in Hong Kong, the depreciation is calculated by assuming that the trustee income derived from the Hong Kong business was always liable to New Zealand income tax and that depreciation was allowed on the basis of the assets being in Hong Kong. Financial arrangements 10.34 Section HC 31(4) and (5) sets out a method for calculating the consideration for a financial arrangement on the change date. The amount determined is then used to calculate the base price adjustment when it matures, or when it is remitted, sold or otherwise transferred. The intent is to ensure income or expenses that would have been notionally accrued in relation to the financial arrangement in the period before becoming liable to New Zealand income tax (assuming the trustee income had been liable to income tax all along) are not accrued in the period after actually becoming liable to income tax. 10.35 There are two options for establishing the consideration. The first option is the market value of the financial arrangement on the change date. The second option is the value calculated from the formula (s HC 31(5)): consideration paid to the person + expenditure – consideration paid by a person – income Where (s HC 31(5)):  consideration paid to the person is the consideration amount paid to the person before the change date;  expenditure is the amount that would have been incurred under the financial arrangement rules before the change date;  consideration paid by the person is the amount paid by the person before the change date; and  income is the income that would have been derived under the financial arrangement rules before the change date. 10.36 The consideration calculated is taken into account in the formula in s EW 31 when calculating the base price adjustment for the financial arrangement. 107 UNCLASSIFIED Impact of transitional residence Distributions from foreign trusts and non-complying trusts 10.37 Transitional residents are treated the same as non-residents under s HR 8(1)(a) when they derive a foreign-sourced amount under a number of provisions including s CW 27. This indicates that a foreign-sourced amount derived by a transitional resident that is not their employment income or income from a supply of services is exempt income. Consequently, a transitional resident who derives a foreign-sourced amount as either beneficiary income or as a taxable distribution from either a foreign or non-complying trust is treated as deriving exempt income which is excluded from assessable income under s BD 1(5). 10.38 Beneficiary income retains the character that it had when derived by the trustee because the trust provisions, such as s HC 5, are structured to retain the dual derivation of such income by both the trustee and the beneficiary as discussed at \[5.13\] and \[5.14 10.39 Although taxable distributions are a construct of the trust tax regime, it is implicit from both the ordering rules in s HC 16, and from s YD 4(13) and (18), that the source of the income or capital gains in the hands of the trustee that are subsequently included in such distributions remains relevant in characterising them for tax purposes. Refer to the discussion on taxable distributions from \[8.102\] for more detail on the relevance of source and residency for the tax treatment to non-residents. 10.40 Where a trustee of a foreign trust derives income or capital gains sourced from New Zealand, a taxable distribution to a beneficiary is treated as income having a New Zealand source to the same extent under s YD 4(13) and (18). The ordering rules in s HC 16 will determine the character of the taxable distribution. This means taxable distributions will not be exempt to transitional residents under s CW 27 as foreign-sourced amounts to the extent that they comprise accumulated income and associated party capital gain amounts sourced from New Zealand. 10.41 A transitional resident who derives New Zealand-sourced beneficiary income or taxable distributions from foreign trusts must include this in their assessable income. New Zealand-sourced income included in taxable distributions to transitional residents from non-complying trusts is excluded income taxable to the transitional resident at 45%. Distributions from complying trusts 10.42 Beneficiary income retains its underlying character (see \[5.13\]). Consequently, a transitional resident receiving beneficiary income will be taxed on New Zealand-sourced income within that distribution, but not on other foreign- sourced amounts. Taxation of trustee income when settlor is a transitional resident 10.43 The treatment of foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee between the date on which the settlor of that foreign trust became resident and the date on which any election is made, is determined under ss HC 25 (foreign-sourced amounts: non-resident trustees) and HC 26 (foreign-sourced amounts: resident 108 UNCLASSIFIED trustees). Section HC 25 does not make non-resident trustees liable for tax on foreign-sourced amounts while the settlor is a transitional resident, but does in the income year any settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. Section HC 26, in conjunction with s CW 54, treats foreign-sourced amounts derived by resident trustees as exempt where the settlor is a transitional resident (and the trust is a registered foreign trust that complies with certain disclosure requirements) but not in the income year the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. 10.44 A consequence of a transitional resident making further settlements after becoming resident is that the exemption in s HC 25(4) will not apply for foreign- sourced amounts derived by a non-resident trustee because a settlement has been made by a New Zealand resident. This means that from the income year in which the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident, any foreign-sourced amounts will be taxable where the trustee is non-resident. Equivalent treatment applies where the trustee is resident as the exemption for foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee under ss HC 26(1) and CW 54 also expires in the income year that a settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. 10.45 New Zealand-sourced income of a trustee of a foreign trust is taxable at all times irrespective of the status of the settlor. Liability of settlor while a transitional resident 10.46 Where a settlor makes no settlements on a foreign trust after they become resident, and the settlor has not previously been resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1989, they will not be liable under s HC 29(5) for the tax on trustee income of that trust unless they make an election under s HC 30. 10.47 If a settlor makes further settlements on a foreign trust with non-resident trustees while they are a transitional resident, they would be liable for tax on the New Zealand-sourced trustee income from the time they made that settlement under s HC 29(1). From the beginning of the income year in which they cease to be a transitional resident, they will be liable for tax on the foreign- sourced amounts of the trustee through the combination of ss HC 25(2) and HC 29(1). 10.48 If a settlor makes settlements on a foreign trust with a resident trustee while a transitional resident, s HC 29(3) will apply to exclude the settlor from liability on trustee income. Issues with pre-migration trusts 10.49 Where immigrants to New Zealand and returning New Zealanders who have been absent for more than 10 years settle a trust prior to coming to New Zealand, they may intend to have it treated as a non-complying trust under s HC 30(4) after it ceases to be a foreign trust, without the settlor having agency liability on trustee income under s HC 29(2). But agency liability will be triggered if any further settlements occur while they are resident. This can arise for example if the settlor has made a loan to the trust and fails to charge market rate interest on it. Also returning New Zealanders will continue to have an agency liability on trustee income of a non-complying trust they have settled under s HC 29(5) if they had previously been resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1987. 109 UNCLASSIFIED Taxation of distributions to new or returning residents who are not transitional residents Beneficiary income 10.50 The residency of a beneficiary determines how they are taxed on beneficiary income. A newly resident beneficiary who is not or who has ceased to be a transitional resident is taxable at marginal rates on all beneficiary income in the same manner as any resident. Taxable distributions 10.51 Newly resident beneficiaries who are not or who have ceased to be transitional residents are taxed on taxable distributions at applicable rates being their marginal rate for such distributions from foreign trusts and 45% for non- complying trusts. New Zealanders returning within 5 years 10.52 If a person ceases to be resident and then returns to New Zealand within 5 years and resumes tax residency, they are taxed on all beneficiary income and taxable distributions that they derived over the period of absence from foreign and non-complying trusts. The intention of s HC 23 is to prevent such beneficiaries from changing residence so as to defeat the trust rules. 10.53 Where s HC 23 applies, the resulting income is treated under s CV 15 as being derived on the day the person becomes resident again. 10.54 Any beneficiary income taxable under s HC 23 may be accompanied by relevant foreign tax credits or NRWT. However, s LJ 6(2) permits foreign tax credits on taxable distributions only if they are substantially the same as NRWT. This means no credit is available for underlying tax paid on that type of income, the credit is only for tax in the nature of a withholding tax imposed on non- residents. Trustees immigrating to New Zealand 10.55 If a trustee migrates to New Zealand and becomes resident that alone will not result in the trust being taxable, because prime liability on foreign-sourced amounts is determined by the residency of the settlor and beneficiaries and the source of the income. If the settlor is non-resident, no beneficiaries are resident and no income has a New Zealand source, the trustee would have no liability for New Zealand tax in their capacity as trustee. 10.56 A resident trustee must, however, disclose details of trusts they are a trustee of with non-resident settlors (foreign trusts) under s 59B of the TAA. These obligations are discussed in Part 13 of this Interpretation Statement. 10.57 A trustee will only be a transitional resident under s HR 8 in their personal capacity as a “natural person”, which excludes their status as a trustee. Therefore, s CW 27 does not apply to exempt foreign-sourced amounts from tax that a transitional resident derives as a trustee. 110 UNCLASSIFIED Part 11 Exit from the trust regime Impact of settlor leaving New Zealand 11.1 New Zealand does not have a residence test for trusts. Therefore, there is no specific regime for the emigration of trusts (unlike for companies). 11.2 The taxation of trustee income is generally dependent on the residence of the settlor. Therefore, if the tax residence of a New Zealand settlor changes, there may be tax implications in relation to the treatment of trustee income. Specifically, foreign-sourced amounts derived by a non-resident trustee are liable to tax under s HC 25 where a settlor is resident and not a transitional resident. Foreign-sourced amounts derived by a resident trustee are taxable, if the settlor is resident and not a transitional resident, because the tax exemption for foreign-sourced trustee income in ss HC 26 and CW 54 does not apply in such circumstances. New Zealand-sourced income of a trustee is always taxable. However, the tax rate on New Zealand-sourced trustee income will depend on the type of income, the residence of the trustees, whether or not the trustees have made an election under s HC 33, and the potential relevance of a double tax treaty (eg, in setting rates of NRWT on interest, dividends and royalties). Therefore, it will not always be the case that the flat trustee rate of 33% will be applicable. 11.3 If all the settlors of a complying trust leave New Zealand, ss HC 26(1) and CW 54 will result in the foreign-sourced amounts of a resident trustee being exempt income in the income year following the departure of the last of the settlors. The same applies under s HC 25 where the trustee is non-resident. If the trustee does not pay tax on worldwide trustee income, the trust will cease to be a complying trust at the time it next makes a distribution. 11.4 If complying trust status is lost, under s HC 10(1)(a) the trust will become a non-complying trust and subject to the ordering rules in s HC 16 (discussed in Part 8 of this Interpretation Statement) with taxable distributions derived by any New Zealand resident beneficiaries attracting tax at 45%. New Zealand-sourced taxable distributions to non-resident beneficiaries will also be subject to tax at 45%. 11.5 Sections HC 33(1B) and HC 10(1)(ab) permit the trustee of a complying trust that ceases to meet the requirements under s HC 10(1)(a) to retain that status even after the last settlor leaves New Zealand. From 1 April 2008, a trustee in this position can be treated as having made an election to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee under s HC 33 just by indicating that it is a complying trust in the annual return and continuing to pay tax on the worldwide trustee income before making any distribution. 11.6 Consequently, when a settlor leaves New Zealand they can effectively choose to migrate their trust and thereafter have it treated as a non-complying trust or carry on as a complying trust and pay full tax in New Zealand on the worldwide trustee income. Impact of trustee leaving New Zealand 11.7 Many other countries base the tax residence of trusts on the residence of the trustee. Consequently, even if one trustee of a complying trust adopts 111 UNCLASSIFIED residency in another country it may result in the new country of residence seeking to tax the trustee income of that trust. 11.8 In New Zealand, the residency of the trustee is not the main factor in determining the liability of the trustee to pay tax on trustee income. Where a trustee ceases to be New Zealand resident, that trustee will remain liable for tax on worldwide trustee income of a trust settled by a person who remains resident in New Zealand, including in the income year such a settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. Tax liability on foreign-sourced amounts is imposed under s HC 25 on foreign trustees where the settlor is resident and not a transitional resident. New Zealand-sourced income derived by a non-resident trustee in such a situation will be taxable based on the source rules in s YD 4. Beneficiaries ceasing to be resident in New Zealand 11.9 A beneficiary of a complying trust who ceases to be New Zealand tax resident is treated for tax purposes in the same manner as any non-resident beneficiary. Tax is paid by the trustee as their agent or withheld at applicable NRWT rates from beneficiary income that is New Zealand-sourced. 11.10 A taxable distribution from a foreign trust to a non-resident beneficiary is taxable to the same extent as the income has a New Zealand source under s YD 4(13) and (18). The ordering rules in s HC 16 are applied to determine the character of the amounts distributed as accumulated income and associated party capital gains. 11.11 A taxable distribution from a non-complying trust to a non-resident beneficiary is taxed at 45% under s BF 1(b) to the extent that it consists of New Zealand-sourced income and capital gains but not foreign-sourced amounts. 11.12 Beneficiary income derived by a non-resident is taxed if it has a New Zealand source. Foreign-sourced amounts are not assessable income of a non-resident under s BD 1(5). 112 UNCLASSIFIED Part 12 Associated persons Overview 12.1 Subpart YB sets out the rules for determining when persons will be associated for tax purposes. Several provisions in subpart YB deal with trusts. The associated persons rules relating to trusts were strengthened from 1 April 2010 with some exceptions where the rules apply to land transactions. 12.2 The associated persons rules are designed to prevent changes to the tax treatment of a transaction by conducting it with or flowing it through an associated party. They also treat transactions between associated persons as being undertaken at arm’s length for tax purposes. A major area of concern has been the use of trusts by property developers to move property transactions from a taxable business to a non-taxable capital investment by a related party trust. As a result, the rules were strengthened in relation to trusts. See Inland Revenue Department NZ, A Guide to Associated Persons Definitions for Income Tax Purposes IR 620 (November 2010) at 6. 12.3 The broad rules for associated persons in the trust context can be summarised as: Associated persons rule Income tax – land Income tax – other Trustees and beneficiaries No Yes Trustee and relative of beneficiary No Yes Trustee and settlor Yes Yes Settlor and beneficiary No Yes Two trustees and same settlor Yes Yes Trustees and person with power to appoint and remove trustees Yes Yes 12.4 Several modifications apply to the trust-based tests to ensure the rules do not over-reach in their object of protecting the tax base. These modifications include: not having the beneficiary association tests, or person and the trustee for (a) a relative test, applying to land sales transactions; excluding charities as beneficiaries for the tests and excluding charitable (b) trusts from the trustee and settlor test; and not including the provision of services to a trust for less than market value (c) in the settlor definition for associated person tests. Trust-specific associated person tests 12.5 Under s YB 6(1), a trustee is associated to the beneficiaries of a trust. This rule does not apply for the purposes of the “land provisions” under s YB 6(2). “Land provisions” is defined in s YA 1 to cover numerous land-related transactions: 113 UNCLASSIFIED land provisions means the following provisions: (a) sections CB 7 to CB 11 (which relate to certain land transactions), except CB 8 (Disposal: land used for landfill, if notice of election): (b) section CB 15 (Transactions between associated persons): (bba) section CC 1B (Consideration relating to grant, renewal, extension, or transfer of leasehold estate or licence): (bbab) section EE 67 (Other definitions): (bb) section EI 4B (Consideration for agreement to grant, renew, extend, or transfer leasehold estate or licence): (c) sections FB 3 to FB 5 (which relate to the transfer of land on a settlement of relationship property) 12.6 Beneficiaries are defined under s YB 6(1) to include those that have benefited under a trust as well as those eligible to benefit. This latter class includes any person named by the trustee as a beneficiary as well as discretionary beneficiaries that are named or within a designated class. 12.7 Importantly, where trustees or other persons have a general power to appoint beneficiaries, any person yet to be appointed is not included as a beneficiary. For elaboration of the policy on when a person under a trust is eligible to benefit, see “Income Tax: Associated Persons”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 9 (February 1996): 25. 12.8 Exceptions for certain employer trusts exist under s YB 15, the bonus bonds unit trust and energy consumer trusts (lines trusts) under s YB 16(1), as well as charities under s YB 16(2). Community trusts that hold shares in the successor companies to the former trustee banks are excluded, because, technically, these “purpose” trusts do not have beneficiaries at law. 12.9 Two persons are associated under s YB 5(1) if one is a trustee and the other is associated under the “two relatives test” with a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust. The “two relatives test” is in s YB 4 and determines that two relatives are associated if they are within two degrees of relationship; they are married, in a civil union or in a de facto relationship; or if one person is within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person’s spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner. Again the provision does not apply to land provisions under s YB 5(2), and there is also the same exception under s YB 16(1) described above. A trustee will be associated to the person’s relatives within the second degree (ie, their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner, parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings, and parents of the person’s spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner). 12.10 Trusts with a common settlor are associated under s YB 7. Under this provision two persons who are married, in a civil union or in a de facto relationship are treated as the same person to prevent circumvention by the use of mirror trusts. Further, for the purposes of s YB 7, a settlor does not include someone who provides services to the trusts for less than market value, for example a family member who provides accounting services to a family trust for no consideration (s YB 10). Also s YB 7 does not apply where a trust is only for the benefit of employees (s YB 15). 114 UNCLASSIFIED 12.11 A trustee and a settlor are associated under s YB 8. The same exceptions listed in \[12.10\] apply with the addition of an exception for charitable trusts under s YB 8(2). 12.12 A settlor and any beneficiary of the trust are associated under s YB 9. Again, the same exceptions described in \[12.10\] apply. 12.13 The associated persons rules do not apply to associate a deceased person with their estate. While a trustee is defined as including an executor and an administrator, an estate is not the same as a trust, as discussed in Part 9 of this Interpretation Statement (in relation to deceased estates). In addition, under ss FC 1 and FC 2, a transfer of a deceased person’s assets to their executor is treated as a transfer for market value. This means a deceased person is not a “settlor” of their estate because there is no transfer for less than market value. 12.14 A trustee and a person with power to appoint or remove a trustee are associated under s YB 11. An exception exists for certain employer trusts under s YB 15. 12.15 Corporate trustees are not looked through when testing association. 12.16 For more detail on the associated persons regime and for an explanation of the reasoning behind various exclusions such as charities and energy consumer trusts (lines trusts) with examples, see Inland Revenue Department NZ, A Guide to Associated Persons Definitions for Income Tax Purposes IR 620 (November 2010). 115 UNCLASSIFIED Part 13 Compliance Introduction 13.1 There are tax obligations placed on settlors, trustees and beneficiaries of trusts. Many such obligations are common to all taxpayers (eg, the obligation to pay tax on the due date), and are not dealt with in this Interpretation Statement. Rather, this part of the Interpretation Statement explains the compliance obligations that are unique to trusts. Settlor disclosure obligations where no resident trustee 13.2 Section 59 of the TAA requires a resident who makes a settlement on a trust after 17 December 1987 to disclose that settlement to the Commissioner if there is: no resident trustee, at the time of settlement; or (a) a resident trustee and later there are no resident trustees, then when (b) there are no resident trustees. 13.3 Where a nominee settlor (as set out in s YB 21) is resident, they must make the disclosure regarding the person deemed to be the settlor under s YB 21, if there is no resident trustee at settlement. 13.4 Disclosure must be made on the prescribed form Settlors of Trusts Disclosure IR 462 (January 2008) within 3 months of the date when the settlement is made on non-resident trustees or all trustees become non-resident, as the case may be. 13.5 The disclosure requirement does not apply to superannuation funds or to any person in respect of a superannuation fund. Consequently, members of such schemes do not have to disclose their contributions. It also does not apply before 1 April 2009 to any offshore superannuation scheme classified by the Government Actuary under regs 29 or 30 of the Superannuation Schemes Regulations 1983. Disclosure details for resident settlors under s 59 13.6 Each time a settlement is made resident settlors (or their nominee settlors if applicable) must disclose under s 59(1) and (2) of the TAA using the prescribed form Settlors of Trusts Disclosure IR 462 (January 2008): the name of the trust; (a) details of the settlement (covering both the original and any later (b) settlement amounts and dates); the market value of property transferred to the trust; (c) details of consideration received by a settlor for property settled on the (d) trust; the names and addresses of trustees and beneficiaries; (e) copies of the trust deed and any amending deeds; (f) 116 UNCLASSIFIED the name and address of persons for whom a nominee is acting; (g) the full legal description and address of any real property settled on a (h) trust; the number, type and name of the company and country of incorporation (i) of any shares settled; details of the parties, interest rate and term of financial arrangements (j) settled; the consideration paid and the nature of the services provided that are (k) settlements; and any other information the Commissioner requires. (l) 13.7 Disclosure on the prescribed form is required within 3 months of the date of settlement or of the date on which there is no trustee of the trust resident in New Zealand. Disclosure obligations for resident trustee of foreign trust 13.8 Resident foreign trustees are required to register foreign trusts with Inland Revenue (s 59B(2) of the TAA). A “resident foreign trustee” is defined in s 3(1) of the TAA as a New Zealand tax resident who alone or jointly acts as a trustee of a foreign trust that is not a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. 13.9 A resident foreign trustee must apply to register the foreign trust within 30 days of the date of formation, or the date any trustee first becomes a resident foreign trustee (s 59C(1)(b) of the TAA). Sections 59C(3) and (4) of the TAA provide for a “grace period” for registration if all of the trustees of a foreign trust are natural persons not in the business of providing trustee services, and none of them have been resident foreign trustees before. In that case, the time limit for application extends to four years and 30 days from the first date on which the foreign trust had a resident foreign trustee. This concession recognises that some people may become resident foreign trustees due to changes of circumstances, and allows them time to understand their obligations. However, a trust must apply for registration by the end of this “grace period” to obtain the benefit of the tax exemption for foreign-sourced amounts under ss HC 26 and CW 54 for the income years during the “grace period”. This is the case even if the trust has ceased to be a foreign trust by the time the “grace period” ends. 13.10 The resident foreign trustee must provide the following information about a foreign trust at the time of registration (s 59B(3) of the TAA):  the name of the trust;  information about all settlements made on the trust, including the provision of services to the trust for less than market value, other than minor services that are incidental to the activities of the trust (where all the trustees of the foreign trust are natural persons who are not in the business of providing trustee services, it will only be necessary to provide information about settlements for the four years prior to the earliest date that the trust was required to be registered);  the name, email address, physical address, jurisdiction of tax residence, and taxpayer identification number of all settlors, beneficiaries, trustees 117 UNCLASSIFIED and persons with control over the trust (eg, protectors and people with powers of appointment); and  a copy of the trust deed or functional equivalent, including any documents that amend or supplement the trust deed. 13.11 The resident foreign trustee must also provide a signed declaration that each person referred to on the registration form has either been informed of, and has agreed to provide the information necessary for compliance with these rules, and the requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009, is deceased or, despite the efforts of the resident foreign trustee, cannot be located (s 59B(4) of the TAA). 13.12 Resident foreign trustees must also comply with on-going disclosure requirements. These disclosure requirements include:  A requirement to file annual returns, including the trust’s financial statements, and details of any settlements and distributions made over the year. The due date for filing the return is six months after the trust’s balance date or by 30 September if the trust does not have a balance date (s 59D of the TAA).  A requirement to provide any updates to the information provided at registration within 30 days after becoming aware of the alteration (ss 59B(5) and 59C(2) of the TAA).  General record keeping requirements (s 22 of the TAA) (discussed further from \[13.20\]). 13.13 An initial registration fee of $270 and annual filing fees of $50 are payable. However, no fees are payable where all resident foreign trustees of the foreign trust are natural persons that are not in the business of providing trustee services (s 59E of the TAA). 13.14 Where there is more than one resident foreign trustee, all of the resident foreign trustees will be responsible for the performance of the trustee obligations (s 59B(7) of the TAA). However, the trustee that applies for registration of the trust will be the “contact trustee”, and will be responsible for all communication with Inland Revenue (s 59B(3) of the TAA). If the contact trustee wishes to relinquish that role, or expects to cease being a resident foreign trustee for the trust, they must inform Inland Revenue of the date this will occur, the contact details for any replacement contact trustee, and their updated contact details (s 59B(6) of the TAA). 13.15 A trust that has a dual status as both a complying trust and a foreign trust must still meet the registration and on-going disclosure requirements of a foreign trust if it has a resident foreign trustee. 13.16 Failing to comply with the registration and on-going disclosure requirements will mean that the foreign trust will cease to be eligible for an exemption from tax on its foreign-sourced income under ss CW 54 and HC 26. 13.17 Information obtained by Inland Revenue about foreign trusts can be shared with the Department of Internal Affairs, the New Zealand Police and the Overseas Investment Office. In addition, the information can be shared internationally with New Zealand’s tax treaty partners. 118 UNCLASSIFIED 13.18 For further information on the foreign trust disclosure rules, refer to the Policy and Strategy special report Foreign trust disclosure rules (March 2017). This report also discusses the transitional rules that are applicable for foreign trusts that existed on 21 February 2017 when the new rules were enacted. Disclosure obligations for beneficiaries 13.19 Beneficiaries who receive beneficiary income and taxable distributions from foreign or non-complying trusts must fill in form Schedule of beneficiary’s estate or trust income IR 307 (September 2014). A new form must be completed for each trust that income is received from. The form is attached to the beneficiary’s tax return and filed with it. Records to be kept by resident foreign trustee 13.20 A resident foreign trustee is obliged to keep (and produce on request) records that disclose the history and operation of the trust under s 22(7)(d) of the TAA. This information need not include the 2-year concession period referred to above in s 59B(3), but must otherwise cover: a copy of the trust deed and any other constitutional documents; (a) settlement and distribution details made on or by the trust; (b) a record of the assets and liabilities of the trust; and (c) records of the accounting information system if the trust carries on a (d) business, which extends to the charts and codes of accounts, relevant accounting system instruction manuals, and relevant system and programme documentation used in every income year to administer the trust. 13.21 If there is more than one resident foreign trustee, they may appoint one to be the official agent for recordkeeping duties under s 22(2C) of the TAA. This option is also available for making disclosure under s 59B(7). 13.22 Permission can be obtained from the Commissioner to keep records in languages other than English and to keep records off-shore under s 22(2BA) of the TAA. For information about when and how the Commissioner may authorise keeping records offshore and in languages other than English, see “SPS 13/01: Retention of business records in electronic format, application to store records offshore and application to keep records in Māori”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 3 (April 2013): 8. Sanctions for non-compliance 13.23 If a settlor or trustee knowingly does not provide information about a trust or knowingly does not keep proper records, a penalty can be imposed on them under s 143A of the TAA. The penalty is a fine of up to $50,000 for knowingly providing false information or knowingly not disclosing or imprisonment for up to 5 years or both. A person who aids, abets or incites either of these offences is liable to the same fine or term of imprisonment. 119 UNCLASSIFIED 13.24 The penalty under s 143A of the TAA will not apply if a resident foreign trustee convicted of knowingly not providing information subsequently provides that information. 13.25 The Commissioner’s policy is that penalties for failure to make disclosure will not apply if a resident foreign trustee is unaware of the disclosure obligations. The lack of awareness is a question of fact determined on a case-by-case basis. For more information concerning the obligations, duties and implications in this area, see “New Disclosure and Record-Keeping Rules for Foreign Trusts”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006): 107 at 110. Default assessments 13.26 Section 93B of the TAA empowers the Commissioner to make default assessments in three situations relevant in this context under that Act; that is, where a person: has failed to disclose the details of a trust under s 59 of the TAA; (a) has failed to provide information in relation to a trust requested by the (b) Commissioner under s 17 of the TAA; and is unable to obtain sufficient information to calculate the trustee income of (c) the trust. 13.27 In any of these circumstances, the Commissioner may determine (in a fair and reasonable manner) the amount of trustee income for the income year. Requests for information about trusts from other countries 13.28 Inland Revenue provides information about a foreign trust to the Australian Tax Office under the Exchange of Information article in the double tax treaty between New Zealand and Australia, if the resident foreign trustee discloses that a settlor of the foreign trust is an Australian resident. 13.29 Inland Revenue also provides information about foreign trusts to other countries New Zealand has agreements with on a case-by-case basis when a treaty partner makes a valid request. Inland Revenue is permitted to require information to be provided under s 17 of the TAA by a person if considered necessary to satisfy New Zealand’s treaty obligations subject to tax confidentiality laws in ss 20 and 20B of the TAA and litigation privilege if relevant. 13.30 There is no obligation to send information to treaty partners if there is considered to be a risk in how that information will be used or disclosed. There are also restrictions on disclosure where the information is contrary to public policy, or would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process. 13.31 However, changes have been made to the ITA 2007 and the TAA to incorporate the G20/OECD standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (AEOI). The AEOI focuses on imposing due diligence and reporting obligations on certain financial institutions, broadly involving identifying and reporting prescribed information about relevant foreign tax residents that hold (or in certain circumstances control) accounts with such 120 UNCLASSIFIED institutions. These obligations are in the CRS, which is supplemented by OECD Commentary. The approach is to incorporate CRS directly into law by reference and to require application of the CRS consistently with the OECD Commentary. Because of similarities, the CRS provisions have been merged with the FATCA framework in part 11B of the TAA. 13.32 The CRS includes certain unit trusts and managed investment trusts in the term “financial institution”. Settlors, mandatory beneficiaries, discretionary beneficiaries (if they receive distributions), any other natural persons that have effective control over the trust, and any persons that provide a loan (or other debt funding) to the trust, will be deemed to hold a “financial account” with such a financial institution trust. 13.33 From 1 July 2017 trusts that are Reporting New Zealand financial institutions must commence CRS due diligence reviews and thereafter an annual reporting regime commences. 13.34 If a trust is not a financial institution, but is a type of passive entity (known as a passive non-financial entity) that holds an account with a financial institution, it may be asked by that institution to confirm who its controlling persons are (ie, when that financial institution is carrying out its own due diligence on the trust’s account). The trust’s controlling persons are the settlors, trustees, protectors, beneficiaries, and any other natural person that controls the trust. 13.35 For more guidance on AEOI/CRS obligations for trusts that are financial institutions refer to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 on the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. Inland Revenue has also published two comprehensive guides (see Inland Revenue Department NZ, Is the trust a Reporting NZFI under CRS? IR 1052 (August 2017) and Inland Revenue Department NZ, Family trust obligations under the CRS IR 1053 (August 2017)). The guides deal with the AEOI standard and the implementation legislation at a detailed technical level. 13.36 Inland Revenue has also published guidance on the operation of the FATCA framework as it applies to trusts in Inland Revenue Department NZ, Trust guidance notes: Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) IR 1087 (October 2017). Filing of tax returns 13.37 Under s 59(3) of the TAA, trustees are required to make a return of all income derived by the trustees for each separate trust they are responsible for. This extends to both trustee income and beneficiary income. Superannuation funds are included in this obligation. This requirement also applies to settlors or beneficiaries who make an election to satisfy the income tax liability of a trustee of a trust under s HC 33. 13.38 One return for each trust must be filed, if it derives income. Co-trustees file jointly and do not include any of their personal income. The trustee is liable for tax on all income as if beneficially entitled under s HC 24. 13.39 Each year a trust must file the tax return Income Tax Return: Estate or Trust IR 6 (March 2016) and include: all income derived by the trust; (a) 121 UNCLASSIFIED the tax credits relating to that income; (b) the allocation of income between trustee income and beneficiary income; (c) and any taxable distributions made. (d) The completed form Estate or Trust Beneficiary Details IR 6B (March 2016) should be attached to the IR 6. 13.40 From 16 November 2015 s 43B of the TAA permits a trustee of a trust that is required to file a tax return to make a declaration that the trust is a non-active trust. The declaration is made using the form Non-Active Trust Declaration IR 633 (November 2015). The trustee is then not required to file a tax return, and must inform the Commissioner if that status changes. Previously, such trusts were required to file nil tax returns. However, the Commissioner has the power to override a non-active trust declaration and request that a trust files a tax return. This measure provides relief to trusts with little or no income and, in particular, those trusts owning houses on land occupied by beneficiaries who do not pay rent who are required to have IRD numbers if such land is either transferred or received. 13.41 Under s 43B(1)(a) of the TAA, a trustee of a complying trust is not required to file an income tax return if throughout the year: the trust is a non-active trust, meaning: (a) (i) the trust has not derived or been deemed to derive any income; (ii) the trust has no deductions; (iii) the trust has had no transactions involving assets of the trust that gave rise to income for the trust; and (iv) the trust has not had any fringe benefits for current or former employees; and the trust meets the criteria to be a complying trust under s HC 10. (b) 13.42 In determining the non-active status of the trust the following minimal income and expense items can be ignored to ease the compliance burden: reasonable fees paid to “professional trustees” (as defined in s 20 of the (a) TAA) to administer the trust; bank charges and other minimal administration fees not exceeding $200 (b) per year; bank account interest not exceeding $200 per year; and (c) rates, insurance and other expenditure incidental to a dwelling owned by (d) the trust and incurred by beneficiaries. Allocation of tax credits 13.43 Any tax credits associated with income derived by a trustee are generally allocated in the same proportion as the income is allocated between beneficiary 122 UNCLASSIFIED income, trustee income and taxable distributions. However, there are exceptions to this general rule. Imputation credits 13.44 Imputation credits must be allocated in proportion to the total distributions received from the trust under s LE 5. The purpose of this rule is to prevent trustees from streaming imputation credits to those beneficiaries that are best able to use them. Under s LE 5, a trustee cannot allocate such credits to beneficiaries as they choose and must use this formula under s LE 5(2): (person’s distributions ÷ trust distributions) x (total beneficiary credits – person’s supplementary credits) In this formula:  person’s distributions is the total distributions for the tax year made to the person in their capacity as beneficiary;  trust distributions is the total distributions for the tax year made to all beneficiaries (in their capacity as such) including any supplementary dividends;  total beneficiary credits is the total imputation credits attached to dividends and total supplementary dividends for the tax year paid to all beneficiaries; and  person’s supplementary dividend is the total supplementary dividends for the tax year paid to the person as beneficiary of the trust. 13.45 When applying the formula, all distributions, including those of corpus and non-taxable capital gains, are taken into account, not just beneficiary income. The meaning of “distribution” is discussed from \[8.6\], and includes the use of trust property for less than market value. The formula applies whether or not the trustees have any discretion to differentiate between beneficiaries. Example 30. Allocation of imputation credits to beneficiaries A trust has three adult beneficiaries, Daniel, Rebecca and Mick, and income of $40,000, consisting of $30,000 of interest and dividends of $10,000 with $600 of attached imputation credits. The $40,000 of income is distributed between the income beneficiaries Daniel and Rebecca equally, and Mick as a capital beneficiary is distributed corpus of $20,000. The formula requires the imputation credits to be allocated like this: Beneficiary Distribution % Imputation credits Daniel $20,000 33.33 33.33% x $600 = $200 Rebecca $20,000 33.33 33.33% x $600 = $200 Mick $20,000 33.33 nil Accordingly, $200 of imputation credits are lost, because Mick’s corpus distribution is ineligible to receive them, yet it still dilutes the imputation credit entitlements of the other income beneficiaries. 13.46 Beneficiaries can claim a credit for tax paid on beneficiary income and taxable distributions and their share of tax credits in their personal tax returns. 123 UNCLASSIFIED 13.47 When dividend income is distributed to a minor beneficiary, imputation and RWT credits remain with the trustee to be assessed along with the minor beneficiary income at the trustee rate (s LE 4). However, the amount of these credits that may be attached to the distribution is calculated by ignoring the minor beneficiary rule under ss LE 5 and LF 3. Consequently, the minor beneficiaries are treated, effectively, as deriving the distribution for the purposes of the tax credit rules. Resident withholding tax 13.48 The RWT rules allow a trustee to choose to detach some or all of an RWT tax credit from distributions made to a beneficiary on a lower tax rate (Beneficiary A) and replace those detached RWT credits with a cash payment (referred to as an RWT substitution payment) (ss LB 3(4) and RE 2(7)). The trustee is then allowed to pass all, some or none of those detached tax credits to another beneficiary (Beneficiary B) (s LB 3(5)). The trustee can use tax credits not passed to a beneficiary to satisfy the tax liability on trustee income (s LE 3(5)). These rules will only apply where the trustee pays tax as agent for the beneficiary (s LE 3(7)). 13.49 The effect of these rules is that Beneficiary A does not have to seek a refund for RWT deducted over and above their marginal tax rate as they get RWT credits at their correct rate and the RWT substitution payment. The RWT substitution payment is treated by s RE 2(8) as being resident passive income that is beneficiary income. There is no obligation on the trustee to withhold RWT from the substitution payment despite its deemed status as resident passive income. These rules also allow the trustee to allocate RWT credits to beneficiaries in a way that will ensure they can best be utilised. Example 31. Trustee pays RWT substitution payment The trustees of the Egmont trust receive $1,000 of gross interest from government stock with RWT deducted at 33%. They have $670 net cash and $330 of RWT credits. They wish to distribute the income to Emma, a beneficiary with a marginal tax rate of 17.5%. They resolve to detach $155 of the RWT tax credits from the distribution to Emma, and replace them with an equal RWT substitution payment. As a result, Emma has beneficiary income of $1,000. Her marginal tax rate is 17.5%, so she will have tax to pay of $175. This tax can be satisfied using the remaining RWT credit of $175 that was distributed to her, so she has no further tax to pay. In economic terms, Emma is in the same position as having obtained a refund of the excess RWT paid. The trustees choose to allocate the detached RWT tax credit of $155 to another beneficiary, Sarah. Maori authority distributions 13.50 Where a trustee receives a taxable Maori authority distribution, with attached Maori authority tax credits (including any tax withheld from a Maori authority distribution that is treated as a Maori authority tax credit under s RE 24), and distributes that amount to a beneficiary, the trustee cannot allocate the Maori authority tax credits as they choose. Instead, s LO 2 requires the trustee to apply the following formula to determine the amount of Maori authority tax credits that can be distributed to each beneficiary: (person’s distributions ÷ trust distributions) × (total beneficiary credits − person’s supplementary dividend). 124 UNCLASSIFIED 13.51 In this formula:  person’s distributions is the total taxable Maori authority distributions for the tax year made to the person in their capacity as beneficiary of the trust;  trust distributions is the total distributions for the tax year made to all beneficiaries of the trust in their capacity as beneficiaries, and includes all supplementary dividends paid to them;  total beneficiary credits is the total Maori authority credits attached to taxable Maori authority distributions and total supplementary dividends for the tax year made to all beneficiaries of the trust in their capacity as beneficiaries; and  person’s supplementary dividend is the total supplementary dividends for the tax year paid to the person in their capacity as beneficiary of the trust. 13.52 When applying the formula, all distributions, including those of corpus and non taxable capital gains, are taken into account, not just beneficiary income. The meaning of “distribution” is discussed from \[8.6\], and includes the use of trust property for less than market value. The formula applies whether or not the trustees have any discretion to differentiate between beneficiaries. Withholding tax obligations on trustees 13.53 A trustee has an obligation to withhold RWT for distributions made to beneficiaries of resident passive income if the trustee holds an exemption certificate such that RWT was not previously withheld on that income (ss RE 3 and RE 4). “Resident passive income” is defined in s RE 2(1) to include interest, dividends, taxable Maori authority distributions and replacement payments under share-lending arrangements. The trustee will not, however, have any obligation to withhold RWT if the beneficiary holds an RWT exemption certificate (s RE 5). If the trustee does not hold an RWT exemption certificate, and receives the resident passive income in the conduct of a taxable activity, the trustee will also have an obligation to withhold RWT and pay it to the Commissioner if the trustee receives a payment of resident passive income and the correct amount of RWT has not previously been withheld (s RE 7). 13.54 If trustees are issued an RWT exemption certificate, the certificate is in the name of the trust. Therefore, the certificate continues when trustees change. However, a trustee will remain jointly and severally liable for any RWT the trust is required to pay (eg, RWT payable on distributions to beneficiaries) until written notification of retirement is provided to the Commissioner under s RE 30. 13.55 Non-resident passive income is defined in s RF 2 as meaning: income having a source in New Zealand that a non-resident derives and that consists of— (a) a dividend other than an investment society dividend: (b) a royalty: (c) an investment society dividend when the non-resident is not engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand: 125 UNCLASSIFIED (d) interest when the non-resident is not engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. 13.56 A resident trustee of a complying trust who derives passive income such as interest and dividends will frequently have RWT withheld from them by the payer. Any passive income including royalties a resident trustee distributes to a non-resident beneficiary is treated as non-resident passive income. The trustee has an obligation, at the time of payment, to withhold NRWT at the appropriate rate from the distribution under ss RF 3 and RF 4. The NRWT withheld must then be paid to Inland Revenue by the 20th of the following month or at 6- month intervals if the annual amount is less than $500. For more details on the obligations for NRWT payers, see Inland Revenue Department NZ, NRWT: Payer’s Guide IR 291 (October 2015). 13.57 The time of payment is not when the trustee receives the income, but when it is paid to a non-resident beneficiary. This includes crediting to an account or being dealt with in their interest or on their behalf as well as when vested absolutely in their interest. 13.58 If RWT has already been deducted from the income, then, under s RF 5, the RWT paid is used to offset the NRWT payable. If more RWT has been withheld than the NRWT payable, the non-resident beneficiary can file a tax return to seek a refund of the excess. If the RWT is less than the NRWT payable, then the trustee must withhold the difference as NRWT from the payment. 13.59 The NRWT is payable on the amount actually paid to the beneficiary because this is gross income of the beneficiary. The trustee may not have passed on all the income derived because the trustee has funded some or all of its expenses from that income. In this situation, the part of the income retained to meet expenses will be trustee income. If, however, any charges are made by the trustee directly to the non-resident beneficiary in relation to the distribution, such as handling fees or commissions, then the amount subject to NRWT is the amount paid before these charges are deducted. 13.60 If a non-resident beneficiary has a fixed entitlement under the terms of the trust to any non-resident passive income the trustee can arrange for the payer at source to deduct NRWT at the appropriate rate, or have approved issuer levy (AIL) paid on payments of interest if applicable, rather than have the trustee attend to this. The trustee will need to prove the beneficiary’s entitlement to the payer’s satisfaction. 13.61 If a trustee distributes other New Zealand-sourced income (eg, rents) to non- residents as either beneficiary income or taxable distributions, the trustee must pay tax as agent for the beneficiary at their relevant marginal tax rate under s HC 32. Consequently, the trustee will routinely deduct that tax from the distribution to fund its obligation. Agency obligations for trustees and settlors Trustee and settlor agency liability 13.62 Where a beneficiary derives beneficiary income or a taxable distribution during any income year the trustee is liable to satisfy the income tax liability of the beneficiary on that income as their agent under s HC 32. This means the agency provisions in subpart HD (Agents) apply. This agency liability does not 126 UNCLASSIFIED apply to distributions from community trusts under ss HC 32(2) and HD 12(1) since the beneficiaries of community trusts account for their own tax. 13.63 Section HD 3(2) requires every person who is an agent to make returns of the income for which the person is an agent. A trustee deriving income must file an annual tax return IR 6 (March 2016), attaching the form Estate or Trust Beneficiary Details IR 6B (March 2016) to record the income distributed and tax paid for each beneficiary. 13.64 An agent is assessed on such income as if the agent were the principal. This means the trustee is personally liable for tax on beneficiary income and taxable distributions as if that income were the trustee’s income. 13.65 Section HD 4(a) ensures the liability of the agent (trustee) does not release the principal (beneficiary) from liability for their tax obligations. Further, under s HD 2, any assessment of the agent for tax does not preclude an assessment of the principal for the same tax and vice versa. Consequently, the trustee and beneficiary are jointly and severally liable for tax on beneficiary income and on taxable distributions. In practical terms, these provisions are used as a collection mechanism, but are never used to collect more than 100% of the tax due. The beneficiary remains liable to furnish returns and to assessment for tax on beneficiary income and taxable distributions. 13.66 Section HC 29(2) sets out a settlor’s liability for tax as agent of a trustee. It does not apply where there is a resident trustee for the full income year and from the time of the initial settlement on a trust to the end of that first income year (s HC 29(3)). The settlor will also have no liability if they were not resident in New Zealand when any settlement was made on the trust, and they were not, after 17 December 2017, previously resident in New Zealand (s HC 29(5)). Consequently, s HC 29 routinely applies to settlors of non-complying trusts. The intention of the provision is to enable tax to be captured from resident settlors on trustee income of non-complying trusts when trustees are non-resident. 13.67 Where there is more than one settlor, they are jointly and severally liable for tax on that income. The settlor’s liability does not, however, extend to the trustees’ liability for income tax as agent for beneficiaries under s HC 32. 13.68 Settlor liability applies to trusts (other than charitable trusts and superannuation funds) where a settlement was made to or for the benefit of a trust after 17 December 1987. It does not apply under s HC 29(4)(c) where the trustee income is derived from a settlor remitting an amount under a financial arrangement. Trustee liability as agent of beneficiary (s HC 32) Residency of a trustee is not relevant 13.69 The residence of a trustee is not relevant for the purposes of s HC 32. A trustee is liable for tax as agent on beneficiary income and taxable distributions whether the trustee is resident or not. 13.70 When a beneficiary is non-resident, the trustee’s agency liability is limited to income sourced from New Zealand that the beneficiary derives. When a trustee fails to meet a resident beneficiary’s tax obligations, the liability falls under s HD 4 on the beneficiary. 127 UNCLASSIFIED Beneficiary may undertake the duties with consent 13.71 Under s HD 4(b), if the Commissioner agrees, the beneficiary and trustee may decide that a beneficiary is to undertake the duties of making assessments, providing returns, and satisfying the beneficiary’s tax liability rather than the trustee. Where this occurs, the trustee is not relieved from having to file a return for the trust’s other income. If the beneficiary fails to perform its direct assessment duties, the trustee remains personally liable for the beneficiary’s tax liability under s HD 4(a). Calculating the tax payable by the trustee as agent 13.72 Section HD 7 prescribes that the rate of tax for which an agent is assessable and liable is determined by reference to the taxable income of the principal. However, tax is payable on the amount of agency income only as a proportion of the taxable income of that principal. This means a trustee must first calculate the tax payable on the total taxable income of the beneficiary and then determine the portion referable to just the beneficiary’s income and taxable distributions. 13.73 For example, if during the income year ending 31 March 2016 an individual beneficiary derives beneficiary income of $5,000 and total taxable income, (including the beneficiary income) of $50,000, the tax payable by the trustee on the beneficiary income would be calculated as follows: Tax payable on taxable income at current marginal rates $48,000 × (10.5% to $14,000 then 17.5%) = $7,420 $2,000 × 30% = $600 Total = $8,020 Tax payable on beneficiary income $8,020 × ($5,000 ÷ $50,000) = $802 13.74 Where a beneficiary derives a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust the taxable distribution is assessable at the rate of 45% (s HC 34 and in sch 1, part A, cl 4). Consequently, the amount of tax is calculated at the flat rate of 45% on such a distribution rather than using the method described above. 13.75 In practical terms, where the trustee has paid tax on beneficiary income or on a taxable distribution in full, the beneficiary will not be required to pay tax on that income. If the trustee pays tax on the beneficiary income or taxable distribution but the amount paid is less than the correct amount, the beneficiary will be required to pay the difference; if they do not, the trustee remains liable. Practically, ensuring that the correct amount of tax is paid will require communication between the trustee and the beneficiary. Right of recovery against beneficiary 13.76 Under s HD 5(2), when an agent pays tax, the agent may recover the amount from the principal, or the agent may deduct the amount from any money held that belongs to the principal. Therefore, a trustee has an effective right of indemnity against a beneficiary for any tax paid as their agent. Section HD 5(3) permits an agent to retain an amount out of money belonging or payable to the principal that is reasonably sufficient to pay the tax when it is due or in a later 128 UNCLASSIFIED income year. As a result, where the trustee has not yet paid tax on beneficiary income or on a taxable distribution, the trustee may deduct an appropriate amount from either the income or distribution to cover the tax. Settlor agency liability on trustee income (s HC 29) 13.77 Where a settlement has been made on a trust after 17 December 1987 and during any income year the trustee derives trustee income, any settlor of the trust who is resident in New Zealand at any time during that income year is liable to income tax on the trustee income for the entire income year as agent of the trustee. 13.78 Under s HC 29(2) the settlor liability for trustee income does not extend to beneficiary income for which the trustee is liable as agent under s HC 32. The settlor has a statutory right of indemnity against the trustee for any tax paid by the settlor on trustee income in s HD 5(2) and (3). 13.79 The same agency consequences applicable to trustees liable as agent for beneficiaries apply to settlors in this context. Section HD 3(2) requires every agent to make returns of the agency income that the principal is required to make and must satisfy their principal’s tax liability. Under s HD 2, the principal and agent are jointly and severally liable for the tax obligations and the liability of one remains despite the assessment of the other. Therefore, the Commissioner may assess the settlor for income tax on trustee income whether or not the Commissioner also assesses the trustee for income tax on such income. There is no requirement for the Commissioner to assess the trustee on the trustee income and to attempt to collect the tax from the trustee before an assessment can be made on the settlor. Where an assessment is made on the settlor, this does not preclude an assessment being made on the trustee. However, these tax collection aids are never used to collect more than 100% of the tax payable. If an assessment is made on the settlor under s HD 4 this does not release the trustee from the liability to make returns and to be assessed and charged with tax. However, the Commissioner can agree that the principal is to undertake the duties on application by the parties. 13.80 Settlors are, therefore, jointly and severally liable for tax on the entire trustee income, and it is for the settlors to apportion liability among themselves. Section HC 29(6) provides an exception to this general rule. An apportionment of the liability can be made where the settlor can satisfy the Commissioner (with full disclosure) that another settlor or others settlors should be liable, having regard to their respective settlements. Exceptions to settlor liability (s HC 29(3)–(6)) Trustee resident (s HC 29(3)) 13.81 Section HC 29(3) provides that a settlor of a trust is not liable if the trust has a resident trustee for the full income year. Where the first settlement on a trust with a resident trustee is made during an income year then the settlor is not liable from that time until the year ends. 13.82 A resident corporate settlor of a foreign trust unable to elect into the complying trust regime under s HC 30 on migration to New Zealand, because the settlor is not a natural person, would be liable for the tax on trustee income under 129 UNCLASSIFIED s HC 29 unless an exception applied. The most likely exception is the presence of a New Zealand resident trustee for the entire income year during which the corporate settlor is resident under s HC 29(3). 13.83 Liability is not imposed on the settlor because a resident trustee can pay the tax. Where no trustee is resident during the income year or where a trustee is resident for only part of the income year, it may be less likely that the tax can be collected from the trustee. Superannuation funds and charities (s HC 29(4)) 13.84 Settlors of superannuation funds and charitable trusts are not liable for tax on trustee income under s HC 29(4). The trustees of superannuation funds are liable for tax on world-wide income and there is no beneficiary income for members of superannuation funds because all income is taxed to the trustee. Settlors of charitable trusts are not liable for any tax payable by charitable trustees (eg, fringe benefit tax paid on benefits provided to employees of a business run by a charity). The settlors of charitable trusts who make charitable gifts and donations might be discouraged from making such gifts and donations if they were liable for trustee income, even though that income would usually be exempt to charitable trusts under ss CW 41 and CW 42. Non-resident settlors (s HC 29(5)) 13.85 A settlor of a trust is not liable to income tax on trustee income if the settlor is a natural person who was not resident in New Zealand at the time of any settlement by that settlor and who was not resident at the time of any settlement since 17 December 1987. This rule does not apply if the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income under s HC 33. 13.86 Section HC 29(5) ties in with s HC 30, which permits a settlor of a foreign trust who becomes resident in New Zealand and is not or is no longer a transitional resident to elect to convert the trust to a complying trust. Read together, the effect of these provisions is that settlors of foreign trusts who become resident in New Zealand and are not (or cease to be) transitional residents are not liable for income tax on trustee income unless they elect to pay tax on such income within the period of a year after ceasing to be a transitional resident. Immigrants who settled trusts before becoming resident in New Zealand (and ex-patriate New Zealanders returning after more than 10 years abroad) may have made the settlement without knowledge of the New Zealand trust tax regime. Therefore, they are not automatically liable for income tax on trustee income on becoming resident and before ceasing transitional residence. In this regard, new immigrant settlors of such trusts are treated in a similar manner to resident settlors who settled trusts before 17 December 1987. For more information on the election procedure for newly resident settlors, see Part 10 of this Interpretation Statement. 13.87 For s HC 29(5) to apply the settlor must be a natural person. This is consistent with the s HC 30 election option, which also applies only to natural persons. The settlor must not have been resident in New Zealand at the time of any settlement by that settlor or by any other person after 17 December 1987. 13.88 Section HC 29(5) does not apply where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income under s HC 33. Several categories of election are covered by the 130 UNCLASSIFIED s HC 33 procedure, including elections under s HC 30 when a foreign trust can be converted to a complying trust within a year of transitional residence ceasing. If an election under s HC 33 to pay tax on trustee income is made by a trustee or beneficiary, and not by the settlor, the settlor will continue to be exempted from liability for tax on trustee income if s HC 29(5) is satisfied. Limitation of liability (s HC 29(6)) Requirements and application 13.89 Section HC 29(6) may be used to limit the liability of settlors where there is more than one settlor of the trust. It provides that a settlor is not liable to income tax on trustee income to the extent to which the settlor can satisfy the Commissioner, through full disclosure of the settlements made, that another settlor should be liable having regard to the respective settlements made. 13.90 Section HC 29(6) may apply where the settlors are all resident in New Zealand, and the settlors prefer an apportionment of liability under that provision to the joint and several liability imposed by s HC 29(2). It may also apply where there is a mix of resident and non-resident settlors, and the resident settlors seek to limit their liability to a proportionate share of the trustee income. 13.91 In determining whether the liability of a settlor should be limited, the Commissioner must have regard to the respective settlements made by the settlor and by other settlors. It is incumbent on the applicant to propose a method of apportionment that is fair and reasonable. An apportionment may be relatively simple, if different settlements result from dispositions of property to the trust. The two following methods are examples of apportionments that would be acceptable to the Commissioner: The first method is by determining, at the time of the settlement, the (a) proportion that the market value of the property settled by the settlor on the trust bears to the market value of the trust’s net assets. This proportion then remains unchanged until a further settlement is made on the trust. When a further settlement is made, the property settled earlier is revalued and the liability of the settlors is worked out by comparing the current values of all property settled on the trust. The second method is by tracing the income attributable to the property (b) settled on the trust by the settlor Example 32. Apportioning liability between settlors To illustrate the first method, assume that in year 1 Megan and Grant each transfer property with a market value of $10,000 to a trust. In year 4, Grant transfers more property with a market value of $5,000 to the trust. In year 4, the properties transferred by Megan and Grant in year 1 have each increased 50% to a market value of $15,000, so trust assets are $30,000 before Grant’s second settlement. The liability of Megan and Grant for tax on trustee income in years 1 to 3 is calculated in each of those income years as: trustee income × ( $10,000 ÷ $20,000) In year 4, the proportions of trustee income for which Megan and Grant are liable are recalculated by revaluing the property originally contributed by them and by taking into account the additional settlement made by Grant. The proportion of trustee income for which Megan would be liable to income tax would be: ($15,000 ÷ $35,000) x 100% = 43% 131 UNCLASSIFIED Grant would be liable to income tax on the remaining 57% of the trustee income. 13.92 Where different types of property are settled producing different returns, a tracing approach may be more appropriate. This approach could be used, for example, if one settlor transferred shares to a trust while another transferred land. The liability of the settlors could then be determined by allocating the income derived from the shares to that settlor and by allocating the income derived from the land to the other settlor. 13.93 The examples discussed above assume quite simple facts. In more complex cases, for example, where property settled by one settlor has been later disposed of by the trustee, or where settlements have arisen from the contribution of property or the provision of services, it may not be possible to make a sensible comparison of the settlements for the purpose of s HC 29(6). If this is the case, the provision will not apply. Whether it can be applied or not will depend on the facts of each case. Limitation of liability and complying trust definition (s HC 29(7)) 13.94 Section HC 29(7) provides that s HC 29(6) does not apply to determine whether the tax obligations for a trustee’s income tax liability are met for the purposes of s HC 10(1)(a)(ii) when meeting the requirements of a complying trust. 13.95 As a consequence, if tax is not paid on all the income of a trustee under s HC 24 because the resident settlor’s liability to tax is limited by s HC 29(6), the trust will not be a complying trust in relation to any distribution made from it. However, as noted previously at \[8.33\], a trust that loses its complying trust status can regain that status by satisfying the trustee’s income tax liability for the life of the trust up to the time of distribution. Trustee income from remittance of debt (s HC 29(4)(c)) 13.96 Under s HC 29(4)(c), a settlor is not liable to income tax on trustee income to the extent that the trustee income is derived under ss EW 31 or EZ 38 from amounts remitted by the settlor using the base price adjustment mechanism under the financial arrangement rules. 13.97 The remittance of a financial arrangement will generally give rise to income to the issuer of the financial arrangement. Where the remittance of a financial arrangement by the settlor results in trustee income, s HC 29(4)(c) exempts the settlor from liability to tax for that. However, the trustee will remain liable to tax for the trustee income arising from the remittance, and, if the trustee’s obligations for that liability are not satisfied, the trust will not be a complying trust for distribution purposes. 132 UNCLASSIFIED References Related rulings/statements “Appendix: Explanation of Taxation of Trusts”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 1, No 5 (November 1989) “Consequential amendments to Part H – Treatment of net income of certain entities”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 9 (November 1996): 23 “Death and Assets Transfers”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 7 (September 2005): 41 “Income Tax: Associated Persons”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 9 (February 1996): 25 “IS 12/02: Income Tax — Whether Income Deemed to Arise Under Tax Law, But Not Trust Law, Can Give Rise to Beneficiary Income”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 49 “IS 16/03: Tax Residence”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2 “New Disclosure and Record-Keeping Rules for Foreign Trusts”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006): 107 110 QB 15/11 “Income Tax–Scenarios on Tax Avoidance-2015” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 10 (November 2015): 27 “Qualifying Trust Status”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004): 85 “Recommendations of the Rewrite Advisory Panel: Meaning of ‘Settlor’ and ‘Settlement’”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 1 (February 2010): 42 “SPS 13/01: Retention of business records in electronic format, application to store records offshore and application to keep records in Māori”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 3 (April 2013): 8 “Taxing Beneficiary Income of Minors at 33% – the ‘Minor Beneficiary Rule’”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001): 28 “Temporary Exemption from Tax on Foreign Income for New Migrants and Certain Returning New Zealanders”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006): 103. “Withholding Tax and Payments to Overseas Beneficiaries”, Public Information Bulletin, No 29 (February 1966): 4 Subject references agency, associated persons, beneficiary, beneficiary income, charitable trust, community trusts, complying trust, corpus, deceased estates, disclosure, foreign investment funds, foreign superannuation funds, foreign trust, income tax, Māori authorities, minor beneficiary, non-complying trust, ordering rules, settlor, superannuation funds, taxable distribution, transfer of value, transitional residency, trust, trustee, trustee income, unit trusts Legislative references Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 Care of Children Act 2004 – s 15 Charities Act 2005 – ss 5 and 13 Community Trusts Act 1999 – s 4 Domestic Violence Act 1995 – s 2 Energy Companies Act 1992 – ss 2(1), 76 Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 – s 2 (definition of “disposition of property”) Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 – s 6(1) Income Tax Act 1976 – s 226(2)(b) Income Tax Act 1994 Income Tax Act 2004 Income Tax Act 2007 – ss BC 4, BD 1, BF 1, BG 1, CB 6, CB 22, CC 3, CD 5, CE 1, CF 3, CW 27, CW 41, CW 42, CW 52–CW 54, CV 12–CV 15, CX 40, CX 58, CX 59, CZ 19, DA 1, DA 2, DB 23, DB 32, DV 1–DV 7, DV 9, DX 1, EW 9 , EW 11, EW 31, EW 44, EW 50, EX 1, EX 19, EX 28, EZ 38, EZ 39, FC 1, FC 2, GB 22, GE 1, subpart HC (ss HC 1–HC 37), HD 2–HD 5, HD 7, HD 12, HF 2, HF 11, HR 8, HR 11, HR 12, HZ 1, HZ 2, LB 3, LE 1, LE 4, LE 5, LF 1–LF 3 , LJ 2, LJ 6, 2, MB 7, RA 9, RE 2, RE 5, RE 7– RE 9, RE 30, RF 2–RF 5, YA 1 (definitions of “charitable purpose”, “community trust”, “disposition of property”, “foreign superannuation scheme”, “income”, “international tax rules”, “land provisions”, “market value”, “pay”, “settlement”, “settlor”, “superannuation fund", “superannuation scheme”, “transfer of value”, “transfers value”, “trust rules”, “trustee”, “unit trust”), YB 4– YB 11, YB 15, YB 16, YB 21, YD 4, YZ 1, sch 1, part A, cl 3, cl 4, sch 25, part A, sch 51 Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Regulations 1995 Land and Income Tax Act 1954 – s 155 Maori Fisheries Act 2004 – ss 13, 79, 92 Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 – ss 302, 202, 351 to 360 Social Security Act 1964.

Summary Where a GST-registered trading trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary for no 2. consideration and that distribution consists of goods forming part of the trust’s taxable activity, it will be an associated supply for GST purposes. This is because the supply is between two associated persons – the trust and the beneficiary. 2 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED The supply will likely be a taxable supply as it will be made in New Zealand in the 3. course or furtherance of the GST-registered trading trust’s taxable activity. However, in certain circumstances the supply could be an exempt supply under s 14. The consideration for the supply is nil. This is because the beneficiary does not pay 4. anything for this distribution of goods. However, GST is payable based on the value of a supply, not necessarily the consideration provided by the recipient. If the beneficiary uses the goods to make taxable supplies (or intends to), the value of the supply will be the consideration paid (ie, nil). Otherwise, the value of the supply will be the open market value of the goods. The time of supply will vary depending on whether the goods vest in the beneficiary 5. with an immediate right to present possession, or with a right to future possession. It also depends on whether the goods supplied can be removed or not.  If the distribution vests property in the beneficiary with a right to present possession and the property is to be removed, then the time of supply will be at the time of the removal.  If the distribution vests property in the beneficiary with a right to present possession and the property is not to be removed, then the time of supply will be at the same time as the resolution to distribute is made. This is because the property will be immediately available to the beneficiary at that point.  If the distribution vests property in the beneficiary with a right to future possession, the time of supply is at the time the beneficiary is permitted to remove the goods. It is unlikely that the beneficiary would be permitted to remove the property until the future date stipulated in the resolution to distribute. If the goods cannot be removed, the time of supply is the future date when those goods are made available. In all cases, it is irrelevant that legal title might not have been transferred to the 6. beneficiary at the time of supply (ie, on removal or when the goods are made available). If there is a delay in the transfer of goods from the trust to the beneficiary, the 7. delay may create a bare trust relationship. This means the trustee will hold the goods as bare trustee. Distributions of goods to beneficiaries may trigger obligations on the trust to either 8. register for or deregister from GST. However, distributions of all of the trust assets or distributions resulting in a substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of the trust’s taxable activity will not of themselves trigger a liability to register for GST. Distributions of all of the trust’s assets are likely to trigger a liability to deregister from GST though. Analysis This Interpretation Statement considers the GST treatment of a distribution made 9. by a GST-registered trading trust to a beneficiary, where that distribution consists of goods forming part of the trust’s taxable activity. To determine the GST treatment of these distributions the following questions need to be considered:  Are the trust and the beneficiary “associated persons”?  Is there a supply of goods or services? 3 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED  If there is a supply, is it a taxable supply?  What is the value of the supply?  What is the time of supply? The Interpretation Statement will also consider: 10.  the effects of any delay in making a distribution; and  any GST registration and deregistration obligations that might arise as a result of a distribution. Examples are included at the end of this Interpretation Statement to illustrate some 11. of the concepts discussed. Are the trust and the beneficiary “associated persons”? If the trust and the beneficiary are associated persons, any supply made by the 12. trust to the beneficiary will be an “associated supply” (s 2) and special rules will apply for determining the value and time of that supply. Section 2A defines “associated persons”. Of relevance is s 2A(1)(f), which confirms 13. that a “trustee of a trust” and a beneficiary are associated persons, unless the beneficiary is a charitable or non-profit body. “Unincorporated body” is defined in s 2 and includes “a trustee of a trust”. 14. Section 57(2)(a) explains that where an unincorporated body carries on a taxable activity, the members of that body (the trustees) shall not themselves be registered. Section 57(2)(d) explains that in these circumstances, the registration shall be in the name of the trust. Consequently, it is the Commissioner’s view that the reference to “trustee of a 15. trust” in s 2A can also be read as a reference to the trust. The Commissioner therefore considers that a trust and a beneficiary are associated persons. Is there a supply of goods or services? Distributions of goods by a trust to a beneficiary are often made for no 16. consideration. The trust does not charge the beneficiary for the distribution and the beneficiary does not make any payment. This raises the issue of whether there is a supply for GST purposes. “Supply” is defined widely in s 5(1) to include “all forms of supply”. The courts 17. interpret the word as meaning “to furnish with or provide”. 1 In C & E v Oliver \[1980\] 1 All ER 353 (QB), a value added tax case concerning a similar definition of “supply”, Griffiths J stated at 354–355: There is no definition of “supply” in the Act itself, but it is quite clear from the language of the Act that “supply” is a word of the widest import .... “Supply” is the passing of possession in goods pursuant to an agreement whereunder the supplier agrees to part with and the recipient agrees to take possession. By “possession” is meant, in this context, control over the goods, in the sense of having the immediate facility for their use. This may or may not involve the physical removal of the goods. \[Emphasis added\] 1 Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 (HC) at 6,223. 4 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED Therefore, a supply exists where goods are distributed by a GST-registered trading 18. trust to a beneficiary, where the distribution consists of goods forming part of the trust’s taxable activity. The trust furnishes or provides the goods to the beneficiary. The trust agrees to part with possession of the goods and the beneficiary agrees to accept them. However, not all supplies by a trust to a beneficiary are distributions. For example, 19. in The Trustee, Executors and Agency Company New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076 the taxpayer trust sold the trust’s farmland to a beneficiary. This was not a distribution by the trust to the beneficiary but a sale of the trust’s assets to that person. On the facts, this was taken to be an ordinary supply in the course or furtherance of the trust’s taxable activity. This transaction was a sale and not a distribution of trust assets. Is the supply a taxable supply? Where a GST-registered trading trust makes a distribution of goods to a beneficiary 20. there will be supply for GST purposes. It must then be determined whether that supply is a taxable supply. A “taxable supply” is defined in s 2(1) as “a supply of goods and services in New 21. Zealand that is charged with tax under section 8 and includes a supply that section 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B requires to be charged at the rate of 0%”. Section 8(1) is the primary charging section: 22. Imposition of goods and services tax on supply (1) Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 15% on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after 1 October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. ... For the supply to be a taxable supply, it must be made in New Zealand “in the 23. course or furtherance of a taxable activity”. This phrase is not defined in the Act. The courts have held that the phrase “in the course of” includes “things belonging to or arising out of”, encompassing “natural incidents” and “things necessarily incidental to” the activity. 2 The courts have also held that a supply will be in the furtherance of the activity, even if it is not in the course of it, if it is made to “help, achieve, or advance” the purpose or object of the taxable activity. 3 The courts have held that a supply of goods that have been exclusively used for private purposes is not a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 4 The courts have interpreted the phrase “in the course or furtherance of a taxable 24. activity” widely to cover any supplies made “in connection with” a taxable activity, including the sale of capital assets used in carrying on a taxable activity. 5 In 2 Public Trustee v Henderson & Pollard Ltd \[1956\] NZLR 180 (Compensation Court) at 185–186; Case M129 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,839 at 2,845. 3 Case N43 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,361 at 3,366. 4 Case P4 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,024 at 4,032. No comment was made on this aspect on appeal (Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 (HC); Newman v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097 (CA)). See also Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 5 (October 1993):8, Questions We’ve Been Asked “Sale of Land was Part of Taxable Activity” in relation to the sale of land that was part of the taxpayer’s wider taxable activity although not part of its main activity. 5 Case K55 (1988) 10 NZTC 453; Hibell v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,195 (HC). 5 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED Case K55, Judge Bathgate stated that there must be a discernible relationship or nexus between the goods supplied and the taxable activity, at 457: 6 ... “In the course or furtherance of” a taxable activity is not an altogether different concept from the income tax situation of “... in gaining or producing,” the assessable income. It may be that to discover whether a supply is in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity some discernible nexus should be apparent between the activity and the supply. It would not appear inappropriate. As on the application of sec 104 of the Income Tax Act it is a question of fact and degree as to whether a supply is in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the person concerned. There must obviously be a discernible relationship between the supply and the activity in the form of a nexus for the supply to be in the course or furtherance of the activity. \[Emphasis added\] When a trustee distributes goods to a beneficiary, the supply will be connected with 25. the trust’s taxable activity if the goods distributed formed part of the taxable activity. The fact that the trust claimed an input tax deduction for the goods when acquired is evidence of the connection between the goods and the trust’s taxable activity. By distributing the goods to the beneficiary the goods are no longer available to the trust as of right (unless the beneficiary agrees to allow the trust to continue to use the goods). The discernible relationship between the taxable activity and the supply (the distribution) indicates that the supply to the beneficiary will be made in the furtherance (although not necessarily the course) of the taxable activity. The rate of GST (if any) that will apply to a distribution will depend on whether the 26. supply is a taxable supply or an exempt supply. For most supplies in New Zealand by a GST-registered trust to a beneficiary in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, the rate of GST is 15% unless the compulsory zero-rating provisions or other special rules apply (see \[68\]). In some circumstances the supply could be an exempt supply under s 14. What is the value of the supply? The value of a supply is determined under s 10. Where the supply is for 27. consideration, the value of the supply is determined under s 10(2): (2) Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,— (a) to the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: (b) to the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money,— (i) the open market value of that consideration, if subparagraph (ii) does not apply; or (ii) the value of the consideration agreed by the supplier and the recipient, if subsection (2B) applies. Where the supply is for no consideration, the value of the supply will be nil under 28. s 10(19): Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section where any supply is made for no consideration, the value of that supply shall be nil. “Consideration” is defined in s 2(1): 29. 6 See also CIR v Dormer & Anor (1997) 18 NZTC 13,466 (HC) at 13,459, Hibell, Case U37 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,353 at \[38\] and Case V16 (2002) 20 NZTC 10,182 at \[58\]. 6 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED consideration, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body When a trustee distributes goods forming part of the trust’s taxable activity to a 30. beneficiary, the beneficiary is unlikely to be required to pay anything for the property, or to act or forbear to act in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of the property. Therefore, it is likely that the consideration for the supply (the distribution) will be nil. However, both s 10(2) and s 10(19) are subject to the other provisions in s 10. In 31. particular, s 10 has special rules relating to associated supplies. As mentioned previously from \[12\], “associated supply” is defined in s 2(1) and includes a supply made between a trust and a beneficiary. The value of an “associated supply” is determined under s 10(3): 32. (3) Subject to subsections (3A), (3AB), (3B), (3C), (3D) and (8), the consideration for a supply is treated as being the open market value of the supply if— (a) the supply is made by a person for no consideration or for a consideration that is less than the open market value of the supply; and (b) the supply is an associated supply; and (c) the supply is not a fringe benefit that the supplier has, or is deemed to have, provided or granted under the FBT rules of the Income Tax Act 2007 to the recipient, being a person employed under a contract of service by the supplier. Where s 10(3) applies, it substitutes the open market value of the supply for the 33. actual consideration. Section 10(3) is subject to exceptions in ss 10(3A)–(3D). Of relevance are 34. ss 10(3A) and 10(3AB): (3A) Subsection (3) does not apply to a supply if— (a) the recipient acquired the supply for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies; and (b) the recipient is entitled to make a deduction under section 20(3) in respect of the supply, or would be entitled to make such a deduction if— (i) the amount of the deduction were determined under section 3A(3)(e) instead of under section 3A(3)(a): (ii) there were consideration for the supply: (iii) the supplier were a registered person who had complied with the requirements of the Act; and (c) the supply is not a supply of financial services to which subsection (3B) applies. (3AB) Subsection (3) does not apply to a supply of goods and services if the recipient— (a) acquires the supply for no consideration; and (b) from the time of the supply, applies the goods and services for the purpose of making taxable supplies. Sections 10(3A) and 10(3AB) apply if the beneficiary uses (or intends to use) the 35. goods to make taxable supplies. In this case (or where one of the other provisions that exclude the operation of s 10(3) applies), the ordinary provisions for valuing the supply of goods and services apply (ss 10(2) and 10(19)). This means the value of the supply will be nil. These rules prevent the beneficiary from obtaining 7 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED an input tax deduction on the open market value of the goods when the beneficiary paid nothing for the distribution, being a supply between associated persons. Therefore, if the beneficiary uses or intends to use the goods distributed to make 36. taxable supplies, the value of the supply is nil. Otherwise, the value of the supply is the open market value of the goods. What is the time of supply? Section 9(1) is the general time of supply rule. The time of supply is the earlier of 37. the time the invoice is issued or the time any payment is received: 9 Time of supply (1) Subject to this Act, for the purposes of this Act a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. For distributions from a trust to a beneficiary, the general time of supply rule is 38. overridden by the rules for associated supplies. This is because the trustee and the beneficiary are associated persons (s 2A(1)(f)) (see from \[12\] above). The time of supply rule for associated supplies is at s 9(2)(a): ... (2) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place— (a) if the supply is an associated supply,— (i) in the case of a supply of goods which are to be removed, at the time of the removal; and (ii) in the case of a supply of goods which are not to be removed, at the time when they are made available to the recipient; and ... provided that this paragraph shall not apply in any case where an invoice is issued, or any payment is made, in respect of that supply, on or before the last day for furnishing the return in relation to the taxable period during which, but for this proviso, that supply would have been made: ... The proviso at the end of s 9(2)(a) is unlikely to apply to a trust distribution made 39. for no consideration. This is because s 24(5)(a) states that a supplier is not required to provide a tax invoice if the consideration for a supply does not exceed $50. The time of supply for an associated supply will depend on whether the goods can 40. be removed or not. In all cases, it is irrelevant that legal title may not yet have been transferred to the beneficiary at the time the goods are removed or made available. Time of supply where there is an immediate right to present possession Where the beneficiary has an immediate right to present possession, the time of 41. supply is at the time of removal of the goods. If the goods cannot be removed, the time of supply is when those goods are made available. 8 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED Goods can be removed Under s 9(2)(a)(i), if the distribution vests goods in the beneficiary with an 42. immediate right to present possession, and the goods are to be removed, then the time of supply will be at the time of the removal. An example of goods that may be removed is a car. When the beneficiary takes possession of the car to drive it away, the time of supply will be triggered. Goods cannot be removed Under s 9(2)(a)(ii), if the property vested in the beneficiary is goods that are not to 43. be removed, then the time of supply will be at the time the goods are made available to the beneficiary. An example of goods that are not to be removed is a building. If a distribution vests property in the beneficiary with an immediate right to present vacant possession, the property will be “made available” to the beneficiary. This means that the time of supply will be at the same time as the resolution to distribute is passed. Time of supply when there is a right to future possession Where the beneficiary has a right to future possession, the time of supply is at the 44. time the beneficiary is permitted to remove the goods. It is unlikely that the beneficiary would be permitted to remove the property until the future date stipulated in the resolution to distribute. If the goods cannot be removed, the time of supply is the future date when those goods are made available. Delay in transferring goods – creation of a bare trust relationship Where a trust resolves to distribute goods to a beneficiary (either with a right to 45. present possession or future possession), there may sometimes be a delay in the transfer of the goods. This delay may create a bare trust relationship. This means the trustee will hold the goods as a bare trustee. The Laws of New Zealand: Trusts (online ed, LexisNexis NZ Limited at \[120\]) defines a “bare trustee” as follows: Meaning of “bare trustee”. A “bare trustee” is a person who holds property in trust for the absolute benefit and at the absolute disposal of other persons who are of full age and sui juris in respect of it, and who has personally no present beneficial interest in it and no duties to perform in respect of it except to convey or transfer it to persons entitled to hold it, and he or she is bound to convey or transfer the property accordingly when required to do so. 1 ... 1 Christie v Ovington (1875) 1 Ch D 279, Morgan v Swansea Urban Sanitary Authority (1878) 9 Ch D 582, Re Docwra (1885) 29 Ch D 693, Re Cunningham and Frayling \[1891\] 2 Ch 567 at 571 and 572 per Stirling J, Re Blandy Jenkins’ Estate \[1917\] 1 Ch 46 (where the earlier authorities were reviewed), and Schalit v Joseph Nadler Ltd \[1933\] 2 KB 79. A bare trustee may originally have had duties in respect of the property which have since ceased (Christie v Ovington (1875) 1 Ch D 279 at 281 per Hall V-C) or which have been superseded by a request from the persons entitled to the property to convey it to them (Morgan v Swansea Urban Sanitary Authority (1878) 9 Ch D 582 at 585 per Jessel MR). A person who has personally an existing beneficial interest of any kind in the trust property is in no circumstances a bare trustee of it: Lysaght v Edwards (1876) 2 Ch D 499 at 506 per Jessel MR. A bare trustee has no equity in the property subject to the trust, and so has no interest which can be charged: Motor Vehicle Dealers’ Institute Inc v UDC Finance (1991) Ltd \[1994\] 1 NZLR 659. See observations on the meaning of “bare trustee” in Herdegen v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 84 ALR 271. Common examples of bare trustees are solicitors’ nominee companies and contributory mortgage nominee companies: ... 9 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED An example might be the transfer of a commercial building which has been vested 46. in the beneficiary by valid resolution of the trustee. If the transfer of legal title to the beneficiary was delayed, it is likely that the trustee holds the building as a bare trustee for the beneficiary during that intervening period. For GST purposes, unless the trustee and the beneficiary agree otherwise, the bare 47. trustee acts as the agent of the beneficiary. 7 This means that:  supplies by or to a bare trustee are treated as supplies that are made by or to the beneficiary; 8  any activity involving supplies for a property subject to a bare trust is carried out by the beneficiary; 9  when a bare trustee transfers legal title to the beneficiary there is no GST supply. 10 Consequently, when a trust passes a resolution to distribute property to a 48. beneficiary with an immediate right to possession, there will be a supply by the trust to the beneficiary. If, after the distribution, the trustee holds legal title to the property for the beneficiary as bare trustee, there will be no supply for GST purposes when the trustee transfers the legal title to the beneficiary. An example of this can be seen in Case R1. 11 The Commissioner successfully 49. argued that the New Zealand resident legal owner of a vessel purchased from overseas sellers held that vessel on bare trust for the taxpayer (the New Zealand resident beneficial owner). The Taxation Review Authority accepted this meant that the transfer of the legal ownership of the vessel to the taxpayer (as the beneficial owner) was not a taxable supply and the taxpayer was not entitled to an input tax deduction. This was because the supply was made overseas and there was no supply between the bare trustee and the taxpayer (as beneficial owner of the vessel). Registration and deregistration obligations Where a trading trust makes a distribution of all or part of its taxable activity, it 50. may trigger registration or deregistration obligations. Registration A trading trust will be liable to register for GST under s 51 if it makes taxable 51. supplies in New Zealand in excess of $60,000 in a 12-month period. If a trading trust is not liable to be registered for GST and it decides to wind up the 52. trust by making a distribution of all the trust assets to a beneficiary (with a value in excess of $60,000), this supply will not trigger a liability to register. This is 7 QB 16/03: “Goods and Services Tax – GST treatment of bare trusts” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016):16. 8 Section 60; CIR v Campbell Investments & Anor (2004) 21 NZTC 18,559 (HC); Case R1 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,001. 9 QB 16/03: “Goods and Services Tax – GST treatment of bare trusts” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016):16. 10 CIR v Campbell Investments & Anor (2004) 21 NZTC 18,559 (HC). 11 Case R1 (1994) 16 NZTRC 6,001. On appeal, and with new evidence regarding the ownership of the vessel, the Commissioner accepted the legal owner was also the beneficial owner of the vessel. This meant there was, on the facts, no bare trust and the supply to the taxpayer by the legal (and beneficial) owner was a taxable supply: Union Corporate Services Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,151. 10 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED because the liability to register is subject to the proviso in s 51(1) and paragraphs (c)–(e). The proviso and s 51(1)(c) state: ... provided that any such person shall not become liable where the Commissioner is satisfied that that value will exceed that amount in that period solely as a consequence of— (c) any ending of, including a premature ending of, or any substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of, any taxable activity carried on by that person; or As the distribution of all the trust’s assets would result in the ending of the trust’s 53. taxable activity, the value of the distribution will not count towards the $60,000 registration threshold and there will be no liability to register for GST. Deregistration If a GST-registered trading trust distributes all the trust’s assets to a beneficiary so 54. that the trust ceases to carry on a taxable activity, the trust must inform the Commissioner of this fact within 21 days of the date of cessation (s 52(3)). The trust must also provide the Commissioner with the date on which the trust ceased to carry on the taxable activity and whether it intends to carry on any taxable activity within 12 months from that date (s 52(4)). Following notification, the Commissioner will cancel the trust’s GST registration with 55. effect from the last day of the taxable period during which all such taxable activities ceased (or from such other date as may be determined by the Commissioner). Examples The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the 56. law. Example 1: A distribution of goods by a trading trust to a beneficiary The Cheery Trading Trust is a GST-registered trust. It carries on a car rental 57. business. The Cheery Trading Trust decides to make a distribution of a car to Benedict, a beneficiary of the Cherry Trading Trust. Benedict has just turned 20 and is about to start university. The distribution of the car to Benedict will be a taxable supply for GST purposes. 58. This is because the car is part of the Trust’s taxable activity. The consideration for the supply is nil. This is because Benedict is not paying 59. anything for this distribution. Special value of supply rules apply to this transaction because the supply is an associated supply. As Benedict does not intend to use the goods to make taxable supplies, the value of the supply will be the open market value of the car (s 10(3)) and the Trust will need to account for output tax on this supply. If Benedict was registered for GST and intended to use the car in his business to 60. make taxable supplies, the value of supply will be the consideration (ie, nil) (ss 10(3A) and 10(3AB)). The Trust would therefore not need to account for any output tax on this supply. Similarly, Benedict could not claim any input tax on the car. 11 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED Special time of supply rules apply to this transaction because the supply is an 61. associated supply. As Benedict has been vested with an immediate right to present possession, the time of supply will be the time Benedict takes possession of the car (s 9(2)(a)). It is irrelevant that legal title in the car might not have been transferred to Benedict at the time of removal. If Benedict has been vested with a right to future possession (ie, when the rental 62. car is returned in two weeks’ time), then that future date will be the time of supply. Example 2: Winding up a trading trust’s taxable activity with all assets being distributed The Wonderful Trading Trust is a GST-registered trust that carries on a property 63. investment business. It owns three commercial properties. The trustee decides to wind up the Trust’s taxable activity and distribute all the Trust’s assets to Benicia, the beneficiary. Benicia is registered for GST and intends to carry on a property investment business in her own name. For GST purposes, the Trust makes a supply of the property to Benicia. Because 64. the Trust is distributing all the property that formed part of its taxable activity, s 6(2) applies. Section 6(2) states: 6(2) Beginning and ending Anything done in connection with the beginning or ending, including a premature ending, of a taxable activity is treated as being carried out in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity. Section 6(2) therefore treats the supply of the goods as being carried out in the 65. course or furtherance of the taxable activity since the distribution is made in connection with the ending of a taxable activity. Therefore, the supply by way of distribution is a taxable supply. The value of the supply must be determined under s 10(3) as it is a supply for no 66. consideration. As Benicia intends to use the properties distributed for the purpose of making taxable supplies, the value of the supply is nil. The properties distributed to Benicia are immediately available. This means the 67. time of supply will be at the same time as the resolution to distribute the property is passed. It is irrelevant for GST purposes that it then takes the trustees six weeks for the title to the properties to be registered in Benicia’s name. Zero-rating Particular provisions under the Act allow for or require zero-rating in these 68. circumstances. For example, under s 11(1)(m) the supply may be zero-rated if it is the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern and the beneficiary is registered for GST. If the supply consists wholly or partly of land and the beneficiary is registered for GST, s 11(1)(mb) requires the supply to be zero-rated. However, as noted at \[66\], the value of the supply is nil and so whether the supply is standard- rated or zero-rated will not affect the GST output tax payable by the Trust or the input tax deductible by Benicia. De-registration As the Trust has now ceased to carry on any taxable activities, it must inform the 69. Commissioner of this fact within 21 days of the date of cessation (s 53(3)). Following notification, the Commissioner will cancel the GST registration of the 12 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED Trust with effect from the last day of the taxable period during which all such taxable activities ceased (or from such other date as may be determined by the Commissioner). The Trust must provide the Commissioner with the date on which the Trust ceased 70. to carry on the taxable activity and whether it intends to carry on any taxable activity within 12 months from that date (s 52(4)). As the Wonderful Trading Trust has now ceased to carry on a taxable activity, it 71. must file a final GST return for the part of the last taxable period for which it was registered (s 16(4)). Example 3: Creation of a bare trust relationship The Blissful Trading Trust carries on a property renovation business. It purchases 72. residential properties, renovates them and then sells them for a profit. It currently owns two residential properties. The Trust resolves to distribute one of the properties to Benjamin, a beneficiary of the Blissful Trading Trust. The resolution provides for Benjamin to have immediate possession of the property. The trustees are aware that Benjamin is looking for somewhere to live when he returns from his OE, where he is currently trekking in Nepal. The distribution of the property to Benjamin will be a taxable supply for GST 73. purposes. This is because the property is part of the Blissful Trading Trust’s taxable activity. As Benjamin intends to live in the property, the value of the supply will be deemed 74. to be the open market value under s 10(3). For the same reason, the zero-rating provision in s 11(1)(mb) will not apply meaning that the supply will be standard- rated. As the property was vested in Benjamin with immediate possession, the time of 75. supply is at the same time as the resolution to distribute the property is passed. It is irrelevant that this time of supply does not coincide with the date that the legal title passed in the property to Benjamin following his return to New Zealand and signing the transfer documents. As there is a delay in transferring the property to Benjamin, a bare trust arises. 76. This means the trustee of the Blissful Trading Trust will hold the property as a bare trustee. A bare trustee acts as agent for the beneficiary until legal title is subsequently transferred to the beneficiary. When the trustee subsequently transfers legal title to Benjamin there will be no 77. supply, as the supply occurs when the property is made available to Benjamin. Example 4: Goods sold to beneficiary The Happy Trading Trust carries on the taxable activity of a paper mill. Benny, a 78. beneficiary of the Happy Trading Trust carries on a publishing business. The Happy Trading Trust sells four pallets of paper to Benny for use in his publishing business. Benny pays the Trust market value for the paper. This is not a distribution by the Trust. It is simply an ordinary supply in the course 79. or furtherance of the Trust’s taxable activity made at market value. The value of the supply is the open market value, as determined under s 10(3) (as this is still an associated supply for GST purposes). 13 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED The time of supply rules for associated persons will apply to this transaction. As 80. the four pallets of paper are to be removed, s 9(2)(a)(i) states that the time of supply will be when the paper is removed. Example 5: Registration The Joyful Trading Trust owns a commercial property with an annual rent of 81. $30,000. As this is the only asset owned by the Trust, it is not liable to register for GST under s 51, as it does not make taxable supplies in New Zealand in excess of $60,000 in a 12-month period. The Trust decides to distribute the commercial property to Benita the beneficiary. 82. The supply is a taxable supply for GST purposes. Benita is not registered for GST and does not carry on a taxable activity. She intends to convert the commercial property into a family home. The distribution by the Trust to Benita is an “associated supply” for GST purposes. 83. This means the value of the supply must be determined under s 10(3). As the property is not going to be used to make taxable supplies, s 10(3A) does not apply. This means the value of the supply for GST purposes must be the open market value, which is $800,000. While the taxable supply by the Trust is in excess of the $60,000 registration 84. threshold, it does not trigger a liability to register. This is because the liability to register is subject to the proviso in s 51(1) and paragraphs (c)–(e). As the distribution to Benita has resulted in the ending of taxable activity carried on 85. by the Trust, paragraph (c) applies and therefore the value of the distribution will not count towards the $60,000 registration threshold. 14 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED References Related rulings/statements QB 16/03: “Goods and Services Tax – GST treatment of bare trusts” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016):16 QB 16/03: “Goods and Services Tax – GST treatment of bare trusts” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016):16 QWBA: “Sale of Land was part of taxable activity” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 5 (October 1993):8 Subject references Associated persons, associated supply, bare trust, beneficiaries, consideration, distribution, GST, supply, taxable activity, taxable supply, trustees, trusts, unincorporated body Legislative references Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – ss 2, 2A, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11A, 11AB, 11B, 14, 16, 24, 51, 52, 53, 57, 60 Case references C & E v Oliver \[1980\] 1 All ER 353 (QB) CIR v Campbell Investments & Anor (2004) 21 NZTC 18,559 (HC) CIR v Dormer & Anor (1997) 18 NZTC 13,466 (HC) Case K55 (1988) 10 NZTC 453 Case M129 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,839 Case N43 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,361 Case P4 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,024 Case R1 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,001 Case U37 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,353 Case V16 (2002) 20 NZTC 10,182 Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 (HC) Hibell v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,195 (HC) Newman v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097 (CA) Public Trustee v Henderson & Pollard Ltd \[1956\] NZLR 180 (Compensation Court) The Trustee, Executors and Agency Company New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076 Union Corporate Services Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,151 Other references The Laws of New Zealand: Trusts online ed, LexisNexis NZ Limited \[120\] 15 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix – Legislation Section 2 definition of “associated supply” 1. associated supply means— (a) a supply for which the supplier and recipient are associated persons: (b) a supply of a right, under an equity security or participatory security, to receive for no consideration, or consideration at other than the open market value, a supply of goods and services that is— (i) not an exempt supply;

Section 51 provides: 4. 51 Persons making supplies in course of taxable activity to be registered (1) Subject to this Act, every person who, on or after 1 October 1986, carries on any taxable activity and is not registered, becomes liable to be registered— (a) at the end of any month where the total value of supplies made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately preceding that month in the course of carrying on all taxable activities has exceeded $60,000 (or such larger amount as the Governor-General may, from time to time, by Order in Council declare): provided that a person does not become liable to be registered by virtue of this paragraph where the Commissioner is satisfied that the value of those supplies in the period of 12 months beginning on the day after the last day of the period referred to in the said paragraph will not exceed that amount: (b) at the commencement of any month where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of the supplies to be made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately following that month will exceed the amount specified in paragraph (a): provided that any such person shall not become liable where the Commissioner is satisfied that that value will exceed that amount in that period solely as a consequence of— (c) any ending of, including a premature ending of, or any substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of, any taxable activity carried on by that person; or (d) the replacement of any plant or other capital asset used in any taxable activity carried on by that person; or (e) the supply, to persons who are non-residents but are physically present in New Zealand, of telecommunications services that are treated as being supplied in New Zealand under sections 8(6) and 8A. (1B) For the purposes of determining under subsection (1) the liability of a unit title body corporate to be registered, the value of a supply of a service made by the body corporate to a member is not included in the total value of supplies made in New Zealand by the body corporate. (1C) For the purposes of subsection (1), if the person is a non-resident supplier of remote services to which section 8(3)(c) applies, then in determining whether the person is liable to be registered, the person may use a fair and reasonable method of converting foreign currency amounts into New Zealand currency amounts. 17 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED (2) Every person who, by virtue of subsection (1), becomes liable to be registered shall apply to the Commissioner in the prescribed form for registration under this Act, within 21 days of becoming so liable, and provide the Commissioner with such further particulars as the Commissioner may require for the purpose of registering that person. (3) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2), every person who satisfies the Commissioner that, on or after 1 October 1986,— (a) that person is carrying on any taxable activity; or (b) that person intends to carry on any taxable activity from a specified date,— may apply to the Commissioner in the prescribed form for registration under this Act, and provide the Commissioner with such further particulars as the Commissioner may require for the purpose of registering that person. (4) Where any person has— (a) made application for registration pursuant to subsection (2), (3), or section 54B, and the Commissioner is satisfied that that person is eligible to be registered under this Act, that person shall be a registered person for the purposes of this Act with effect from such date as the Commissioner may determine; or (b) not made application for registration pursuant to subsection (2), and the Commissioner is satisfied that that person is liable to be registered under this Act, that person shall be a registered person for the purposes of this Act with effect from the date on which that person first became liable to be registered under this Act: provided that the Commissioner may, having regard to the circumstances of the case, determine that person to be a registered person from such later date as the Commissioner considers equitable. (5) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where any taxable activity is carried on by any non-profit body in branches or divisions, that non-profit body may apply to the Commissioner for any such branch or division to be a separate person for the purposes of this section, and if each such branch or division maintains an independent system of accounting and can be separately identified by reference to the nature of the activities carried on or the location of that branch or division, each such branch or division shall be deemed to be a separate person, and not a part of the non-profit body, and, where any such branch or division is a separate person pursuant to this subsection, any taxable activity carried on by that branch or division shall, to that extent, be deemed not to be carried on by the non-profit body first mentioned in this subsection. (5B) A unit title body corporate that is registered under this Act as a result of an application under subsection (3) made on a date (the application date) on or after the date of introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill must be registered with effect from a date after the application date.

Section 52 provides: 5. 52 Cancellation of registration (1) Subject to this Act, every registered person who carries on any taxable activity shall cease to be liable to be registered where at any time the Commissioner is satisfied that the value of that person’s taxable supplies in the period of 12 months then beginning will be not more than the amount specified for the purposes of section 51(1). (2) Every person who, by virtue of subsection (1), ceases to be liable to be registered may request the Commissioner to cancel that person’s registration, and if the 18 IS 18/02 UNCLASSIFIED Commissioner is at any time satisfied, as mentioned in subsection (1), the Commissioner shall cancel that person’s registration with effect from the last day of the taxable period during which the Commissioner was so satisfied, or from such other date as may be determined by the Commissioner, and shall notify that person of the date on which the cancellation of the registration takes effect. (3) Every registered person who ceases to carry on all taxable activities shall inform the Commissioner of that fact within 21 days of the date of cessation and the Commissioner shall cancel the registration of any such person with effect from the last day of the taxable period during which all such taxable activities ceased, or from such other date as may be determined by the Commissioner: provided that the Commissioner shall not at any time cancel the registration of any such registered person if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the registered person will carry on any taxable activity at any time within 12 months from that date of cessation. (4) Any information provided by a registered person to the Commissioner under subsection (3) must include the date on which the person ceased to carry on all taxable activities and whether or not the person intends to carry on any taxable activity within 12 months from that date.

(5A) Any date determined by the Commissioner for the cancellation of registration under subsection (5) may be retrospective to a date not earlier than— (a) the last day of the taxable period during which taxable activity by the person ceased; or (b) the date on which the person was registered under this Act, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person did not, from that date, carry on any taxable activity. (6) \[Repealed\] (7) In subsections (5) and (5A), for a non-resident person who is not registered under section 54B, a taxable activity means a taxable activity carried on in New Zealand. (8) If a unit title body corporate is a registered person on the date of introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill and the registration is later cancelled after an application under subsection (2), the cancellation must take effect on or after the date on which the unit title body corporate applies for cancellation of the registration. (9) If a unit title body corporate is registered under this Act with effect from a date (the registration date) after the date of introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill and the registration is later cancelled after an application under subsection (2), the cancellation must take effect on or after the later of— (a) the date on which the unit title body corporate applies for cancellation of the registration: (b) the day that is 4 years after the registration date.

This Interpretation Statement provides guidance on when the attribution rule for income from personal services in ss GB 27 to GB 29 will apply. It expands on “Attribution of Income” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 12 (December 2 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED 2000): 49. It does not discuss or explain the calculation rules contained in s GB 29. 2. The attribution rule for income from personal services in ss GB 27 to GB 29 is a specific anti-avoidance rule that prevents an individual avoiding the top personal tax rate by diverting income to an associated entity. Essentially, the income attribution rule applies when an individual (the working person), who performs personal services, is associated with an entity (the associated entity) that provides personal services to a third person (the buyer). 3. The income attribution rule only applies where various threshold tests are met and no exemptions apply. This Interpretation Statement provides guidance on the application of each of those threshold tests and exemptions, to assist readers in determining whether the income attribution rule applies to their situation. Introduction 4. The income attribution rule applies where (s GB 27(1)):  a person (the working person) provides personal services;  the working person is associated with an entity (the associated entity);  the associated entity is inserted between the working person and the party who acquires the services (the buyer);  the working person performs the services, but the associated entity derives the income;  various threshold tests in s GB 27(2) are satisfied; and  none of the exemptions in s GB 27(3) apply. 5. This Interpretation Statement focuses on the application of the threshold tests in s GB 27(2), and the exemptions in s GB 27(3). 6. The threshold tests that must be satisfied for the income attribution rule to apply are:  80% or more of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to the buyer or an associate of the buyer or a combination of them (s GB 27(2)(a)); and  80% or more of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from services that are performed by the working person or a relative of the working person or a combination of them (s GB 27(2)(b)); and  the working person’s net income for the income year exceeds $70,000, including any amounts that would be attributed if the rule applied (s GB 27(2)(c)); and  substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure used to derive the entity’s assessable income (s GB 27(2)(d)). 7. However, even if the threshold tests are satisfied, a working person and an associated entity will be exempt from applying the income attribution rule where:  the associated entity and the working person are non-residents; 3 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED  the associated entity is a natural person, and is neither a partner of a partnership nor a trustee of a trust;  the services performed by the working person are essential support for a product supplied by the associated entity;  the amount to be attributed to the working person is less than $5,000 (although there are exclusions to this); or  in various situations where the associated entity is a controlled foreign company (CFC). 8. A process for considering the application of the various thresholds and exemptions is illustrated in Flowchart 1 on the next page. 9. The analysis following the flowchart discusses each of the threshold tests and any exclusions in the order that they appear in the flowchart. 4 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED Flowchart 1: Does the income attribution rule apply?

See \[73\] and \[74\] Is the associated entity a CFC? See \[75\] Income attribution rule applies Income attribution rule does not apply 5 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED Is there an associated entity and working person relationship? 10. The income attribution rule will only apply where the entity is associated with the working person. 11. The rules in subpart YB apply to determine whether a working person and an entity are associated persons. A company and a person (other than a company) will be associated if the person has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more (s YB 3). 12. If the entity and the working person are not associated, the income attribution rule will not apply. Example 1. Identifying the parties Paul employs Andrea. Andrea is paid a salary of $150,000. Andrea incorporates a company called A&M Co Ltd which contracts her services to Paul. Andrea is the sole shareholder of A&M Co Ltd. Paul pays A&M Co Ltd $150,000 for the services provided. A&M Co Ltd pays Andrea a salary of $80,000 and retains the remaining $70,000. Question Who are the relevant parties under the income attribution rule? Answer Under the new arrangement, Paul is the buyer, A&M Co Ltd is the associated entity and Andrea is the working person for the purposes of the income attribution rule. Who Attribution party Contractual party Original party Paul Buyer Buyer Employer A&M Co Ltd Associated entity Employer None Andrea Working person Employee Employee 13. The income attribution rule is not restricted to reorganisations of existing situations. It also applies to new structures where the appropriate relationships are created. The income attribution rule is also not confined to a corporate structure. The associated entity could be, for example, a trust or a partnership, and the working person could be a partner, trustee or beneficiary of a trading trust. The rules in subpart YB will also apply to determine whether a working person is associated with a partnership or trust. In particular, a partner and a partnership will be associated persons (s YB 12), and a trustee of a trust will be associated with the beneficiaries (s YB 6) (and people related to the beneficiaries (s YB 5)) and settlors of the trust (s YB 8), and with a person with the power to appoint or remove the trustee (s YB 11). 14. Most of the examples given in this item are based on a corporate structure because that is likely to be the most common structure. However, the analysis is equally applicable to other less common business structures where the income attribution rule may apply such as a trading trust or partnership. Example 2. Identifying the parties Jane and Megan have just established the JM Partnership. Jane completes all the work for the partnership while Megan has contributed the capital. The JM Partnership has entered into a substantial contract with Bug Eliminators Ltd which will take almost all of Jane’s time. Question Who are the relevant parties under the income attribution rule? 6 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED Answer Under the arrangement Bug Eliminators Ltd is the buyer, JM Partnership is the associated entity and Jane is the working person for the purposes of the income attribution rule. Are the associated entity and working person both non-resident for the entire income year? 15. Under s GB 27(3)(a), the income attribution rule will not apply if the associated person and the working person are both non-resident during the relevant income year under the tests in ss YD 1 (Residence of natural persons) and YD 2 (Residence of companies). For more guidance on the application of the residence tests see “IS 16/03: Tax Residence” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2. 16. The residence or non-residence of the working person is the first matter to address when considering this exemption. It will only be necessary to consider the residence of the associated entity if the working person is a non-resident. Example 3. Non-resident working person and resident associated entity John is a non-resident who owns all of the share capital of NZCO which is a New Zealand incorporated company. John is the working person and NZCO is the associated entity. NZCO provides consulting services to one buyer, which is an Australian company. The services are provided to the buyer in Australia and the work is done by John in Australia. Question: Does the income attribution rule apply? Answer: Yes, the income attribution rule applies. The exemption in s GB 27(3)(a) provides that both the associated entity (NZCO) and working person (John) must be non-residents at all times. While John is not a New Zealand tax resident, NZCO is incorporated in New Zealand so is a company that is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. There may be some relief for a working person under the Australia/New Zealand double tax agreement, but this item does not consider the application of any relevant double tax agreements. Example 4. Tax resident working person Michelle is New Zealand tax resident who is living in France. She owns all of the share capital of NZCO which is a New Zealand incorporated company. Michelle is the working person and NZCO is the associated entity. NZCO provides consulting services to FRENCHCO, which is the sole buyer of the services that NZCO provides. Michelle provides the services in France. Question: Does the income attribution rule apply? Answer: Yes, the income attribution rule applies. The exemption in s GB 27(3)(a) provides that both the associated entity (NZCO) and the working person (Michelle) must be non- residents at all times. In this example Michelle (the working person) is a New Zealand tax resident. This means the requirements of s GB 27(3)(a) are not met. 7 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED Example 5. Non-resident associated entity Bryan was a New Zealand tax resident but he currently lives in the United Kingdom and is a non-resident at all relevant times. He owns all of the share capital of BRITCO which is a UK company. Bryan is the working person and BRITCO is the associated entity. BRITCO provides consulting services to UKCO, which is the sole buyer of the services that BRITCO provides. Bryan provides the services in the United Kingdom. Question: Does the income attribution rule apply? Answer: No, the income attribution rule does not apply. The exemption in s GB 27(3)(a) provides that both the associated entity (BRITCO) and the working person (Bryan) must be non-residents during the relevant income year. In this example the associated entity (BRITCO) is not a New Zealand tax resident and neither is Bryan (for the time being). This means the requirements of s GB 27(3)(a) have been satisfied even though the working person (Bryan) is a New Zealander. Is the associated entity a natural person acting in that capacity? 17. The income attribution rule will not apply if the associated entity is a natural person and is neither a partner of a partnership nor a trustee of a trust (s GB 27(3)(b). The income attribution rule is designed to prevent higher income earners from diverting personal services income to associated people by using companies, trusts and look-through companies. Section GB 27(3)(b) was added after the income attribution rule was enacted so that if a sole trader employs relatives to carry out personal services of a type to which the income attribution rule would otherwise apply, all the income from those services is not directed to those relatives. If the income attribution rule did apply the sole trader would have no income from those services. 18. However, if the natural person is acting in their capacity as a partner of a partnership, or a trustee of a trust, opportunities may still exist for the natural person to divert personal services income. Accordingly, the exemption does not apply in these situations. Has the working person chosen to apply the controlled foreign company rules? 19. The income attribution rule will not apply (s GB 27(3)(e)) if:  the associated entity is a CFC (that is, a foreign company that is controlled by five or fewer New Zealand residents); and  the amount that would be attributed to the working person under the income attribution rules would also be attributed CFC income under s CQ 2(2B) (When attributed CFC income arises) or an attributed CFC loss under s DN 2(2) (When attributed CFC loss arises); and  the working person files a return of income in which they return the amount as attributed CFC income. 20. This exemption prevents double taxation through the application of multiple regimes by allowing the working person to choose to apply the CFC rules or the income attribution rules. 8 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED Do the working person and associated entity earn a combined net income of more than $70,000? 21. The income attribution rule will only apply if the working person’s net income from personal services for the income year is more than $70,000, assuming the income derived by the associated entity is attributed to the working person under the income attribution rule (s GB 27(2)(c)). The $70,000 must be calculated by applying all of the calculation rules contained in s GB 29 including the loss restriction rules contained in s GB 29(1). 22. This threshold is designed to ensure the income attribution rule does not apply if the working person’s net income for the year, calculated in accordance with all of the rules contained in s GB 29, is less than $70,000 (which is the income level at which the 33% top marginal rate of tax commences). If the working person’s net income, calculated in accordance with all of the rules contained in s GB 29, would always be less than $70,000 there are limited tax advantages from interposing the associated entity between the working person and the buyer. 23. The working person’s income is calculated by reference to income that would have been earned if the income attribution rule applied. This is effectively the income that the working person would have had, if the associated entity had not been interposed. Example 6. Income earned by working person Lauraco (the associated entity) earns $100,000 this year and pays a salary of $60,000 to Laura (the working person). Question Has Laura earned more than $70,000 for the purposes of the attribution rule? Answer Yes, Laura has earned more than $70,000 if the income attribution rule applies. As the amount paid as a salary to Laura is under the $70,000 threshold Laura might argue that the income attribution rule does not apply. However, if the income attribution rule applied a further $40,000 would be attributed by the associated entity. Accordingly, Laura’s net income for the purposes of this threshold requirement is $100,000, not just the $60,000 paid. 24. When calculating the amount of income for the working person it is necessary to also consider the taxable value of any fringe benefit the working person receives (s GB 28(5)). Does 80% of that income come from one buyer or two or more associated buyers? 25. The income attribution rule will only apply where 80% of the associated entity’s total income is from one buyer or from two or more buyers if those buyers are associated persons (s GB 27(2)(a)). 26. The inclusion of this requirement ensures that contracts are not divided between existing entities associated with the buyer, or that the buyer does not incorporate new companies to ensure the 80% threshold is not met. 27. To determine whether two buyers are associated, the general associated persons rules in subpart YB apply. In summary, the associated persons rules treat two people as being associated where they are: 9 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED  two companies, if either a group of persons hold total voting interests in each company of 50% or more, or if the group of persons control both companies by any other means;  a company and a person (other than a company) if the person has a voting interest in the company of 25% or more;  relatives;  a trustee of a trust and: o a beneficiary of the trust; o the settlor of the trust; o a person who is related to a beneficiary; o a trustee of another trust with the same settlor; or o a person with the power to appoint or remove the trustee;  a settlor of a trust and a beneficiary of the trust;  a partnership and a partner (excluding limited partnerships, which are treated as companies);  a look-through company and a look through owner who is a director or employee; or  each associated with a third person . 28. This Interpretation Statement does not go into detail about the application of the associated persons provisions. For more information see “New Definitions of ‘Associated Persons’” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 8 (October/November 2009): 75. Example 7. Associated persons – two buyers Bob owns all of the share capital of Bobco and is the sole employee of Bobco. Bob is the working person and Bobco is the associated entity. The buyers of Bobco’s services are AUSCO and its wholly owned subsidiary NZCO. Both of the buyer companies have entered into separate contracts with Bobco which will each provide 40% of Bobco’s total income. Bobco is aware that NZCO is a wholly owned subsidiary of AUSCO. Question: Does Bob earn 80% of his income from the buyer and a person associated with the buyer? Answer: Yes, Bob does earn 80% of his income from the buyer and a person associated with that buyer. AUSCO and NZCO are associated with each other, which means 80% of Bobco’s total income is derived from the supply of services to a combination of the buyer and a person associated with the buyer (that is, AUSCO and NZCO). Example 8. Associated persons – buyer with multiple customers Ann owns all of the share capital of Service Ltd and is the sole employee of Service Ltd. The buyer of Service Ltd’s services is Computersupport Ltd which provides a wide variety of computer services to 15 third party clients. Service Ltd has no clients apart from Computersupport Ltd. The contract between Service Ltd and Computersupport Ltd requires Service Ltd to provide direct “helpdesk” services as and when required to all of the 15 third party clients of Computersupport Ltd. Question Is Ann providing her services to one buyer? Answer: 10 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED Yes, Ann is providing her services to one buyer. Ann is the working person and Service Ltd is the associated entity. The associated entity Service Ltd has only one client, Computersupport Ltd, which is the buyer. It is irrelevant that Service Ltd is providing computer helpdesk services to Computersupport Ltd’s 15 clients. There are no contracts between Service Ltd and the 15 third party clients of Computersupport Ltd. Example 9. Associated persons – buyer and associated entity associated Alan owns all of the share capital of Parent Ltd, Manufacturing Ltd, Distribution Ltd and Retail Ltd. Alan is the sole employee of Parent Ltd and is the working person. Parent Ltd is the associated entity that provides services to the three sister companies Manufacturing Ltd, Distribution Ltd and Retail Ltd, which are the buyers. Parent Ltd does not provide services to any other taxpayers. Question: Is Alan providing all his services to one buyer? Answer: Yes, Alan is providing all his services to one buyer. Parent Ltd, Manufacturing Ltd, Distribution Ltd and Retail Ltd are associated with each other which means all of Parent Ltd’s income is derived from the supply of services to a combination of the buyer and persons associated with the buyer (that is, Manufacturing Ltd, Distribution Ltd and Retail Ltd). 29. The income attribution rule may apply one year to an associated entity and cease to apply the next year. This could happen where an associated entity is working for one buyer but changes its contract midway through the year to a different, unassociated buyer. 30. This situation was considered when the income attribution rule was enacted and the decision was that although the rule may be arbitrary in this regard, the preference was to keep the rule simple to understand and apply. Example 10. Change of buyers Fiona (the working person) has been providing 100% management services, through her associated entity FJH Ltd, to a payroll company for years. Six months into the current income year, that contract ends and Fiona and the associated entity contracts for six months with a different, unassociated, independent payroll company. The new contract is on the same terms and for the same amount as the previous contract. Question: Will the income attribution rule apply to FJH Ltd for the current income year? Answer: No, the income attribution rule will not apply to FJH Ltd for the current income year. Because Fiona is earning the same amount in relation to each unassociated buyer, she can only be earning 50% from one buyer and the income attribution rule will not apply. There was only one buyer in the year before the change, so the income attribution rule does apply to that year. It is also possible that the income attribution rule may apply to the year after the change (if there are no other buyers). 31. Section GB 28 also contains rules relating to associated persons that are relevant when determining whether two buyers are associated. A person is only treated as being associated with another person for the income attribution rule if they are associated at the time the working person performs the services (s GB 28(2)). Also, no association exists between two buyers where both of them are public authorities (s GB 28(3)(a)). 11 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED 32. Finally, there will be no association between two buyers where the working person cannot reasonably be expected to know that the two buyers are associated, other than by making a specific inquiry (s GB 28(3)(b)). An example of this would be if the working person were providing services to a company (an arm’s length third party) that is part of a large group, and that company had several related companies (also arm’s length) that were also contracting with the working person. 33. There is a difference between a person “knowing” that parties are associated (which would be subjective) and being “reasonably expected to know”. The use of the words “reasonably expected to know” rather than just “know” indicates that it is an objective test. Accordingly, the question is whether a reasonable person should know. 34. The Commissioner considers that the working person should reasonably be able to know that two buyers may be associated where the associated buyers have similar names, where the working person was contracting with the same person on behalf of two buyers, where there is obvious and immediately accessible public information available to the working person about the buyers, or where there is local or regional knowledge of the association. The requirement that the person should be “reasonably expected to know” will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. Example 11. Associated persons - knowledge Clare owns all of the share capital of Clareco and is the sole employee of Clareco. Clare is the working person and Clareco is the associated entity. The buyers of Clareco services are AUSCO and its wholly owned subsidiary NZCO. Both buyer companies have entered into separate contracts with the associated entity that will each provide 50% of Clareco’s total income. Clare is not aware that NZCO is a wholly owned subsidiary of AUSCO. The buyers have different company names, and different employees entered into the contracts with the associated entity. Question: Can Clare be reasonably expected to know that AUSCO and NZCO are associated buyers? Answer: No, Clare cannot be reasonably expected to know that a particular buyer (NZCO) is associated with another buyer (AUSCO) without making specific enquires. The working person (Clare) is not aware of the 100% common shareholding between AUSCO and NZCO and would not reasonably be expected to know they are associated because: - The two buyers have different company names. - The two contracts were negotiated and entered into with different employees of NZCO and AUSCO. However, the answer might be different if AUSCO and NZCO were in the same industry and the services Clare provided were very similar with overlap between the first and the second contract in terms of timeframes, price and so on. Is 80% of that income earned by the working person or a relative of the working person or a combination of them? 35. The income attribution rules will only apply where 80% or more of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived through services personally performed by the working person, a relative of the working person, or a combination of both of them (s GB 27(2)(b)). The inclusion of personal services performed by a relative of the working person is designed to 12 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED ensure personal services cannot be split between relatives to make them appear to fall outside the income attribution rules. A common example would be where the services are provided by spouses or by a parent and an adult child. 36. “Relative” is defined in s YA 1 as a person connected with another person by being:  within the second degree of blood relationship to the other;  in a marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship with the other;  in a marriage, civil union, or de facto relationship with a person who is within the second degree of blood relationship to the other;  adopted as a child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the first degree of relationship to the other; or  the trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit. 37. This definition is consistent with the meaning of “relative” in the associated persons provisions, and covers parents, siblings and children. 38. The definition of “relative” is, however, limited by s GB 28(4) for the purposes of the income attribution rules. Section GB 28(4) states that a person is a relative of the working person only if the person is a relative at the beginning of the relevant income year. As an example, if during an income year two persons who each provide services to the entity begin a de facto relationship, they will not be caught within the provision until the next income year. However, if two people are in a de facto relationship, but split up during the year, they will be treated as being associated for the purposes of the income attribution rule for that income year. Example 12. Relatives of working person Dawn and her spouse Richard own all of the share capital of D&Dco. Dawn is the only full time employee of D&Dco. Richard and their adult children Diana and David are equally capable of providing the same services that would otherwise have been provided by Dawn. D&Dco is the associated entity. There is a single buyer of D&Dco services. The contract between D&Dco and the buyer provides that 50% of the services will be provided by Dawn and 50% of the services will be provided by Richard. The contract also provides that Richard can arrange for all or a proportion of his services to be provided by Diana or David or both. Question: Are Dawn and her relatives providing more than 80% of their services to a buyer? Answer: Yes, Dawn and her relatives are providing more than 80% of their services to a buyer. More than 80% (in this case 100%) of the services provided by D&Dco will be provided by a combination of the working person (Dawn) and the relatives of Dawn (Richard, Diana or David). Are there substantial business assets? 39. The income attribution rules will not apply if the associated entity:  has “substantial business assets”; and 13 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED  those assets are a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the associated entity’s income from the provision of personal services to the buyer. 40. If the associated entity does not have substantial business assets, or those assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive gross income from the provision of personal services, then income attribution may be required (subject to the application of the other thresholds and exemptions discussed in this Interpretation Statement) (s GB 27(2)(d)). 41. The substantial business assets test is designed to recognise that when substantial business assets are used in the associated entity’s business of providing personal services there should also be a return on that capital. For example, the owner-driver of a petrol tanker should receive a return based on both the asset employed and the labour provided. 42. The expression “substantial business assets” is defined in s GB 28(6) as depreciable property that:  has a total cost of more than: o $75,000; or o 25% or more of the associated entity’s total income from services for the income year; and  is not for “private use”, which will not apply where the private use of the depreciable property is 20% or less of its total use (s GB 28(8)). 43. “Substantial business assets” can comprise a single asset or multiple assets. 44. The questions that need to be considered to determine whether an associated entity has substantial business assets are summarised in Flowchart 2. 45. The text following the flowchart to \[85\] considers each question in the order that it appears in the flowchart. 14 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED Flowchart 2: Are there substantial business assets? Does the associated entity have depreciable property? 46. As stated above, to have a “substantial business asset”, an associated entity must have property that is “depreciable property”. 47. “Depreciable property” is, generally, defined as being property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use in deriving assessable income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income (s EE 6). Depreciable property includes items that are “depreciable intangible property” (listed in sch 14). These items include property such as a patent or the right to use a patent, and the right to use a copyright. However, “depreciable property” does not include items of property that are listed in s EE 7, such as land, trading stock, and financial arrangements. 48. To be depreciable property, the substantial business assets must be used, or available for use, to derive the associated entity’s assessable income from the provision of personal services. Not all property will automatically satisfy this requirement. Property that is used for private use is unlikely to satisfy this test. This is consistent with the definition of “substantial business assets”. Is the depreciable property a necessary part of the associated entity’s business structure? 49. As discussed above, it is a requirement that the depreciable property be a necessary part of the associated entity’s business structure that is used to provide personal services to the buyer. The first step is to identify the business that the associated entity is undertaking and then the structure that is being used. In most cases the business being undertaken by the associated entity will Yes z No No No No No Yes Yes z Yes Yes Does the associated entity have depreciable property? See \[46\] to \[48\] Is the depreciable property a necessary part of the associated entity’s business structure? See \[49\] to \[52\] Yes, there are substantial business assets Did the depreciable property cost more than $75,000 or more than 25% of the associated entity’s income for the year? See \[53\] to \[56\] Is that private use 20% or less? See \[66\] to \[70\] No, there are no substantial business assets Is the depreciable property available for private use? See \[57\] to \[65\] 15 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED be self-evident. It can then be considered whether the particular assets being considered (to be substantial business assets) are a necessary part of the business structure. 50. An associated entity’s “business structure” is the structure or organisation that has been established to carry out the associated entity’s contractual obligations to the buyer of the working person’s services (CIR v Trustpower Ltd (2016) 27 NZTC 22-010 (CA); Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 5 ATD 87 (HCA)). 51. The dictionary definitions of “necessary” indicate that the depreciable property must be essential, vital, indispensable or imperative to the success of the activity being performed. Case law indicates that the word “necessary” can have a narrow or a wide interpretation depending on the statutory context. In the context of the income attribution rule, which is a specific anti-avoidance rule, the Commissioner’s view is that the word “necessary” should be narrowly interpreted (Pabari v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions \[2005\] 1 All ER 287). 52. Therefore, it is the Commissioner’s view that business assets must be indispensable or essential to the provision of the particular services provided by the working person to the buyer of those services. Tools and equipment that are only infrequently (if at all) used by a working person to perform the personal services provided to a buyer of the personal services may not satisfy the narrow test of indispensability. Example 13. Necessary business tools Wendy the plumber is the working person. She is a very experienced plumber and is employed by her associated entity. The associated entity’s business is providing plumbing services. The associated entity owns all of the plumbing equipment that Wendy needs to carry out her work and a van to carry that equipment. The buyer is constructing a large commercial building that will take at least three years to build. Question Are the plumbing equipment and van a necessary part of the business structure? Answer Yes the plumbing equipment and the van owned by the associated entity are a necessary part of the associated entity’s business structure. Example 14. Necessary business tools Barry the builder is the working person. Barry is employed by his associated entity which runs a business providing building services. All of the income of the associated entity is from a single buyer. The buyer owns all of the building equipment that Barry needs to carry out the buyer’s building contract. The buyer also provides a vehicle to transport Barry from the buyer’s premises to the construction site. The associated entity owns some equipment that is not used for building and it is stored at Barry's private residence. Barry uses a motor vehicle owned by the associated entity to drive from his private residence to the buyer’s premises. Barry then uses the buyers building equipment and motor vehicle to travel to the construction site. Question Are the associated entity’s equipment and motor vehicle a necessary part of the business structure? Answer 16 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED No, based on the facts provided the associated entity’s equipment and motor vehicle are not necessary parts of the business structure (while the motor vehicle may be a necessary part of the business structure more information would be needed before this could be decided). The equipment owned by the associated entity is not a necessary part of the business structure because it does not relate to the business of the associated entity and the buyer provides Barry with all of the building equipment necessary. Did the depreciable property cost more than $75,000 or more than 25% of the associated entity’s income for the year? 53. Depreciable property will only be a “substantial business asset” if it has a total cost of more than (s GB 28(6)(a)):  $75,000; or  25% or more of the associated entity’s total income from services for the income year. 54. These are alternative tests, either of which must be satisfied. 55. This test requires the taxpayer to correctly ascertain the relationship between the cost of their depreciable property and the two statutory thresholds. It is “cost” and not market value that is relevant. The “cost” will be the same as the cost the associated entity uses for depreciation purposes. 56. The most common categories of business assets owned by associated entities include motor vehicles, tools and equipment, computers and communication equipment. Example 15. Substantial business assets – monetary thresholds Cost of depreciable property $40,000 Total income from services $120,000 25% of total income from services $30,000 Statutory amount $75,000 Question Does the asset meet the monetary threshold? Answer Yes, the asset meets the monetary threshold. The cost of the depreciable property is $40,000 which is less than the statutory amount of $75,000. The first limb of the test is not satisfied. However, the cost of $40,000 is more than 25% of income from personal services which is $30,000. The second limb of the test is satisfied. Example 16. Substantial business assets – monetary thresholds Cost of depreciable property $50,000 Total income from services $240,000 25% of total income from services $60,000 Statutory amount $75,000 Question Does the asset meet the monetary threshold? Answer No, the asset does not meet the monetary threshold. The cost of the depreciable property is $50,000 which is less that the statutory amount of $75,000. The cost is also less than 25% of income from personal services which is $60,000. The test has not been satisfied because the taxpayer has failed both of the alternative tests. 17 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED Example 17. Substantial business assets – monetary thresholds Cost of depreciable property $80,000 Total income from services $280,000 25% of total income from services $70,000 Statutory amount $75,000 Question Does the asset meet the monetary threshold? Answer Yes. The asset meets the monetary threshold. The cost of the depreciable property is $80,000 which is more than the statutory amount of $75,000. The cost is also more than 25% of income from personal services which is $70,000. The test is satisfied because the taxpayer has satisfied both of the alternative tests (and only one test needs to be satisfied). Example 18. Substantial business assets – monetary thresholds Cost of depreciable property $80,000 Total income from services $360,000 25% of total income from services $90,000 Statutory amount $75,000 Question Does the asset meet the monetary threshold? Answer Yes, the asset meets the monetary threshold. The cost of the depreciable property is $80,000 which is more than the statutory amount of $75,000. The first of the alternative tests has been satisfied. It does not matter that the cost of $80,000 is less than 25% of income from personal services which is $90,000. The test is satisfied because the taxpayer is required to satisfy only one of the alternative tests. Is the depreciable property used for private use? 57. Depreciable property may not be a “substantial business asset” if it is used for private use (subject to the 20% test discussed from \[66\]). 58. The Act does not contain a general definition of “private use”. The dictionary definitions relevantly indicate that “private” refers to the part of a person’s life that is concerned with situations or activities in a person’s personal relationships and activities rather than with the person’s work or business relationships (CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5, 198 (CA)). 59. Many business assets, such as computers, printers, tablets, smart phones tools and equipment, are capable of being used for both business and non-business activities. In relation to the use of such assets, the Commissioner considers that any use that is not in the course of undertaking specific income earning activities should be classified as private use. Private use of motor vehicles 60. The Act contains a specific definition of “private use” for motor vehicles. Under s CX 36, private use for a motor vehicle includes:  the employee’s use of the vehicle for travel between home and work; and  any other travel that confers a private benefit on the employee (for example, use after hours, during the weekend or when the working person is on leave). 18 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED 61. Section GB 28(9), which sets out how to calculate the percentage of private use of a substantial business asset (discussed from \[66\]), refers to the number of days for which fringe benefit tax (FBT) is payable for the property. Because FBT is payable for motor vehicles depending on their private use, this definition is also relevant when determining the private use of a motor vehicle for the purposes of the substantial business asset test. 62. This Interpretation Statement briefly discusses where there will be private use of a motor vehicle. For more information on this topic see “Travel by Motor Vehicle Between Home and Work – Deductibility of Expenditure and FBT Implications” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004): 31 (IS 3448), and IS 17/07 “Fringe Benefit Tax – Motor Vehicles” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 9 (October 2017): 12. Travel between home and work 63. In most cases, the Commissioner considers that travel between home and work in a vehicle owned by an associated entity will confer a private advantage and be considered private use of that vehicle. However, where a home is also a workplace and an employee is required for sound business reasons to travel to perform employment duties partly at the home workplace and partly at another workplace, then no private benefit will be conferred by that travel (CIR v Schick (1998) 18 NZTC 13,738 (HC)). 64. If the working person’s home is also the associated entity’s premises, and sound business reasons exist for this arrangement, travel in a motor vehicle from the home to the buyer’s premises will be considered work-to-work travel. This travel will not be considered private use for s GB 28(6)(b). 65. If the associated entity’s premises are separate from the working person’s home, the standard rules relating to FBT and motor vehicles as set out in IS 17/07 and IS3448 apply. It is likely that any travel between home and those premises in a motor vehicle will be considered private use under s GB 28(6)(b). Is the private use 20% or less? 66. The phrase “private use” is limited for the purposes of the income attribution rule so that where the private use of the depreciable property is 20% or less of its total use it will not be considered private use (s GB 28(8)). 67. This limitation means depreciable property may satisfy the test for substantial business assets even if there is an element of private use or enjoyment, provided the level of private use is not more than 20% of the total use. Or, to put it another way, the classification of an asset as a substantial business asset will not change in cases where the business use of that asset is at least 80%. 68. Section GB 28(9) provides guidance on calculating the percentage of private use of a business asset. 69. In the case of property that is subject to the FBT rules, the percentage of private use must be calculated by comparing the number of days for which FBT is payable with the total days in the tax year in which the property is owned or is subject to a specified lease, a finance lease or a hire purchase agreement. 70. In the case of all other property (including any property that is excluded from FBT under s CX 21), the percentage of private use must be calculated by comparing the expenditure relating to the property that is non-deductible as a 19 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED result of the private use with the total expenditure relating to the property incurred in the tax year. Are the services being provided essential support for a product? 71. The income attribution rule will not apply to the extent that the services provided by a working person are essential support for a product supplied by the working person’s associated entity (s GB 27(3)(c)). 72. Various dictionary definitions suggest that the word “product”, when read in this context, describes the sale of something that has been produced or acquired by the associated entity that is sold to the buyer. Example 19. Essential support for a product Computer Comprehensive Service Ltd is the associated entity that has entered into a contract with its only customer, a government department (the buyer). The contract requires Computer Comprehensive Service Ltd to install a new computer system, provide software and hardware support and provide “hands on” training to the buyer’s staff. All of the staff training will be undertaken by the working person at the buyer’s premises. Question: Does the income attribution rule apply? Answer: No, the income attribution rule does not apply. Computer Comprehensive Service Ltd (the associated entity) has agreed to provide the government department (the buyer) with a computer system, software and hardware support, and comprehensive hands on training. The training services the working person provides are essential support for the hardware and software (the product) that Computer Comprehensive Service Ltd sold to the government department. Is the amount being attributed less than $5,000? 73. The income attribution rule will not apply where the total amount to be attributed to the working person by the associated entity is less than $5,000. This means that if the amount attributed under s GB 29 is less than $5,000, no attribution need be made (s GB 27(3)(d)). 74. However, if the working person has more than one associated entity, this exemption can apply only once (s GB 27(3)(d)(i)). This means the second entity must attribute income regardless of the level of that income. Is the associated entity a controlled foreign company? 75. The $5,000 exemption will not apply if the associated entity is a CFC. This is to ensure that all income from CFCs is returned regardless of the amount. A separate exemption that may apply for CFCs is discussed at \[19\] and \[20\]. 20 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED References Subject references associated persons attribution of income from personal services controlled foreign companies income tax Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CQ 2, CX 21, CX 36, CX 38, DN 2, EE 6, EE 7, EX 1, GB 27 to GB 29, in s YA 1 (“associated persons”, “ car”, “motor vehicle”, “relative”), subpart YB, ss YD 1, YD 2, sch 14 Land Transport Act 1998, s 2 (“motor vehicle) Case references Case P26 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,196 (TRA) Case R37 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,208 (TRA) Case S26 (1994) 17 NZTC 7,182 (TRA) Case T38 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,255 (TRA) CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 (CA) CIR v Schick (1998) 18 NZTC 13,738 (HC) CIR v Trustpower Ltd (2016) 27 NZTC 22-010 (CA) Pabari v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions \[2005\] 1 All ER 287 (EWCA Civ) Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 5 ATD 87 (HCA) Other references “Attribution of Income” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000): 49 “IS 16/03: Tax Residence” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2 “IS 17/07: Fringe Benefit Tax – Motor Vehicles” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 9 (October 2017): 12 “New Definitions of ‘Associated Persons’” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 8 (October/November 2009): 75 “Travel by Motor Vehicle between Home and Work – Deductibility of Expenditure and FBT Implications” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004): 31 21 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix – Legislation Sections GB 27 to GB 29 provide: GB 27 Attribution rule for income from personal services Application of section GB 29 (1) An amount of income in an income year of a person (the associated entity) is attributed to another person (the working person) under section GB 29 for the working person’s corresponding tax year if,— (a) during the income year, a third person (the buyer) acquires services from the associated entity, and the services are personally performed by the working person; and (b) the working person is associated with the associated entity; and (c) the threshold test in subsection (2) is met; and (d) none of the exemptions in subsection (3) applies. Threshold for application of attribution rule (2) The attribution occurs only if— (a) 80% or more of the associated entity’s total income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to the buyer, a person associated with the buyer, or a combination of them; and (b) 80% or more of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived through services personally performed by the working person, a relative of the working person, or a combination of them; and (c) the working person’s net income for the income year, assuming section GB 29 applies in relation to the associated entity and working person, is more than $70,000; and (d) substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the total income referred to in paragraph (a). Exemptions (3) The attribution does not occur— (a) if both the associated entity and the working person are non-residents at all times during the associated entity’s income year: (b) if the associated entity is a natural person and is neither a partner of a partnership nor a trustee of a trust: (c) to the extent to which the services personally performed by the working person are essential support for a product supplied by the associated entity: (d) if the total amount to be attributed to the working person, for the associated entity and the income year, is less than $5,000, unless— (i) the application of this paragraph would prevent income being attributed to the working person for the income year in relation to another associated entity: (ii) the associated entity is a CFC and a person who holds an attributing interest in the CFC files, after the date (the Royal assent date) on which the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016 receives the Royal assent, a return of income in which the amount of income attributed to the working person is determined under this section: (e) if the associated entity is a CFC and— (i) the amount gives rise to attributed CFC income under section CQ 2(2B) (When attributed CFC income arises) or attributed CFC loss under 22 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED section DN 2(2) (When attributed CFC loss arises) for a person who holds an attributing interest in the CFC; and (ii) the person who holds the attributing interest in the CFC files, after the Royal assent date, a return of income in which the amount attributed to the working person is determined under section EX 20B (Attributable CFC amount). Treatment of certain dividends (4) If a company that is required to attribute an amount to the working person under this section pays a dividend, sections HA 14 to HA 19 (which relate to qualifying companies) are treated as applying to the company and the dividend if the company— (a) has no net income for the tax year in which it pays the dividend other than income attributed under this section, ignoring interest income that is incidental to the company’s business; and (b) is not a qualifying company; and (c) chooses to have the dividend treated as if it were paid by a qualifying company. Cancellation of notional imputation credits (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), to the extent to which the dividend paid by the company would have had an imputation credit attached that arose under section OB 16 (ICA attribution for personal services) in the absence of the election made under subsection (4)(c), the credit is treated as cancelled immediately before it would have been attached under sections HA 14 to HA 19 (which relate to dividends paid by qualifying companies). GB 28 Interpretation of terms used in section GB 27 When this section applies (1) This section applies for the purposes of section GB 27. Associated persons (2) A person is treated as being associated with another person if they are associated at the time the services are personally performed by the working person. Non-associated buyers (3) For the purposes of section GB 27(2)(a), a buyer is not treated as being associated with another buyer if either— (a) both buyers are public authorities; or (b) the working person cannot be reasonably expected to know that a particular buyer is associated with another buyer, other than by making a specific enquiry. Relatives (4) For the purposes of section GB 27(2)(b), a person is a relative of the working person only if the person is a relative at the beginning of the relevant income year of the working person. Fringe benefits included (5) For the purposes of section GB 27(2)(c), the working person’s annual gross income includes the taxable value of a fringe benefit, as determined under sections RD 25 to RD 63 (which relate to fringe benefit tax), provided or granted by a person associated with the working person. Meaning of substantial business assets (6) Substantial business assets means depreciable property that— (a) at the end of the associated entity’s corresponding income year, has a total cost of more than either— 23 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED (i) $75,000; or (ii) 25% or more of the associated entity’s total income from services for the income year; and (b) is not for private use. Assets subject to finance lease, hire purchase agreement, or specified lease (7) For the purposes of subsection (6)(a), the cost of depreciable property includes— (a) the consideration provided to the lessee in the case of property subject to a finance lease or a hire purchase agreement, including expenditure or loss incurred by the lessee in preparing and installing the finance lease asset for use, unless the lessee is allowed a deduction for the expenditure or loss, other than a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss: (b) the cost price, in the case of property subject to a specified lease. Private use of assets (8) Subsection (6)(b) does not apply to depreciable property if 20% or less of the property’s use is for private use. Calculation of private proportion of use (9) For the purposes of subsection (8), the percentage of a property’s use for private purposes for an income year is calculated according to— (a) the proportion that the number of days for which fringe benefit tax is payable by the associated entity in relation to the property bears to the total number of days in the income year in which the property is owned by or is subject to a finance lease, hire purchase agreement, or specified lease, involving the associated entity, if the property is subject to the FBT rules: (b) the proportion that the expenditure incurred in relation to the property, for which a deduction is denied to the associated entity, bears to all expenditure incurred by the associated entity in relation to the property in the income year, if the property is not subject to the FBT rules. GB 29 Attribution rule: calculation Amount attributed (1) A working person is treated as deriving income in an income year equal to the least of the following amounts: (a) the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year, calculated as if their only income were derived from personal services: (b) the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year: (c) if and to the extent to which the associated entity is a company or a trust that has a loss balance to be carried forward under section IA 4 (Using loss balances carried forward to tax year) arising from a business or a trading activity of supplying personal services, the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year after subtracting the loss balance carried forward from an earlier corresponding tax year. Calculation for trustee or partnership (2) For the purposes of calculating the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year in the application of subsection (1),— (a) if the associated entity is a trustee of a trust, the trustees are treated as not having made a distribution of beneficiary income out of the year’s income: (b) if the associated entity is a partnership, the associated entity is treated as a taxpayer and section HG 2 (Partnerships are transparent) does not apply: (c) if the associated entity is a look-through company, the associated entity is treated as a taxpayer and section HB 1 (Look-through companies are transparent) does not apply. 24 IS 18/03 UNCLASSIFIED Salary paid or fringe benefits treated as deductions (3) For the purposes of calculating the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year in the application of subsection (1),— (a) the associated entity is allowed a deduction for employment income paid to the working person during the income year: (b) the associated entity is allowed a deduction for the taxable value of a fringe benefit provided or granted by the associated entity to the working person during the income year, and for the fringe benefit tax payable on the fringe benefit. Reduction of attributable income for distributions (4) For the purposes of calculating the associated entity’s net income for the corresponding tax year in the application of subsection (1), the amount of net income of the associated entity for the corresponding tax year is reduced by— (a) in the case of a trustee of a trust, the amount of beneficiary income derived by the working person from the trust in the income year: (b) in the case of a partnership, the share of profits allocated by the partnership to the working person: (c) in the case of a company, a dividend paid— (i) by the associated entity to the working person during the income year or before the end of 6 months after the end of the income year; and (ii) from income derived in the income year. Attribution reduced by market value of administrative services (5) If the associated entity is a partnership that receives administrative services from another person related to their income from personal services and has not paid for the administrative services, the amount to be attributed to the working person is reduced by the market value of the administrative services provided by the other person. Reduction of beneficiary income when rule results in trust having tax loss (6) If the associated entity is a trustee and the amount attributable would cause the associated entity to have a tax loss for the corresponding tax year, for the purposes of this Act,— (a) beneficiary income from the trust for the income year must be reduced to the extent to which the associated entity’s taxable income for the corresponding tax year is zero; and (b) the reduction in beneficiary income must be divided among the beneficiaries other than the working person— (i) according to proportions determined by the trust’s trustees: (ii) if the trustees do not make the determination, according to the proportion that each beneficiary’s beneficiary income bears to the total beneficiary income from the trust for the income year. Attribution to more than 1 working person (7) If the amount attributable is to be attributed to more than 1 working person, the share attributed to each working person must reflect the respective value of the services personally performed by each working person.
UNCLASSIFIED 1 Interpretation Statement 18/05 – Fact Sheet Applying the “safe harbour” approach This fact sheet sets out the most important information from interpretation statement IS 18/05, including an explanation of Inland Revenue’s “safe harbour” approach to administering section LD 3(2)(a). For more detailed information please refer to the full statement. What is the interpretation statement about? 1. Interpretation statement IS 18/05 explains what is required to qualify as a donee organisation under section LD 3(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the key provision) in terms of how an organisation applies their funds. 2. People making monetary gifts of $5 or more to a donee organisation can obtain a tax benefit (see key tax benefit). 3. An organisation can qualify as a donee organisation if it applies its funds “wholly or mainly” to specified purposes within New Zealand (see key terms). 4. The statement clarifies the interpretation of important aspects of the “wholly or mainly” requirement and explains Inland Revenue’s safe harbour approach to administering the requirement (see key terms). 5. The statement provides guidance on how a donee organisation can retain this status under the key provision while applying some of its funds to purposes other than specified purposes within New Zealand. Who does the statement apply to? 6. The statement is relevant to an organisation that applies their funds to specified purposes within New Zealand and to other purposes (for example, overseas purposes). 7. The statement is not relevant to an organisation that only applies their funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. It is also not relevant to overseas donee organisations listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. When does the statement apply from? 8. The statement applies to and from the 2019/20 income year. This means from 1 April 2019 or the first day of the 2019/20 income year for an organisation with a non- standard balance date. Key terms “New Zealand” does not include Niue, the Cook Islands, Tokelau, or the Ross Dependency of Antarctica. “Organisation” means a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual. “Specified purposes” mean charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes. Key provision Section LD 3(2)(a): A donee organisation includes an organisation whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to specified purposes within New Zealand. Key tax benefit If a person makes a monetary gift of $5 or more to a donee organisation, they can receive a refundable tax credit or income tax deduction. Therefore, people may be more motivated to give to an organisation that qualifies as a donee organisation than to one that does not qualify. IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 2 Important information “Wholly or mainly” will be administered as meaning at least 75% 9. “Wholly or mainly” requires considerably more than 50% of a donee organisation’s funds to be applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. 10. Inland Revenue will administer the “wholly or mainly” requirement on a “safe harbour” basis of “75% or more”. This means Inland Revenue will generally accept without further enquiry that an organisation meeting or exceeding the safe harbour percentage of 75% has wholly or mainly applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. “Funds” means money readily available 11. The most appropriate meaning of “funds” is “money readily available” to an organisation at any point (that is, “cash on hand”). This includes cash and other highly liquid assets available to meet commitments. 12. For the purposes of the safe harbour calculation, the term “funds” is accepted as equating to the accounting concepts of “cash” and “cash equivalents”. “Applied” means used or devoted to 13. “Applied” means “devoted to” or “put to use”. Funds can be applied by being spent or accumulated. Accumulated means the funds are either set aside for future spending or invested. 14. While there are no specific limits on the extent to which funds can be accumulated, an organisation that simply accumulates funds will need to show that their funds are applied wholly or mainly to specified purposes within New Zealand. “Funds are applied” requirement 15. The legislative requirement that “funds are applied” has the following components:  The application of funds arises as a result of the organisation undertaking an affirmative act to accumulate money for, or spending it on, specified purposes within New Zealand.  The affirmative act necessary to invest or set aside funds is a decision to accumulate funds that has been made at the appropriate level in the organisation for decisions of that type according to the organisation’s established management practices. For example, the trustees of a charitable trust resolve to set aside money in the trust’s on-call savings account for a capital purchase in New Zealand.  The decision to accumulate funds needs sufficient detail to characterise the application of funds as advancing charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand. 16. If the funds are not spent and there is no appropriate decision to accumulate the funds for a purpose, the funds are not considered to have been applied to any purpose (see \[47\] to \[ 49\] below). 17. Funds are applied on a continuing basis over the lifetime of the donee organisation (although, for purposes of the safe harbour calculation it is practicable to look at funds applied over a year – see \[35\] below). IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 3 Specified purposes must be “within New Zealand” 18. It is the specified purposes that must be “within New Zealand”, not the application of funds. This means the location where funds are spent is not relevant. 19. The purpose sought to be achieved is determined objectively (see \[20\] to \[ 24\] below). How does an organisation decide if their funds are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand? Funds applied must have a sufficient connection to specified purposes within New Zealand 20. An organisation usually applies funds by spending them on goods or services in the course of carrying on some activity. It may also accumulate funds for future spending or donate funds to another organisation (see \[29\] to \[ 32\] below). 21. The character of an activity is determined by the reason for which the activity is carried out. That is, the underlying purpose sought to be advanced, as assessed objectively from the results of the activity. 22. An organisation needs to identify objectively whether a sufficient relationship (connection or nexus) exists between the purposes served by the actual or proposed activity and advancing specified purposes within New Zealand. The connection needs to be sufficiently direct, although it does not need to be an immediate connection (see \[25\] below). 23. Each application of funds must be assessed objectively on its own merits to determine whether some results are incidental or consequential to other results (see \[26\] below) or whether more than one purpose exists (see \[27\] to \[ 28\] below). 24. The examples after \[55\] below will help an organisation decide how much of its funds are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Funds applied may have immediate and less immediate purposes 25. The purpose or purposes served by an application of funds may be the immediate or less immediate purposes. For example, where trading activities:  directly achieve a certain object or objects of the organisation as set out in its founding documents, the funds applied to the immediate purpose of the trading activities are also applied to that object or objects;  are a way of raising funds, the funds applied to the immediate purpose of the trading activities are considered as being applied to the less immediate purpose or purposes to which the net surplus from trading will be applied. Funds applied may have incidental results 26. Some results of applying funds arise incidentally or as a consequence of achieving other results directly relatable to the objects of the organisation. These incidental or consequential results can be ignored when deciding whether the results bear a sufficient relationship to specified purposes within New Zealand (see examples 2, 7 to 9 and 15). Applying funds to more than one purpose 27. Results not naturally arising incidentally or as a consequence of other results that are pursued as a result in their own right may indicate the presence of another independent purpose for the funds applied. If so, the expenditure concerned may need to be IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 4 apportioned to different purposes, if the purposes differ as to whether they are specified purposes within New Zealand or other purposes. 28. The approach to apportionment is similar to apportioning deductions for expenditure for income tax. See the discussion about apportioning overheads in \[ 40\] to \[46\], the worked example in \[ 54\], and examples 3 and 4 below. Donating funds to another organisation 29. Where a donee organisation applies funds by donating them to another organisation, the donee organisation may need to establish it has applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand to ensure it meets the safe harbour. 30. The distinctive objects of the other organisation may indicate that the donated funds have been applied wholly to specified purposes within New Zealand and can be counted as such. 31. For example, a donation to a public institution or fund that has donee status under sections LD 3(2)(b), (c) or (d) would be a donation to an organisation or fund that is required to exclusively apply its funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. In other situations, the other organisation may have objects such that it is obvious any donations received by it are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. 32. In other cases, such as an overseas donee organisation listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the presumption, without evidence to the contrary, would be that the donated funds are applied to that organisation’s distinct overseas objects, rather than to specified purposes within New Zealand. How does the administrative safe harbour work? Introduction 33. An administrative safe harbour is a calculation method an organisation can adopt to arrive at a “safe harbour percentage”. If an organisation meets or exceeds the minimum safe harbour percentage, Inland Revenue will generally accept without further enquiry that the organisation meets the wholly or mainly requirement of s LD 3(2)(a). Inland Revenue has set the safe harbour figure at a minimum of 75%. 34. The safe harbour percentage is relevant only if the organisation applies funds to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand. Steps in the calculation 35. Calculating an organisation’s safe harbour percentage involves three steps:  Step 1: Use the organisation’s statement of cash flows in its financial statements or statement of receipts and payments in its performance report to find the organisation’s “total funds”. “Total funds” is the sum of the cash on hand at the end of a year and the cash spent during the year (that is, all cash outflows whether capital or revenue).  Step 2: Find the amount of the organisation's “funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand”. This is a combination of the cash spent, invested or set aside during the year entirely for specified purposes within New Zealand and amounts reasonably apportioned to those purposes.  Step 3: Divide the cash spent or set aside for specified purposes within New Zealand (as per step 2) by the organisation’s “total funds” (as per step 1 ) and express this as a percentage. This is the organisation’s safe harbour percentage for the year. IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 5 36. The financial statements or performance report for the organisation should be used, rather than any consolidated accounts that include financial information for other entities. An organisation that is not a registered charity may use their statement of cash flows or its equivalent from their financial reports. Investing and setting aside funds 37. Step 2 in the safe harbour calculation requires finding the amount of cash an organisation has spent or accumulated (ie, invested or set aside) for specified purposes within New Zealand. 38. Funds invested or set aside for future spending for some purpose or purposes are applied at the time the investment is acquired or the decision to set the funds aside is made. Practically this means that funds set aside but still on hand at balance date will be considered in every year’s safe harbour calculation up to and in the year they are spent. However, funds invested will be considered only in the year they are invested and again in the year it is spent. 39. Because the safe harbour calculation adopts the accounting terms “cash” and “cash equivalents” as a proxy for “funds” these terms will provide the basis for differentiating between funds set aside and investments. Generally, “cash equivalents” are short- term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Often these funds will be set aside for funding an organisation’s on-going operational expenses and will be, therefore, usually set aside for the purpose of advancing all the objects of the organisation. Apportioning “overheads” 40. Step 2 includes apportioning amounts where they have been spent or accumulated for specified purposes within New Zealand and for other purposes. 41. In some cases funds are applied in such a way that different purposes are served without distinction and the relative application of funds does not lend itself easily to measurement. This situation may arise for “overhead” type costs (for example, sundry office expenses). It may also arise for investments where funds have been accumulated for the general purposes of the organisation. It may also be true for the general operating funds of the organisation on hand at year-end. In many cases, the general operating funds of the organisation on hand at year-end will equate to all the “funds” (cash and cash equivalents) an organisation has set aside at year-end. 42. In such cases, some basis of apportionment is still required. Inland Revenue will generally accept apportioning these remaining funds based on the ratio established when the application of all the other funds is considered. That is, the ratio of the other funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand (being those applied entirely to those purposes or those apportioned already to those purposes on some other reasonable basis) compared to the total of all these other funds. 43. For example, an organisation determines that the total funds in a year it has spent or accumulated entirely for specified purposes within New Zealand is $1,000. It determines that other funds totalling $500 have been spent or accumulated for specified purposes within New Zealand and for other purposes. Using some apportionment method that is reasonable given the particular nature of these funds, the organisation apportions $200 of this total to specified purposes within New Zealand. The ratio of funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand established so far is, therefore, 80% ((1,000 + 200) / (1,000 + 500)). IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 6 44. The organisation has remaining funds of $800 that have been applied to a combination of purposes. This amount includes the organisation’s cash and cash equivalents on hand at year-end held as operating funds and other “overhead” expenses that relate to all the purposes of the organisation without distinction. It is assumed there is no discernable and reasonable basis on which to apportion these funds. Therefore, Inland Revenue will generally accept that these funds can be apportioned using the percentage arrived at by considering the way the other $1,500 of the organisation’s funds have been spent or accumulated (that is, 80% to specified purposes within New Zealand). 45. In that case, the $800 of remaining funds is apportioned to specified purposes within New Zealand to the extent of $640 (800 x 80%). This means, assuming all of the organisation’s funds for the year have been applied to a purpose, the organisation’s “total funds” of $2,300 (1,500 + 800), have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand to the extent of $1,840 (1,000 + 200 + 640). The organisation’s safe harbour percentage is 80% (1,840 / 2,300). 46. Including these remaining funds in the calculation does not affect the safe harbour percentage already determined from the consideration of the other funds spent or accumulated because the $800 in this example is apportioned using the same ratio of 80%. Practically, therefore, these funds could be ignored for the purposes of the calculation. However, as mentioned, this applies only to funds spent or accumulated for different purposes where no other reasonable basis on which they can be apportioned exists. Treatment of funds not accumulated for a purpose 47. Most organisations are likely to have spent or accumulated all of their funds for a purpose in any given year. In other words, they will not have any funds that have not been spent or accumulated for a purpose. This is because the organisation has taken some affirmative act to spend or accumulate all of its funds for a purpose. 48. If so, in the safe harbour calculation the total of funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand plus the funds that have been applied to other purposes will always equal the organisation’s “total funds” for the year. 49. However, if an organisation does have funds that have not been accumulated for a purpose, this will not be the case. The funds that have not been accumulated for a purpose will still be part of the “total funds” for the purposes of calculating the organisation’s safe harbour percentage. However, by definition, these funds have not been accumulated for any purpose. Therefore, they cannot be counted as funds that have been accumulated for specified purposes within New Zealand. The practical implication of this may be to reduce the percentage of funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand for that year. Failing to achieve the safe harbour percentage 50. If an organisation fails to meet the safe harbour of 75% in any year, Inland Revenue will accept a revised calculation based on the current year and the two preceding years. In such a case, the organisation can recalculate the percentage on the basis of the cumulative total of its funds applied over the current and preceding two years (including years before the commencement of the statement). This allows some year-on-year variation for exceptional years. Table 1 provides an example of the rolling three-year cumulative approach that Inland Revenue will accept. IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 7 Table 1: Example of the rolling three-year cumulative approach to the safe harbour calculation Year -2 $ Year -1 $ Current year $ Total funds 10,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00 Funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand 9,000.00 4,000.00 3,000.00 Percentage of total funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand (safe harbour percentage) 90% 80% 60% Cumulative total funds 10,000.00 15,000.00 20,000.00 Cumulative funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand 9,000.00 13,000.00 16,000.00 Cumulative percentage of total funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand (cumulative safe harbour percentage) 90% 87% 80% 51. This means an organisation can be below the safe harbour percentage of 75% in an exceptional year provided the rolling three-year cumulative percentage is 75% or more. However, it would not be expected that an organisation would apply 50% or less of its funds to specified purposes within New Zealand in any particular year. 52. If the rolling three-year cumulative safe harbour percentage of funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand in a year is below 75% or the figure in any year is 50% or below, then the organisation should contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible. 53. Some options may be available if an organisation finds complying with the wholly or mainly requirement of s LD 3(2)(a) difficult. For example, an organisation may wish to consider whether to establish and maintain a fund exclusively for specified purposes within New Zealand under section LD 3(2)(c). In that situation, the fund, rather than the organisation, would hold donee organisation status and tax benefits could accrue to donors to the fund. In cases where the safe harbour is not met, an organisation should discuss their situation with Inland Revenue. IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 8 Example of how the safe harbour percentage is calculated 54. The following example from the statement shows how the safe harbour is calculated. EduParcel is an organisation established primarily to provide grants to New Zealand students, but it also provides occasional assistance in developing countries by distributing food parcels. EduParcel has generally funded its operations through donations from the public. EduParcel is approved as a registered charity with Charities Services and has donee organisation status under s LD 3(2)(a). Since it is a small organisation, EduParcel has opted to apply the tier 4 reporting standards for registered charities. This requires EduParcel to file an annual performance report and annual return to Charities Services. EduParcel commences its activities on 1 April 2019 with unpaid volunteer staff. It has a 31 March balance date. In its first year of operations, EduParcel receives donations of $22,000. Included in the donations is a $10,000 bequest. EduParcel’s management board resolves to invest this amount as surplus operating funds to be applied to all its purposes in the future. Accordingly, it resolves to invest the funds in a term deposit for future spending on all of the organisation’s purposes. EduParcel opens a cheque account with a trading bank specifically for the purpose of meeting its on-going operating costs. It also opens a savings account with the bank for the purpose of holding operating funds not needed immediately on an interest- bearing basis. The savings account generates $20 of interest income for the year. EduParcel rents an office, and pays for office supplies, contents insurance, power, phone, internet and a website. It also rents a small storage unit to house the food parcels and related material. These costs amount to $9,300. To fund these expenses, it initially borrows $2,000 interest-free from a supporter. This amount is repaid from donations later in the year. EduParcel also purchases some office furniture for $800 during the year. During the year, EduParcel provides Sally, a New Zealand physics student from a disadvantaged background, with a $1,150 grant to assist her New Zealand university studies. It also spends $50 to send a food parcel to an overseas developing country. At year-end EduParcel has set aside $300 in its cheque account and $420 in its savings account for future operating costs. For the year ended 31 March 2020, EduParcel produces a performance report including the following statement of receipts and payments: IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 9 Table 2: Example – EduParcel’s statement of receipts and payments for the year ended 31 March 2020 EduParcel Statement of Receipts and Payments “How was it funded?” and “What did it cost?” For the year ended: 31 March 2020 Notes Actual Actual This Year Last Year $ $ Operating Receipts Donations, fundraising and other similar receipts 22,000 Fees, subscriptions and other receipts from members - Receipts from providing goods or services - Interest, dividends and other investment income receipts 20 Other operating receipts - Total Operating Receipts 22,020 - Operating Payments Payments relating to public fundraising - Volunteer and employee related payments - Payments related to providing goods or services 3 9,300 Grants and donations paid 3 1,200 Other operating payments - Total Operating Payments 10,500 - Operating Surplus or (Deficit) 11,520 Capital receipts Receipts from sale of resources Receipts from borrowings 2,000 Capital payments Purchase of resources 3 800 Repayment of borrowings 3 2,000 Increase /(Decrease) in Bank Account and Cash 10,720 - Bank accounts and cash at beginning of the financial year - Bank accounts and Cash at the End of the Financial Year 10,720 - Represented by: Cheque account(s) 300 Savings accounts(s) 420 Term Deposit account(s) 10,000 Cash Floats - Petty Cash - Total Bank A/cs and Cash at the End of the Financial Year 10,720 - Following the method in Figure 1 above, EduParcel uses the statement of receipts and payments from the performance report to determine its “total funds”. “Total funds” comprises the amounts highlighted in green in Table 2. They are the: • Operating and Capital Payments made (10,500 + 2,800 = $13,300) • Bank Accounts and Cash at the End of the Financial Year ($10,720). IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 10 Accordingly, EduParcel has spent funds of $13,300 and has $10,720 left over that it has accumulated by investing or setting aside at the end of the year, giving it a “total funds” figure of $24,020. “Total funds” of $24,020 is the same amount obtained by adding EduParcel’s: • opening bank accounts and cash (nil); and • receipts from all sources for the year (22,020 + 2,000 as highlighted in yellow in Table 2). Step 2 in the safe harbour calculation requires finding the amount of cash EduParcel has spent or accumulated for specified purposes within New Zealand. In this example, EduParcel does not have any cash that has not been spent or accumulated for a purpose. Accordingly, all of its “total funds” have been “applied” by being spent or accumulated. The notes to the performance report provide further details of EduParcel’s payments (see Table 3): Table 3: Example – EduParcel’s notes to the performance report for the year ended 31 March 2020 EduParcel Notes to the Performance Report For the year ended: 31 March 2020 Note 3: Analysis of Payments “What did it cost?” Payment item Analysis This Year Last Year $ $ Payments relating to public fundraising - Total - - Payment item Analysis Volunteer and employee-related payments - Total - - Payment item Analysis Payments related to providing goods or services Rent on NZ office 7,800 Rent on storage unit 300 Office supplies 200 Contents Insurance 500 Power/phone/internet 300 Website costs 200 Total 9,300 - Payment item Analysis Grants and donations paid NZ scholarship grant 1,150 African food parcel programme 50 Total 1,200 - Payment item Analysis Other operating payments - Total - - Payment item Analysis Capital payments Property, plant and equipment 800 Repayment of borrowings 2,000 Total 2,800 - IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 11 To find the amount spent and accumulated for “funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand” EduParcel first finds the amounts spent or accumulated entirely for specified purposes within New Zealand. The only amount spent entirely for specified purposes within New Zealand is the education grant of $1,150. EduParcel then finds the amounts that have been spent or accumulated entirely for purposes other than specified purposes within New Zealand. These amounts are the rent on the storage unit of $300 and the food parcel of $50 because both these amounts relate to EduParcel’s activities for advancing purposes overseas. All of EduParcel’s remaining funds have been spent or accumulated for both specified purposes within New Zealand and other purposes. EduParcel next considers whether any of these funds can be apportioned between these different purposes on some discernible and reasonable basis. It concludes that, because the contents insurance covers property in both its office and the storage shed, most of the insurance premium of $500 relates to its office furniture based on the relative insured values of the property. From this, it determines the relative insured values are 20% for overseas purposes and 80% for specified purposes within New Zealand. Accordingly, it apportions $400 of the premium to specified purposes within New Zealand. EduParcel considers that in relation to the remaining funds no readily discernible basis on which to make an apportionment exists. This is because none of these other amounts can be specifically attributed to its New Zealand educational activities, or to its foreign food parcel programme. However, these remaining amounts need to be apportioned between specified purposes within New Zealand and other purposes on some basis. The amounts in question are the:  payments relating to providing goods or services (such as the office rent and office supplies but excluding the storage unit rent and contents insurance) of $8,500;  capital payment to purchase office furniture of $800;  funds spent on repaying the loan of $2,000;  funds invested in the term deposit of $10,000; and  funds set aside as operating funds and held in the cheque and savings accounts at year-end of $720. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that these amounts serve all of EduParcel’s purposes without distinction and that there is no more reasonable basis to apportion these amounts. As such, they can be apportioned on the ratio of the previous amounts referred to that relate entirely to a purpose or can be reasonably apportioned on some other basis. EduParcel prepares a spread sheet (in Table 4) showing these amounts: IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 12 Table 4: Example – EduParcel safe harbour calculation EduParcel – Safe harbour calculation Item Specified purposes within NZ $ Other purposes $ Total $ Funds applied entirely for a purpose: NZ scholarship grant 1,150 1,150 Overseas food parcel programme 50 50 Storage unit rent 300 300 Funds applied for both purposes – apportioned on some reasonable basis Contents insurance 400 100 500 Total 1,550 450 2,000 Percentage of funds applied 78% 22% 100% Funds applied for a combination of purposes apportioned on above percentage: Operating payments 6,630 1,870 8,500 Purchase of office furniture 624 176 800 Loan repayment 1,560 440 2,000 Term deposit 7,800 2,200 10,000 Cash held for general operating purposes 562 158 720 Total 17,176 4,844 22,020 Funds applied to no purpose - - - Total funds applied $18,726 $5,294 $24,020 EduParcel finds its safe harbour percentage by taking its “funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand” ($18,726) and dividing it by its “total funds” ($24,020) to arrive at a percentage of 78%. On the basis of this single year’s results, Inland Revenue would generally accept without further enquiry that EduParcel has applied 78% of its total funds to specified purposes within New Zealand and is within the 75% wholly or mainly administrative safe harbour. As can be seen in this example, the safe harbour percentage could be established by just considering the funds entirely applied to a purpose plus those able to be apportioned on some other discernible and reasonable basis (ie, the funds applied totalling $2,000 shown in the first part of Table 4). This is because the funds applied to a combination of purposes that cannot be apportioned on some other discernible and reasonable basis are apportioned on the same ratio (in this case, 78%). Organisations apportioning funds applied on this basis will need to be able to show that there is no other basis for apportionment (eg, floor area or time basis – see the discussion of apportionment above). However, Inland Revenue will generally accept this basis applying at least to the extent of funds set aside and on hand at year-end as operating funds. Following this simplified approach it would be possible for EduParcel to calculate the safe harbour percentage in the following manner shown in Table 5: IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 13 Table 5: Example – EduParcel safe harbour calculation (simplified) EduParcel – Safe harbour calculation Item Specified purposes within NZ $ Other purposes $ Total $ Funds applied entirely to a purpose: NZ scholarship grant 1,150 1,150 Overseas food parcel programme 50 50 Storage unit rent 300 300 Funds applied to both purposes – apportioned on some reasonable basis Contents insurance 400 100 500 1,550 450 2,000 Percentage of funds applied 78% 22% 100% Funds applied to a combination of purposes apportioned on above percentage: 17,176 4,844 22,020 Total funds applied $18,726 $5,294 $24,020 IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 14 Examples – how to determine when funds are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand 55. As mentioned, the following examples from the statement will help an organisation decide how much of its total funds are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. The following examples involve the Foliage Foundation. This foundation is a charitable organisation with donee organisation status under s LD 3(2)(a). The Foundation was established with the primary object of supporting and undertaking the restoration or maintenance of New Zealand native forests by promoting or undertaking native tree planting programmes in New Zealand bush reserves. Other objects include public education on indigenous forest conservation issues in New Zealand and overseas as well as assisting or co-operating with other people or organisations with similar aims in New Zealand or overseas. Example 1 – Spending overseas to further New Zealand specified purposes The Foliage Foundation purchases and imports from a foreign supplier certain specialty tools used for clearing land and planting trees. Although the purchase involves spending offshore, the purpose of the expenditure is to advance the foundation’s New Zealand tree planting activities. Therefore, the spending is regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 2 – Spending in New Zealand to further overseas purposes The Foliage Foundation becomes concerned about the loss of rain forest in the Amazon basin of South America through logging and land clearing for agriculture. In response, it carries out a campaign in New Zealand to raise awareness about deforestation in the Amazon. The campaign involves a series of road shows around New Zealand for which the foundation pays each speaker’s expenses and a speaker’s fee. It pays an Auckland business to create a new website, separate from the foundation’s general website, with information specific to the Amazon rainforest issues. It also produces a number of television and radio advertisements that are broadcast on New Zealand stations. The campaign is directed at bringing about a halt to deforestation outside New Zealand. Any result this would bring about within New Zealand, for instance the effects this might arguably have on New Zealand’s climate, arises incidentally to the primary purpose of the campaign. Accordingly, the application of funds to the campaign does not bear a sufficiently direct relationship to specified purposes within New Zealand. Therefore, the various costs are not regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 3 – Apportionment of expenses – wage costs dissected or apportioned The Amazon rainforest campaign in example 2 is very successful, so the Foliage Foundation hires one additional staff member to work full time on Amazon rainforest issues. The foundation has 19 other staff employed to carry on its New Zealand planting programme. It needs to dissect its total wage expense by staff member and consider the purpose for which each staff member is employed. The salaries of the 19 staff are funds applied to specified purposes within IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 15 New Zealand. However, the salary for the employee working on the Amazon rainforest issues is not. If any staff member was employed for more than one purpose, some apportionment of the individual’s wage expense on a reasonable basis might then be needed (for example, by hours spent on each purpose). This would require the foundation keeping adequate records to substantiate any apportionment calculation. Example 4 – Apportionment of expenses – electricity bill apportioned The Foliage Foundation is based in temporary accommodation from where all its activities are undertaken or directed and where all of the organisation’s staff are located. It receives and pays a $300 electricity bill for its accommodation. Unlike the previous example, it cannot reasonably trace the exact usage of electricity and dissect the electricity bill into the portion that relates to specified purposes within New Zealand and the portion that relates to its activities in relation to the Amazon. Accordingly, it needs to find some reasonable basis on which to apportion the electricity bill. In the absence of a more reasonable basis, Inland Revenue will generally accept apportionment of overhead expenses, such as electricity, on the basis of the percentage established by the funds that have been applied entirely to a single purpose plus those that have been apportioned using some other apportionment method. In this case, the foundation works out that it has applied funds entirely to specified purposes within New Zealand to the extent of $8,000 and entirely to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand of $2,000. It has no other funds it can apportion on another discernible and reasonable basis. Accordingly, it apportions its electricity bill as being applied to specified purposes within New Zealand in the same ratio. This means the electricity bill is apportioned to specified purposes within New Zealand to the extent of $240 ($8,000 / $10,000 x $300 = $240). Example 5 – Scholarships for New Zealand students to study overseas The Foliage Foundation decides to start providing scholarships to high-achieving New Zealand arboriculture students to increase expertise in New Zealand. The scholarships allow students to undertake a year of study on courses specialising in the restoration of native forests at a foreign university. Although the scholarship funds are spent offshore and the students carry out their studies overseas, the students are required to return to New Zealand and many continue to work in related sectors in New Zealand. The results of having increased arboriculture skills and knowledge available to the foundation and New Zealand in general provide a sufficient connection to specified purposes within New Zealand. Therefore, the scholarship costs are regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 6 – Sending employees to overseas conference The Foliage Foundation joins the Native Tree League, a worldwide network of organisations promoting native tree development programmes. Joining is free and entitles the foundation to attend the league’s annual conference and access technical resources and expertise from the league members. The foundation decides to send two of its employees to the league’s annual conference held that year in Argentina and has to pay for flights and accommodation. No holiday element is included in the trip. The employees return with increased knowledge of native tree preservation. IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 16 The results of having increased skills and knowledge available to the foundation provide a sufficient connection to specified purposes within New Zealand. As such, the travel costs are regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 7 - Sending a speaker to an overseas conference The Foliage Foundation decides to send another employee to present a paper at the annual Native Tree League conference in Argentina. The paper will be about their involvement in a recent study into kauri conservation. The foundation pays for the flights and accommodation and the employee attends the conference. No holiday element is included in the trip. One result of the expenditure is to benefit the foreign conference attendees with increased knowledge of kauri conservation issues. However, the employee’s presentation will also raise the profile of the foundation and international awareness of indigenous forest conservation issues in New Zealand. The employee will return with increased knowledge of these issues from attending the balance of the conference. Any personal benefit to the employee and any benefit to the other conference attendees who attend the paper’s presentation is incidental to these purposes. Therefore, the travel costs are regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 8 – Hosting overseas representatives Following the conference (example 7), the Foliage Foundation hosts two Native Tree League representatives while they are visiting New Zealand. Whether the expenditure incurred in hosting the representatives can be regarded as advancing specified purposes within New Zealand will depend on the purpose of the representatives’ visit. For instance, if the representatives are hosted while carrying on activities for the Native Tree League or during a private visit to New Zealand the expenditure will not advance the foundation’s objects. Therefore, the hosting costs are unlikely to be regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. However, if the representatives were hosted, for example, because they were the keynote speakers at the foundation’s annual conference, then the hosting costs would be considered as being applied to advance specified purposes within New Zealand with any benefit to the Native Tree League being incidental. In other circumstances, the hosting costs might advance the purposes of both organisations in which case some apportionment on a reasonable basis would be acceptable. Example 9 – Contribution to a foreign organisation A representative from the Native Tree League contacts the Foliage Foundation and asks for a contribution to the construction of the league’s worldwide headquarters in Argentina. The foundation decides that it will contribute a lump-sum payment because of the organisations’ shared interest in developing native tree planting programmes throughout the world. The contribution directly advances the purposes of the league overseas as it helps bring about the result that the league has new headquarters. This may have some indirect results that benefit members of the league in other countries, such as the foundation. However, such results are incidental to the direct advancement of the league’s purposes. This means the contribution does not bear a sufficiently direct relationship to specified purposes within New Zealand. Therefore, the contribution is IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 17 not regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 10 – Investment in New Zealand and overseas To fund major planting projects planned for the South Island for coming years, the Foliage Foundation decides to use funds to invest in a portfolio of shares and bonds. Some of the shares and bonds it buys are in New Zealand companies, but most are in overseas listed companies. Most of the income from its investments is from overseas. The investment income will be reinvested until such time as all the investments are sold to fund the planned planting projects. The purchase of the shares and bonds and subsequent reinvestment of investment income involves the application of funds. The purpose advanced by the application of these funds is the less immediate purpose to which the investments will ultimately be applied. This purpose is the foundation’s tree-planting purposes within New Zealand. It is not relevant that some of the investments are overseas or that the source of some of the investment income is from overseas. Therefore, the accumulation of funds is regarded as being funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. When the investments are realised in the future, the cash spent on the South Island planting projects will also be an application of funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 11 – Purchase of materials by trading activity The Foliage Foundation decides to run a small trading activity making and selling designer bush shirts from a shop in Wellington. It uses cash from its general operating funds to buy from overseas and New Zealand suppliers the raw materials used to manufacture the shirts. The shirts are then sold and the surplus used to fund the foundation’s New Zealand planting programmes. The relevant purpose to which the cash used to purchase raw materials is applied is the less immediate purpose of generating funds for the foundation to apply to its purposes of tree planting in New Zealand. Therefore, the purchase of the raw materials is regarded as being funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 12 – Funding a future project The Foliage Foundation decides to buy a small block of land adjacent to a bush reserve and build an office and storage yard. It intends to use the premises for its permanent New Zealand head office from which all its activities are undertaken or directed and where its equipment is stored. All foundation staff will be located in the head office. The foundation appeals to its supporters for financial assistance. Tim, a foundation supporter, donates all the money needed to buy the land. In anticipation of Tim’s donation being spent on the new property, the foundation’s officers make a decision to invest the donation and create a building reserve fund in the foundation’s financial accounts. As further donations and funds arise they will be invested as a result of further decisions to accumulate funds towards this capital project. Ultimately, the capital project will result in advancing all the foundation’s objects by providing the site of the foundation’s future premises. As with example 4, apportionment of the funds accumulated is required as the foundation’s objects are advanced both within and outside of New Zealand. IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 18 Example 13 – Expenses related to a fixed asset The Foliage Foundation realises its investments and completes the capital project (from example 12) in a subsequent financial year. At this point, it needs to reconsider whether the cash realised from the investments is being spent for specified purposes within New Zealand. As it still intends to use the property for all of its activities, the funds being applied to the project will need to be apportioned on the same basis as previously. In the future, any costs of holding the property (such as local authority rates and insurance) may also need to be apportioned on a reasonable basis between all the foundation’s purposes. The holding costs could be apportioned using a similar approach to that used in example 4. Example 14 – Loan funds and repayments Instead of receiving all of the money needed for its new premises from a donation (as in example 12), the Foliage Foundation borrows some of what is needed from a trading bank. On borrowing the money from the bank, the money immediately becomes part of the foundation’s total funds for the purposes of the safe harbour calculation. The borrowed funds are applied by being accumulated until they are spent, as in the earlier example. When the borrowed funds are spent, the foundation will need to consider the purpose for which the premises will be used. If, (as in example 13) all the funds are being applied to more than one purpose, they will need to be apportioned for the purposes of the safe harbour calculation. Subsequently, the foundation will apply further funds to repay the loan from the bank. The purpose of the funds applied to the loan repayments will follow the purposes to which the original loan money was spent on. Example 15 – Overseas people viewing the Foliage Foundation’s general website The Foliage Foundation maintains two websites. One has general information about the foundation and details its New Zealand planting programmes and scholarships. The second, separate, website holds information about the foundation’s Amazon rainforest work (see example 2) and links to the Native Tree League’s website (see example 6). The foundation’s general website includes a link to this second website, but contains none of its content. The foundation finds that both of its websites get hits from visitors from overseas countries. However, because the general website’s content is not specifically directed to the foundation’s overseas activities, any use of the website by overseas persons is incidental. The expenditure involved in running the general website will still be viewed as advancing the foundation’s purposes in New Zealand. Therefore, the general website’s costs are regarded as being an application of funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. However, if in the future any of the content of the general website was specifically directed at advancing overseas purposes, some apportionment of the on-going website costs on a reasonable basis may be necessary. Example 16 – Spending for foreign posted worker holidaying in New Zealand After a few years, the Foliage Foundation’s Amazon rainforest campaign’s effectiveness declines. The foundation thinks it can make a greater difference by spending the same amount to engage somebody to travel to South America to IS 18/05 Fact Sheet UNCLASSIFIED 19 undertake rainforest protection work. The foundation sends one of its long-time supporters, Emma, to Brazil. After spending a year in Brazil, Emma returns to New Zealand for a two week holiday to see her family and friends. At the end of her holiday Emma will return to her duties in Brazil. The foundation helps pay for Emma’s travel and accommodation while she is in New Zealand. Although the travel and accommodation costs are spent in New Zealand, they are costs involved in advancing the foundation’s overseas purposes because Emma is primarily engaged in the activity of advancing rainforest protection work in Brazil even though she is temporarily visiting New Zealand. Therefore, the travel and accommodation costs will not be regarded as being an application of funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 17 – Government contracts The Foliage Foundation enters into an agreement with a government department where, in return for the payment of a grant, the foundation carries out native forest restoration on Crown conservation land. On receipt, the grant will be part of the foundation’s total funds for the purposes of the safe harbour calculation. The foundation uses the grant to purchase native tree seedlings and to pay temporary employees to plant them. The grant spent on seedlings and employee wages are costs associated with the provision of outputs under the government contract. The purpose of the expenditure will, therefore, follow the purpose of the government contract. Since the purpose of the government contract is to restore New Zealand native forests, the expenditure advances specified purposes within New Zealand. Therefore, the grant money spent and the portion set aside for future spending under the grant agreement are regarded as being an application of funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. The same conclusion will apply, if the contract is terminated and, under the terms of the grant agreement, any unspent grant money is required to be repaid to the government department.
