This is 25% less time than in 2013 (36 hours), which in turn was 25% less time than in 2009. Median hourly value of that time holds steady In 2016 the median hourly value of that time was $56.47/hour, similar to the value in 2013 ($52.40/hour). But because SMEs are spending less time overall, the median value of their in-house costs has reduced by 24% since 2013. Median value of external costs also reduces Using tax professionals – tax agents, accountants, and tax lawyers – external to their business contributes to SMEs’ overall compliance costs. In 2016, most SMEs used tax agents and/or accountants to help them meet their tax obligations. In 2016, the median annual value of SMEs’ use of tax professionals was $1,000. This is a little lower (10% less) than in 2013. Overall stress levels are low In 2016, almost half of SMEs said meeting their tax obligations caused little or no stress; and the majority (88%) said it required about the same or less effort as it did the year before. More detail about the time, money and effort SMEs said they spent on meeting their tax obligations in 2016 is available in the following chapter, Survey Results. 25% $1,573 27hrs 89% $1,000 49% 1 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Four focus groups supported the 2016 survey of SMEs’ compliance costs. The participants were a mix of high, medium and low compliance cost customers; half were employers, and half worked by themselves. The findings below offer insights into the underlying factors affecting the time, money and effort SMEs spend meeting their tax obligations. SMEs’ perception of compliance costs: reasonable, and improved Focus group participants said compliance costs were comprised mainly of their tax agents’ fees and the time spent undertaking compliance activities (such as recording information). Most participants were confident they manage their tax obligations effectively, with processes or support services in place, and felt mistakes were likely to be minor. Most feel the current obligation workload is reasonable. They perceived compliance costs to have reduced since 2013 due to IR’s better customer service, less paperwork and more use of digital filing, and improved online services. Factors contributing to compliance costs... ...higher compliance costs: ...lower compliance costs: More staff; casual workforce with varying hours; staff with fines, tax arrears, and interactions with other agencies The type of business (e.g., exporting and importing adds complexity) A higher number of transactions within the business Business owners/managers with low tax knowledge and low ICT ability (some still struggle with new technology and are reluctant to change) Cost of tax agents (and varying level of use) Find completing and filing returns stressful Using accounting software Good systems and processes within the business Using IR’s digital channels to file returns Better customer service from IR Better accounts interfaces with suppliers and banks Keeping tax rule changes to a minimum Opportunities for IR to further reduce compliance costs Raise awareness of the low cost of accounting software, especially amongst the self-employed Promote our reminder service that notifies customers when their filing and payment dates have passed Acknowledging all returns and payments received, preferably by email Improve content and functionality on ird.govt.nz, like simplifying language and offering step-by-step videos, and one platform for all returns 2 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Executive summary Compliance costs are a key measure of how well Inland Revenue is meeting its goal of making it easier and more efficient for businesses to meet their tax obligations. Key survey findings The time SMEs spend within their business on tax compliance continues to reduce In 2016 the median annual number of in-house hours spent on tax by SMEs was 27 (a reduction of 25% from 36 hours in 2013). 48% of these hours were spent on recording information (53% in 2013). This was the most time-consuming activity across all tax types covered (GST, Income Tax, PAYE, KiwiSaver, and FBT). GST was the most time-consuming tax type, accounting for a median 14 annual hours in 2016 (compared to a median 24 hours a year in 2013). The hourly cost of SMEs’ time is similar, but the overall cost to SMEs has reduced SME owners undertake the bulk of tax compliance activities undertaken within their businesses. Adjusting for inflation, the value of SME owners’ time in 2016 is similar to that in 2013 ($71/hour vs $61/hour). The combined median internal and external annual cost of compliance to SMEs is $3,200; a reduction of 12% from $3,654 in 2013. The median annual cost of in-house compliance activities is $1,573 (compared with $2,076 in 2013), bringing it back to below 2004 levels. The internal cost to SMEs has reduced by 24% due to all staff spending less time in- house on compliance activities. Stress levels are low In 2016, almost half (49%) of SMEs considered meeting their tax obligations to cause little or no stress, and the majority (86%) reported it was not at all stressful to moderately stressful (84% in 2013). Growing use of tax professionals, digital accounting and digital payroll systems In 2016, 89% of SMEs used a tax agent, accountant and/or tax lawyer to help meet their tax obligations. Three quarters (76%) of SMEs used digital methods of accounting and 60% of Employer SMEs used digital payroll systems (i.e., Excel spreadsheets, or PC-based and web-based software). Importance of these findings for business transformation Although the median hours spent within and external to their business have reduced since 2004, the cost of compliance to SMEs is still an important consideration for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. Designing and delivering services and systems that facilitate compliance in a customer-centric manner remains a priority for Inland Revenue. 3 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Focus group findings Four focus groups supported the survey, to offer insights into the factors affecting the time, money and effort SMEs spend meeting their tax obligations. Participants identified their tax agents’ fees and the time spent undertaking compliance activities (such as recording information) as their primary compliance costs. Most felt the current obligation workload is reasonable, as they have appropriate processes and systems in place to manage it effectively. SMEs’ compliance costs since 2013 were seen to have reduced due to better customer-centred service from Inland Revenue, less paperwork and more use of Inland Revenue’s digital service channels, and improvements to Inland Revenue’s online services. Specific characteristics of the businesses were associated with higher compliance costs: having more staff; casual workforce with varying hours; staff with fines, tax arrears, and interactions with other government agencies; businesses that import and export, and/or have high number of transactions; business owners/managers with low tax knowledge and low ICT ability, using high-cost tax agents, and find completing and filing returns stressful. Participants used tax agents and accountants to ensure their returns are correct and tax obligations were minimised (in particular, their Income Tax return). Some perceived tax returns submitted by agents as less likely to be reviewed by Inland Revenue, and this also gave them peace of mind. Opportunities for Inland Revenue In addition, the following opportunities for Inland Revenue were identified: Raise awareness of the benefits and low cost of accounting software, particularly amongst self- employed business individuals. Promote Inland Revenue’s customer reminder system, as it includes reminder s of dates missed. Acknowledging all returns and payments received, preferably by email. Improve content and functionality on ird.govt.nz, particularly video and other visual step-by-step guides explaining processes and bringing all returns into one platform. This report The following chapters present the results and findings of the survey and the focus groups in detail, followed by a brief Conclusion that reiterates the opportunities for Inland Revenue to make further meaningful changes that will reduce SMEs’ compliance costs. 4 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Survey results In 2016 Inland Revenue conducted a survey of n=4,028 Small-to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). This chapter presents the survey results, using the median value (half are higher and half are lower) rather than the mean (average), to best reflect the diversity of SMEs. Population The definition of the 2016 population of SMEs is available in the Appendix: Methodology. The eligible survey population was 372,296. Using the Kish allocation procedure, endorsed by Statistics New Zealand, the drawn sample was 28,746. The achieved survey population was 4,028; a response rate of 14%. Respondent characteristics Table 1: Proportion of SME population and survey respondents by number of employees (2016) Number of employees SME population (unweighted n=372,296) % Survey respondents (unweighted n=4,028) % Nil employees 62 55 Micro (1-5) 21 21 Small (6-19) 12 15 Medium (20+) 4 9 Note: Figures may not total 100% due to rounding.

Compared to 2013, the median total hours spent on all tax activities in 2016 reduced by 25% (from a median 36 hours to 27, as shown in Table 3), continuing the trend established in 2009. GST remains the most time-consuming tax Followed closely by PAYE (median 12 hours annually), GST remains the most time-consuming tax in 2016 (median 14 hours annually). The median time SMEs spent on Income Tax has halved (from 12 hours in 2013 to six hours in 2016). Just 8% of respondents said they had one tax type; 92% said they had more than one. Table 3: Median annual hours of in-house time SMEs spent by tax type (2004-2016) Tax type 2004 2009 2013 2016 GST 33 24 24 14 Income Tax 18 12 12 6 PAYE 15 12 12 12 KiwiSaver - 9 9 9 FBT 8 3 4 2 All tax types (median annual hours)\* 55 48 36 27 \*Note: As these are medians, the total hours do not equal the sum of the components. Recording information remains the most time-consuming compliance activity As shown by Tables 4 and 5, recording information has accounted for around half of the total hours spent on dealing with tax between 2004 and 2013; and a slightly lower proportion in 2016. Calculating tax, completing and filing returns and paying tax together make up the next most time-consuming set of activities. It is anticipated that the changes being made through Business Transformation will see further reductions in the amount of time spent on these activities, continuing the trend established in 2009.

Table 5: Apportioned annual hours of in-house time SMEs spent on tax activities (2004 – 2016) Activity 2004 2009 2013 2016 Recording information 26.3 23.9 18.9 12.9 Calculating tax, completing and filing returns, paying tax 12.7 10.1 7.2 6.1 Dealing with Inland Revenue 3.1 2.4 2.0 1.3 Tax planning 1.9 1.0 0.9 0.9 Dealing with tax advisors (including providing information) 6.8 5.8 4.4 3.3 Learning about tax laws (new or existing) 4.0 3.8 2.4 2.2 Other 0.2 1.0 0.3 0.3 Total hours (Median) 55 48 36 27 Financial cost of in-house time spent on compliance holds steady The financial value of the median annual internal time spent on tax compliance is calculated by costing the hours of the various people associated with the business, and how much time is spent by each on meeting the business’ tax obligations. The following dollar amounts have been used to convert time spent to compliance costs for 2016: $70.63 – owners/partners/directors/trustees (inflation-adjusted from 2013) (c.f., $61.13 in 2013) $30.46 – paid employees (inflation-adjusted from 2013 value of $28.03) $42.04 – unpaid family members or friends (inflation-adjusted from 2013 value of $38.69). In 2016 SME owners, partners, directors and trustees were most likely to be the personnel undertaking the compliance activities; just over one third (n=1,396) of SMEs had paid employees involved in tax compliance and very few (n=197) had unpaid friends and relatives involved. The involvement of business owners over other personnel is illustrated in the median hourly internal cost of dealing with each tax type is presented in Table 6 (below). The greatest increases in the hourly costs since 2013 are for KiwiSaver and FBT, bringing them closer to the hourly rates of other tax types. Table 6: Median hourly cost of in-house time spent by tax type (2013 and 2016) GST Income tax PAYE KiwiSaver FBT All\* 2013 cost $53.15 $54.72 $49.86 $41.15 $44.58 $52.40 2016 cost $56.61 $58.70 $55.77 $54.94 $50.08 $56.47 \*Note: As these are medians, the total costs are not equal the sums of the components. Table 7 (overleaf) shows the median annual cost of time spent in-house by tax type for 2004, 2009, 2013 and 2016. These costs are based on the values of the time of the different categories of personnel in each year, inflation-adjusted for comparability across the years. In each year, the median in-house costs for each tax type are based on only those respondents who were registered for that particular tax type. 7 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Table 7: Median annual cost of in -house time spent by tax type (2004 – 2016) GST Income Tax PAYE KiwiSaver FBT All\* 2004 $1,542 $757 $699 n/a $51 $1,739 2009 $1,455 $794 $661 $397 $159 $2,579 2013 $1,223 $734 $505 $184 $178 2 $2,076 2016 $848 $318 $706 $426 $69 $1,573 \*Note: As these are medians, the total costs are not equal the sums of the components. The median cost of internal hours spent on all tax types increased from 2004 to 2009. The main reasons for this were an increase in the self-assessed value of business-owners’ time and the introduction of KiwiSaver in 2007, which brought additional tax-related requirements. From 2009, however, the median cost of internal hours spent on all tax types reduced. In 2016 it is less than the 2004 figure and it is anticipated that a raft of improvements afforded by new technology (such as online banking, greater use of accounting software within the business and by their suppliers, and greater use of myIR) and a customer-centric approach to Inland Revenue’s service have also contributed to this effect over time. External tax compliance costs reduce slightly This study considers using tax professionals – a tax agent, accountant, and/or tax lawyer – to help meet tax obligations as a cost external to the respondents’ business. In 2016, most (89%) SMEs used a tax professional to help meet their tax obligations. As Table 8 (below) shows, this external cost contributes significantly to the value of their overall (combined) compliance costs (a median annual value of $3,200 in 2016). The median annual external cost of using a tax professional or professionals was $1,000 in 2016. This is a reduction of 10% since 2013. While the dollar values of SMEs’ in-house and external costs may have reduced since 2013, the proportions of in-house and external costs are similar. Table 8: Median annual compliance costs (2016) 2013 (n=1,148) 2016 (n=4,028) Median annual in-house cost $2,076 $1,573 Median annual external cost $1,117 $1,000 Median annual combined cost\* $3,654 $3,200 \*Note: As these are medians, the combined costs do not equal the sums of the components. It is important to note that other sources of external costs, such as the pricing structure of tax agents and accountants and the cost of software packages and subscriptions were not available to the study or not included in the survey. While both these sources contribute to a business’ overall external compliance costs, they are not exclusively used for tax compliance purposes. 2 Note: Due to inconsistency in the 2013 source data, the figure for FBT in 2013 is an approximation based on the 2013 total median hours of in-house time spent and hourly costs by tax type. 8 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Combined compliance costs are still regressive The total median annual in-house compliance costs and the total external costs 3 were combined and then considered as a proportion of business turnover (see Figure 1, below). This reveals that compliance costs in 2016 are still regressive, consistent with the 2013 survey results. In 2016, businesses with an annual turnover of $40,000 or less spend 4% of this amount on meeting their tax obligations, while those with a turnover of $250,000 or more spend less than 1%. However the compliance cost values for larger businesses are larger than those for smaller businesses. Figure 1: Combined compliance costs as a proportion of turnover (2013 and 2016) For most SMEs, the stress of compliance is low As well as the financial costs of tax compliance, it is important to consider SMEs’ psychological costs. Respondents were asked how stressful they found meeting each tax type (excluding finding the money), and also overall how stressful they found meeting their tax obligations overall (including finding the money). Ratings were on a scale of 1 (not at all stressful) to 7 (extremely stressful). Table 9 (overleaf) shows almost half (49%) of respondents 4 said that, overall, meeting their tax obligations caused little or no stress (a rating of 1 or 2) and just 5% said it caused significant stress (a rating of 6 or 7). The highest degree of stress was associated with Income Tax, followed by GST, with 12% and 8% 5 of respondents indicating they found these tax types to be more than moderately stressful (a rating of 6 or 7). KiwiSaver and FBT attracted the highest proportions of respondents who rated it as resulting in little or no stress (62% each), suggesting that it has become entrenched in SMEs’ business practices. 3 Here ‘external costs’ refers to the costs respondents gave for using their tax agent, accountant and/or tax lawyer in the previous 12 months. It does not include the small number of respondents that reported they sought specialist advice. 4 Not all respondents answered questions about stress, so the n counts for these questions are different to the overall bases. 5 This figure does not equal the figures in Table 9 due to rounding. 9 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Table 9: Reported stress levels – overall and by tax type (2016) Level of reported stress GST (n=3,334) Income Tax (n=2,800) PAYE (n=1,367) KiwiSaver (n=1,289) 6 FBT (n=454) 7 Overall (3,148) 1 (not at all stressful) 23% 16% 22% 37% 33% 22% 2 23% 19% 26% 26% 29% 27% 3 17% 19% 19% 14% 17% 19% 4 (moderately stressful) 17% 20% 17% 12% 13% 18% 5 11% 14% 9% 7% 6% 9% 6 6% 8% 5% 4% 1% 3% 7 (extremely stressful) 3% 4% 1% 1% 1% 2% Note: Figures may not total 100% due to rounding. As shown by Table 10, a business’ staff size is not an important factor in the level of stress reported by respondents, although Small and Medium-sized businesses were more likely to give ratings of 6 or 7. Table 10: Reported overall stress levels by business size (2016) Level of reported stress Nil employees (n=1,787) Micro (1 -5) (n=738) Small (6 -19) (n=405) Medium (20+) (n=218) All types (n=3,148) 1 (not at all stressful) 24% 20% 17% 11% 22% 2 28% 26% 21% 35% 27% 3 18% 21% 22% 25% 19% 4 (moderately stressful) 17% 20% 21% 16% 18% 5 8% 9% 11% 6% 9% 6 3% 2% 5% 5% 3% 7 (extremely stressful) 2% 2% 3% 3% 2% Note: Figures many not total 100% due to rounding Further, respondents were asked about whether meeting their tax obligations is easier or more difficult in comparison to the previous year. The table below shows that most SMEs consider the effort required to be about the same as the year before. 8 Table 11: Change in effort required to meet tax obligations, compared to the previous year (2016) Change in effort required All SMEs (n=3,192) 1 (getting easier) 4% 2 6% 3 10% 4 (about the same) 68% 5 7% 6 3% 7 (getting harder) 2% 6 More respondents answered the KiwiSaver stress question than the KiwiSaver hours spent question. 7 This figure includes those that had nil payments for FBT as well as those that had payments. 8 Not all respondents answered this question, so the n count is different to the overall base. 10 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Tax morale is high Tax morale is the attitudinal precursor to tax compliance behaviour, and therefore customer attitudes towards paying tax is of importance to Inland Revenue. High compliance costs may undermine tax morale. In 2016, for the first time, respondents were asked the four tax morale questions used in Inland Revenue’s Customer Satisfaction & Perceptions Survey (CS&P). Responses to the questions indicate tax morale is high amongst respondents, although not always as high as recent customers’, as the tables below illustrates. While agreement with the first three statements is a little lower than expected, a much larger proportion (73%) of survey respondents disagree with the statement “I resent paying tax” compared with SMEs that have recently contacted the Department (52%). Table 12a: SMEs’ tax morale, SME Compliance Costs Survey (May-July 2016) Rating Strongly disagree – Disagree Agree – Strongly agree 1-2 3 4-5 Paying tax is the right thing to do 2% 13% 85% I am responsible for paying my fair share of tax 2% 9% 89% Paying tax contributes to New Zealand society 3% 13% 84% I resent paying tax 73% 18% 9% Table 12b: Tax morale of SME customers, CS&P Survey 2015-2016 Quarter 4 (April-June 2016) Rating Strongly disagree – Disagree Agree – Strongly agree 1-2 3 4-5 Paying tax is the right thing to do 1% 6% 93% I am responsible for paying my fair share of tax 2% 5% 93% Paying tax contributes to New Zealand society 1% 6% 93% I resent paying tax 52% 25% 23% Mental tax accounting indicators show weaknesses A recent study conducted by Inland Revenue (2015) revealed mental tax accounting is positively associated with tax compliance. Strong mental tax accounting may result in lower compliance costs as a benefit of effective business practices such as record-keeping. For the first time respondents to the SME Compliance Costs Survey were asked questions designed to measure their mental tax accounting, and the results illustrate there are varying practices. Despite 85% agreeing or strongly agreeing that they know which tax information and records they need to keep, the table overleaf shows mental tax accounting wavers amongst respondents. Further, only 22% of respondents said they used a separate bank account for tax, one of the indicators of strong mental tax accounting. Aligned to the stress and effort ratings discussed earlier, just over half (54%) the respondents agreed that the time they spend on tax matters is acceptable and a further 32% responded neutrally to this question. 11 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Table 13: Indicators of mental tax accounting (2016) Rating Strongly disagree Strongly agree 1 2 3 4 5 I know what tax info and records I need to keep <1% 2% 13% 37% 48% I only really know the amount of tax that needs to be paid when my tax return is completed 9% 16% 22% 29% 25% The amount of time I spend on tax matters is acceptable to me 2% 11% 32% 32% 22% I have set long term goals for this business 5% 10% 35% 29% 21% I frequently have unexpected expenses 19% 36% 26% 13% 7% This business has a detailed budget 13% 25% 35% 16% 11% Note: Figures may not total 100% due to rounding. Few SMEs sought specialist tax advice Respondents were asked if they sought specialist tax advice in the preceding year. This was over and above being asked whether their business used a tax agent, accountant and/or a tax lawyer. Few respondents (n=154) reported they paid for specialist tax advice. The majority (64%) of those that did said it was in relation to Income Tax, two-fifths (41%) sought specialist advice for GST, and one-fifth (23%) for PAYE, as shown by Table 14 (below). Table 14: Use of specialist advice (2016) Tax type % SMEs with tax type (n=4,028) % SMEs sought specialist advice for tax type (n=154) GST 97% 41% Income Tax 89% 64% PAYE 38% 23% KiwiSaver (incl. ESCT) 26% 17% FBT 9% 20% The following chapter presents the findings from the focus groups held with SME owners. 12 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Focus group findings The survey was supported by four focus groups with SME owners. The findings below offer insights into the factors affecting the time, money and effort SMEs spend meeting their tax obligations in 2016. Opportunities available to Inland Revenue to further reduce compliance costs for its SME customers are also presented. Perceptions of compliance costs Focus group participants said compliance costs were comprised mainly of their tax agents’ fees and the time spent undertaking compliance activities (such as recording information) and the occasional call to Inland Revenue (e.g., querying an online statement). This confirmed the approach of surveying SMEs about their internal and external tax compliance costs. Income Tax and GST were viewed as requiring the most effort, with PAYE being relatively simple to administer (apart from those with a larger and more casual workforce). “Just time spent completing material and filling out forms online and doing GST, putting my spreadsheet together and sending that off to the tax agent. I did quantify in the surveys how many hours I thought that was going to take 8 – 10 hours or something”. (Self-employed, low cost, male) Most participants were confident they manage their tax obligations effectively, with processes or support services in place, and felt mistakes were likely to be minor. Generally, participants were comfortable with the level of tax compliance costs. Most felt that compliance costs are reasonable in Aotearoa New Zealand. “From my personal point of view I think New Zealand compliance costs are pretty low. I used to file some tax returns in the US and the complexity there of doing taxes is much greater.” (Self-employed, high cost, male) Compliance costs were seen to have reduced since 2013, due to better customer-centred service from IR, less paperwork and a move to digital filing, IR’s improved online services, and also few changes to tax rules and regulations during this time. “I think it is a heck of a lot better now than it has ever been and their systems are pretty good”. (Self- employed, high cost, male) “GST is better online, it is new, in the last year they have made it simpler again”. (Self-employed, low cost, female) SMEs’ suppliers and service providers are increasingly using digital systems and this has also contributed efficiencies within their businesses. “It is the systems of the service providers I think which make things easier in terms of the electronic statements and the direct credits. So if the service providers are with it electronically then that is where the advantage is I would have thought.” (Self-employed, high cost, male) “The bank has a special IRD button now that you can push and the payments to the IRD are on there so it is all getting easier and easier really.” (Employers, low cost, male) Views of tax compliance costs were coloured by: the ability and organisation skills of individuals, sensitivity to stress related factors, tax agent costs, and attitude towards tax generally. “It is a bit stressful sometimes trying to get your head around the figures. I have had to ring them a few times just to get the hang of it.” (Low cost employers, male) 13 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Use of a tax agent/accountant Although all but one focus group participant used a tax agent and/or accountant, the tasks the agents carry out for them varied considerably. The majority undertake GST and PAYE returns themselves, relying on a tax agent for their annual Income Tax return. “But then the accountant does all the FBT and other bits and pieces and it is quite expensive $8 - $10,000. But it’s compulsory, there is not much choice is there?” (Self-employed, high cost, male) “You deal with individuals within those big firms and they are not cheap but the advice you get more than pays for itself.” (Employers, high cost, male) Most employers in the focus groups used some form of accounting software – a mixture of MYOB, Xero, Quickbooks, Sage 50, Banklink, and bespoke programmes. Software use was much lower across the self- employed, with the majority not using any subscription-based software. Tax agents were seen to reduce their costs if information could be pulled directly from these programmes and it is interesting to note that some are encouraging their clients to use this software. “I do use this Xero thing because my accountant said you will be using that. And whilst they are not huge, they are a cost.” (Employers, low cost, male) “It is not my strongest point so I rely on an accountant but I do MYOB and he checks everything. I put aside about $500 a month to keep him happy; rather than pay a lump sum I spread it out.” (Employers, high cost, male) The key reasons participants offered for using a tax agent were to provide ‘peace of mind’; for their expertise (especially important for Income Tax returns where the amount of tax could be minimised); to free them up to focus on their business; and the perception that Inland Revenue is less likely to scrutinise returns submitted via an agent. “But to me $2500 is an investment in knowing there is a high likelihood those accounts are correct. \[So it gives you peace of mind?\] “Yes de-stressing.” (Employers, low cost, male) “I think having an accountant takes away the stress, we pay for peace of mind. You trust they are going to do the right things.” (Self-employed, low cost, female) “They save you money, that is their job and they claim for things you are entitled to which you would be ignorant of. So they are worth paying.” (Employers, low cost, male) Factors that contribute to high compliance costs The factors participants identified that contribute to high compliance costs are largely based in the characteristics of the business: More staff; casual workforce with varying hours; staff with fines, tax arrears, and WINZ interactions The type of business (e.g., exporting and importing adds complexity) A higher number of transactions within the business Business owners/managers with low tax knowledge and low ICT ability (some still struggle with new technology and are reluctant to change) Cost of tax agents (and varying level of use) Find completing and filing returns stressful “I have got a lot of lower socio economic staff so I have also got to collect fines, tax arrears and those things. So number of staff, type of staff, variability and how they work”. (Employers, high cost, male) “If you are employing staff, exports, things that don’t fall in the norm. You have to remember to treat those things.” (Self-employed, high cost, female) “Probably the main thing is the complexity because you have got GST, PAYE, FBT, Income Tax and shortly we will have perhaps short term holding cost taxes for some people who are dealing in properties. So there is \[the\] complexity of the tax system.” (Self-employed, high cost, male) 14 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 “The level of costs really depend on your ability to keep records and if you don’t keep good records your costs are going to go up.” (Self-employed, high cost, male) Factors that contribute to lower compliance costs The factors participants identified which contributed to lower compliance costs were: Using accounting software Introducing good systems and processes within the business Using Inland Revenue’s digital services to calculate tax and file returns Better customer service from Inland Revenue Better accounts interfaces with suppliers and banks Keeping tax rule changes to a minimum “I think two things, a good wages programme and a good accounting programme.” (Employers, low cost, male) “Xero is $260 a year and I don’t go to the accountant at all. My accountant fee was $2500 a year and he said ‘you are going on this’ and it went down to $1600 a year plus Xero. I get up in the morning; it appears, you do a reconciliation – that was petrol, that was this – gone. They have access to it, you don’t do anything.” (Employers, low cost, male) “You can do your whole month in 15 minutes and send your payment away and that sort of thing. GST takes a little bit longer because I do it longhand and use my bank statements. My accountant showed me how to use my bank statements and that takes me a couple of hours.” (Employers, low cost, male) “You can still be manual but going online does cut down the paperwork and also you can get in and see all of the documents, which is really good.” (Employers, high cost, male) How to reduce SMEs’ compliance costs Steps businesses can take to reduce their compliance costs Participants discussed a range of measures that could be taken by businesses to reduce their compliance costs: shop around for a less costly tax agent; meet accountant more regularly so it is less work at year end; install accounting software; keep better records; set regular time aside to keep up to date on paperwork and data entry; set up bank accounts to manage cash flow issues; and undertake an accounting course. “That is the good thing about MYOB you just get the data off your bank statement and enter it in and it says ‘what was this for’ and you say ‘it was an expense for stationery’ and it does it all for you. It won’t let you proceed if it doesn’t balance.” (Self-employed, low cost, male) “I am quite happy doing it the way I do it but if someone could show me how to use one of those software packages I probably would.” (Employers, low cost, male) “Cash flow management is critical. You have to track your cash efficiently and put \[the tax\] to the side. Because technically it is not your money.” (Employers, high cost, male) Steps Inland Revenue can take to further reduce compliance costs While participants felt Inland Revenue’s efforts since 2013 had lessened their compliance costs, they also identified additional steps they believed the Department could take to reduce them further. 15 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Digital services Further development and improvement of Inland Revenue’s digital services would clearly result in greater efficiency and ease of use. Participants’ suggestions included: all business tax returns to be completed and filed in one online platform/account; integrate accounting and banking systems with this platform, so data can be uploaded directly to it; using simple language on ird.govt.nz, and improve the search engine; enhancing Inland Revenue’s notification system to acknowledge all returns and payments received, and sending reminders when the due date has passed if no return has been received 9 ; ‘cheat sheets’ to explain obligations, and visual step-by-step guides and videos explaining processes; offer live chat support, and improved phone response times; and developing a mobile app for payments. “They have got to think about the system from the user point of view. Start from a fresh point of view and sit in the user chair”. (Employers, high cost, male) “I think the IRD upgrade system has got to get everything one log in, simple for all compliance. At the moment you can do some things through it but other things you have to do in a separate way. Same way with your bank, you get your log in and everything is in there and you can talk to them and do it all”. (Employers, high cost, male) “I think better user interfaces, better integration from the common accounting system straight into the revenue so you don’t have to relay it – it is just straight through”. (Employers, high cost, male) “Most of my tax information I got from my recruitment agency because I was a first time contractor and they had a leaflet of what you need to know. I tried going to the IRD website and there is a lot of information but it is very dense. Their website is like the actual law – it is not worded to help you.” (Self-employed, low cost, male) “It needs instructional videos to say how to comply.” (Employers, high cost, male) “Live chat, any time I have used live chat it has been really good.” (Self-employed, low cost, male) “You can file correspondence online too and that is one of the problems: they have got this great online correspondence thing but they don’t look at it very often I don’t think. It is usually quicker to ring them up”. (Self-employed, high cost, male) Other ideas Participants made a range of other suggestions: having interest gathering GST accounts run by Inland Revenue; reducing the types of taxes and rules (especially for smaller businesses); more leniency on late payments, providing a ‘carrot’ for prompt payment; ability to choose the ideal tax cycle for their business; keep change in tax rules to a minimum; and set up an independent disputes resolution service. “If I could put my GST into a GST account and it was the Inland Revenue and you could trust them not to snatch it that is a good idea. The money is to a degree working”. (Employers, high cost, male) “Incentivise us to streamline our system into theirs and give us a carrot for having done that right 12 months in a row, so you can get easier access to something.” (Employers, high cost, male) “Why isn’t there a choice and you pick when your dates are?” (Employers, high cost, male) “...it touches on what \[participant name\] said about \[Inland Revenue being\] difficult to deal with, an independent mediation or compliance type process. So if someone has an issue they should be able to push a button. ACC legislation provides for an independent disputes process funded by ACC if there is an issue so IRD should have the same thing. \[Would you have used that service if it was 9 This is a service Inland Revenue already offers – customers can receive email and SMS reminders leading up to due dates, as well as when they are missed. Customers wishing to receive email or SMS reminders are encouraged to check these contact details are held by the Department. 16 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 available?\] Yes. If for example IRD queries a return or a transaction and you go I don’t think this is fair you can push the button to the independent dispute process or mediation process and get it resolved.” (Employers, high cost, male) Advice to new businesses – getting it right from the start The most commonly cited advice for anyone starting a new business was to: have good systems in place to record and collate information; hire a good tax agent; and invest in accounting software. Other advice participants offered included to: set up system and processes that work for their business – you may need outside help to set this up and should shop around for the best deal and best fit; be methodical and regularly set aside time to keep up to date with paperwork; and look to gain the knowledge and skills required to be confident meeting tax obligations. Opportunities for Inland Revenue The focus groups revealed the opportunities available to Inland Revenue to further reduce the compliance costs of its SME customers; these are outlined below. Raise awareness of the low cost of accounting software There is opportunity to promote the benefits of using accounting software, particularly its relatively low cost, especially to the self-employed (and it is clear that some tax professionals are encouraging their clients to use accounting software; Inland Revenue may wish to consider how to support this). Using accounting software could reduce SMEs’ compliance costs in terms of their time and tax agents’ fees, improve business information, reduce their likelihood to fail, improve the timeliness and accuracy of their tax compliance, and generally contribute to integrity of the tax system. Promote Inland Revenue’s reminder system There is demand for Inland Revenue to provide email and text reminders; and not just before tax is due, but also when the due dates have passed and returns/payments have not been received. This is a service already provided by the Department, and promoting it could improve uptake of online accounts, the timeliness of SMEs’ compliance, and minimise penalties and interest for those who tend to be late or are late from time-to - time. Acknowledging all returns and payments received Participants wanted Inland Revenue to acknowledge receipt of all returns and payments submitted. Providing email acknowledgements would offer SMEs certainty and could prevent further contact through more expensive service channels. Improved content and functionality on ird.govt.nz Participants suggested a range of improvements to Inland Revenue’s website, ird.govt.nz: simplified language; better search function; step-by-step guides and videos explaining processes; live chat support. Improving the website is a perennial goal, to enable compliance and prevent further contact through more expensive service channels. 17 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Conclusion This paper has presented an analysis of the time, money and stress Small-to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) spend on meeting their tax obligations. This chapter forms the conclusion of the analysis. Compliance costs are reducing but still remain a focus of IR’s business transformation Although the hours spent within and external to their business have reduced since 2004, and most latterly since 2013, the cost of compliance to SMEs is still an important consideration for Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. Designing and delivering services and systems that facilitate compliance remains a priority for Inland Revenue. The comments made by survey respondents and focus group participants support the changes Inland Revenue is proposing in policy consultations and preparing to launch. For example, despite the reduction in hours SMEs spend complying with their GST obligations this is still their most time-consuming tax type so the imminent launch of Inland Revenue’s new online GST services is likely to be well-received. Changes such as these facilitate compliance in a customer-centric manner. Opportunities available to Inland Revenue represent meaningful changes for SMEs The focus groups offered a depth of detail to the survey results and illustrated that there are a number of opportunities available to Inland Revenue to further reduce the compliance costs of its SME customers: raise awareness of the low cost of accounting software or partner with the providers to offer a free trial to encourage uptake, particularly amongst self-employed business individuals promoting Inland Revenue’s reminder system as it includes reminders of dates missed for all tax types acknowledging all returns and payments received, preferably by email improved content and functionality on ird.govt.nz, particularly video and other visual step-by-step guides explaining filing and payment processes and better search functionality Opportunities for other government agencies The survey results and focus group findings indicate opportunities for other government agencies operating under the Better Public Services umbrella, who wish to take a similar approach to designing and promoting the services they offer SMEs. The dual outcome is to better serve SMEs whilst facilitating compliance. Future compliance costs measurement Inland Revenue plans to measure SMEs’ compliance costs again in 2018, to provide insights for its Business Transformation Programme. 18 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 Appendix: Methodology This chapter outlines the methodological approach of the study. Survey methodology The 2016 survey of SMEs’ compliance costs continued a time series established in 2004 and carried out in 2009 and 2013. A fresh examination of 2013’s study identified several aspects of the methodology, including the questionnaire, which could be improved upon; these changes are incorporated into the 2016 study. SME survey population Definition of the 2016 population of SMEs: All enterprises in Aotearoa New Zealand which meet all of following criteria: Population 1. Registered with Inland Revenue 2. Have an annual turnover more than $30,000 or PAYE deductions more than $4,000 and an annual turnover less than $80 million and employ less than 50 employees\* 3. Have filed an income tax, GST, or PAYE form with Inland Revenue in the 2015 tax year (1 April 2014 – 31 March 2015) 4. Are not not-for-profit businesses Exclusions 5. Must be currently active, that means they are not ceased or bankrupted or liquidated entities 6. Have either a physical address or an email address available to IRD 7. Were not selected for IR-sponsored surveys six months prior the 2016 SME compliance costs survey sample were drawn or businesses that are included in the non-contact list Entities include registered businesses and self-employed persons. \* Number of employees refers to the highest monthly employment between 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015. The eligible survey population was 372,296. SME sample design The sample design was a stratified random sample of SMEs. The sample strata (n = 25) were defined by customer group, turnover and employment size. The total sample size of n = 28,746 was calculated on the basis of 5% margin of error at the 95% level with an estimated response rate of 25%. The sampling rates for each stratum are determined through Kish allocation, as endorsed by Statistics New Zealand, which allocates the total sample size among the strata in proportion to stratum sizes to minimise the overall sampling error on the primary estimate of interest. The total internal hours spent in tax compliance is the primary estimate of interest. The sample design was peer reviewed by Professor Binh Tran-Nam, a leading tax researcher and academic. SME survey questionnaire and its deployment The questionnaire was based on the 2013 instrument (which itself was based on the original 2004 instrument), with the aim of preserving continuity in key metrics across the points of measurement: the number of hours respondents spent meeting their tax obligations within their business, by tax type; the value of that time; and the level of stress they experienced as a compliance cost. 19 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 The survey was deployed via Inland Revenue’s online surveying tool, Insight Explorer. Invitations to take the survey were emailed to survey candidates where email addresses were available (n=20,846), or posted where they were not (n=7,900). Survey candidates in the letter group could request a paper copy of the questionnaire be posted to them, or to take the survey by phone. Candidates in both the email and letter groups could opt out of the survey. Reminders were emailed at weekly intervals, and a second invitation to take the survey was posted to those that had not completed the survey after a fortnight. The fieldwork spanned almost six weeks. Achieved SME sample After cleansing, the achieved sample was n=4,028. This represents a response rate of 14%. Weighting the survey data All data were weighted so the survey results could be used to make generalisations to the entire survey population. Weighted values have been used in all analysis for this report. A weight for each responding SME was calculated as (N(i)/n(i)), where: N(i) is the population count of each stratum, and n(i) is the achieved sample in each stratum. Focus groups Four focus groups supported the 2016 survey of SMEs’ compliance costs. The research was conducted on 28 and 29 June 2016 in Auckland at UMR’s purpose built focus group facility. The duration of each group was around two hours. Participants were recruited from the first few hundred respondents to the survey. Based on their survey responses, the participants were a mix of high, medium and low compliance cost customers; half were employers, and half worked by themselves: 1x focus group – SME employers, high time spent meeting obligations. 1x focus group – SME employers, low-medium time spent meeting obligations. 1x focus group – self employed, high time spent meeting obligations. 1x focus group – self employed, low-medium time spent meeting obligations. Care must be taken interpreting results from focus groups as these are based on a qualitative methodology and validation by a quantitative methodology is required to measure how strongly views are held across the wider population. 20 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake

Media statement

### Three BEPS consultation documents released

Finance Minister Steven Joyce and Revenue Minister Judith Collins have released three consultation papers proposing new measures to strengthen New Zealand’s rules for taxing large multinationals.

“Our broad-based low rate tax system continues to perform very well for New Zealand overall,” Mr Joyce says. “However it’s important that it keeps evolving to ensure that all companies operating in New Zealand pay their fair share of tax.”

“The proposals in these documents are in line with the recommendations from the OECD’s base erosion and profit-shifting (BEPS) project which has developed best practice measures for the global response to BEPS.”

The consultation documents contain proposals for:

*   Tackling concerns about multinationals booking profits from their New Zealand sales offshore, even though these sales are driven by New Zealand- based staff
*   Preventing multinationals using interest payments to shift profits offshore, and
*   Implementing New Zealand’s entrance into an international convention for aligning our double tax agreements with OECD recommendations.

“We also need to be mindful of the New Zealand context so the proposals address some specific BEPS arrangements that Inland Revenue has observed,” Ms Collins says.

“We welcome multinationals’ participation in our economy, but we also expect them to pay tax based on their actual levels of economic activity in New Zealand.”

Submissions on the consultation document on implementing the international convention are open until 7 April. Submissions on the other two are open until 18 April. Ministers will consider final proposals arising from the documents later in the year.

The consultation documents are available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.

Speech

### Address to International Fiscal Association Conference

Thank you for inviting me to open your conference.

It is a pleasure to be here.

I haven’t been in the Revenue portfolio very long but I have learned very quickly how important this grouping of professionals is to the success of our tax system.

Your professional advice provided in analysing policy proposals and suggesting improvements makes your contribution invaluable.

I take over the Revenue portfolio at a significant point for our economy and for the tax system.

Today I want to focus on one of the most significant items on the tax policy work programme – New Zealand’s response to base erosion and profit shifting or BEPS.

The Government is releasing three BEPS consultation papers today:

1.  [BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance](/publications/2017/2017-dd-transfer-pricing-pe)
    
2.  [BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules](/publications/2017/2017-dd-beps-interest-limitation)
    
3.  [New Zealand’s implementation of the _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS_](/publications/2017/2017-ip-beps-mli-nz)
    

#### BEPS

Base erosion and profit shifting, or BEPS, the tactics used by some large multinationals to minimise their exposure to tax and spirit profits out of a country is not new.

As a small, open economy we’ve been aware of our potential vulnerabilities to this issue for several years and have been progressively strengthening our rules.

Therefore, we are well placed when we assess our tax system against the OECD’s 15 point Action Plan.

But we know there are areas where we could do better and we are progressing reforms in those areas.

Our strong starting point gives us the luxury of being able to take a considered, balanced approach.

The Government has therefore taken a measured approach to addressing base erosion and profit shifting, by prioritising the specific problems that Inland Revenue has actually observed in its investigations of multinationals.

We have also taken care to create a coherent package of measures. Stripping the tax benefits from one type of arrangement is ineffective if multinationals can get the same benefit from switching to a different arrangement.

We also need to ensure the BEPS reforms fit within New Zealand’s overall tax framework and do not unduly discourage foreign investment.

With these principles in mind, in the last year, the Government has implemented a number of measures to address BEPS.

These include applying GST to offshore service providers, introducing legislation to strengthen non-resident withholding tax rules, limit the use of look-through companies as conduit vehicles, and clarify that New Zealand’s general anti-avoidance rule overrides tax treaties.

#### Hybrids

The Government is committed to the implementation of the OECD’s suggested rules for dealing with hybrid mismatches.

We are encouraged by the evident determination to implement the rules which is also being shown in the UK, the EU and Australia.

But we recognise that the rules need to be implemented in a way that takes account of New Zealand’s existing tax framework.

To make sure this happens, officials are continuing to consult on the design of measures to address BEPS caused by hybrid mismatches.

The hybrids consultation process is a good example of the private sector and officials working together to address unintended consequences while ensuring the rules remain robust and effective.

As part of that, and in line with our generic tax policy process, I understand that my officials are keen to explore options for further consultation on this matter with you on technical aspects that may arise relating to legislative drafting.

But hybrids are only one of the BEPS issues. This is why we are releasing three BEPS consultation papers today that propose new measures to strengthen our rules for taxing multinationals.

#### Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance

The first discussion document consults on proposals to counter permanent establishment avoidance, strengthen our transfer pricing rules, and help Inland Revenue deal with uncooperative multinationals.

These proposals are aimed at large multinationals that are able to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite significant economic activity here.

#### Permanent establishment avoidance

The first proposal targets permanent establishment avoidance. As you know, in order for New Zealand to tax a non-resident on its sales here, the non-resident must have a PE in New Zealand. Our concern is that some non-residents have structured their affairs to avoid a PE at law, even when one exists in substance. This typically involves the non-resident engaging a related party to undertake sales activities instead of carrying them out itself. The fact that the non-resident and the related entity are legally separate means the related party’s sales activities do not give rise to a PE for the non-resident.

This kind of structure can allow multinationals to book the profit from their New Zealand sales offshore for tax purposes, even though these sales are driven by New Zealand-based staff.

To prevent this, the discussion document proposes a PE anti-avoidance rule that applies to large multinationals – that is multinationals with a global turnover of more than 750 million euros.

Under the proposal, a non-resident will be deemed to have a New Zealand PE if they sell goods or services to a person in New Zealand and have a related entity carrying out activities in New Zealand to bring the sale about. This deemed PE will only arise if the arrangement defeats the purpose of PE provisions in a tax treaty.

It will stop non-residents from using tax treaties to avoid New Zealand tax. The OECD has confirmed that tax treaties are not intended to be used in this way.

The new anti-avoidance rule will allow Inland Revenue to tax non-residents when their sales are actually generated through the work of New Zealand staff in related entities, such as subsidiaries or commercially dependent agents. The rules generally will not apply in respect of auxiliary or preparatory activities (such as advertising and marketing), or the activities of independent agents. This reflects the definition of a PE in most of New Zealand’s double tax agreements.

The rule will also apply to many third party channel provider arrangements, where a non-resident supplies its goods or services to New Zealand customers in effective partnership with an independent New Zealand distributor.

I want to be clear that if the multinational is simply shipping goods or supplying services over the internet - and has no-one working for it in New Zealand - they are not the intended target of the proposed rule.

This is consistent with the established international distinction between “trading with a country” and “trading in a country”.

This distinction benefits New Zealand by ensuring New Zealand exporters do not pay foreign income taxes simply because they export their products overseas.

New Zealand is not going out on an international limb with this rule. Our proposed rule is similar to aspects of rules recently adopted by Australia and the United Kingdom.  It is also broadly consistent with the OECD’s new measures to prevent PE avoidance. However the OECD’s measures will only apply if both parties to a tax treaty agree to include them. This means we need our own PE avoidance measure to supplement the OECD’s measures.

#### Transfer pricing avoidance

Another common way that multinationals shift profits offshore is through transfer pricing.

As I’m sure you know, this is where a related company charges a New Zealand subsidiary an artificially high price for inputs such as raw materials, head-office services, or the rights to use intellectual property. This shifts the multinationals profits from New Zealand, where we can tax it, into another jurisdiction, where we cannot.

To counter such arrangements, New Zealand has transfer pricing rules which require payments between related parties to be set at an arms-length rate.

However, our existing transfer pricing legislation is over 20 years old. Since that time multinational transactions have become vastly more complex and less aligned with market behaviours.

In particular, our current legislation focuses more on the legal form of the related party transaction. Some multinationals have tried to take advantage of this by legally structuring their transactions in a way that does not reflect their economic substance. They then use the legal structure to try and justify an artificial price.

The current legal focus has also allowed some multinationals to try and price transactions using contracts to shift the legal liability, ownership of IP or responsibility for funding arrangements into an offshore entity. These contracts can allow a greater share of the profits to be booked offshore, despite the fact that the offshore entity may carry out very little economic activity in relation to their new responsibilities.

While our existing rules offer some protection against these practices, they are not wholly effective.

The OECD has recently developed new transfer pricing guidelines specifically designed to address these issues as part of its BEPS project.

Australia has also recently introduced similar changes to its transfer pricing legislation.

The discussion document proposes strengthening New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation so it aligns with the OECD's new guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules.

It proposes introducing rules requiring transfer pricing to align with the economic substance of a transaction. It also proposes rules allowing a transaction to be disregarded or reconstructed if it would not have been entered into between independent parties.

Finally the discussion document proposes some rules to make it easier for Inland Revenue to investigate a multinational’s transfer pricing practices. These include shifting the burden of proof for transfer pricing matters on to the multinational and extending the time bar for transfer pricing from four years to seven years.

#### Enforcement barriers

It can be difficult for Inland Revenue to investigate large uncooperative multinationals.

Inland Revenue must currently prove that the multinational’s tax position is incorrect in relation to transfer pricing.

However, the multinational holds most of the information relevant to determining its own tax position.

This information is often held offshore, which requires the multinational’s co-operation to access.

To address these issues we are proposing a series of administrative measures to help Inland Revenue assess and collect the right amount of tax.

The measures generally only apply to large multinationals that refuse to cooperate with Inland Revenue.

The proposed measures will make it easier for Inland Revenue to assess uncooperative multinationals, by allowing them to be based on the information Inland Revenue has at the time.

The measures will also require tax to be paid earlier in the disputes process, and allow Inland Revenue to collect relevant information that is held offshore.

The proposed measures will also contain remedies for Inland Revenue where the non-resident does not cooperate, such as increased penalties and a power to allocate income to New Zealand in the absence of information to the contrary.

The measures are intended to incentivise cooperation and we so expect them only to be used if the multinational has been given fair notice and an opportunity to comply.

Overall the aim of our proposed administrative measures is to prevent the avoidance of our existing rules without substantially widening their scope or discouraging multinationals from doing business here.

Even where the new measures apply, Inland Revenue will still have to follow its standard disputes resolution process before it can issue an assessment.

We have designed the measures so that cooperative multinationals should not be affected by them provided they do not use artificial arrangements to avoid paying New Zealand tax.

#### Interest limitation

It is standard business practice to borrow in order to help finance investments. However, since interest payments are deductible, the use of debt is also a simple mechanism for shifting profits offshore.

For this reason, the design of best-practice interest limitation rules was a focus of the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan.

The OECD ultimately recommended a rule that limits a multinational’s interest deductions based on its earnings – more specifically, its EBITDA.

New Zealand’s current interest limitation rules – the thin capitalisation rules – take a different approach. Those rules limit a multinational’s interest deductions here in an indirect manner, by placing a limit on the amount of interest-bearing debt.

The discussion document I am releasing today on interest limitation does not propose the adoption of an EBITDA-based rule. Generally, the Government considers that the thin capitalisation rules are serving New Zealand well.

Most foreign-owned firms operating here have relatively conservative debt positions and pay significant amounts of tax. Moreover, in recent years the Government has strengthened our thin capitalisation rules by reducing the safe harbour debt to asset ratio from 75 per cent to 60 per cent, and expanded the scope of the rules so they apply to companies that are controlled by groups of investors.

Moreover, an EBITDA-based rule has some significant drawbacks. For example, EBITDA often declines in economic downturns, meaning that firms could face denial of interest deductions when they are also suffering from reduced sales.

A weakness of our current thin capitalisation rule, as compared to an EBITDA-based rule, is it is vulnerable to highly priced related-party debt. Accordingly, the Government is proposing to buttress the existing thin-cap rules with a new mechanism that will cap interest rates on cross-border related-party debt.

Exactly the same incentives that can push firms to thinly capitalise may encourage foreign parents to finance their New Zealand subsidiaries in ways which appear risky in order to justify higher interest rates. This can allow firms to lower their New Zealand tax liabilities and not pay their fair share of New Zealand tax.

While we do not think that most firms are gaming the system, there are some who appear to be doing so. We have firms, for example, with both third party and related party debt, where the interest rates on related party debt are much higher than on third party debt.

Small numbers of firms are charging very high interest rates, but this can represent a substantial fraction of related party interest payments.

Under the proposal, the deductible interest rate on a related-party cross-border loan will generally be set with reference to the parent company’s own interest costs.

This proposal is both hard to manipulate and objective. It should ensure that multinationals operating here can only deduct a reasonable amount of interest here in New Zealand, and avoid costly and lengthy disputes over the appropriate interest rate on a loan.

The discussion document also considers other proposals that address specific weaknesses of our existing thin-cap rules without abandoning the general framework.

The most significant of these is a proposal to require firms to value their assets net of their “non-debt liabilities”.

As I have mentioned, the thin capitalisation rules are based on a firm’s debt relative to its assets. However, what constitutes debt under the rules is much narrower than a firm’s total liabilities. A firm’s other liabilities – its non-debt liabilities – are currently ignored under the rules.

The Government is concerned that ignoring these non-debt liabilities means that some firms are able to be very highly geared without invoking the thin capitalisation rules – in fact some have negative equity. The existing rules are failing to treat them as having excessive debt.

This proposed adjustment for non-debt liabilities would bring New Zealand’s rules into line with the rules in other countries, including Australia which otherwise has rules similar to ours.

#### Multilateral Instrument

Finally, because many BEPS techniques rely on abuse of tax treaties, the BEPS Action Plan recommended a number of changes to strengthen them.

It would be very time consuming for individual countries to implement the recommended amendments on a treaty-by-treaty basis, so the OECD has developed a multilateral tax treaty that will modify a worldwide network of several thousand bilateral tax treaties in one fell swoop.

The Multilateral Instrument will insert a principal purpose test – similar to our general anti-avoidance rule – into treaties to deny treaty benefits to abusive arrangements.

It will also strengthen the treaty permanent establishment definition to prevent multinationals avoiding having a taxable presence in a country and introduce rules to prevent hybrid entities being used to obtain inappropriate treaty benefits.

It is important that these BEPS measures do not lead to unnecessary uncertainty for compliant taxpayers and to unintended double taxation. To address this risk, the Multilateral Instrument also contains an important measure to help business – the ability to submit disputes between competent authorities as to how a treaty applies to independent binding arbitration.

New Zealand expects to sign the Multilateral Instrument, along with many other countries, in June this year.

Because this is an unprecedented approach to modifying tax treaties, there will be some novel implementation issues.

To make sure the implementation goes smoothly, my officials are also today releasing an issues paper asking for your views on this.

In keeping with our generic tax policy process, we look forward to your feedback. We pay attention to what the private sector says and proposals are always improved by feedback.

While I recognise there is a lot of new material to digest, I encourage you to submit on all three BEPS consultation papers, as your views provide important insights into how the proposals could affect business.

Feedback from submitters will be critical to achieving the intended outcomes of preventing tax benefits from aggressive BEPS arrangements, whilst ensuring New Zealand remains a stable and attractive location for investment.

#### Conclusion

By closing loopholes and reducing opportunities for gaming the system, we not only ensure that multinationals and others pay their fair share of tax, but we also help maintain confidence in the fairness of the tax system.

I’m grateful to you for the time and effort you put in to review proposals.

I look forward to your continued interest in tax policy.

Thank you

Speech

### Address to the Employers and Manufacturers Association annual payroll conference

Good morning and thank you for inviting me to your 20th Annual Payroll Conference. It is a pleasure to be here.

You’ve asked me to talk about how Inland Revenue’s ‘Making Tax Simpler’ is progressing and how advice and feedback from payroll professionals like yourselves shaped the proposals in the forthcoming Bill.

I’ll talk to you about the current PAYE proposals- what they cover, how they’ll be implemented and how we used your feedback in their development.

But first, I think it’s useful to look at the background and provide some context for the development of these proposals.

As you’re aware, through the Business Transformation programme, Inland Revenue is investing in a complete overhaul of the tax system: involving customers, staff, policy, processes and replacing aging technology.

The objective is to take advantage of modern digital systems to make tax less onerous and to integrate tax requirements into normal business processes.

In doing so, we want to enable businesses to spend more time focusing on growth and innovation – developing productive opportunities and not be tied down with compliance requirements.

Put simply, it’s about Making Tax Simpler. Making it easier for people to deal with Inland Revenue and get it right from the start.

This transformation is a multi-staged process, taking place over several years. While we’re working at pace, we need to ensure it’s meeting the needs of New Zealanders, so we’re being very deliberate in our approach.

We want to ensure it is manageable and successful for all parties while minimising risk to this critical part of our economy. And it’s already delivering solid gains.

The first stage has gone live with a number of core processes and filing GST direct from accounting software has been possible since early 2016.

Of course GST isn’t a payroll issue, but the success and positive feedback these significant changes have received shows that the changes are working and delivering benefits. While there have been a few technical issues to work through (as was expected with such a large change) we can have real confidence as we move forward with PAYE and other future initiatives.

For example, last year, following the introduction of direct GST filing from software, Inland Revenue asked more than 4000 SMEs what had changed for them since 2013 and found that on average:

*   they’re spending 25% less time on tax,
*   their in-house costs have reduced 24% and
*   around half say tax isn’t stressful!

Along with the key Transformation goals of time saving and reducing tax costs, we are also endeavouring to reduce ‘tax stresses for SMEs, so that’s a great start.

Further to that, the recent, February 7 “Stage 1 cut-over” included additional GST improvements which will take full advantage of the efficiencies technology can provide. Amongst other things the new capabilities enable customers to more easily amend returns and track payments and refunds on line.

So the key Government objective, taking advantage of modern digital systems, making tax a less onerous part of taxpayers’ lives and integrating tax requirements into normal business processes, is being achieved with GST.

We recognise that issues and opportunities around PAYE are very different to GST but I’m confident we can achieve similarly positive results.

#### PAYE Proposals

Last November, my predecessor, Michael Woodhouse, outlined a number of proposals aimed at making tax a less onerous part of the payroll process. The PAYE proposals focussed primarily on how you do it – process improvements.

The proposals are designed to provide significant efficiencies and better integrate tax into your core business processes. Our objectives are:

*   to update PAYE processes so that employers using software can get more value out of it.
*   to make providing PAYE information part of the payday process rather than on a separate timetable to suit Inland Revenue

Rather than reiterate the detail of these, of which you will largely be aware (and which you can discuss in IRD’s presentation later today), I thought you may be interested in how your submissions informed the proposals.

Firstly, can I thank you for the nearly 90 written submissions and 1,000 comments we received on the original proposals through the [Making Tax Simpler](https://www.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz)
 consultation.

The advice and feedback from you, the payroll professionals, and other experts has been carefully considered.

This feedback has helped shaped the Government’s decisions which are reflected in the Taxation bill which I am proposing to introduce very shortly.

#### Payday Reporting

Effective from 1 April 2019, we are proposing to replace the requirement for an employer monthly schedule with ‘payday’ reporting of employee information. So as part of the payroll process, you can integrate the next step, the provision of PAYE information to Inland Revenue. Do it all at once, direct from the payroll software, on the payday timetable your business has established, not a date set by Inland Revenue. Specifically:

*   employers using payroll software, payroll intermediaries and those above the electronic filing threshold will report their PAYE information within 2 days of payday
*   those below the electronic filing threshold and not using software will have 7 days after payday to report.

This proposal also has benefits for the wider community. Providing this information on a payday basis will help IRD improve how they administer such things as Working for Families, Child Support and Student Loans. Payday reporting and faster processing will reduce the likelihood that employees will miss out on entitlements or incur debt.

The current delays in receiving and processing the information in the current system mean it can be months before issues get picked up and corrected. Correcting employee information more quickly will be a significant win and importantly, should reduce the queries you have from employees about issues with their tax or other deductions.

Although the proposal is that payday reporting of PAYE information will be required from 1 April 2019, Inland Revenue is working on providing payday reporting for early adopters who are keen to use the system sooner.

So how did your feedback help shape this Payday Reporting?

Submissions were generally positive from employers with large payrolls, their representatives such as Business New Zealand and from the payroll software industry.

A common area of comment raised was around the processes for error correction and adjustment and access to already filed information.

I am told that you will have better access to already filed information and further consultation is proposed on processes for error correction and adjustment - these are aimed at largely automating the process. The objective is that when you correct information in your payroll system, it should generate the information Inland Revenue requires - making these requirements a natural by-product of your own process.

Submissions from employers with small payrolls were mixed. Some who were using payroll software thought that everybody should and supported the proposal to be able to file PAYE information directly from software.

However, a number voiced their concern about all employers being required to use payroll software – 45,000 New Zealand employers have only one staff member and some employers felt that they were just too small to justify payroll software.

The proposals in the bill that I am introducing to Parliament will not require employers to use payroll software. But it will require all employers to file information relating to each payday. Employers not using software will be able to file their PAYE information through Inland Revenue’s website and an updated version of myIR.

The smallest organisations will be able to file on paper if they prefer although we are hoping that the new digital services will convince many to go online.

#### Reduced threshold for electronic filing PAYE information

A reduced threshold for electronic filing of PAYE information was proposed. In 1999, a threshold of $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT was set for electronic filing. Employers above this threshold need to send their PAYE information to Inland Revenue electronically, organisations below the threshold can file on paper. This hasn’t changed since 1999, but business practices certainly have.

Today, most organisations are connected to the internet. They do their banking, and a multitude of other normal business activities, online. Just over 91% of payments made to Inland Revenue are made electronically.

Feedback on the reduced threshold was mixed. Over 63% of those below the current electronic filing threshold already file electronically and the number filing electronically is increasing each year. Despite the mixed feedback, because electronic filing is less costly to administer and administration costs fall on taxpayers, the Government is proposing to reduce the electronic filing threshold.

The proposed new threshold of $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT will still exempt the smallest organisations. As an indication, it would require an employer with four full time employees at the average wage (or ten full timers at the minimum wage) to file through Inland Revenue’s website or through payroll software. And there will be an exemption from electronic filing for any employers who cannot access digital services.

#### Paying PAYE at the same time you pay your staff

We also listened to your feedback on the proposal that employers pay PAYE to Inland Revenue at the same time you pay your staff. While some commented that this would reduce compliance costs, a number of businesses were concerned about cash flow. It’s worth noting that this money doesn’t belong to the employer and is effectively held in trust until it is time to pay it to Inland Revenue. Paying it to Inland Revenue on payday could:

*   further reduce compliance costs,
*   potentially reduce the likelihood that the money is used for other purposes and
*   enable PAYE and deductions of KiwiSaver contributions, student loan repayments and child support payments to be passed on more quickly.

In light of the submissions, the Government decided not to require employers to pay their PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue on payday. The current payment obligations, either twice monthly for the largest employers and payroll intermediaries or monthly for the rest, will remain the same. (However, if employers want to take advantage of doing everything at the same time including paying Inland Revenue on payday they will be able to do so.)

#### Ending Current Payroll Subsidy

In line with the more widespread use of electronic services, the Government has also decided to end the current payroll subsidy from 1 April 2018.

In the early days of electronic filing, the subsidy helped improve the quality of PAYE information transmitted to the IRD, by encouraging employers to use listed payroll intermediaries. But time and technological advances have overtaken the subsidy and we believe there is no longer a case to subsidise (a maximum of $10 a pay run) one type of payroll service over others.

Not surprisingly, many submissions suggest the subsidy should be extended or that Inland Revenue should make payroll software available for free. The Government has not accepted those suggestions. Through the changes I have outlined this morning it is instead proposing to invest in making the system better for all employers.

#### Some final thoughts

Earlier I mentioned that Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation is being managed in stages. While this means that risk is being managed prudently, it also means that some of the benefits might be staggered. For example, the benefits from increased processing speed won’t be completely realised until all PAYE information is fully processed in the new computer system - that is not expected to be until late 2019.

The changes from Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation will open up a fully digital system for those who want to eliminate paper interactions with Inland Revenue.

Our new software will make changes more quickly but, as mentioned, technology is only part of the solution, both business and Inland Revenue will need to change processes and continue to look for and share improvement opportunities.

Government recognises that the requirement to change processes will involve some costs in the short term but as evidenced by the GST example, real compliance cost reductions are achievable by updating our tax systems.

So, those are the main PAYE proposals arising from last year’s public consultation. Feedback in the consultation phase was hugely valuable and was critical in their development – again, my sincere thanks for your contributions.

Please also be assured that you are welcome to comment during the select committee stage. If you don’t know how to do that I suggest you Google “How to make submissions to a select committee” there is a handy guide available and submissions can be made electronically.

I know these proposals involve changes and change can always be a bit daunting… but what I’ve outlined today is intended to help make the PAYE component of your jobs a little easier and a little smoother. They should also help businesses by making their processes a little less costly and assist individuals by helping to make their tax affairs more accurate.

Thank you again for inviting me to speak to you today. I very much look forward to continuing to work together and looking for improvements.

### Tax bill increases fairness, modernises tax system

A new tax bill introduced into Parliament today will help modernise our tax administration while ensuring that the current system works as it should, says Revenue Minister Judith Collins.

“The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill contains proposals relating to collecting employment and investment income information. The proposals will help Inland Revenue to ensure that people are on the right tax code and receiving any entitlements correctly.”

The Bill also contains proposals to modernise the taxation of employee share schemes.

Employee share schemes are arrangements where companies provide shares or share options to their employees as part of an employee’s remuneration.

Changes proposed in the Bill include new rules to ensure the tax treatment of employee share schemes is consistent with other forms of employment income. This includes providing a deduction for the employer for the cost of shares in line with other forms of remuneration.

“The employee share scheme measures proposed in the Bill are based on feedback from two rounds of public consultation in May and September 2016. The consultation process has been valuable in shaping the reforms contained in this Bill.

“For example, the original proposals raised the possibility of abolishing the tax regime for widely offered schemes, but in response to feedback the rules are being retained, but simplified and improved.

“There will also be another opportunity to provide feedback on the Bill during the Select Committee process.

“Through the consultation process, the Government also became aware of practical issues facing start-up companies offering employee share schemes.

“To address these issues, my officials are currently developing a public consultation document that refines the start-up proposal that was contained in the 2016 issues paper. I hope interested parties will provide feedback on these proposals too,” Ms Collins says.

Ms Collins says a range of measures addressing taxpayers’ concerns such as issues with demergers and decommissioning costs for petroleum miners are addressed by the Bill. There are also a number of GST-related matters included.

“And there is a proposal to add five new charities to the list of donee organisations eligible for tax benefits. These are, Byond Disaster Relief New Zealand, Flying for Life Charitable Trust, Médecins Sans Frontières New Zealand Charitable Trust, Tony McClean Nepal Trust, and Zimbabwe Rural Schools Library Trust,” Ms Collins says.

$2b Family Incomes Package to lift after-tax incomes
====================================================

The Government’s $2 billion per year Family Incomes Package will make changes to tax thresholds, Working for Families and the Accommodation Supplement to help Kiwi families get ahead, Finance Minister Steven Joyce says.

“It is important that Kiwi families directly share in the benefits of New Zealand’s economic growth,” Mr Joyce says. “The Family Incomes Package is carefully designed to especially assist low and middle income earners with young families and higher housing costs.”

The Budget 2017 Family Incomes Package benefits around 1.3 million families in New Zealand by, on average, $26 per week.

“The measures in this budget are expected to lift 20,000 households above the threshold for severe housing stress, and reduce the number of children living in families receiving less than half of the median income by around 50,000,” Mr Joyce says.

From 1 April 2018, the Package:

*   Increases the $14,000 income tax threshold to $22,000, and the $48,000 tax threshold to $52,000.
*   Discontinues the Independent Earner Tax Credit.
*   Increases the Family Tax Credit rates for young children to the level of those for children aged 16 to 18, while increasing the abatement rate and decreasing the abatement threshold.
*   Increases the Accommodation Supplement maximum amounts, and updates the Accommodation Supplement areas to reflect 2016 rents.
*   Increases the weekly payments of the Accommodation Benefit for eligible Student Allowance recipients by up to $20.

These changes mean, for example, a couple with two children under 13 and one partner working earning $55,000 will gain $41 per week plus any increase to their Accommodation Supplement.

Mr Joyce says that as wages have risen over the last seven years, people on lower and middle incomes have been faced with higher marginal tax rates.

“The Budget 2017 Family Incomes Package will provide better rewards for hard work by adjusting the bottom two tax thresholds and lowering the marginal tax rates for low and middle income earners,” Mr Joyce says. “At the same time it will start simplifying the tax and transfer system by removing the separate Independent Earner Tax Credit which is claimed during the year by less than one third of those eligible.”

The tax threshold change provides a tax reduction of $10.77 a week to anyone earning more than $22,000 per annum, increasing to $20.38 a week for anyone earning more than $52,000 per annum.

People who lose the Independent Earner Tax Credit will be compensated in full by the lifting of the lowest income tax threshold from $14,000 to $22,000.

“The Family Incomes Package will also help lower income families with young children meet their living costs through changes to the Family Tax Credit, and it will improve the incomes for those with higher housing costs,” Mr Joyce says.

Some of the biggest gains in the Package are for people on lower incomes with young children.

“Family Tax Credit rates increase by $9.25 a week for the first child under 16, while credits for subsequent children increase by either $17.75 or $26.81 per week depending on the age of the child,” Mr Joyce says.

Similarly there are significant increases for people on low incomes with high accommodation costs.

The maximum Accommodation Supplement rate for a two person household increases by between $25 and $75 a week, while the maximum for larger households increases by between $40 and $80 a week. In addition, changes to the Accommodation Supplement areas will provide further gains for some families.

The Accommodation Benefit, which is paid to Student Allowance recipients who experience housing stress, will also increase by up to $20 per week.

The Package will have flow-on effects, with around three quarters of a million superannuitants benefiting because of the link between New Zealand Superannuation and after tax wages. The couple rate for superannuitants will increase by $13.12 per week on 1 April next year in addition to the normal adjustments.

“Budget 2017 is about delivering for New Zealanders. This Family Incomes Package is the first step in allowing Kiwi families to spend more of their own money, so they can make the decisions that are best for them,” Mr Joyce says.

Fact Sheet 1 – Family Incomes Package
=====================================

Summary
-------

### From 1 April 2018:

The $2 billion per year Family Incomes Package will provide better rewards for hard work, help lower-income families with young children meet their living costs, and improve incomes for people with high housing costs.

The Family Incomes Package will benefit 1,340,000 families by an average of $26 per week. Around 750,000 superannuitants and 41,000 students will also benefit from the Family Incomes Package.

The measures in this Package are expected to lift 20,000 households above the threshold for severe housing stress, and reduce the number of children living in families receiving less than half of the median income by around 50,000.

The following elements make up the Package:

*   Increasing the bottom two income tax thresholds:
    *   From $14,000 to $22,000; and
    *   From $48,000 to $52,000.
*   Discontinuing the Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC).
*   Family Tax Credit (FTC):
    *   Increasing payment rates for children aged under 16, so that they align with the rates for children aged 16 to 18 years; and
    *   Increasing the abatement rate from 22.5 cents to 25 cents in the dollar and decreasing the abatement threshold from $36,350 a year to $35,000 a year.
*   Housing costs:
    *   Increasing the maximum Accommodation Supplement (AS) payments and updating locations of Accommodation Supplement areas to reflect increases in housing costs; and
    *   Increasing the weekly payments of Accommodation Benefit for eligible Student Allowance recipients by up to $20.

Superannuitants will gain from the tax threshold increases and some will also gain from the Accommodation Supplement increases.

The impact of the Family Incomes Package on any given family or individual will depend on their particular circumstances, including the types of supplementary assistance they may receive.

Impact on family incomes
------------------------

### Tax threshold changes and discontinuing IETC

The tax threshold changes provide a tax reduction of $10.77 a week to anyone earning more than $22,000 per annum, increasing to $20.38 a week for anyone earning more than $52,000 per annum.

These changes are likely to increase work incentives. Working families and individuals not receiving a benefit will gain from the tax threshold changes if their individual incomes are above $14,000.

Individuals who receive the Independent Earner Tax Credit of up to $10 per week will be fully compensated by the increase in the $14,000 tax threshold. Only 32 per cent of those eligible claim this credit during the tax year.

New Zealand Superannuation recipients will gain from the tax threshold increases, and from the link between Superannuation rates and after-tax average wages.

### Changes to Family Tax Credit

Eligible families with children aged under 16 will gain further from the increases to the Family Tax Credit rates for younger children.

Family Tax Credits increase by $9.25 a week for the first child under 16, while credits for subsequent children increase by between $17.75 and $26.81 per week.

A small number of families may be disadvantaged by the changes to Family Tax Credit abatement settings but in nearly all cases this will be more than offset by the tax threshold changes. Transitional assistance will be available for any families experiencing overall losses of more than $3 per week as a result of the changes across the Family Incomes Package.

### Changes to accommodation payments

The maximum Accommodation Supplement rates for a two person household will increase between $25 and $75 a week, while larger households will gain up to between $40 and $80 a week in accommodation support, depending on where they live. In addition, the make-up of the four Accommodation Supplement areas will be updated so families in areas where housing costs have increased the most will receive further gains.

Families and individuals who are entitled to receive Accommodation Supplement at the maximum payment rate will gain from these changes.

Student Allowance recipients who are eligible to receive Accommodation Benefit at the current maximum weekly rate of $40 may now receive up to $60 per week. This will help around 41,000 students with high accommodation costs.

Average impacts
---------------

The package as a whole is expected to benefit around 1,340,000 families by an average of $26 per week.

The table below shows the impacts across the population for those families who gain from the Family Incomes Package. These are approximate changes by income quintile, and indicate how a family’s average gain is distributed across the elements of the package.

**Table 1**: Distribution of gains by element[\[1\]](#footnote-1)

| 2   | $24,000 | 296,000 | $11.07 | ($5.73) | $6.10 | $3.81 | $15.11 |
| 3   | $51,000 | 296,000 | $20.90 | ($2.32) | $2.98 | $2.14 | $23.69 |
| 4   | $84,000 | 298,000 | $28.12 | ($3.77) | $1.65 | $0.25 | $26.24 |
| 5   | $127,000 | 298,000 | $34.65 | ($1.43) | $0.00 | $0.00 | $33.22 |
| Total |     | 1,342,000 | $21.58 | ($2.94) | $4.28 | $3.32 | $25.81 |

There will be flow-on gains to around 750,000 superannuitants and 41,000 students who also benefit from the Family Incomes Package.

What is the economic effect of the package?
-------------------------------------------

In the short term, household consumption is expected to increase, increasing employment growth and reducing the unemployment rate by around 0.1 percentage points. Overall, the package results in a cumulative $3 billion increase in nominal GDP across the five years to June 2021. It is expected to have a modest, positive impact on GDP in the long run.

How much does the package cost?
-------------------------------

The total net cost of the Family Incomes Package is on average $2 billion per year, and about $6.5 billion over the four-year Budget forecast period.

**Table 2**: Cost by element of the Family Incomes Package

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **$million** | **2017/18** | **2018/19** | **2019/20** | **2020/21** |
| Reduction in Tax Revenue including IETC | 486.000 | 1,896.000 | 1,895.000 | 1,976.000 |
| Working for Families | 97.000 | 373.000 | 318.000 | 310.000 |
| Accommodation Supplement | 87.559 | 361.583 | 380.296 | 399.723 |
| Accommodation Benefit | 6.300 | 19.500 | 19.500 | 19.800 |
| Transitional Fund | 1.063 | 0.500 | 0.400 | 0.250 |
| Consequential Impacts[\[3\]](#footnote-3) | \-74.338 | \-575.244 | \-760.906 | \-693.736 |
| **Operating balance impact** | **603.584** | **2,075.339** | **1,852.290** | **2,012.037** |

The cost is lower in 2019/20 because indexation of the younger-child rates for the Family Tax Credit and abatement changes (part of the Working for Families tax credits) were expected to occur on 1 April 2019 and was therefore included in previous forecasts.

More information
----------------

All changes in the Family Incomes Package will commence from 1 April 2018. Until then taxes and payments are unaffected.

1.  The Treasury recommends the following caveats be noted when interpreting this analysis. To ensure the sample is representative of the New Zealand population, sample weights have been modified to match the administrative characteristics of the Accommodation Supplement recipients. This has been done as an aggregate level adjustment. The impact of Temporary Additional Support is excluded from Table 1. Accommodation Supplement area changes have been included at the Urban Area (2001) level, however, subsequent changes have been made at the Area Unit level. Area Unit data is not available in Treasury’s microsimulation model, so these changes have not been included. Table 1 excludes New Zealand Superannuation recipients and independent students.

3.  Consequential impacts include, for example, increased GST revenue as people spend their additional after-tax income, a reduction in gross benefit expenditure (as the net payments to benefit recipients are unchanged), partially offset by increases in New Zealand Superannuation payments due to an increase in the after-tax average wage (to which it is linked).

To find out what the Family Incomes Package means for you, see the Family Incomes Package Calculator at: www.budget.govt.nz/budget/2017/family-incomes-calculator 3 Consequential impacts include, for example, increased GST revenue as people spend their additional after-tax income, a reduction in gross benefit expenditure (as the net payments to benefit recipients are unchanged), partially offset by increases in New Zealand Superannuation payments due to an increase in the after-tax average wage (to which it is linked). 4
Fact Sheet 2 – Changes to Tax Thresholds and the Independent Earner Tax Credit Summary From 1 April 2018: • Working families with incomes above $14,000 will gain from increases to the two bottom thresholds. The $14,000 income tax threshold will increase to $22,000, and the $48,000 threshold will increase to $52,000. • The change above means anyone earning more than $22,000 annually will receive a tax reduction of $10.77 a week, and anyone earning more than $52,000 will receive a tax reduction of $20.38 per week. • The Independent Earner Tax Credit of up to $10 per week will be discontinued. Individuals who currently receive the tax credit will be fully compensated by the increase in the $14,000 tax threshold to $22,000. What is changing? From 1 April 2018, the $14,000 income tax threshold will increase to $22,000, and the $48,000 threshold to $52,000. Table 1: Current and new personal income tax thresholds Current Bracket ($) New Bracket ($) Rate 1 – 14,000 1 – 22,000 10.5% 14,001 – 48,000 22,001 – 52,000 17.5% 48,001 – 70,000 52,001 – 70,000 30% 70,001+ 70,001+ 33% The Independent Earner Tax Credit, which is a maximum of $520 a year ($10 per week), will be discontinued. It is currently available to individuals with taxable income between $24,000 and $48,000 who are not eligible to receive benefits, New Zealand Superannuation or Working for Families tax credits. Why are the changes being made? The average wage has risen from $49,500 to $58,900 over the last seven years. As incomes rise, the marginal tax rates that individuals face also increase. This weakens work incentives by reducing the rewards of extra work. Increasing tax thresholds provides greater rewards for low and middle income earners, and is expected to support long-run economic performance. 1 The increase of the $14,000 tax threshold will provide greater incentives for people to enter work; in particular, for those receiving a benefit. The increase of the $48,000 tax threshold will provide greater incentives for people already in work to increase work hours and earn more income. Table 2: Examples of families without entitlement to Working for Families Primary income (annual) Secondary income (annual) Weekly tax reduction Weekly IETC change Weekly income change $33,000 $33,000 $21.54 -$ 20.00 $1.54 increase $60,000 $60,000 $40.77 n/a $40.77 increase $60,000 - $20.38 n/a $20.38 increase The Independent Earner Tax Credit has had less uptake than expected. Of those individuals who are eligible to receive it, only 32 per cent claim it during the year. Individuals who currently receive the tax credit will be fully compensated by the increase in the $14,000 tax threshold to $22,000. Discontinuing the tax credit will help to simplify the system, as individuals will not have to file a tax return at year-end or use a different tax code to claim it. For example, a person on an annual income of $33,000 who currently qualifies for the Independent Earner Tax Credit will no longer receive the $10 per week tax credit from 1 April 2018, and will pay $10.77 less per week in income tax in the year, resulting in an increase in after-tax income of $0.77 per week. This example does not include other elements of the Family Incomes Package, such as changes to the Accommodation Supplement rates. More information The changes to the tax thresholds will have impacts on how provisional tax payments are calculated for the 2018-19 tax year and other taxes that are linked to the personal income tax thresholds. • The uplift factor for provisional taxpayers using the uplift method will temporarily be reduced from 105 per cent to 100 per cent (zero uplift) to ensure those taxpayers benefit from the tax changes during the year. • Extra pay thresholds will adjust to reflect the change in income tax thresholds. • Fringe benefit tax thresholds will adjust to reflect the change in income tax thresholds. • Individuals may need to update their prescribed investor rate (PIR) with their bank or financial institution if the change in thresholds means that they face a lower marginal tax rate. • The tax changes will not affect the Student Allowance payment rate or the main benefit rates. 2
Fact Sheet 3 – Changes to Working for Families
==============================================

Summary
-------

### From 1 April 2018:

*   The Family Tax Credit rates will be updated so they are the same regardless of age. There will be one rate for the eldest child, $101.98 a week, and one rate for all subsequent children, $91.25 a week.
*   Low to middle income families with an eldest child aged under 16 will get up to $9.25 more a week in Working for Families, depending on their income, and up to $26.81 a week more for subsequent children, depending on their income and age of child.
*   Around 310,000 families will benefit from the changes to the Family Tax Credit.
*   The abatement rate for Working for Families Tax Credits will be increased from 22.5 cents to 25 cents in the dollar. The abatement threshold will decrease from $36,350 a year to $35,000 a year. This brings forward changes already planned to progressively occur by 2025 based on expected movements in the Consumers Price Index.

What is changing?
-----------------

From 1 April 2018, two elements of Working for Families will change:

1.  The Family Tax Credit rates for children aged under 16 are increasing, so that they align with the rates for children aged 16 to 18 years.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Annual Rate** | **Current** | **1 April 2018** |
| Eldest child, 16-18 | $5,303 | $5,303 |
| Eldest child, 0-15 | $4,822 |
| Subsequent child, 16-18 | $4,745 | $4,745 |
| Subsequent child, 13-15 | $3,822 |
| Subsequent child, 0-12 | $3,351 |

The base rate of the Family Tax Credit for the eldest child aged under 16 will increase from $92.73 to $101.98 a week – an increase of $9.25 a week, or around 10 per cent.

The base rate of the Family Tax Credit for a subsequent child aged under 13 will increase from $64.44 to $91.25 a week – an increase of $26.81 a week, or around 42 per cent.

The base rate of the Family Tax Credit for a subsequent child aged 13 to 15 will increase from $73.50 to $91.25 a week – an increase of $17.75 a week, or around 24 per cent.

1.  The abatement rate for Working for Families will increase and the abatement threshold will decrease.

The abatement rate for Working for Families Tax Credits will be increased from 22.5 cents to 25 cents in the dollar. The abatement threshold will decrease from $36,350 a year to $35,000 a year. This brings forward changes already planned to progressively occur by 2025 based on expected movements in the Consumers Price Index.

Most Working for Families payments start reducing (abating) when a family’s income exceeds the abatement threshold. Payments currently reduce by 22.5 cents for each dollar earned over $36,350 of family scheme income (gross income with some adjustments).

Why are changes being made?
---------------------------

The Government wants to help lower income families with young children to meet their living costs. The Family Tax Credit rates for young children have not been increased since 1 April 2012.

The Government also wants to start simplifying the rules for payments to families to make them easier to understand. Currently there are five different Family Tax Credit rates for children. If a child changes from one age band to another during the year, the family is paid a composite rate based on when in the year the child’s birthday was. Removing the age bands will start to simplify the system.

Raising the abatement rate to 25 cents in the dollar and lowering the abatement threshold to $35,000 means that assistance is better targeted to lower income families.

How do these changes affect people’s incomes?
---------------------------------------------

As a result of these changes to Working for Families:

*   Families with one child aged under 16 and a family income less than $35,000 a year, including beneficiaries, will get $9.25 extra a week per child.
*   Families with one child aged under 16 and another child aged under 13 with a family income less than $35,000 will get $36.06 extra a week.
*   Families that only have children aged 16 to 18 years, earning less than $35,000 a year in family scheme income, including beneficiaries, will see no change in Family Tax Credit payments.
*   Higher income families or families earning more than $35,000 who only have children aged 16 to 18 years will receive slightly less from Working for Families. Nearly all of those changes are compensated for through other elements in the Family Incomes Package.

Table 1 only shows changes to Family Tax Credits. Families will benefit from the changes to the income tax thresholds and some will also benefit from increases to the Accommodation Supplement. Transitional financial assistance will be available to the small number of households who may see overall losses of more than $3 a week as a result of the changes across the Family Incomes Package.

Hon Steven Joyce  
Minister of Finance

25 May 2017

### $2b Family Incomes Package to lift after-tax incomes

The Government’s $2 billion per year Family Incomes Package will make changes to tax thresholds, Working for Families and the Accommodation Supplement to help Kiwi families get ahead, Finance Minister Steven Joyce says.

“It is important that Kiwi families directly share in the benefits of New Zealand’s economic growth,” Mr Joyce says. “The Family Incomes Package is carefully designed to especially assist low and middle income earners with young families and higher housing costs.”

The Budget 2017 Family Incomes Package benefits around 1.3 million families in New Zealand by, on average, $26 per week.

“The measures in this budget are expected to lift 20,000 households above the threshold for severe housing stress, and reduce the number of children living in families receiving less than half of the median income by around 50,000,” Mr Joyce says.

From 1 April 2018, the Package:

*   Increases the $14,000 income tax threshold to $22,000, and the $48,000 tax threshold to $52,000.

*   Discontinues the Independent Earner Tax Credit.

*   Increases the Family Tax Credit rates for young children to the level of those for children aged 16 to 18, while increasing the abatement rate and decreasing the abatement threshold.

*   Increases the Accommodation Supplement maximum amounts, and updates the Accommodation Supplement areas to reflect 2016 rents.

*   Increases the weekly payments of the Accommodation Benefit for eligible Student Allowance recipients by up to $20.

These changes mean, for example, a couple with two children under 13 and one partner working earning $55,000 will gain $41 per week plus any increase to their Accommodation Supplement.

Mr Joyce says that as wages have risen over the last seven years, people on lower and middle incomes have been faced with higher marginal tax rates.

“The Budget 2017 Family Incomes Package will provide better rewards for hard work by adjusting the bottom two tax thresholds and lowering the marginal tax rates for low and middle income earners,” Mr Joyce says. “At the same time it will start simplifying the tax and transfer system by removing the separate Independent Earner Tax Credit which is claimed during the year by less than one third of those eligible.”

The tax threshold change provides a tax reduction of $10.77 a week to anyone earning more than $22,000 per annum, increasing to $20.38 a week for anyone earning more than $52,000 per annum.

People who lose the Independent Earner Tax Credit will be compensated in full by the lifting of the lowest income tax threshold from $14,000 to $22,000.

“The Family Incomes Package will also help lower income families with young children meet their living costs through changes to the Family Tax Credit, and it will improve the incomes for those with higher housing costs,” Mr Joyce says.

Some of the biggest gains in the Package are for people on lower incomes with young children. 

“Family Tax Credit rates increase by $9.25 a week for the first child under 16, while credits for subsequent children increase by either $17.75 or $26.81 per week depending on the age of the child,” Mr Joyce says.

Similarly there are significant increases for people on low incomes with high accommodation costs.

The maximum Accommodation Supplement rate for a two person household increases by between $25 and $75 a week, while the maximum for larger households increases by between $40 and $80 a week. In addition, changes to the Accommodation Supplement areas will provide further gains for some families.

The Accommodation Benefit, which is paid to Student Allowance recipients who experience housing stress, will also increase by up to $20 per week.

The Package will have flow-on effects, with around three quarters of a million superannuitants benefiting because of the link between New Zealand Superannuation and after tax wages. The couple rate for superannuitants will increase by $13.12 per week on 1 April next year in addition to the normal adjustments.

“Budget 2017 is about delivering for New Zealanders. This Family Incomes Package is the first step in allowing Kiwi families to spend more of their own money, so they can make the decisions that are best for them,” Mr Joyce says.

### Fact Sheet – Family Incomes Package

#### Summary

From 1 April 2018:

The $2 billion per year Family Incomes Package will provide better rewards for hard work, help lower-income families with young children meet their living costs, and improve incomes for people with high housing costs.

The Family Incomes Package will benefit 1,340,000 families by an average of $26 per week. Around 750,000 superannuitants and 41,000 students will also benefit from the Family Incomes Package.

The measures in this Package are expected to lift 20,000 households above the threshold for severe housing stress, and reduce the number of children living in families receiving less than half of the median income by around 50,000.

The following elements make up the Package:

*   Increasing the bottom two income tax thresholds:
    *   From $14,000 to $22,000; and
    *   From $48,000 to $52,000.
*   Discontinuing the Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC).
*   Family Tax Credit (FTC):
    *   Increasing payment rates for children aged under 16, so that they align with the rates for children aged 16 to 18 years; and
    *   Increasing the abatement rate from 22.5 cents to 25 cents in the dollar and decreasing the abatement threshold from $36,350 a year to $35,000 a year.
*   Housing costs:
    *   Increasing the maximum Accommodation Supplement (AS) payments and updating locations of Accommodation Supplement areas to reflect increases in housing costs; and
    *   Increasing the weekly payments of Accommodation Benefit for eligible Student Allowance recipients by up to $20.

Superannuitants will gain from the tax threshold increases and some will also gain from the Accommodation Supplement increases.  
The impact of the Family Incomes Package on any given family or individual will depend on their particular circumstances, including the types of supplementary assistance they may receive.

#### Impact on family incomes

##### Tax threshold changes and discontinuing IETC

The tax threshold changes provide a tax reduction of $10.77 a week to anyone earning more than $22,000 per annum, increasing to $20.38 a week for anyone earning more than $52,000 per annum.

These changes are likely to increase work incentives. Working families and individuals not receiving a benefit will gain from the tax threshold changes if their individual incomes are above $14,000.

Individuals who receive the Independent Earner Tax Credit of up to $10 per week will be fully compensated by the increase in the $14,000 tax threshold. Only 32 per cent of those eligible claim this credit during the tax year.

New Zealand Superannuation recipients will gain from the tax threshold increases, and from the link between Superannuation rates and after-tax average wages.

##### Changes to Family Tax Credit

Eligible families with children aged under 16 will gain further from the increases to the Family Tax Credit rates for younger children.

Family Tax Credits increase by $9.25 a week for the first child under 16, while credits for subsequent children increase by between $17.75 and $26.81 per week.

A small number of families may be disadvantaged by the changes to Family Tax Credit abatement settings but in nearly all cases this will be more than offset by the tax threshold changes. Transitional assistance will be available for any families experiencing overall losses of more than $3 per week as a result of the changes across the Family Incomes Package.

##### Changes to accommodation payments

The maximum Accommodation Supplement rates for a two person household will increase between $25 and $75 a week, while larger households will gain up to between $40 and $80 a week in accommodation support, depending on where they live. In addition, the make-up of the four Accommodation Supplement areas will be updated so families in areas where housing costs have increased the most will receive further gains.

Families and individuals who are entitled to receive Accommodation Supplement at the maximum payment rate will gain from these changes.

Student Allowance recipients who are eligible to receive Accommodation Benefit at the current maximum weekly rate of $40 may now receive up to $60 per week. This will help around 41,000 students with high accommodation costs.

#### Average impacts

The package as a whole is expected to benefit around 1,340,000 families by an average of $26 per week.

The table below shows the impacts across the population for those families who gain from the Family Incomes Package. These are approximate changes by income quintile, and indicate how a family’s average gain is distributed across the elements of the package.

**Table 1**: Distribution of gains by element[\[1\]](#footnote1)

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| **Quintile** | **Minimum  <br>income  <br>in range** | **Number of  <br>Families  <br>who gain** | **Average change in:** |     |     |     | **Average gain  <br>from all  <br>elements[\[2\]](#footnote2)<br>** |
| **Tax** | **IETC** | **WFF** | **AS** |
| 1   | \*  | 154,000 | $5.13 | ($0.10) | $16.63 | $17.04 | $35.32 |
| 2   | $24,000 | 296,000 | $11.07 | ($5.73) | $6.10 | $3.81 | $15.11 |
| 3   | $51,000 | 296,000 | $20.90 | ($2.32) | $2.98 | $2.14 | $23.69 |
| 4   | $84,000 | 298,000 | $28.12 | ($3.77 | $1.65 | $0.25 | $26.24 |
| 5   | $127,000 | 298,000 | $34.65 | ($1.43) | $0.00 | $0.00 | $33.22 |
| Total |     | 1,342,000 | $21,58 | ($2.94) | $4.28 | $3.32 | $25.81 |

There will be flow-on gains to around 750,000 superannuitants and 41,000 students who also benefit from the Family Incomes Package.

#### What is the economic effect of the package?

In the short term, household consumption is expected to increase, increasing employment growth and reducing the unemployment rate by around 0.1 percentage points. Overall, the package results in a cumulative $3 billion increase in nominal GDP across the five years to June 2021. It is expected to have a modest, positive impact on GDP in the long run.

#### How much does the package cost?

The total net cost of the Family Incomes Package is on average $2 billion per year, and about $6.5 billion over the four-year Budget forecast period.

**Table 2**: Cost by element of the Family Incomes Package

| $million | 2017/18 | 2018/19 | 2019/20 | 2020/21 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reduction in Tax Revenue including IETC | 486.000 | 1,896.000 | 1,895.000 | 1,976.000 |
| Working for Families | 97.000 | 373.000 | 318.000 | 310.000 |
| Accommodation Supplement | 87.559 | 361.583 | 380.296 | 399.723 |
| Accommodation Benefit | 6.300 | 19.500 | 19.500 | 19.800 |
| Transitional Fund | 1.063 | 0.500 | 0.400 | 0.250 |
| Consequential Impact[\[3\]](#footnote3) | \-74.33 | \-575.24 | \-760.90 | \-693.736 |
| **Operating balance impact** | **603.584** | **2,075.33** | **1,852.29** | **2,012.037** |

The cost is lower in 2019/20 because indexation of the younger-child rates for the Family Tax Credit and abatement changes (part of the Working for Families tax credits) were expected to occur on 1 April 2019 and was therefore included in previous forecasts.

#### More information

All changes in the Family Incomes Package will commence from 1 April 2018. Until then taxes and payments are unaffected.

\[1\] The Treasury recommends the following caveats be noted when interpreting this analysis. To ensure the sample is representative of the New Zealand population, sample weights have been modified to match the administrative characteristics of the Accommodation Supplement recipients. This has been done as an aggregate level adjustment. The impact of Temporary Additional Support is excluded from Table 1. Accommodation Supplement area changes have been included at the Urban Area (2001) level, however, subsequent changes have been made at the Area Unit level. Area Unit data is not available in Treasury’s microsimulation model, so these changes have not been included. Table 1 excludes New Zealand Superannuation recipients and independent students.

\[2\] Some interactions between the tax and transfer system are not presented. Therefore the Tax, IETC, WFF and AS columns are not intended to sum to the average gain from all elements column.

\[3\] Consequential impacts include, for example, increased GST revenue as people spend their additional after-tax income, a reduction in gross benefit expenditure (as the net payments to benefit recipients are unchanged), partially offset by increases in New Zealand Superannuation payments due to an increase in the after-tax average wage (to which it is linked).

### Fact Sheet – Changes to Tax Thresholds and the Independent Earner Tax Credit

#### Summary

From 1 April 2018:

*   Working families with incomes above $14,000 will gain from increases to the two bottom thresholds. The $14,000 income tax threshold will increase to $22,000, and the $48,000 threshold will increase to $52,000.
*   The change above means anyone earning more than $22,000 annually will receive a tax reduction of $10.77 a week, and anyone earning more than $52,000 will receive a tax reduction of $20.38 per week.
*   The Independent Earner Tax Credit of up to $10 per week will be discontinued. Individuals who currently receive the tax credit will be fully compensated by the increase in the $14,000 tax threshold to $22,000.

#### What is changing?

From 1 April 2018, the $14,000 income tax threshold will increase to $22,000, and the $48,000 threshold to $52,000.

**Table 1**: Current and new personal income tax thresholds

| Current Bracket ($) | New Bracket ($) | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 – 14,000 | 1 – 22,000 | 10.5% |
| 14,001 – 48,000 | 22,001 – 52,000 | 17.5% |
| 48,001 – 70,000 | 52,001 – 70,000 | 30% |
| 70,001+ | 70,001 | 33% |

The Independent Earner Tax Credit, which is a maximum of $520 a year ($10 per week), will be discontinued. It is currently available to individuals with taxable income between $24,000 and $48,000 who are not eligible to receive benefits, New Zealand Superannuation or Working for Families tax credits.

#### Why are the changes being made?

The average wage has risen from $49,500 to $58,900 over the last seven years. As incomes rise, the marginal tax rates that individuals face also increase. This weakens work incentives by reducing the rewards of extra work. Increasing tax thresholds provides greater rewards for low and middle income earners, and is expected to support long-run economic performance.

The increase of the $14,000 tax threshold will provide greater incentives for people to enter work; in particular, for those receiving a benefit. The increase of the $48,000 tax threshold will provide greater incentives for people already in work to increase work hours and earn more income.

**Table 2**: Examples of families without entitlement to Working for Families

| Primary income (annual) | Secondary income (annual) | Weekly tax reduction | Weekly IETC change | Weekly income change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $33,000 | $33,000 | $21.54 | \-$20.0 | $1.54 increase |
| $60,000 | $60,000 | $40.77 | n/a | $40.77 increase |
| $60,00 | \-  | $20.38 | n/a | $20.38 increase |

The Independent Earner Tax Credit has had less uptake than expected. Of those individuals who are eligible to receive it, only 32 per cent claim it during the year.

Individuals who currently receive the tax credit will be fully compensated by the increase in the $14,000 tax threshold to $22,000. Discontinuing the tax credit will help to simplify the system, as individuals will not have to file a tax return at year-end or use a different tax code to claim it.

For example, a person on an annual income of $33,000 who currently qualifies for the Independent Earner Tax Credit will no longer receive the $10 per week tax credit from 1 April 2018, and will pay $10.77 less per week in income tax in the year, resulting in an increase in after-tax income of $0.77 per week. This example does not include other elements of the Family Incomes Package, such as changes to the Accommodation Supplement rates.

#### More information

The changes to the tax thresholds will have impacts on how provisional tax payments are calculated for the 2018-19 tax year and other taxes that are linked to the personal income tax thresholds.

*   The uplift factor for provisional taxpayers using the uplift method will temporarily be reduced from 105 per cent to 100 per cent (zero uplift) to ensure those taxpayers benefit from the tax changes during the year.
*   Extra pay thresholds will adjust to reflect the change in income tax thresholds.
*   Fringe benefit tax thresholds will adjust to reflect the change in income tax thresholds.
*   Individuals may need to update their prescribed investor rate (PIR) with their bank or financial institution if the change in thresholds means that they face a lower marginal tax rate.
*   The tax changes will not affect the Student Allowance payment rate or the main benefit rates.

* * *

### Fact Sheet – Changes to Working for Families

#### Summary

From 1 April 2018:

*   The Family Tax Credit rates will be updated so they are the same regardless of age. There will be one rate for the eldest child, $101.98 a week, and one rate for all subsequent children, $91.25 a week.
*   Low to middle income families with an eldest child aged under 16 will get up to $9.25 more a week in Working for Families, depending on their income, and up to $26.81 a week more for subsequent children, depending on their income and age of child.
*   Around 310,000 families will benefit from the changes to the Family Tax Credit.
*   The abatement rate for Working for Families Tax Credits will be increased from 22.5 cents to 25 cents in the dollar. The abatement threshold will decrease from $36,350 a year to $35,000 a year. This brings forward changes already planned to progressively occur by 2025 based on expected movements in the Consumers Price Index.

#### What is changing?

From 1 April 2018, two elements of Working for Families will change:

1\. The Family Tax Credit rates for children aged under 16 are increasing, so that they align with the rates for children aged 16 to 18 years.

| Annual Rate | Current | 1 April 2018 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Eldest child, 16-18 | $5,303 | $5,303 |
| Eldest child, 0-15 | $4,822 |
| Subsequent child, 16-18 | $4,745 | $4,745 |
| Subsequent child, 13-15 | $3,822 |
| Subsequent child, 0-12 | $3,351 |

The base rate of the Family Tax Credit for the eldest child aged under 16 will increase from $92.73 to $101.98 a week – an increase of $9.25 a week, or around 10 per cent.

The base rate of the Family Tax Credit for a subsequent child aged under 13 will increase from $64.44 to $91.25 a week – an increase of $26.81 a week, or around 42 per cent.

The base rate of the Family Tax Credit for a subsequent child aged 13 to 15 will increase from $73.50 to $91.25 a week – an increase of $17.75 a week, or around 24 per cent.

2\. The abatement rate for Working for Families will increase and the abatement threshold will decrease.

The abatement rate for Working for Families Tax Credits will be increased from 22.5 cents to 25 cents in the dollar. The abatement threshold will decrease from $36,350 a year to $35,000 a year. This brings forward changes already planned to progressively occur by 2025 based on expected movements in the Consumers Price Index.

Most Working for Families payments start reducing (abating) when a family’s income exceeds the abatement threshold. Payments currently reduce by 22.5 cents for each dollar earned over $36,350 of family scheme income (gross income with some adjustments).

#### Why are changes being made?

The Government wants to help lower income families with young children to meet their living costs. The Family Tax Credit rates for young children have not been increased since 1 April 2012.

The Government also wants to start simplifying the rules for payments to families to make them easier to understand. Currently there are five different Family Tax Credit rates for children. If a child changes from one age band to another during the year, the family is paid a composite rate based on when in the year the child’s birthday was. Removing the age bands will start to simplify the system.

Raising the abatement rate to 25 cents in the dollar and lowering the abatement threshold to $35,000 means that assistance is better targeted to lower income families.

#### How do these changes affect people’s incomes?

As a result of these changes to Working for Families:

*   Families with one child aged under 16 and a family income less than $35,000 a year, including beneficiaries, will get $9.25 extra a week per child.
*   Families with one child aged under 16 and another child aged under 13 with a family income less than $35,000 will get $36.06 extra a week.
*   Families that only have children aged 16 to 18 years, earning less than $35,000 a year in family scheme income, including beneficiaries, will see no change in Family Tax Credit payments.
*   Higher income families or families earning more than $35,000 who only have children aged 16 to 18 years will receive slightly less from Working for Families. Nearly all of those changes are compensated for through other elements in the Family Incomes Package.

#### Examples of Family Tax Credit changes

| 60,000 | 0   | 0   | 0   | 3333 | 3798 | 465 | 2,852 | 3798 | 946 |
| 65,000 |     |     |     | 2208 | 2548 | 340 | 1,727 | 2548 | 821 |
| 70,000 |     |     |     | 1083 | 1298 | 215 | 602 | 1298 | 696 |
| 75,000 |     |     |     | 0   | 48  | 48  | 0   | 48  | 48  |
| 80,000 |     |     |     | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

Table 1 only shows changes to Family Tax Credits. Families will benefit from the changes to the income tax thresholds and some will also benefit from increases to the Accommodation Supplement. Transitional financial assistance will be available to the small number of households who may see overall losses of more than $3 a week as a result of the changes across the Family Incomes Package.

#### More information

Inland Revenue and Work and Income will contact Working for Families recipients in February 2018 to inform them of their likely entitlement for the 2018-19 tax year.

### Budget 2017 addresses black hole expenditure

Many business expenses currently written off as black hole expenditure would become tax deductible under proposals released as part of Budget 2017, Revenue Minister Judith Collins says.

“Some costs of investigating the viability of a new proposal or project – that is, feasibility expenditure – are currently neither immediately tax deductible, nor depreciable. As a result, it falls into what businesses describe as the black hole,” Ms Collins says.

“Tax consequences should not be an obstacle to businesses innovating and pursuing opportunities for growth. The discussion document we are releasing today therefore proposes improved tax treatment for feasibility and black hole expenditure.

“Where no asset is created on the balance sheet, feasibility expenditure would be immediately deductible for income tax purposes. Where an asset is created we’re proposing that the feasibility expenditure would be capital expenditure for tax purposes.

“In addition, capitalised feasibility expenditure and other expenditure on an asset abandoned part way through construction would become immediately deductible if it is also expensed under International Financial Reporting Standards.

“We’re asking for views on a range of aspects of the proposals including the timing for application. If businesses are not making investments today because of the current treatment, we welcome feedback on making the change retrospective. Doing so would give businesses certainty that investments currently being considered would be in line for this improved tax treatment,” Ms Collins says.

“The Government has already resolved many types of black hole expenditure over the past few years to improve productivity and remove a tax impediment to growth. These proposals will allow an even wider range of costs to be deductible for tax purposes.”

Public feedback on Black hole and feasibility expenditure at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz is open until 6 July.

Hon Stuart Nash  
Minister of Revenue

Speech

### Opening address at the Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand Annual Tax Conference 2017

#### Introduction

It’s great to be able to join you here today as the Minister of Revenue. It was only a year ago that I was last here with you in a different role.

Thank you for the invite, and can I start by just acknowledging the great work that CAANZ does, and I hope will continue to do, in supporting the New Zealand tax system. One thing I am really keen to do today is set the scene for how I would like Inland Revenue and the private sector to collaborate over the next three years.

As someone who has sat on the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee and considered a number of tax bills, and had to set my alarm far too early in order to get up and read your submission, I know that you take your role in crafting tax policy and legislation incredibly seriously. For this I thank you – even though I didn’t at 4.30 am in the morning. The day after Winston confirmed that he was forming a coalition with Labour, but before Jacinda had allocated portfolios, it had already been announced that Grant would be Finance Minister and we were joking about the amount of tax legislation we would have to put through the House to achieve our 100-day plan. I said to Grant, “Well mate, you are going to have to read all this tax legislation now.” He said “Well, the Revenue Minister will,” – to which we both laughed. Little did I know … I suspect I cursed myself when I didn’t delete that 4.30 am alarm setting.

Our Government’s focus in the first term will be to make New Zealand an even better place to live in. A better place to live, work, visit and do business. Our policies will see major investment in housing, health, education, police and infrastructure, while creating jobs and lifting the incomes of families.

Tax is important because it funds the public services and infrastructure that all New Zealanders rely on. Community expectations about living in a fair and decent society with first-world public services rely on the tax system delivering adequate revenue.

Tax is broadly 1/3 of GDP and therefore it is absolutely critical for New Zealand’s wellbeing that it works well. Our system is good, but it can be better.

We want a progressive tax and transfer system for all individuals and families. It must treat all incomes and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner. While I am in favour of the tax system to incentivise certain behaviour (for example, excise tax in relation to tobacco), I am adamant that the tax system must not create perverse outcomes to the detriment of the economy. Where these have occurred, we will fix them. It must promote the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy. And it must be efficient, fair and simple to collect.

We also know some sectors of society can get away with paying little or no tax. That’s unfair, and we want to strengthen our system to reduce those opportunities and to make it fairer.

I said we had lots to do – let me set out the Government’s priorities in the tax space for the first 100 days.

#### The 100 day plan

Within 100 days we will:

*   Repeal the previous government’s tax cuts and redirect that to families in need, and what we consider is more targeted assistance. With so much investment needed to support our social services and our infrastructure, now is not the time for tax cuts.
*   Legislate to pass the Families Package, including the Winter Energy Payment, Best Start and increases to Paid Parental Leave.
*   Establish the Tax Working Group, led by the Minister of Finance and myself. By Christmas, we will release the terms of reference and membership of the Tax Working Group. We want a group of experts to advise us on the future of the tax system. Let’s be honest, no one usually likes paying tax, so IRD have a duty to make it as easy as possible to comply while still taking into account the integrity of the system. I know it’s a very fine balancing act, but we should always be looking for ways to improve.

We also want to make this a conversation involving the broader public and community. The tax system is something we all must own.

We’re committed to ensuring our tax system continues to apply as broadly and neutrally as possible. A big concern of this Government is fairness. Although there have been a number of Tax Working Groups over the years, our tax system hasn’t had a major overhaul in a generation.

So the first question for the Working Group will be: “is our tax system fit for the future?” Perhaps the Working Group will say that the system is fine and they will come back with no substantive recommendations. But I suspect there are inherent inequities in the system that need addressing.

How broad this review will be is currently being discussed. But personally, I think this is an opportunity to think longer term about some of the bigger opportunities and threats to our tax system. An opportunity to future-proof it. I would like to briefly discuss some of those longer-term trends.

#### Future challenges

The first is: what is the future of work? We know from research conducted by the Minister for Finance Grant Robertson that the nature and experience of work is changing rapidly. We need to be in a position to respond to the changes. One job for life is yesterday’s reality, not tomorrow’s opportunity. So let’s understand the consequences of this from a tax perspective.

At the same time, New Zealand must continue to be an innovative place with high economic growth, where businesses thrive and create the jobs that will make as Sir Peter Gluckman once said “New Zealand as a place where talent wants to live”. Internationally, I expect the trend of declining tax rates to continue. Just recently, the US House of Representatives released their tax proposal, with a fall in the company tax rate from 35% to 20%.

This is something to keep an eye on. We want to make sure that our company tax is fair and efficient and, as with the BEPS work which the Government will continue to support, it is important to ensure that all companies operating in NZ, pay their fair share. The Government will take strong action to ensure multinational companies comply based on their genuine activity. As the then PM John Key said “what these companies do may be legal, but it’s immoral”. At the same time, we will ensure that New Zealand remains a great place to do business. We will be introducing legislation soon to support this.

The system must be consistent and easy to understand and comply with, while maintaining its overall integrity.

Another issue is the ageing population and growing fiscal pressures. Increased costs of New Zealand Super and healthcare. We must ensure that the tax base is resilient, and able to fund the services in a way that meets the expectation of all New Zealanders.

Meanwhile, new technology is changing the way business operates and consumers behave. We need 21st century solutions to 21st century problems.

There are opportunities for foreign services to be supplied into New Zealand from companies that are resident overseas. It is important that, over time, this does not lead to an evaporation of our company tax base. This is an issue which is currently receiving considerable debate in the OECD, and it is important for us to be considering how New Zealand should best respond.

Another change is the rapid growth in the sharing economy. The biggest accommodation provider in the world doesn’t own a single bed and the biggest transport provider doesn’t own a car. As this sort of practice develops, it will be important to make sure that everything is done to ensure high levels of tax compliance. But we don’t want solutions that only address particular platforms; we need a tax system that makes compliance painless for all future innovations that become part of the new economy.

There are even more disruptive technologies on the horizon – in particular blockchain technology, such as Bitcoin, and other decentralised methods of operating. It’s inevitable that our tax system will need adjustments to accommodate these new business models, however they evolve. If we don’t evolve at the same rate in real time, the potential cost could be huge.

The successful solution to these issues will depend on tax professionals such as you continuing to engage with the Government to work through issues. One advantage we have is that our tax system is undergoing the most significant transformation that is probably happening around the world in how it administers tax, and this creates great opportunities for us to get ahead of the game.

#### Update on Business Transformation

Just on that, I would briefly like to touch on Business Transformation. I know the Commissioner and her staff will be giving you an update on the detail.

This Government is supportive of the direction of Business Transformation. A modern, digital tax system will serve all the needs of New Zealanders. Customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct entitlements, as tax will be withheld and assistance provided at the time it is needed.

As a result of the changes being made, businesses will be able to spend more time on running their business, with tax as a secondary consideration. Both business and individuals will have greater confidence that they are paying the right amount with minimum effort required on their part. As you may know, provisional tax, a particular concern for many businesses, has been addressed.

The Transformation programme will allow Inland Revenue to best serve all New Zealanders and the Government by increasing certainty in the tax system, reducing compliance costs and simplifying tax administration – through the use of digital services.

It’s a key investment, and the Government is committed to the success of the programme.

The income proposals relating to the timelier provisions of PAYE and investment income information are in the bill currently before the select committee. Many of you today have made submissions, which I thank you for. I would like to see this bill reported back and enacted by 31 March 2018.

Meanwhile, officials are still to report to Ministers on the policy proposals canvassed in the TAA, Individuals and Social Policy discussion documents, taking into account the feedback received in submissions. As part of this, one objective is to ensure that money held by the IRD goes back to Kiwis. At present, the IRD holds around $720m in unclaimed tax refunds for taxpayers earning employment and investment income subject to withholding. The proposal is for refunds to be issued automatically. I would expect to start to consider this advice later this month before it makes its way into a tax bill.

#### Working with the community

That brings me to an important point. I believe that there are too many tax bills before the House. A couple of years ago, three or so submitters made submissions on the wrong bill.

And too often, there were times when the IRD was saying one thing while tax professionals were saying another.

None of us on the select committee were tax professionals, yet we were expected to rule on complex tax law. This point was personally very challenging.

I know that good relations already exist between the IRD and the private sector. I also know that the IRD is currently undertaking work to try to improve how it engages with the sector. This is good. Of course, there will always be areas where full agreement cannot be reached, but it shouldn’t be a fundamental disagreement on crucial tax legislation.

#### Conclusion

It’s more important than ever for us to be working closer together. Our aspirations for the tax system reflect our aspirations for our society.

To make this happen, we need better engagement between tax professionals and the IRD on policy proposals.

The pay-offs for our economy and society will be immense.

And from a purely personal perspective, it should mean I will no longer need to get up at 4.30 am to read detailed submissions opposing proposals.

### Towards a fairer tax system - Tax Working Group Terms of Reference announced

Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Revenue Minister Stuart Nash today announced the Terms of Reference for the Tax Working Group and that the Group will be chaired by Sir Michael Cullen.

“Our 100 Day Plan includes the establishment of a Tax Working Group. The Working Group will consider changes that would improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system,” says Grant Robertson.

“This Government is committed to a fair and progressive tax system. It is important that New Zealanders have confidence in their tax system and know that everyone is paying their fair share.”

“At the moment the tax system appears unfair – for example, it doesn’t treat income from speculation in housing as it does income from work. We want to consider how we can create a better balanced system and can encourage a shift to investment in the productive economy.

“Individual wage-earners, businesses, asset owners and speculators should pay their fair share of tax. Right now we don’t think that is happening. This working group is not about increasing income tax or the rate of GST, but rather introducing more fairness across all taxpayers.

“The Working Group will also consider how the tax system can contribute to positive environmental outcomes and the impact of likely changes to the economic environment, demographics, technology and employment practices over the next decade.

“As former Minister of Finance from 1999 to 2008, Sir Michael’s credentials are impeccable and he will be a huge asset to the Working Group.”

“The other members of the Working Group will be announced before Christmas. They will include a diverse range of tax and finance experts and representatives of the business and wider community. The Working Group will be supported by a secretariat of officials from Treasury and Inland Revenue and have an independent advisor to analyse the various sources of advice received,” says Stuart Nash.

“Final recommendations to Ministers are expected by February 2019. As promised before the election, any significant changes legislated for from the Group’s final report will not come into force until the 2021 tax year.

“It is important to ensure that all sectors of the New Zealand economy can feed into the Working Group’s processes and that all relevant perspectives are considered.”

“As we promised during the election campaign, certain areas will be outside the scope of the review, including increasing any income tax rate, the rate of GST, inheritance tax and changes that would apply to the family home or land beneath it,” Grant Robertson says.

“We also want to thank our government partners, the New Zealand First and Green parties, for their input and support of the Terms of Reference for this important piece of work on the future of our tax system.

"This review is a core part of the government’s programme and I’m confident it will deliver recommendations that will enable us to put in place a tax system that is fair for all New Zealanders,” says Grant Robertson.

A major part of the changes revolves around more efficient provision of information to Inland Revenue. This Bill contains two sets of proposals which have been the subject of recent public consultation: • Making tax simpler: Better administration of PAYE and GST, which sought feedback on changes to improve the administration of PAYE and GST released in November 2015 • Making tax simpler: Investment income information, which sought feedback on changes to improve the administration of investment income information released in July 2016 Public feedback on these proposals was generally supportive and public submissions have helped shape the final proposals contained in this Bill. Improving the administration of PAYE is an integral part of this reform. Emplo ying staff can add significant compliance costs to a business or not-for-profit organisation. Increasingly employers are using software to help them run their organisations. This Bill therefore proposes changes to take advantage of modern digital systems to reduce the compliance and administrative costs associated with the PAYE process by making meeting tax obligations part of the process of paying employees rather than a separate and additional activity. Employers using payroll software will be able to report information to Inland Revenue from within their payroll software. Those who choose not to use software will be able to report their employment income information through Inland Revenue’s secure online services or, if they fall below the electronic filing threshold, on paper. The key changes in the Bill relating to PAYE are: • Record keeping (PAYE): consolidating requirements on employers • Payday provision of employment income information • Emplo yment inco me information and threshold amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 • Tax codes: clarifying the circumstances in which the no notification deduction rate applies • Consequential changes to employer reporting of employee share scheme benefit information • Penalties: amendments to retain late filing and non-electronic filing penalties as mo nthly penalt ies 3 • Transit ional provisio ns: to enable vo luntary payday reporting from 1 April 2018 • Repealing the subsidy for listed PAYE intermediaries The proposals aim to make it easier to get an employee’s pay right and to quickly address issues, such as using the wrong tax code. The result would be lower compliance costs for employers and improved accuracy of deductions for employees. The changes will also create opportunities to improve the future administration of social policy, such as child support, KiwiSaver, Working for Families and student loans. One such improvement may involve shortening the annual period over which some social policies are currently assessed to better match periods of assistance with need. Because of the more widespread use of electronic services and diversity of payroll products and services that are now available the Government has also decided to repeal the payroll subsidy from 1 April 2018. The Bill also proposes to consolidate and more logically structure the administrative requirements relat ing to emplo yment inco me info rmat ion in the Tax Administration Act 1994. To achieve this some amendments are proposed to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the introduction of a number of new subparts and schedules is proposed in the Tax Administration Act 1994 as is the shifting of a number of sections within that Act to more appropriate locations. The second set of proposals relate to the provision of investment income information. Investment income refers to interest, dividends, portfolio investment entity (PIE) income, taxable Māori authority distributions and royalties. The proposed amendments aim to reduce compliance costs for recipients of investment income and administrative costs for Government, while improving the administration of investment income to ensure that taxpayers’ tax obligations and social policy entitlements and obligations are calculated more accurately during the year. Inland Revenue currently receives limited and infrequent information about the investment income that taxpayers earn and the tax withheld or paid on that income. For interest subject to resident withholding tax (RWT) or non-resident withho lding tax (NRWT) and portfolio investment entity (PIE) income, Inland Revenue only receives information about the income taxpayers earned and the tax deducted from that income after the end of the tax year. For dividends, Māori authority distributions and interest income that is exempt from RWT or subject to the approved issuer levy (AIL), Inland Revenue only receives information about the amounts received by recipients when it is specifically requested. The key changes relate to the following: • obtaining more frequent and detailed information for interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions; 4 • bringing forward the due date when PIEs are required to provide information to Inland Revenue; • encouraging the provision of IRD numbers; • increasing electronic filing; • improving the administration of RWT exempt-status (certificates of exemption); • removing some requirements to provide end-of-year withholding tax certificates; and • improving error correction. 5 EMPLOYMENT INCOME INFORMATION Background PAYE is a withholding tax mechanism used by New Zealand employers (and PAYE intermediaries) to deduct income tax and the ACC earners’ levy from employees’ salaries, wages and as appropriate, from schedular payments, and pay it directly to Inland Revenue. The PAYE system is also used to collect payments and information for many inco me-related social policies including student loan repayments, KiwiSaver contributions and some child support payments. The changes proposed in the Bill are part of modernising New Zealand’s tax administration and are intended to use business/payroll systems to reduce the compliance and administrative costs associated with the provision of PAYE information. No compulsory changes are proposed to employers’ current obligations around the payment of PAYE and other deductions. Emplo yers will however be able to remit PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue on payday if they choose to. The key changes in the Bill are: • Record keeping (PAYE): consolidating requirements on employers • Payday provision of employment income information • Emplo yment inco me information and threshold amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 • Tax codes: clarifying the circumstances in which the no notification deduction rate applies • Consequential changes to employer reporting of employee share scheme benefit information • Penalties: amendments to retain late filing and non-electronic filing penalties as mo nthly penalt ies • Transitional provisions: to enable voluntary payday reporting from 1 April 2018 • Repealing the subsidy for listed PAYE intermediaries 6 RECORD KEEPING (PAYE) (Clauses 169, 197, 199, 201, and 284(1)(a), and schedule 2) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposals bring together the sections that impose PAYE record-keeping requirements on emplo yers. New schedule 3 itemises the information that emplo yers must record and keep. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless stated otherwise. Current section Proposed changes Section 24 provides that an employer who makes a PAYE income payment to an employee must keep proper records showing the amount of income and the amount of tax withheld. The section also requires PAYE intermediaries to keep a proper record of their actions undertaken for the employer. Section 24(2) further requires safe custody of such records and supporting information for a period of seven years unless the Commissioner has notified that retention is not required. Clause 201 proposes to repeal section 24. When information is transmitted electronically section 23(2)(c) permits employers not to retain a return that is an employer monthly schedule. Section RP 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also details the record keeping obligations on an employer and requires that the employer provide information to the intermediary within the agreed timeframe. Proposed new section 22AA contains the PAYE record keeping obligations from section 24 and also requires employers to keep the records required under the KiwiSaver Act 2006; the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011; and Child Support Act 1991. The new section proposes to place the detail of the specific records in new schedule 3 Table 1: Record-keeping requirements for employers and PAYE intermediaries. Clause 199 proposes to amend section 23(2) so that where information has been transmitted electronically an employer is not required to retain the employment income information that has been provided to the Commissioner. Proposed new schedule 3 sets out the items for which records, certificates and notifications are required to be kept. Clause 169 amends section RP 8 so that it no longer repeats the requirements in the proposed new section 22AA. 7 PAYDAY PROVISION OF EMPLOYMENT INCOME INFORMATION (Clauses 130, 147, 148, 172(14), (17), (40) and (41), 187(12) and (14), 200, 228, 230, 233, 236, 238, 284(1)(b), 288 and 290, and schedule 2) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill defines what is meant by “employment income information”, when different groups of employers must provide the information to the Commissioner and how it must be delivered. An amendment also proposes how acceptable means for error correction and adjustment may be established. Consequential changes are proposed to the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019 but under the transitional provisions employers may choose to adopt payday filing of employment income information beginning on 1 April 2018. Key features Clause 200 proposes a new subpart 3C in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Emplo yment inco me information) consisting of sections 23B–23P. Proposed new section 23C defines “employment income information” as the items of information set out in schedule 4, tables 1–3. These tables include the information required on the employer monthly schedule, information about employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT), which is currently required on the PAYE income payment form, and information about new and departing employees. Date of birth information and contact details will be required from all new emplo yees. New sections 23E to 23H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 establish four employer groups for the delivery of employment income information to the Commissioner. These groups establish the employers’ obligations to file employment income informat ion, including due dates and the means of delivery. The due date for employment income information from “online emplo yers” above the electronic filing threshold, payroll intermediaries and from employers below the threshold using payroll software is proposed as two working days after payday. “Threshold emplo yers” below the electronic filing threshold will be able to continue to report employment income information on paper but it is proposed that they will need to do so following each payday. The due date for employment income informat ion fro m emplo yers below the electronic filing thresho ld that are not using payroll software is proposed as seven working days following payday. 8 The Bill proposes that the electronic filing threshold be reduced from $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT to $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT. The Bill further provides that in future this threshold may be changed by Order in Council following appropriate consultation. An exemption to electronic filing by the second working day after payday is proposed for “electronic-exempt emplo yers” who while above the electronic filing threshold, cannot access suitable digital services. If an exemption is granted, the exempt employer will be able to file their employment income information on paper and it will not be due until seven working days after payday. New section 23H proposes how employment income information obligations apply to emplo yers who start emplo ying wit hin a tax year and new section 23I proposes employment information requirements when these fall on an emplo yee. Proposed section 23J identifies how the employment income information requirements relate to employee share schemes, this provision is dealt with later in this Commentary under “Consequential changes to employer reporting of employee share scheme benefit information”. Proposed section 23M of the Tax Administration Act 1994 establishes a regulation making power whereby acceptable means of error correction and adjustment may be set out in regulations, made on the advice of the Minister of Revenue, and fo llowing appropriate consultation. Detailed analysis All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Employment income information and employer groups Proposed sections 23C to 23H define “emplo yment income information” and establish four employer groups, along wit h requirements for the employment income information for each group and due dates for the proposed requirement that the information is provided on a payday basis. Proposed section 23I sets out the requirements for employees to provide emplo yment inco me informat ion. 9 Current section Proposed changes Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 defines: • employer monthly schedule • PAYE income payment form. Clause 172(14) and (41) propose that these definitions are repealed. Proposed new section 23C(1) defines “employment income information” as the information set out in new schedule 4, tables 1 – 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This proposed new schedule contains information relating to: • the employer, employee, income and amounts withheld - required each payday, in schedule 4, table 1; • information relating to new employees in schedule 4, table 2; • Information relating to departing employees in schedule 4, table 3. The proposed information fields differ from those currently required as follows: • The requirement for a separate form to accompany payment (the PAYE income payment form) is repealed; this is discussed further in relation to proposed section 23N(2). • Schedule 4, table 1 requires the payday date. • Date of birth information is required if the employee has provided it to the employer. • Contact details are required from all new employees. The proposed requirements for date of birth information and contact details are discussed in more detail in the commentary on proposed new section 23K under “Employment income information for new and departing employees”. Proposed new section 23C(2) requires the Commissioner to prescribe one or more electronic forms and means of electronic communication for the delivery of employment income information. See also the commentary on proposed section 23N. Section 46 requires an employer to provide details of persons employed and of their salaries, wages and other emoluments received in the month. Clause 236 proposes to repeal Section 46 as the requirements are now included in subpart 3C. Section 36E allows an employer not required to file their employer monthly schedule or PAYE income payment form electronically, to elect to do so. It is proposed to repeal this section. Section 48 provides that with prior consent of the Commissioner any requirement for the delivery of information by an employer or PAYE intermediary can be varied. The consent may have conditions and may be varied or revoked at any time. Clause 238 proposes to repeal this section. Section 23D(1) proposes the establishment of four employer groups for the provision of employment income information on a payday basis; the online group; the threshold group; the electronic exempt group and the new group. Despite the existence of four groups, section 23D(2) proposes that a PAYE intermediary is always included in the online group. Section 23D(3) proposes that any employer can choose to provide their employment income information before the date set out in the relevant section. Under proposed section 23D(4) an employer may choose to provide employment income information electronically even if they are not required to. Section 23D(5) proposes that an employer can seek approval to deliver employment income information in a different way. The Commissioner may consent, with conditions, vary the conditions or cancel the approval at any time. 10 Current section Proposed changes Section RD 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires employers who have withheld $500,000 of PAYE and ESCT in a year, or more, to provide a PAYE income payment form with the twice-monthly payments of PAYE, due on the 20th of the month for the first pay ment period and the 5th of the following month for the second period. These employers must provide the employer monthly schedule by the 5th of the following month. All other employers provide the PAYE income payment form and employer monthly schedule on the 20th of the following month. The changes proposed in clause 148 replace existing RD 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007 with a section which provides an obligation to return PAYE information as set out under sections 23E to 23H of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For further discussion of the changes to RD 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007 see the subsequent section on employment income information and threshold amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed changes replace monthly and twice-monthly filing with payday filing of employment income information. The proposed change from information provision on a monthly and twice-monthly basis to a payday basis is intended to reduce compliance and administrative costs by integrating tax requirements into an employer’s existing pay cycle(s). The online employer group proposed in section 23E is the default group. It is proposed that an employer is an online employer unless they fall into one of the other groups (the threshold group, the electronic exempt group and the new group). It is intended that online delivery of employment income information will be possible from within payroll software or using Inland Revenue’s secure online service – myIR. An employer in the online group must deliver employment income information to the Commissioner in a prescribed electronic form and using a prescribed form of electronic communication, within two working days following payday. Clause 187(12) proposes the insertion of a definition of “payday” into section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Payday means the day on which an employer makes a PAYE income payment to an employee. Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 defines “pay”. The definition includes to distribute an amount to a person, or to credit an amount to them. An online employer who makes a payment to an employee outside the normal payroll cycle would be required to provide the relevant employment income information within two days of the out-of-cycl e payda y. 11 Current section Proposed changes Section RD 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that employers who withhold less than $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT have until the 20th of the following month to file their employment information. The changes proposed in clause 148 replace existing section RD 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007 with a section which provides an obligation to return PAYE information as set out under sections 23E to 23H of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 36A(2B) exempts employers who have withheld less than $100,000 of PAYE and ESCT in the preceding tax year from the requirement to file PAYE information electronically. Clause 228 proposes that section 36A is repealed. Section 36D requires an employer who is not required to file electronically and who has not chosen to do so, to file on a prescribed form. Clause 233 proposes to repeal this section. The threshold employer group is defined in proposed new section 23F and comprises employers below a threshold of PAYE and ESCT withheld in the previous year and who do not use payroll software. The proposed threshold employer group recognises that some small employers do not use payroll software or other digital systems. These employers nevertheless calculate PAYE information on a payda y basis; they need to do so to withhold appropriately. The threshold employer group requires employers below the filing threshold who do not use payroll software, to file employment income information on a payday basis but permits them to file on a prescribed paper form. The due date, of seven working days after payday, allows time to post the information to the Commissioner. A definition of “payroll software” is proposed in new section 23O as a commercially available computer application or service which enables the calculation of salary and wages and the computation of PAYE. The definition also includes a bespoke equivalent of a commercial offering. Section 23F(4) proposes that the threshold be set at $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT, and section 23F(6) provides that the threshold may be amended by Order in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. The proposed threshold reduction reflects greater use of digital services than in 1999 when the threshold was first introduced. Before making any recommendation to change the threshold the Minister of Revenue must, under proposed section 23F(6), undertake appropriate consultation. Section 36B provides that the Commissioner may authorise an employer above the electronic filing threshold to furnish the information in a non-electronic format if the employer’s accounting system is incapable of providing the information in the prescribed electronic format. In considering whether to allow an employer above the electronic filing threshold to provide an employer monthly schedule in a non-electronic format section 36B requires the Commissioner to have regard to whether the employer employs 50 or fewer employees. Clause 230 proposes to repeal section 36B. The Bill proposes that employers which are unable to access suitable digital services may be exempted by the Commissioner from the requirement to file electronically. Proposed new section 23G provides that exempt employers may file employment income information in a prescribed non-electronic (paper) format and that employment income information from this group must be delivered to the Commissioner within seven working days after payda y. When deciding whether to exempt an employer the Commissioner must have regard to whether the employer can access appropriate digital services and consider the compliance costs that would be incurred by the employer in meeting the online requirements. An employer who does not have a digital payroll system can meet the requirements for the online group in proposed section 23E by filing electronically through myIR. In this context it is not considered appropriate in deciding a case for an exemption to have regard to whether an employer’s accounting system is capable of providing the information. Because the electronic filing threshold is calculated on the basis of PAYE and ESCT withheld it exempts micro employers from electronic filing. Proposed new section 23G therefore focuses on the reasons why electronic filing may not be a reasonable expectation rather than on the numbers employed. 12 Current section Proposed changes Section 36A(2B) provides that a new employer is not required to file an employer monthly schedule or a PAYE Income payment form electronically in relation to the months of the year in which the total amount of tax withheld remained under the threshold. As noted above clause 228 proposes the repeal of section 36A. Notwithstanding the requirements in section 36A(2B), section 36CA provides that a new employee who is required to file electronically may furnish an employer monthly schedule on a paper form for the first six months of business. Clause 233 proposes the repeal of this section. The new group of employers allows employers which start employing and which cross the electronic filing threshold a period of time in which to establish electronic filing systems. Proposed new section 23H provides that new employers who cross the electronic filing threshold within a tax year may choose, for the first six months they employ employees, to deliver their employment information in a non-electronic format, within seven days after payda y. The proposed provision differs from existing section 36CA, which allows a new employer over the electronic filing threshold six months to begin electronic filing from the date on which “the employer begins business”. The commencement of employment is considered more relevant than the commencement of business. This provision may also apply to employers that are not businesses. If new employers choose to use payroll software during the first six months the section proposes that they are immediately included in the online employer group and must provide their employment information within two days of payday. At the end of the six-month new-employer period, new employers, provided they are over the threshold, are included in the online group. Employment income information from new employers using a payroll intermediary will be required to be delivered electronically because of the proposal in section 23D(2), that all payroll intermediaries are included in the online group. Section RD 4(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires an employee whose employer has not withheld an amount of tax from a PAYE income payment, to pay the amount of tax and provide an employer monthly schedule to the Commissioner by the 20th of the following month. Section RD 21(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that if an amount of tax is not withheld the employee must provide an employer monthly schedule with the details and pay the deficiency. Despite the introduction of payday reporting it is proposed that employees who have an obligation to provide employment income information only have to provide it on a monthly basis within seven days of the end of the month. This recognises that such employees are not employers in the normal sense and are unlikely to have payroll software systems. The obligation applies to employees whose employers have not withheld tax from a PAYE income payment and includes taxpayers whose employers are not obliged to withhold PAYE and other deductions. The group includes private domestic workers and the employees of foreign embassies. Proposed new section 23I provides that employees, who have an obligation to provide employment income information, must deliver the information to the Commissioner within seven working days of the end of the month in which the PAYE income was paid. Clauses 130 and 147 propose to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 as a consequence of the restructuring of the provisions imposing obligations on an employee. For more detail, see the subsequent section on employment income information and threshold amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. Commentary on proposed section 23J is included in the separate section on consequential changes to employer reporting of emplo yee share scheme benefit information. 13 Employment income information for new and departing employees At present when an employee starts a new job they are generally required to fill in two paper forms for Inland Revenue. The forms include a substantial amount of repetition and often overlap with information the employer collects for its own purposes. The KiwiSaver enrolment form requires an employee’s contact details. New section 23K proposes to modernise the requirements for setting up new employees with Inland Revenue. Once Inland Revenue’s business transformat ion is complete, sending employee details to the department before a new employee is first paid is intended to enable Inland Revenue to automatically check the IRD number and proposed tax code and communicate back in near-real time if changes are necessary or if there are other deductions, such as for child support, to be made. Near real-time checking of employee details before the employee is first paid will minimise the need to subsequently correct errors such as tax codes and deductions. While Inland Revenue will encourage employers to provide “new emplo yee” information before the emplo yee is first paid this will not be a requirement. Similarly, if an employer could provide earlier advice to the Commissioner when an employee ceases their emplo yment, it will assist the Commissioner to provide correct advice to a new employer about the correct tax code and will enable Inland Revenue to delink the employer and employee so that the previous employer does not continue to be contacted about that employee. Earlier advice of an emplo yee’s commencement and cessation dates will also improve the quality of information-sharing with the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation. In addition to information that is currently required, the Bill proposes that the emplo yer will be required to provide a new employee’s date of birth and contact details to Inland Revenue to help verify the employee’s identity, and maintain contact with individuals. If date of birth information is provided it should decrease the requirement for contact between Inland Revenue, the employer and employee, to resolve problems that arise when an employee uses a variation of the name used to obtain the IRD (tax file) number or wrongly transcribes their number. As a consequence, it should reduce recourse to the “no notification” withholding rate of 45c in the dollar, which is used when an employee’s identity cannot be confirmed. To limit compliance costs emplo yers will not be required to sight verification of the date of birth information provided by an employee, and the obligation to provide the information will only apply when date of birth information is supplied by the employee. All new employees eligible for enrolment in KiwiSaver and existing employees, who choose to enrol, are required to advise their employer of their address, tax file number and whether they are a KiwiSaver member. The Bill proposes to generalise the requirement for contact details so that employers are required to provide the information to Inland Revenue for all new employees. The information will be used by Inland Revenue to maintain contact with individuals. 14 The proposed changes to employee information are also intended to simplify the requirements for setting up new employees. Rather than fill out multiple paper forms including a tax code declaration and a KiwiSaver deduction notice, with often overlapping requirements, proposed new section 23K and schedule 4, table 2 will enable a new employee to provide the information required by Inland Revenue directly into an electronic form in the employer’s software system. The required information can then be sent to Inland Revenue by the employer directly from the system, either at the time it is first added, or with the first return of employment inco me informat ion that includes the new employee. For those still using paper it is intended that there will be a single paper form. 15 Current section Proposed changes The employer monthly schedule definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires an employee’s commencement date to be included in the month the employee started and their cessation date in the month in which their employment ended, as noted earlier it is proposed to repeal these definitions. Section 24B(3) requires an employee including a new employee, to provide their employer with a tax code notification. The prescribed tax code notification form states that if the name, tax code and tax file number are not provided the employee will be on the no-notification (45%) tax code. The name, tax file number and tax code are included in the definition of the employer monthly schedule in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For further commentary on the replacement provisions see the subsequent commentary on tax codes. Section 22 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 requires every new employee to give notice to their employer of name, address and tax file number and whether they are already a KiwiSaver member. If they are a member they are required to provide further information about their KiwiSaver status (deduction rate, contribution holiday or non-deduction status). Clause 288 proposes to amend this section. Section RD 3(2) to (4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide how a shareholder employee in a closely held company may treat PAYE income payments. Section 46(7) includes in the definition of employees for the purposes of section 46 (Employers to make returns as to employees), any person who receives a payment which would but for section RD 3(2) to (4) of the Income Tax Act 2007, be a PAYE income payment. Clause 236 proposes that this subsection is repealed as part of the general repeal of section 46. New section 23K proposes that if an employer choses to they may provide early advice of a new employee (subsection (3)) or departing employee (subsection (4)). To enable an employer to provide early advice to Inland Revenue of a new or departing employee it is proposed to separate out the information required each payday (schedule 4, table 1) from that required if stand-alone advice of a new employee (schedule 4, table 2) or ceased employee (schedule 4, table 3) is given. The requirement proposed in section 23K is, however, that the information be included with the first or last payday return of employment income information relating to that employee. In addition to the information required to identify the employer it is proposed in schedule 4, table 2 that employers provide to Inland Revenue a new employee’s: • name • contact details • date of birth if supplied • commencement date • tax file number if supplied • tax code as supplied • KiwiSaver status under section 22 of the KiwiSaver Act. For a departing employee it is proposed in schedule 4, table 3 that the following information is required: • name • cessation date • tax file number. Under section 23K(5) it is proposed, for the avoidance of repetition, that if the new or ceased employee information is provided electronically, along with payday income information, only the additional information is required (that is, no requirement to repeat the name, tax code and tax file number that are already included in the return). Clauses 288 and 290 propose to replace the requirement on a new employee or on an employee opting in, to give the employer a KiwiSaver deduction notice with a requirement to advise the employer of the employee’s KiwiSaver status or of a desired change in status. It is envisaged that this advice could be entered directly into the employer’s software system or on a prescribed paper form. Section 23K(6) proposes a remedial change to the section 46(7) by narrowing the scope of the reporting obligation. Section 23K(6) proposes that the only requirement on employers of shareholder employees, which are not subject to withholding, is to provide information about commencement and cessation dates. 16 When an employer ceases to employ and ability to correct errors in employment income information New section 23L proposes a requirement to notify Inland Revenue when an employer ceases to employ staff. Compared with annual tax processes such as filing an IR 3 or company business tax returns, PAYE and related withholding processes are characterised by high volumes of data and short turnaround times. The process for error correction and adjustment should have low compliance and administrative costs, and must be fair to emplo yees. New section 23M proposes that the manner in which errors can be corrected will be set out in regulations and that the Minister of Revenue, before recommending the content of the regulation, must consult appropriately. Early consultation work is currently under way. Current section Proposed changes Section RD 22(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires an employer whose business has ended to notify Inland Revenue by the 15th day of the second month following the month in which business is ended. Clause 148 proposes to replace section RD 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007; the replacement section does not include this requirement. For obligations relating to employment income information, it is status as an employer, not as a business, that is relevant. It is therefore proposed to replace the obligation on employers to notify Inland Revenue when business ends with a requirement to notify when they permanently cease to employ, which will include when a business ends. Notification will eliminate the possibility of an employer being penalised for failure to file employment income information. New section 23L proposes to require an employer, who intends to permanently cease to employ, to notify Inland Revenue within 30 working days of the date on which they ceased to employ any staff. 17 Current section Proposed changes The only specific legislative provision relating to the amendment of PAYE information is in section 15L, which provides that a payroll intermediary may make amendments to a monthly schedule and is then responsible for the accuracy of the amendment. It is proposed to update this section by replacing the reference to the “employer monthly schedule” with “employment income information”. Inland Revenue’s published guidance requires employers to amend already filed PAYE information by correcting the previously filed information. Employers can do this by submitting an amendment form, which requires the previously filed details and the corrected information or, if it is straightforward, an employer can phone the information in. This information then has to be manually entered into the record by Inland Revenue staff. Inland Revenue also accepts the practice whereby employers make changes to past periods in the current period, provided none of the items on the employer monthly schedule become negative. Payroll intermediaries can file an automated employer monthly schedule amendment. Compared with annual tax processes, such as filing an IR 3 or company business tax return, PAYE and related withholding processes are characterised by high volumes of data and short turnaround times. Payday reporting of employment income information will shorten the turnaround time and reduce the time available to employers to correct employment income information before it is sent to Inland Revenue. In this context the process for error correction and adjustment must have low compliance and administrative costs and must provide materially accurate employee information. To balance the potentially competing requirements of employers, employees, software providers and the tax administration, the Bill proposes a regulation-making power in new section 23M and requires the Minister of Revenue to consult before making recommendation on the content of the regulations. The consultation will seek to understand the impact of the proposals on software providers, on employers’ compliance costs and on the accuracy of employee information. Proposed new section 23M provides that the manner in which PAYE and related errors can be corrected will be set out in regulation and that the Minister before recommending the content of regulations must consult appropriately. Early consultation work is currently underway and will inform more comprehensive consultation later this year. Setting electronic and non-electronic filing requirements New section 23N proposes to require the Commissioner to prescribe both electronic and non-electronic forms and means of delivery for employment income information. These requirements are intended to ensure that: • emplo yment inco me information can be automatically read and processed by Inland Revenue; • external parties, such as those using payroll software that communicates with Inland Revenue, can do so securely; and • customers using such software are able to have their identity verified. The Bill does not retain the current distinction between an information return (the employer monthly schedule) and a form to accompany payment (the PAYE income payment form). Payday reporting and faster processing should ensure that employment income information precedes or accompanies payment. The objective is to eliminate the requirement to repeat the summary information on both forms. During the implementation period the requirement for summary information is, however, likely to remain and it is also possible that a requirement may remain for certain classes of employers – for example, those who continue to submit paper 18 returns. The Bill therefore proposes that the Commissioner may require so me employment income information to accompany payment. Current section Proposed changes Section 36A requires the Commissioner to prescribe an electronic format for the employer monthly schedule and enables the Commissioner to prescribe an electronic format for the PAYE income payment form. Clause 228 proposes to repeal section 36A. The paper forms for these returns are prescribed under the Commissioner’s general power to prescribe forms in section 35. Section RD 22(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that an employer who withholds an amount of tax from a PAYE income payment must provide an employer monthly schedule and a PAYE income payment form in relation to the amount. Clause 148 proposes to replace this with a section that imposes an obligation to return PAYE information as set out under sections 23E to 23H of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Proposed new section 23N(1) requires the Commissioner to prescribe both electronic and non-electronic forms and means of communication and proposes that the Commissioner may set specifications for payroll software for use in the delivery of information. Section 23N(2) provides that to enable processing of a payment the Commissioner may notify employers that certain items of employment income information must accompany the payment. Definition of “payroll software” and variation of requirements The Bill proposes that employers below the electronic filing threshold who use payroll software and new employers who use payroll software become part of the online group. The Bill also provides that the Commissioner may set specifications for payroll software to be used in the delivery of employment income information. To support these provisions a definition of “payroll software” is provided in section 23O. Proposed new section 23P provides that the Commissioner can vary the requirements in subpart 3C and schedule 4. Current section Proposed changes Payroll software is not currently defined but the Commissioner does issue specifications to payroll software providers setting the required formats for prescribed electronic forms. Proposed new section 23O defines payroll software as a commercially available computer application or service or bespoke equivalent which enables the calculation of amounts of salary or wages and amounts that are required to be withheld under the PAYE rules. 19 Current section Proposed changes Section 24P provides that the Commissioner may vary the requirements set out in RD 22 of Income Tax Act 2007 (Returns for amounts of tax paid to the Commissioner); 24B (PAYE tax codes); 24H (When entitlement to use a tax code ends); 24I (PAYE tax code notification and certificate) and 24L (schedular notifications). Clause 207 proposes to repeal this section. Section 46(2) and (3) provide that the Commissioner may vary requirements relating to particulars of commencement or cessation of employment but no v ariation can impose a more onerous requirement on the employer than is imposed by the employer monthly schedule. Clause 236 proposes the repeal of section 46. The definition of an employer monthly schedule in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 inclu des other particulars as required by the Commissioner for a class of employers. As noted above, it is proposed to repeal this definition. It is proposed in new section 23P to provide the Commissioner with the power to vary the requirements in subpart 3C and schedule 4. The scope of the proposed power to vary is broadly analogous to the scope of the existing provision. The requirement that variations to requirements around commencement and cessation be no more onerous than those imposed by the employer monthly schedule has been omitted as the definition of the employer monthly schedule itself provides for “other particulars required by the Commissioner for a class of employers”. See the following commentary on tax codes in proposed new section 24 regarding the power to vary provisions relating to tax codes. 20 EMPLOYMENT INCOME INFORMATION AND THRESHOLD AMENDMENTS TO THE INCOME TAX ACT 2007 (Clauses 130, 147 and 148) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill has been drafted to consolidate the administrative requirements relating to PAYE in the Tax Administration Act 1994. This change and the proposed requirement for payday reporting of PAYE income require a number of changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. It is also proposed that the threshold for PAYE and other deductions to be paid twice monthly should be able to be changed by Order in Council. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019. Key features The changes proposed to the Income Tax Act 2007 are largely consequential on the introduction of payday reporting of employment income information. The obligation on an employee to provide information about their gross income and PAYE and other deductions, when their employer had not withheld, is currently included in both sections RD 4(2) and RD 21(1)(a). It is proposed to remove the requirement to provide information from section RD 4(2) and rely on an updated section RD 21(1)(a). Although there is currently no proposal to alter the threshold, the Bill also provides that the threshold above which employers are required to pay PAYE and other deductions twice monthly, currently set at $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT, should in future be able to be changed by Order in Council following appropriate consultation. The requirement for consultation is intended to ensure that the potential impact of any change, for example on cash flows and compliance costs, is appropriately considered. Detailed analysis All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. 21 Current section Proposed changes Section RD 4 sets out the requirements for once monthly and twice-monthly remittance of PAYE. Subsection (1) provides that employers must pay PAYE and other deductions twice monthly unless they are an employer to whom section RD 22(3) or (4) applies. This section defines the due dates for providing an employer monthly schedule and a PAYE income payment form. Section RD 4(2) establishes an employee’s liability to pay tax and provide information when an amount of PAYE is not withheld. Section RD 22 establishes an obligation on employers to provide an employer monthly schedule and PAYE income payment form. It also establishes the due dates for these returns. The general rule is that the PAYE income payment form must be provided twice monthly and the employer monthly schedule must be provided monthly by the 5th of the following month. Section RD 22(3) and (3B) create an exception for employers that withhold less than $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT. These employers are required to provide a PAYE income payment form and employer monthly schedule by the 20th of the following month. Section RD 22(4), requires new employers to file their employer monthly schedule and PAYE income payment form by the 20th of the following month until the amount of PAYE and ESCT withheld exceeds $500,000; they are then covered by the general rule. Section RD 22(5) and (7) set out how the threshold is to apply if an employer runs more than one business, or is a group of companies, a partnership or if they are persons in whom property has become vested or to whom control has passed. Section RD 22(6) requires an employer whose business has ended to notify the Commissioner by the 15th day of the second month following the month in which business is ended. Clause 130 proposes replacing section RD 4. Some of the changes proposed to section RD 4 are consequential to changes to section RD 22 (Returns for amounts of tax paid to Commissioner). However it is also proposed that the obligation in section RD 4(2) on an employee whose employer has not withheld to provide information to the Commissioner, should no longer be contained in that section. Section RD 21(1)(a) already sets out the obligations on an employee when tax has not been withheld. Clause 147 proposes replacing section RD 21(1)(a). The proposed replacement paragraph establishes an obligation on an employee whose employer has not withheld some or all of an amount of tax, to provide employment income information as set out in section 23I of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section RD 22 details the obligation on the employer to provide information returns for amounts of tax withheld from a PAYE income payment. The changes proposed in clause 148 replace RD 22 with a section which establishes an obligation on an employer who withholds tax under section RD 4 to return employment income information as set out under sections 23E to 23H of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These proposed sections require PAYE information to be provided on a payday rather than a monthly basis. Replacement section RD 22 does not include an equivalent of section RD 22(6) (When business ended) but proposed new section 23L of the Tax Administration Act 1994, requires an employer to notify the Commissioner if they cease to employ with the intention that it is a permanent cessation. Although employers will be able to choose to remit PAYE on a payday basis, the payment obligation in section RD 4 will remain as a once or twice-monthly obligation. Because the once or twice-monthly payment obligation can no longer be defined in terms of the payday information obligation, the proposed replacement section RD 4 includes the rules, previously in section RD 22, setting the $500,000 a year threshold for twice-monthly payment, the rules for new employers, and how the threshold is to be applied if the employer runs more than one business or is a person to whom control has become vested or passed. In addition, section RD 4(7) proposes that the threshold contained in subsection (2) for twice monthly payment may be amended by Order in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue following appropriate consultation. 22 TAX CODES (Clauses 139, 146, 203, 204, 207, 284(1)(c), 303, 305 and 306(2), and schedule 2) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes to clarify the circumstances in which the “no notification” deduction rate applies and to restructure the provisions relating to the use of tax codes more logically by placing much of the detail in schedule 5. Application date The amendments will generally come into force on 1 April 2019. Key features The Bill sets out the core requirements relating to tax codes in proposed subpart 3D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, placing the detail in new schedule 5, parts A to C. The intent is to restructure the existing provisions to improve clarity, and in some circumstances, such as the proposed obligation to notify an employer of a changed tax code in replacement section 24B, to make explicit what was previously implicit. Section 24B(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that the employee must notify their emplo yer of their tax code. Section 24B(3B) of the same Act provides that if an employee does not provide the employer with a tax code notification and the Commissioner has not done so, they have a “no notification” tax code. The no notification tax code results in tax being withheld at the rate of 45c in the dollar. The prescribed form for a tax code notification requires the employee to provide their name and tax file number, in addition to their tax code. The employee’s name and tax file number are critical to establishing their identity. It is now proposed that the implication of not providing a name or tax file number – being placed on the “no- notified” tax code – is spelled out in proposed new section 24E. The no notification tax code has now been renamed the “non-notified” tax code. Detailed analysis All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. 23 Current section Proposed changes Section 24B(1) and (2) provide that tax codes apply for the purposes of the PAYE rules and do not apply to extra pays; schedular payments or the payment of income-tested benefits. Clause 204 proposes to replace section 24B. Proposed section 24B defines a tax code for the purposes of the PAYE rules as: • a code set out in schedule 5, part A; • a tax code provided by the Commissioner; or • a non-notified tax code. Subsection (4) proposes that the basic tax rates for the tax codes are set out in the Income Tax Act 2007, schedule 2, part A. The section proposes that tax codes do not apply to extra pays or schedular payments, and that the amount of tax for income-tested benefits is set out in section RD 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section 24B(3) requires an employee to notify their employer of their tax code and lists the codes. Section 24I(4) requires that a tax code notification must include a statement of entitlement to work in New Zealand under the Immigration Act 2009. Clause 204 proposes to replace these sections. Replacement section 24C proposes that an employee must notify their employer of their applicable tax code, or of a change in tax code. The section refers to schedule 5, part A where the tax codes are listed. The section further proposes that the obligation to notify the employer of a tax code does not apply: • if the Commissioner has provided a tax code to the employer; or • to a non-resident seasonal worker for their first month of employment in New Zealand. Replacement section 24C also proposes that in providing a tax code notification an employee must state their entitlement to work for their employer under the Immigration Act 2009. Section 24F provides that an employee may apply for a special tax code to apply for a veteran’s pension, superannuati on or other employment income. Clause 204 proposes to replace section 24F. Replacement section 24D proposes that an employee may seek a special tax code from the Commissioner to apply in the same way as section 24F(1AB) currently provides. Schedule 5, part B proposes how the Commissioner may issue a special tax code and how the amount of tax is to be calculated. The definition of the “no notification” tax code in section 24B(3B) provides that it applies when the employee has not provided their employer with a tax code notification and the Commissioner has not provided the employer with a tax code or special tax code for the employee. Clause 204 proposes to replace section 24B. It is proposed to set out in replacement section 24E the circumstances in which a non-notified tax code will apply, as follows: • the employee has not notified their employer of their: – name; and – tax file number; and – tax code. • the Commissioner has not provided the employer with a tax code or change in tax code; and • the employee is not a non-resident seasonal employee during their first month of employment. The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 inserted a new section RD 10B into the Income Tax Act 2007 and amended section 24L to allow contractors who are subject to the schedular payment rules to elect their own withholding rate without having to apply for a special tax code. Proposed section 24F identifies how standard, payee and set rates for schedular tax payments apply and where they are set out. Proposed section 24G provides that a payee may apply to the Commissioner for a special tax rate. The detail is contained in proposed schedule 5, part C. The changes proposed to these sections are consequential on the re-organised tax code and tax rate provisions. 24 Current section Proposed changes Subsection 24B(3) contains a list of tax codes. Subsection 24B(4) provides how tax codes from another Act may be combined with the tax codes in section 24B(3). Section 24G provides the steps that the Commissioner may take when she considers an incorrect tax code is being used, and the consequent requirements on the employer. Section 24H provides when entitlement to use a tax code ends. Section 24I provides that an employee who wishes to have their amount of tax reduced may notify their employer of the applicable tax code. Clause 204 proposes to replace these sections. The proposed schedule 5, part A contains detailed provisions in relation to the application of general (not special) tax codes. As noted above, the intent is to improve clarity, not to amend the provisions. Part A proposes provisions relating to: • combining tax codes; • changes to tax codes and when changes to tax codes apply; • the steps the Commissioner may take if she considers that an incorrect tax code is being used, and the consequential requirements on the employer; • when entitlement to use a tax code ends; • a table of tax codes. Section 24F provides that the Commissioner may provide the employee with a special tax code certificate. If a special tax code is issued in respect of a veteran’s pension or superannuation the Commissioner must notify the responsible department. The section sets out what the special tax code may include how it should be calculated and the overriding nature of the special tax code certificate. Section 24F(6) provides that the Commissioner may cancel a special tax code at any time. Section 24E provides that a private domestic worker can apply to the Commissioner for a tax code. Section 24F(5B) prevents a non-resident seasonal worker from applying for a special tax code. Clause 204 proposes to replace sections 24E and 24F. The proposed schedule 5, part B contains detailed provisions relating special and particular tax codes. As with part A, the intent is to clarify rather than change the existing legislation. Part B includes provisions relating to: • the Commissioner’s ability to provide a special tax code; • what a special tax code may apply to, what it may require and how the Commissioner is to calculate it; • the requirement on the Commissioner to notify the relevant department if the code is issued in relation to superannuation or veteran’s pension income; • the overriding nature of a special tax code; • the Commissioner’s ability to cancel a special tax code; • tax codes for private domestic workers; and • tax codes for non-resident seasonal workers. Section 24P provides the Commissioner with the power to vary sections: 24B (PAYE tax codes); 24H (When entitlement to use a tax code ends); 24I (PAYE tax code notification and certificate) and 24L (schedular notifications). Clause 207 proposes to repeal section 24P. New section 24H proposes that the Commissioner can vary the requirements of section 24B and schedule 5, part A, clause 4. This new section is intended to carry over the Commissioner’s power to vary, as it relates to tax codes, from section 24P. 25 PENALTIES (Clauses 268, 269(1), (5) and (6), 270, 271, 272 and 275(2)) Summary of proposed amendments Because there are no mandatory changes proposed for the timing of PAYE and related deductions, the Bill does not change the penalty provisions around non-payment of PAYE and related deductions. The proposed requirement for employers to file employment income information on a payday basis will increase the number of times most emplo yers file informat io n relating to PAYE income payments. The Bill proposes, however, that late filing penalty and non-electronic filing penalties will remain monthly penalties. Regardless of how many times an employer fails to file electronically in a month, or has failed to file employment income information on time during a month, only one penalty will be imposed for non-electronic filing, and a maximum of one penalty will be imposed for late filing. The due date for paying the penalties is proposed as 30 days from the end of the month in which the information was due. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019. Key features It is proposed that the non-electronic filing penalty will remain a monthly penalty. Regardless of how often an employer fails to file electronically in a calendar month the maximum penalty will be $250 or $1 for each employee for whom information was returned in a format other than the prescribed electronic format. The late filing penalty under the proposals in the Bill will continue to be a penalty that is not imposed for a first instance of late filing. If an employer fails to meet the filing due date, the Commissioner must notify them that a further failure to file on time after receipt of the Commissioner’s notice will result in the imposition of a $250 penalty. The Bill proposes that the maximum late payment penalty that may be imposed on an employer is $250 a calendar month. The Bill also proposes that the shortfall penalty for not paying an employer monthly schedule amount is renamed as a penalty for unpaid amounts of employer withholding payments. The current monthly penalty and maxima for an employer who fails to withho ld PAYE from a non-resident contractor entitled to double tax relief, will remain. 26 Detailed analysis All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Current section Proposed changes Section139A(6) provides that if a taxpayer has filed their employer monthly schedule on time for the previous 12 months, the Commissioner must give notice that a further failure to file will result in a penalty. If the taxpayer has not filed on time for the previous 12 months, following a further failure to file on time the Commissioner must give notice to the taxpayer that the late filing penalty is payable. Clause 268 proposes to amend section 139A; the amendments include replacing subsection (6). Section 142(1A) provides that the due date for payment of a late filing penalty is the 5th of the month following the month in which a twice- monthly payer of PAYE is required to file their employer monthly schedule and the 20th of the following month for all other taxpayers. Clause 272(2) proposes to replace section 142(1A) New section 139A(6) proposes that the late filing penalty will remain one that is not imposed for a first instance of late filing of employment income information in a 12-month period. If the taxpayer has filed on time for the previous 12 months: a. After an initial failure to file employment income information on time the Commissioner must notify the taxpayer that a further to file on time will result in a penalty. b. After further failure to file on time, within 12 months of the first failure, the Commissioner must notify the taxpayer that the penalty is payable. It is proposed that the late filing penalty will remain a monthly penalty. The maximum penalty that could be imposed for a failure to file employment income on time is proposed as $250 a month regardless of the number of failures to file on time in that month. Clause 272(2) proposes to amend section 142(1A) so that the due date for the payment of a late filing penalty is 30 days after the end of the month in which the taxpayer is required to deliver their employment income information. Section 139AA provides that a non-electronic filing penalty may be imposed on an employer required to provide returns in a prescribed electronic format, who does not do so. The non-electronic filing penalty in subsection 139AA(4) is the greater of $250 or $1 for each employee employed during the month to which the employer monthly schedule relates. Clause 269 proposes to amend section 139AA; the amendments include replacing section 139AA(4). Section 142G provides that a non-electronic filing penalty is due on the 5th of the month following the month in which the employer was required to furnish an employer monthly schedule in a prescribed electronic format. Clause 275(2) proposes replacing section 142G. It is proposed to amend section 139AA to replace a reference to the requirement to file electronically with a reference to section 23E (the online group). Under proposed replacement section 139AA(4) the non-electronic filing penalty will remain a monthly penalty. Regardless of how often an employer fails to file electronically in a calendar month the maximum penalty will be $250 or $1 for each employee for whom information was returned in that month. The proposed replacement section 142G provides that the non-electronic filing penalty is due 30 days after the end of the month in which the information was due to be received in a prescribed electronic form or by means of the prescribed electronic communication. Section 141AA imposes a capped shortfall penalty for an employer who fails to withhold PAYE from a non- resident contractor, entitled to double tax relief. Clause 270 amends the references in section 141AA to the “employer monthly schedule” and “return period” so that the $250 per contractor per month penalty capped at a total of $1,000 per month remains. 27 Current section Proposed changes Section 141ED(1) provides that an employer is liable for a shortfall penalty if it: • returns an employer monthly schedule but fails to pay some, or all of the amount by the due date; • is given notice of the penalty by the Commissioner. Clause 271 proposes to replace this section. Clause 271 proposes to rename the penalty in section 141ED, for not paying an employer monthly schedule amount, as the employers’ withholding payment penalty. It is proposed that section 141ED be replaced with a section which clarifies the circumstances in which the penalty applies and replaces references to employer monthly schedule with employment income information. The proposed replacement section does not intend to change the operation of the penalty. 28 CONSEQUENTIAL CHANGES TO EMPLOYER REPORTING OF EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME BENEFIT INFORMATION (Clauses 13, 132, 136, 148, 172(19) and (41), 187(5), 200, 284(1)(b) and schedule 2) Summary of proposed amendments From 1 April 2017, employers will be required, under amendments made to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 by the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016, to disclose the value of share benefits employees receive under employee share schemes (and any tax they choose to withhold under the PAYE rules). This disclosure is to be captured on the employer monthly schedule as part of PAYE information reporting. To ensure that employers can meet their employee share scheme benefit information reporting obligations in the proposed new PAYE reporting environment, the Bill proposes to defer the recognition of benefits derived by an employee under an employee share scheme by 20 days from when the employee receives the benefit, with effect from 1 April 2019, in order to provide all employers with sufficient time to compile information to support the required disclosures and deduction of tax, if to be withheld. These measures do not change the date on which the value of the benefit is determined. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019. Key features Proposed amendments to section CE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will defer the date that an employee who receives a benefit under an employee share scheme is treated as deriving income in relation to the benefit by 20 days from the taxing point. This deferral will apply for all employees who receive benefits under an employee share scheme that their employer is required to report to Inland Revenue about as part of emplo yment inco me informat ion. A proposed amendment to section RD 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will mean that an employee share scheme benefit from which an employer has chosen to withhold tax under the PAYE rules will be treated as paid on the 20th day after the taxing point for the benefit received by the employee. Proposed replacement section RD 22(2) will require employers to provide employment income information in relation to employee share scheme benefits to Inland Revenue under proposed new sections 23E to 23H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as modified by section 23J of that Act. 29 Proposed new section 23J(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 specifies that the payday for an employee share scheme benefit is the 20th day after the taxing point for the benefit received by the employee. The payday is relevant for the purposes of determining the due date for the provision of employment income information to Inland Revenue for the various groups of employers described in proposed new sections 23E to 23H of that Act. Proposed new section 23J(2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 specifies that employers are not required to provide Inland Revenue with information on: • employee share scheme benefits received by former employees if they have not chosen to withhold tax from the benefit; or • benefits arising under tax-exempt, widely offered employee share schemes. Proposed section 23J(2)(b) and new schedule 4, table 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 specify the particulars in relation to employee share scheme benefits that must be provided to Inland Revenue by employers who are subject to the reporting requirements. Detailed analysis From 1 April 2017, employers will be required to disclose the value of share benefits employees receive under employee share schemes (and any tax they choose to withhold under the PAYE rules). This disclosure is to be captured on the employer monthly schedule as part of PAYE information reporting. Employers who have until the 20th of the following month to provide an employer monthly schedule for a given month to Inland Revenue, will be required to include information in relation to a benefit received (at any time during a month) by an employee under an employee share scheme in the employer monthly schedule they file for that month. This gives the employer a minimum of 20 days to compile information to support the required disclosures and deduction of tax, if to be withheld. “Large” employers are required to provide an employer monthly schedule for a given month to Inland Revenue by the 5th of the following month. This would not provide these employers with sufficient time to compile information to support the required disclosures and deduction of tax, if to be withheld, in relation to benefits received during the second half of the month by employees under an employee share scheme. Therefore, a special rule defers the recognition of benefits received by employees of “large” employers under an employee share scheme. The effect of this deferral rule is to provide “large” employers with the same minimum period of 20 days that other employers have to compile information to support the required disclosures and deduction of tax, if to be withheld. Changes to employer reporting of benefits derived by employees under employee share schemes (and any tax withheld) are necessary as a consequence of the proposed shift to reporting of employment income information on a payday basis from 1 April 2019. 30 To ensure that employers can meet their employee share scheme benefit information reporting obligations in the proposed new employment income information reporting environment, it is proposed to defer recognition of benefits derived by an employee under an employee share scheme by 20 days from when the employee receives the benefit, with effect from 1 April 2019. The proposed new deferral rule will apply in relation to all (rather than only “large”) employers who are required to report employee share scheme benefit information as part of employment income information on a payday basis. The rationale for widening the application of the deferral rule is that all employers (regardless of size) will require additional time to compile information to support the required disclosures and deduction of tax, if to be withheld. Requirements from 1 April 2017 Proposed changes Section CE 2 specifies when an employee derives a benefit under an employee share scheme. The combined effect of subsections (10) and (11) is to defer the timing of the derivation of income in relation to employee share scheme benefits received by employees of “large” employers (that is, those required to provide an employer monthly schedule for a given month to Inland Revenue by the 5th of the following month, and that are required to remit PAYE deductions on a twice-monthly basis) to the next “PAYE income payment form period” after the one in which they receive the benefit. Proposed amendments to section CE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will defer the date that an employee who receives a benefit under an employee share scheme is treated as deriving income in relation to the benefit by 20 days from when they receive the benefit. The proposed amendment names this 20th day after an employee receives a benefit the “ESS deferral date”. This deferral will apply for all employees who receive benefits under an employee share scheme that their employer is required to report to Inland Revenue about as part of employment income information. Section RD 6 specifies when a benefit under an employee share scheme from which an employer has chosen to withhold tax under the PAYE rules is treated as paid. In the case of “large” employers, the benefit is treated as paid on the first day of the “PAYE income payment form period” after the one in which they receive the benefit. In the case of other employers, the benefit is treated as paid on the date the benefit vests in the employee. The date on which the employee share scheme benefit is treated as paid will be the end date of the four-week period referred to in the extra pay tax rate calculation in section RD 17, which employers will use to calculate the amount of tax they must withhold from the benefit. It will also influence when the employer is required to pay the withheld tax to Inland Revenue by. A proposed amendment to section RD 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will mean that an employee share scheme benefit from which an employer has chosen to withhold tax under the PAYE rules will be treated as paid on the 20th day after the benefit is received by the employee. This will apply irrespective of the size of the employer. 31 Requirements from 1 April 2017 Proposed changes Section RD 7B enables an employer to elect to withhold tax from a benefit received by an employee or former employee under an employee share scheme. The section specifies that an employer makes such an election by calculating the amount of tax required to be withheld from the benefit and paying it to Inland Revenue, and by reporting the value of the benefit to Inland Revenue on their employer monthly schedule by the relevant due date. A proposed amendment to section RD 7B will replace the requirement to report the value of the benefit to Inland Revenue on their employer monthly schedule by the relevant due date with a requirement to include the value of the benefit in their employment income information under proposed new subpart 3C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, treating the 20th day after the employee received the benefit as the relevant payday. Section YA 1 defines the payment period for which an employer must provide a PAYE income payment form under section RD 22(2) as the “PAYE income payment form period”. The “PAYE income payment form period” definition is relevant for the deferral in the recognition of benefits under employee share schemes of “large” employers. For a given month, the first “PAYE income payment form period” runs from the 1st day to the 15th day of the month, and the second “PAYE income payment form period” will run from the 16th day to the end of the month. The Bill proposes to repeal the definition of “PAYE income payment form period” in section YA 1. The Bill proposes to insert a new defined term “ESS deferral date” into section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which refers to the definition of that term in proposed new section CE 2(9). 32 Requirements from 1 April 2017 Proposed changes The requirement for employers to report employee share scheme benefit information to Inland Revenue on their employer monthly schedule under the PAYE rules if they have elected to withhold tax from the benefit is supplemented by section 46 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 46 requires employers to file an employer monthly schedule containing particulars of the persons employed by them in a month and of all salaries, wages, and other emoluments received in that month by each person employed. Section 46(6B) specifies that “other emoluments” includes a benefit that an employee receives under an employee share scheme in relation to which the employer has not made an election under the PAYE rul es to withhold an amount of tax, except if the benefit was received by a former employee or the benefit arose under a tax- exempt, widely offered scheme. Section 46 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is proposed to be repealed. Proposed replacement section RD 22(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 will require employers to provide employment income information in relation to employee share scheme benefits to Inland Revenue under proposed new sections 23E to 23H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as modified by section 23J of that Act. Proposed replacement section RD 22(3) specifies that employers are not required to provide Inland Revenue with information on: • employee share scheme benefits received by former employees if they have not chosen to withhold tax from the benefit; or • benefits arising under tax-exempt, widely offered employee share schemes. Proposed new section 23J(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 specifies that the payday for an employee share scheme benefit, for the purposes of determining the due date for the provision of employment income information to Inland Revenue for the various groups of employers described in proposed new sections 23E to 23H of that Act, is the 20th day after the taxing point for the benefit received by the employee. Proposed new section 23J(2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 specifies that employers are not required to provide Inland Revenue with information on: • employee share scheme benefits received by former employees if they have not chosen to withhold tax from the benefit; or • benefits arising under tax-exempt, widely offered employee share schemes. Proposed new section 23J(2)(b) and proposed new schedule 4, table 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 specify the particulars in relation to employee share scheme benefits that must be provided to Inland Revenue by employers who are subject to the reporting requirements. The employee share scheme benefit-specific information that employers who are required to report employee share scheme benefit informati on for current employees is: • the value of the benefit to the employee; and • the amount of tax withheld from the benefit, if any. Employers who are required to report employee share scheme benefit information for former employees because they have chosen under the PAYE rules to withhold tax from the benefit, must report: • the employee’s name; • the employee’s IRD number, if known by the employer; • the value of the benefit; and • the amount of tax withheld from the benefit. 33 Example Under the proposed rules, if an employee received a benefit under an employee share scheme on 5 July 2019, they would be treated as deriving income in relation to the benefit on 25 July 2019. For the purposes of their employer’s obligation to provide information in relation to the benefit to Inland Revenue under the proposed new requirement for employers to report employment income information to Inland Revenue on a payday basis, 25 July 2019 would also be the relevant payday. This would mean that their employer would be required to report information about the value of the benefit received by the employee and any tax withheld in relation to the benefit by the 2nd working day after 25 July 2019 if they are an employer above the $50,000 per annum of PAYE and ESCT threshold, or by the 7th working day after 25 July 2019 if they are below the threshold. 25 July 2019 would also be the relevant date for determining the due date for the payment of tax withheld in relation to the benefit (assuming that the employer elected to withhold tax in relation to the benefit). In this example, the due date for paying the tax withheld to Inland Revenue would be 5 August 2019 if the employer was above the $500,000 per annum of PAYE and ESCT threshold, or 20 August 2019 if they are below the threshold. 34 EMPLOYMENT INCOME INFORMATION CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS Consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 Clauses 105 (section LB 1) 108 (section LB 8) 110 (section LD 4) 111 (section LD 5) 127 (section RC 3) 129(2) (section RD 2) 137 (section RD 8) 138(3) (section RD 10) 143 (section RD 13B) 145(2) and (3) (section RD 17) 149(1), (3) and (4) (section RD 23) 170 (section RP 14) 181(1), (2), (4), (5) and (7) (s chedule 2) These clauses propose amendments as a result of the new rules for employment income information and the replacement of the employer monthly schedule and in some cases the PAYE income payment form. 150 (section RD 24) 172(22) (section YA 1) These clauses propose to delete a reference to an exemption certificate and replace it with an exemption. Consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 Clauses 194, 195, 234 insert new headings 187(3), (23) and (24) (section 3) 192 (section 15L) 196 (section 22) 208 (section 24Q) 237 (section 47) 255 (section 80D) 257 (section 80KT) 267 (section 125) 277 (section 183A) 278 (section 183D) 279 (section 183F) These clauses propose to update references as a result of the new rules for employment income information and the replacement of the employer monthly schedule and the proposed changes to the structure of the Act. In some cases the changes reflect the proposed renaming of the “ penalty for not paying the employer monthly schedule amount” as the “employers’ withholding payment penalty”. Consequential amendments to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 Clauses 286 (section 4) 287 (section 17) 289 (section 23) 291 (section 42) 292 (section 60) 294(2) (section 64) 295 (section 73) 296 (section 93) 297 (section 97) 298 (section 98) 299 (section 98A) 300 (section 99) These clauses propose to update references as a result of the new rules for employment income information and the replacement of: • the employer monthly schedule and the PAYE income payment form; or • the obligation to provide a KiwiSaver deduction notice with an obligation to advise of KiwiSaver status or of a change in KiwiSaver status. 35 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS (Clause 282) Summary of proposed amendments The application date for the changes relating to payday filing of employment income information is 1 April 2019. Employers may however choose to adopt payday filing from 1 April 2018. The transitional period is from 1 April 2018 to 1 April 2019 but for information relating to PAYE income payments made in March 2019 the transit io nal period extends until 30 April 2019. Application date The transitional provisions will come into force on 1 April 2018. Key features Although the Bill proposes that the provisions relating to payday filing of employment income information are effective from 1 April 2019, it is proposed that employers, if they wish to take advantage of the new arrangements, can choose to file on a payday basis from 1 April 2018. Employers who choose to file on a payday basis will, however, not be subject to a late filing penalty unless they fail to meet the current filing dates for an employer monthly schedule relevant to them. The Bill also proposes to require early adopters of payday employment inco me information reporting to apply the proposed modifications to the employee share scheme rules early as well. Detailed analysis The transitional period for the provision of the information required on an employer mo nthly schedule or PAYE income payment form is proposed as 1 April 2018 to 1 April 2019. However under proposed section 227D(1) for information relating to PAYE income payments made in March 2019 the transitional period is proposed to extend until 30 April 2019. This is to allow employers who have not adopted payday reporting of employment income information prior to 1 April 2019 to provide information on PAYE income payments made in March 2019 in an employer monthly schedule filed during April 2019. Proposed new section 227D(2) contains an exception for employee share scheme benefits received between 16 March 2019 and 31 March 2019 by employees or former employees of employers who are required to remit PAYE deductions on a twice-monthly basis. These employers will be required to apply the proposed modifications to the employee share scheme rules described in 36 the preceding section of this Commentary, rather than being required to provide information about these benefits during May 2019 in an employer monthly schedule relating to the month of April 2019. New section 227C(2) proposes that despite the effective date for payday filing of employment income information being 1 April 2019, employers may choose to file on a payday basis from 1 April 2018. If an employer wishes to start filing on a payday basis during the 2018–19 year it is not necessary, that they start with the information relating to the first PAYE income payment made in April 2018. An employer could start to file employment income information on a payday basis in an appropriately prescribed manner at the beginning of any month during the 2018–19 year. Proposed new section 227C(3) and (4) propose that an employer who elects under proposed subsection (2) to adopt payday filing of employment income informat io n during the transitional period must apply the proposed modifications to the employee share scheme rules described in the preceding section of this Commentary for all employee share scheme benefits received by their employees or former employees on or after the day that is 20 days before they made the election. New section 227C(6) (b) proposes that an employer who chooses to file employment income information on a payday basis during the transitional period will not be subject to a late filing penalty unless they fail to meet the current filing dates of the 5th of the month for employers who have a twice-monthly payment obligation or the 20th of the month for all other employers. Section 227C(7) proposes that an employer who elects to provide employment income information on a payday basis before 1 April 2019 may not revert to providing the information on a monthly basis unless the Commissioner agrees to the change. 37 REPEALING THE SUBSIDY FOR LISTED PAYE INTERMEDIARIES (Clauses 129(1), 151(1), 167 , 168, 171 , 172(32), (42) and (64), 187(22) and (25), 188, 190, 191 , 193 , 280, 281 , 317 and 318) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes that the subsidy currently paid to listed PAYE intermediaries that undertake payroll obligations for small employers ceases on 1 April 2018. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2018. Transit ional provisio ns will ensure that listed PAYE intermediaries can claim and receive the subsidy for PAYE income payments made in periods up to but excluding 1 April 2018. Key features It is proposed that the payroll subsidy paid to listed PAYE intermediaries ceases. Relevant provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax (Payroll Subsidy) Regulations 2006 are being repealed or amended to abolish the legislative framework for the payment of the payroll subsidy. Employers can continue to transfer their PAYE and ESCT obligations to a PAYE intermediary, but the use of the intermediary’s services will no longer be subsidised. Background This subsidy is currently paid by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to listed PAYE intermediaries who assume PAYE obligations for employers who are only required to remit PAYE monthly. The subsidy is $2 per employee per PAYE income payment made in a period and is payable for up to five employees of the employer. The way many businesses manage their payroll and the payroll services available have changed since the subsidy was introduced in 2006. For example, a growing number of small employers make use of payroll software or digital services to manage their payroll and PAYE. There is a range of different payroll products and services available. The subsidy incentivises only one model of payroll services. Because only services provided by listed payroll intermediaries are subsidised, the payroll subsidy potentially distorts employers’ choices between different types of payroll products and services. The Government therefore proposes that the payroll subsidy is repealed. 38 INVESTMENT INCOME INFORMATION Background The key changes relate to the following: • obtaining more frequent and detailed information for interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions; • bringing forward the due date when PIEs are required to provide information to Inland Revenue; • encouraging the provision of IRD numbers; • increasing electronic filing; • improving the administration of RWT exempt-status (certificates of exemption); • removing some requirements to provide end-of-year withholding tax certificates; and • improving error correction. Application date Most of the proposed changes come into force on 1 April 2020, although some apply from 1 April 2018 and 1 April 2019. 39 DETAIL AND FREQUENCY OF INVESTMENT INCOME INFORMATION (Clauses 212, 239, 241, 246, 283 and 284(1)(d), and schedule 2) Summary of proposed amendments Several amendments are proposed to enable Inland Revenue to receive more frequent and detailed information from investment income payers on the amount of income taxpayers earn and the tax withheld on that income. The proposed changes are as follows: • Payers of interest (including interest subject to the approved issuer levy but limited to domestically issued debt), dividends and taxable Māori authorit y distribut ions are to provide investment income information to Inland Revenue by the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income was paid. • Payers of interest, dividends and taxable Māori authority distributions exempt fro m wit hho lding are to report investment income information yearly by 20 April, or monthly at the payer’s preference. • Mult i-rate PIEs are to report investors’ prescribed investor rates (PIRs) six- mo nthly. 1 • A transitional measure: payers of interest are to report the currently required year-end information by 15 May, rather than 31 May, until the above monthly reporting changes take effect. Application dates The first three amendments will come into force on 1 April 2020, however payers can apply the new rules voluntarily from 1 April 2019. The fourth amendment will apply from 1 April 2018 until 1 April 2019 (for payers who elect to apply the new rules early), or until 1 April 2020 for all other withholders. Key features Amendments are proposed to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to require payers of interest, dividends and taxable Māori authority distributions to provide investment income informat ion by the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income was paid, and for payers of income exempt from withholding to provide investment income information at year-end by 20 April. 1 Note, it is also proposed that multi-rate PIEs that are not superannuation schemes or retirement savings schemes provide their investment income information by 15 May rather than 31 May, see section in this Commentary on bringing forward due dates for provision of information by PIEs. 40 Investment income information includes: • the name, IRD number and contact details of the payer of investment income; • the customer’s name, contact details, IRD number and date of birth (if held); • the customer’s tax rate/PIR; • the amount and type of income paid; • the amount of tax withheld (if any) and the date it was withheld, as well as any imputation or Māori authority credits attached; and • for PIE funds, whether the fund the payer is invested in is a retirement savings scheme or not. This information will be required for all owners of an account, where the account has multiple owners and the income payer has information on the joint owners. An amendment is proposed to require payers of interest to report year-end informat io n by 15 May, rather than 30 May, until the monthly reporting changes take effect. It is also proposed that PIEs will report investors’ PIRs six-monthly. Background Currently, Inland Revenue does not receive sufficiently detailed or frequent information about the investment income that taxpayers earn and the tax withheld or paid on that income. If Inland Revenue received more frequent information, it would be able to ensure taxpayers’ tax and social policy obligations/entitlements were more accurate during the year. For example, if Inland Revenue knows how much investment income a taxpayer earns during the year, it will be able to ensure that social policy entitlements the taxpayer receives take the investment income into account, as the entitlement relates to the income the person receives. It will also be in a position to advise the taxpayer of the appropriate withholding rate to use, as well as pre-populate tax returns for the taxpayer at the end of the year. Taxpayers who have not paid the correct tax or received the correct social policy entitlements during the year will need to square up at the end of the year, resulting in a debt or refund. Often taxpayers are unaware of these obligations. This means Inland Revenue may pay out more in social policy entitlements than it otherwise should and taxpayers may pay less tax and social po licy obligations than they should. It is estimated that $21 to $27 million of income tax per annum is forgone due to interest income not being correctly returned as income. This would be identified if interest income were pre-populated into tax returns and personal tax statements. Further, in 2015, at least 185,000 individuals did not have their interest income taken into account for Working for Families purposes. 2 2 Refer to paragraph 78 of the RIS titled “Changes to the tax administration of investment income information”. 41 The proposed amendments focus on obtaining more detailed and frequent information on the investment income that taxpayers earn so Inland Revenue can pre-populate tax returns, proactively adjust tax rates and ensure taxpayers’ tax obligations and social policy entitlements and obligations are calculated more accurately during the year. Obtaining more frequent and detailed information on income that is exempt fro m withholding tax, subject to NRWT or subject to AIL is intended to allow Inland Revenue to determine whether the tax treatment applied is appropriate, and if it is not, to take that income into account in the person’s tax affairs. Requiring payers of interest to provide their year-end information by 15 May rather than 31 May until monthly reporting takes effect will give Inland Revenue sufficient time to pre-populate that information onto taxpayers’ tax returns and personal tax summaries. While interest subject to NRWT will not be pre-populated, given it relates to non-residents, it is st ill proposed to be required by 15 May for ease of compliance so that payers do not have to provide their interest information on two separate dates. Date of birth information is proposed to be required (when the payer holds that information) so that Inland Revenue can use it as a data verification point to help determine the IRD numbers of non-declared taxpayers or those whose IRD number does not appear to be correct. It is proposed that payers provide Inland Revenue with taxpayers’ tax rates and PIRs to better enable Inland Revenue to assess whether the relevant taxpayer is on the appropriate rate, based on the information that Inland Revenue holds about that individual, and to enable Inland Revenue to proactively correct the rate if they are not. Detailed analysis Proposed new subpart 3E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (clause 212 of the Bill, proposed new sections 25B to 25S) codifies the requirements regarding information that payers of investment income must provide to the Inland Revenue. The persons who are required to provide this investment income information are listed in section 25E. Each person covered in section 25E has a specific section in subpart 3E which outlines the information that must be provided by reference to proposed new schedule 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and when it must be provided. The following analysis outlines what each proposed new section does. This is followed by a comparative table, which outlines the current provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that relate to investment income information, and the changes that are proposed. Information on interest (proposed new section 25F in clause 212, clauses 239 and 241) The Bill proposes that a payer of interest (including interest subject to the approved issuer levy, but limited to domestically issued debt) must deliver investment income information to Inland Revenue in electronic form by the 20 th of the month following the month in which the amount of investment income was paid to the investor. 42 Like all of subpart 3E, this provision comes into force on 1 April 2020. To ensure that payers of interest are required to report the currently required year-end information by 15 May, rather than 31 May, clauses 239 and 241 amend sections 49 (NRWT withholding certificates and annual reconciliations) and 51 (RWT withholding reconciliation statements) respectively, to require this information to be filed by 15 May from 1 April 2018 until monthly filing co mes into effect on 1 April 2020. Information on dividends (proposed new section 25G) The Bill proposes that a payer of dividends must deliver investment income information to Inland Revenue in electronic form by the 20 th of the month following the month in which the dividend was paid to the investor. Information on royalties (proposed new section 25H) This provision provides that a person paying royalties to non-residents must provide investment inco me informat ion to Inland Revenue by 31 May after the end of the tax year. This is the same as currently required by section 49 – the provision has simply been moved as part of codifying the investment income information requirements. Information on Māori authority distributions (proposed new section 25I) The Bill proposes that a Māori authority that makes a taxable distribution to a member must provide invest ment inco me informat ion to Inland Revenue by the 20 th of the month following the month in which that distribution is paid to the member. Information on attributed PIE income (proposed new sections 25J and 25K, and clause 246) Proposed new sections 25J and 25K essentially reproduce what is currently required by section 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The only differences are: • Investment income information will be required by 15 May (rather than 31 May) for a mult i-rate PIE that is not a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme (see section on bringing forward due dates for provision of information by PIEs). • Six monthly reporting of PIRs will be required for all multi-rate PIEs (by 20 October for the first six months of the year, and with the year-end report for the final six months of the year). These sections apply from 1 April 2020. To ensure that year-end PIE information is provided by 15 May from 1 April 2018, clause 246 amends section 57B(7) to this effect from 1 April 2018, and repeals it from 1 April 2020. Information from emigrating companies (proposed new section 25L) This provision retains the three month timeframe provided for in sections 49 and 51 for an emigrating company to provide information to the Commissioner in relation to the dividend that the company is treated as paying to shareholders under section FL 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 43 Information in relation to persons with RWT-exempt status (proposed new section 25M) This provision requires payers of interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions to provide taxpayer-specific information to Inland Revenue in relation to payments made to persons with RWT-exempt status (the new equivalent of a RWT exemption certificate) by 20 April following the end of the year or, if the payer prefers, the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income was paid. It replaces section 51(2A), which provides that the Commissioner may require taxpayer-specific information in relation to interest (including certain dividends) paid to a person holding an RWT exemption certificate. There are currently no information requirements in relation to dividends (other than dividends treated as interest or dividends from which a trustee or agent is required to withhold RWT) and Māori authority distributions paid to a person holding an RWT exemption certificate. Information from payers with no withholding obligations (proposed new section 25N) This provision reproduces section 52 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (see the table below); the section has simply been moved as part of codifying the investment income information requirements. Information on financial arrangements (proposed new section 25O) New section 25O requires a person with RWT-exempt status who acquires or disposes of a financial arrangement from/to another person to provide the Commissioner with detailed information regarding the acquisition or disposal of that financial arrangement with their return of income for the year. This provisio n reproduces section 53 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Investment income information: variation of requirements (proposed new section 25S) This provision allows the Commissioner to vary the requirements set out in new proposed subpart 3E and apply those requirements as varied. It replaces sections 51(6) and 49(5) which allow the Commissioner to vary the information requirements relating to interest subject to RWT, and income subject to NRWT. Transitional provision: application of investment income information provisions (proposed new section 227E, clause 283) New section 227E allows payers of investment income to voluntarily apply the provisio ns relating to the delivery of investment income information and the correction of errors under the new proposed subpart 3E from 1 April 2019, before the provisions become compulsory from 1 April 2020. 44 Changes at a glance Current section Proposed change Section 49 – This section requires payers of non-resident passive income to provide investment income information to Inland Revenue by 31 May. Investment income information relating to interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions subject to NRWT will now be required by the 20 th of the following month per proposed new sections 25F, 25G and 25I. Information regarding royalties paid to non- residents will continue to be required by 31 May following the end of the tax year per proposed new section 25H. The definition of “reconciliation statement” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will also be removed given the proposed repeal of section 49. Section 49(4) and (4C) – This section provides that a payer who ceases to carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand must provide the information required by section 49 (relating to income subject to NRWT) to Inland Revenue before 40 working days after the end of the month in which the taxable activity ceases. This information will now be required by the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income was paid to align it with the general rule regarding the provision of investment income information. This also aligns with when payment of the NRWT is currently required when a taxable activity ends (section RA 16). As such, this specific provision is not contained in the new legislation. Section 49(4B) and (4C) – This section provides that when an emigrating company is treated as paying a dividend, it must provide the investment income information required by section 49 to the Commissioner before three months after the time of emigration. This information will continue to be required by three months after the time of emigration per proposed new section 25L. This aligns with when the payment of NRWT is currently required for emigrating companies (section RA 18). Section 49(5) – This section allows the Commissioner to vary the requirements of section 49 and apply the requirements as varied. This is now contained in proposed new section 25S. Section 50 – This section requires a payer of resident passive income to provide Inland Revenue with summary information to accompany the payment of RWT relating to interest and dividends. Summary information will no longer be required to accompany a payment of RWT. Instead, per proposed new sections 25F (interest) and 25G (dividends), detailed investment income information will be required to accompany the payment – which is the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income is paid to the investor. Section 51 – This section requires payers of interest (including certain dividends) subject to RWT to provide investment income information to Inland Revenue by 31 May following the end of the year (note that the 31 May date was inadvertently removed from the section as a result of an amendment in 2006, but continues to apply in practice). Detailed year-end information for interest will no longer be required. Instead, detailed information will be required monthly, as outlined above. Section 51(2A) – This section provides that the Commissioner may request investment income information from a payer who pays interest to a recipient holding an RWT exemption certificate. Proposed new section 25M provides that payers of interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions must provide taxpayer specific information to Inland Revenue in relation to payments made to persons with RWT-exempt status by 20 April following the end of the tax year, or at the payer’s preference, the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income was paid. 45 Current section Proposed change Section 51(3) – This section provides the due date for information where the Commissioner has requested this information. This provision is no longer required given detailed information will be required by the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income is paid. Section 51(4) and (5C) – This section provides that a person who ceases to carry on a taxable activity or business in New Zealand must provide the information required by section 51 (interest subject to RWT) before 40 working days after the end of the month in which the business/taxable activity ceases. This information will now be required by the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income was paid to align it with the general rule regarding the provision of investment income information. This also aligns with when payment of the RWT is currently required when a taxable activity ends (section RA 16). As such, this specific provision is not contained in the new legislation. Section 51(5) and (5C) – Under section RE 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007, a person has an ob ligation to withhold RWT from interest if the payment is made as part of carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand. In order to ensure a withholding obligation applies to exempt persons such as charities or entities carrying on financial services (which do not constitute a taxable activity) that pay interest, section RE 4(3) states that a person holding an RWT exemption certificate also has a withholding obligation. Sections 51(5) and (5C) provide that where a person ceases to hold an RWT exemption certificate (and is not required to withhold RWT by virtue of making payments in the course of a taxable activity in New Zealand), they must provide the information required by section 51 before 40 working days after the end of the month in which they ceased to hold the RWT exemption certificate. This information will now be required by the 20 th of the month following the month in which the income was paid, as explained above. This also aligns with when the payment of RWT is currently required when an RWT exemption certificate expires (section RA 17). Section 51(5B) and (5C) – This section provides that when an emigrating company is treated as paying a dividend (previously companies could migrate without paying tax on all income earned in New Zealand, section FL 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 deems a liquidation and dividend to shareholders to ensure tax is paid) it must provide the information required by section 51 before three months after the time of emigration. This information will continue to be required within three months after the time of emigration as proposed in new section 25L. This is consistent with when the payment of RWT is currently required for emigrating companies (section RA 18). Section 51(6) – This section provides that the Commissioner may vary the requirements of section 51 in relation to any person and apply the requirements as varied. This is now contained in proposed new section 25S. Section 51(7) – This section states that a dividend paid by an RWT proxy is treated as interest for the purposes of section 51. This provision will no longer be necessary as the proposed information requirements for interest and dividends will be the same. 46 Current section Proposed change Section 52 – This section provides that a payer of interest who is not required to withhold RWT because the payment of interest was not made in the course of a taxable activity or was less than the minimum threshold of $5,000 for the tax year must provide investment income information to the Commissioner with their return of income for the year when the interest is allowed as a deduction. This provision is now contained in section 25N. Section 53 – This section requires a person with RWT-exempt status who acquires or disposes of a financial arrangement from/to another person to provide the Commissioner with detailed information regarding the acquisition or disposal of that financial arrangement with their return of income for the year. This provision is now contained in proposed section 25O. Section 54 – This section allows the Commissioner to request from a payer taxpayer-specific information relating to recipients of resident passive income. This provision will no longer be needed as payers of resident passive income will be required to provide this information to the Commissioner. Section 57B – This section sets out the return requirements for multi-rate PIEs, although it is different from the other sections discussed in this Commentary as it covers payment of the tax as well as providing the information. Section 57B(7), which relates to providing information and not to payment of the tax, has been moved to proposed sections 25J and 25K. Section 67 – This section provides that an ICA company which declares a dividend must provide information regarding that dividend to the CIR with the return of income for the year. This information must now be provided on the 20 th of the month following the month in which the dividend is paid, per proposed new section 25G. Section 68B – this section requires a Māori authority to provide Inland Revenue with summary information regarding any Māori authority distributions paid with the return of income for the year. This is now covered by proposed new section 25I. 47 BRINGING FORWARD DUE DATES FOR PROVISION OF INFORMATION BY PIES (Clauses 212, 246 and 284(1)(d), and schedule 2) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are proposed to enable Inland Revenue to receive detailed information earlier from multi-rate PIEs that are not superannuation funds or retirement schemes by 15 May, 3 rather than 31 May, following the end of the income year. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2018. Key features Proposed new subpart 3E (clause 212 of the Bill) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, along with current section 57B, codifies the information requirements for multi-rate PIEs. Proposed section 25J provides that the detailed year-end information to be provided by PIEs that are not superannuation funds or retirement savings schemes is to be provided by 15 May after the end of the tax year. The information required is set out in proposed new schedule 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Proposed section 25J will come into force on 1 April 2020. Clause 246 amends section 57B(7) to require the detailed year end information by 15 May (applying from 1 April 2018) and then repeals section 57B(7) from 1 April 2020. The table below outlines the provisions of these sections and highlights the changes that are proposed. Changes at a glance Current section Proposed change Section 57B (7)(a) – requires a multi-rate PIE , that has a corresponding income year that does not end after the end of the tax year and is not a superannuation fund or a retirement savings scheme, to provide Inland Revenue with detailed recipient information for the year by 31 May after the end of the tax year. Multi-rate PIEs (that have a corresponding income year that does not end after the end of the tax year and are not a superannuation fund or a retirement savings scheme) will be required to report detailed recipient information for the year to Inland Revenue by 15 May after the end of the tax year. 3 The information will still be due by the end of the second month after that in which the PIE’s corresponding income year ends, if the PIE has a corresponding income year that ends after the end of the tax year or by the end of the third month after that in which the PIE loses PIE status, if the cessation occurs in the corresponding income year. 48 Background Currently, Inland Revenue receives detailed PIE income information for multi-rate PIEs (other than superannuation funds and retirement savings schemes) by 31 May following the end of the income year. While the PIE tax in respect of this PIE income is treated as a final tax (unless the prescribed investor rate chosen is too low) the income from these PIEs does need to be taken into account for social policy income calculations. Receiving the information on or around 31 May is too late to associate the PIE income with recipients’ other income records held by Inland Revenue as part of the personal tax summary process. By bringing the due date forward to 15 May the PIE information will be able to be associated with recipients’ employment income, which will give Inland Revenue a better understanding of recipients’ overall income position and will help enable Inland Revenue to ensure taxpayers’ tax and social policy obligations/entitlements are correctly calculated. It will also help Inland Revenue to ensure that PIE investors are selecting the correct PIR for the following year. 49 MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE PROVISION OF IRD NUMBERS (Clauses 81, 85, 180 and 215) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are proposed to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to encourage taxpayers to provide their IRD numbers to payers of investment income. The use of IRD numbers improves the overall administration of the tax system as it ensures Inland Revenue can attribute income to the taxpayer. In order to encourage taxpayers earning interest income to provide their IRD numbers, the non-declaration rate (the rate that applies when a taxpayer has not provided their IRD number) will increase from 33% to 45%. For PIE income, investors opening new investments in multi-rate PIEs will be required to provide their IRD number to the PIE in order to remain a member of the PIE. Application date The changes to the non-declaration rate for interest income will come into force on 1 April 2020. The requirement for new investors in a PIE to provide their IRD numbers in order to stay invested in the PIE will come into force on 1 April 2018. Key features Non-declaration rate Clause 180 increases the non-declaration rate that applies to taxpayers (including non- natural persons) who do not provide their IRD number to payers of interest income from 33% to 45%. PIE funds Deemed exit Clause 215 (section 28B) requires an investor in a multi-rate PIE to notify the PIE of their tax file number within six weeks of becoming an investor in the PIE. Clause 85 (section HM 62) requires multi-rate PIE funds to close a member’s account and refund their investment if they have not provided their IRD number to the PIE within six weeks of opening their account. Tax effects of deemed exit Clause 81 (section HM 4) provides that an investor who has not provided their IRD number to the multi-rate PIE within six weeks of becoming a member is treated as reaching the exit level. This requires the PIE to calculate its tax liability in relation to the exiting investor, under sections HM 42 and HM 47 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 50 Clause 85 (section HM 62) amends section HM 62 of the Income Tax Act to update the definition of exit level to include where an investor has failed to provide their IRD number to the PIE within six weeks of becoming an investor. Background Inland Revenue has difficulty attributing income to a taxpayer if it does not have the taxpayer’s IRD number. Around 20 percent of the interest certificates received by Inland Revenue do not contain the recipient’s IRD number. In relation to PIE income, 2 percent of investors have not provided their IRD number to their PIE fund. Currently, taxpayers are not incentivised to provide their IRD number to Inland Revenue as the non-declaration rate may be too low. The non-declaration rate is 33% for interest income and 28% for PIE income, which equates to the top marginal tax rate for the respective income types. As a result, these rates do not incentivise taxpayers on the top marginal tax rate to provide their IRD number. Further, taxpayers with social policy entitlements or obligations may have much higher effective tax rates (taking into account abatement of entitlements or additional obligations) and may realise that by not providing their IRD number, it is unlikely that their investment income will be taken into account when social policy entitlements/obligations are calculated. This may mean they receive more social assistance or pay less in child support and student loan repayments than they should. No changes are proposed to encourage provision of IRD numbers in relation to dividends and Māori authority distributions due to capability concerns, and because Inland Revenue is unable to determine the extent of the non-declaration problem in relation to these types of income until after Inland Revenue begins to receive detailed recipient information. This makes it very difficult to make a satisfactory analysis of the compliance cost versus the benefit at this stage. Example Laura is a single mother with sole custody of her two children. She earns $50,000 a year and has a student loan. She invested some money from an inheritance which returns her $5,000 income a year. She has not provided her IRD number to her investment income payer. As a result, Laura would receive $1,352 per year more in Working for Families than otherwise entitled, and pay $600 less off her student loan per year than otherwise required, if she did not return this income. Aim of proposed changes The proposed changes should encourage people to provide their IRD numbers so that income is allocated to the relevant taxpayer, ensuring the taxpayer pays the right amount of tax, and receives the correct amount in social policy entitlements, and pays the correct amount in social policy obligations. Having one non-declaration rate for all New Zealand-resident recipients of interest income is easier to understand for taxpayers and may reduce the compliance burden for payers of investment income. 51 The level of non-declaration experienced by PIEs is much lower than the level of non- declaration for interest. As such the IRD number requirement suggested during consultation has been proposed rather than proposing a higher non-declaration rate for PIEs. Consultation highlighted numerous problems with imposing a 45% non-declaration rate for PIEs, such as the unfairness of applying it to retirement savings (which are not taken into account for social policy purposes) and whether the savings would be returned to the taxpayer’s retirement account once the overpaid PIE tax was subsequently recovered. The potential for investors subject to the non-declaration rate receiving PIE losses cashed out at 45% was also concerning. 52 ENCOURAGING ELECTRONIC FILING (Clauses 212, 269 and 275) Summary of proposed amendments An amendment is proposed to require all investment income payers to file their investment income information electronically, unless they receive an exemption fro m the Commissioner. An amendment is also proposed to the non-electronic filing penalty, to ensure it applies to payers who fail to provide their investment income information in a prescribed electronic form. Application date The amendment compelling payers to file electronically will come into force on 1 April 2020, but from 1 April 2019 for payers who voluntarily provide monthly information. The changes to the non-electronic filing penalty will come into force on 1 April 2020. Key features Payers of the following types of income will be required to provide their investment income information to Inland Revenue electronically: Type of income Proposed new section Interest 25F Dividends 25G, 25L (in relation to emigrating companies) Royalties paid to non-residents 25H Māori authority distributions 25I Attributed PIE income 25J and 25K 4 Income paid to persons with RWT exempt status 25M Interest with no withholding obligation that is allowed as a deduction 25N Financial arrangements 25O 4 Note that electronic filing is already a requirement in relation to PIE returns. 53 Proposed new section 25Q (clause 212) provides that the Commissioner may grant an exemption from electronic filing if the investment income payer would experience unreasonable compliance costs or other hardship as a result of the requirement to file digitally. In considering whether to exercise her discretion, the Commissioner must have regard to: • the capability of the investment income payer; • the nature and availability of suitable digital services; and • the compliance costs involved with complying. The Commissioner will publish guidelines on how the exemption will apply. Clause 269 amends the non-electronic filing penalty, so that it applies to payers who fail to provide their investment income information in a prescribed electronic format. Clause 275 provides that this penalty is due 30 days after the end of the month in which the payment of investment income was required to provide the information in the prescribed electronic form to the Commissioner. Background The majorit y o f current investment income returns are paper-based. For returns that are able to be filed electronically, there is no electronic filing threshold to require payers of a certain size to file electronically. Paper filing is slower, more expensive in terms of compliance costs for payers of investment income and administrative costs for Inland Revenue, and more prone to errors. This amendment is intended to ensure that everyone, other than those who are genuinely unable to access digital services, files electronically. This will not require payers to purchase software as payers will be able to enter the relevant details into an online form through MyIR. Having to apply to the Commissioner for an exemption may encourage people who may be able to file digitally, but would otherwise choose not to, to do so. 54 IMPROVING THE ADMINISTRATION OF RWT EXEMPT STATUS (Clauses 161, 163, 172(21), (51), 220 and 224) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are proposed that will change the terminology for RWT exemptions from a person “having an RWT exemption certificate” to “having RWT-exempt status” and will ensure that persons that have RWT-exempt status will be included in an electronic register maintained by Inland Revenue. Investors with RWT-exempt status will have to notify their investment provider of their status and payers of investment income will be able to confirm that investors have RWT-exempt status on the electronic register. Recipients of investment income that are exempt from tax under another Act will need to apply for RWT-exempt status and will then be included on the electronic register if they wish to continue to be treated as being exempt from RWT. The income would still be exempt income so if the recipient did have RWT deducted they could apply to Inland Revenue for a refund of the deducted RWT. This amendment is intended to make it easier for payers of investment income to determine whether the recipient has current RWT-exempt status. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2020. Key features Clauses 161, 163, 172, 220 and 224, which propose changes to sections RE 27, RE 29 and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and sections 32H and 32L of the Tax Administration Act 1994, codify the changes in respect of RWT-exempt status. A number of other clauses include changes to change the terminology from “RWT exemption certificate” to “RWT-exempt status” and have not been specifically covered in this Commentary. The table below outlines the provisions of these sections and highlights the changes that are proposed to the extent that the changes are more than just terminology changes from RWT exemption certificate to RWT-exempt status. 55 Changes at a glance Current section Proposed change Section RE 27 – sets out rules regarding applying for RWT exemption certificates, when a certificate expires and obliges the holder of a certificate if they become aware that they no longer meet the requirements to hold a certificate. Clause 161 (amending section RE 27) provides that a person who has RWT-exempt status must notify their investment provider of their status and of any change in their status. This means that investment providers will be prompted to confirm the persons RWT-exempt status on the electronic register to be provided by the Commissioner and then to treat the person as exempt from RWT. It also means that the person holding RWT-exempt status would have to inform their investment providers if their RWT-exempt status expired or was cancelled. Section RE 29 – sets out the ways available to a person to establish whether another person is a person holding an RWT exemption certificate. These include: • taking reasonable steps to determine whether the other person is a person section 32E(2)(a) to (h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994; or • having seen the other person’s RWT exemption certificate and taken reasonable steps to establish that they are the person named on the certificate. The section also sets out requirements about notices of cancellation published in the Gazette and several other requirements. Clause 163 (proposed section RE 29) provides that a person may establish whether another person has current RWT-exempt status by searching the electronic register provided by the Commissioner. This change simplifies the process for determining whether a person has RWT-exempt status and whether that status is current. Section YA 1 – definition of “exempt interest”. The definition of exempt interest in section YA 1 sets out a range of types of interest that are excluded from being resident passive income under section RE 2(3)(a). The definition includes interest that is exempt income under section CW 64 (Exemption under other Acts). Clause 172 (21) removes income that is exempt under other Acts from the definition of “exempt interest”. This means that recipients of investment income that are exempt under other Acts will need to apply for RWT-exempt status (which they are eligible for) in order to be treated as exempt from RWT. They will then be included on the electronic register discussed above. The income will still be exempt from income tax so even if the recipient did not apply for RWT- exempt status and RWT was deducted the RWT would be refundable. Section YA 1 Clause 172 (51) inserts a new definition of “RWT-exempt status”. The definition refers to the status applied for under section RE 27 by eligible persons. Section 32H – sets out the rules around providing exemption certificates and replacing lost or destroyed certificates. Clause 220 replaces existing section 32H and requires the Commissioner to add a person who meets the requirements and has applied for RWT- exempt status to the electronic register of persons with RWT-exempt status and to notify the person that they have been issued RWT-exempt status (and the start and end date as applicable). This obligation on the Commissioner to add successful applicants to the electronic register means that the register should be kept up to date and should be a reliable source of information for payers of investment income. 56 Current section Proposed change Section 32L – sets out the rules regarding the cancellation of RWT exemption certificates and includes a requirement to publish a list of cancellations in the Gazette. Clause 224 replaces existing section 32 L. It removes the requirement to publish a list of cancellations in the Gazette and instead requires the Commissioner to publish on the electronic register a list of persons whose RWT-exempt status has been revoked. It also provides that a person with an existing RWT certificate of exemption will be treated as having RWT-exempt status if their name appears on the electronic register of persons with RWT-exempt status. This allows persons with existing RWT exemption certificates to be transitioned on to the register and to have RWT-exempt status without having to go through the application process again. Background Currently, Inland Revenue issues certificates of exemption, and the holders of the certificates then provide copies of the certificates to their investment provider. These certificates can be cancelled on the basis that they have expired or been revoked. Information on the issues and cancellations of RWT exemption certificates is published quarterly in the New Zealand Gazette. Recipients of investment income who are exempt from tax under other Acts can also request their investment providers to treat them as exempt from RWT without needing to get a certificate of exemption. The Gazette process is infrequent and causes some problems for payers of investment inco me. Payers have issues determining whether a recipient is still exempt and can also have problems determining whether a recipient who informs them that they are exempt under another Act is actually exempt. 57 REMOVING SOME REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE END-OF-YEAR WITHHOLDING TAX CERTIFICATES (Clause 211) Summary of proposed amendments Under the proposed amendments the requirements to provide end-of-year withholding tax certificates to recipients of interest (or dividends treated as interest and dividends subject to section RE 9(2)) will be limited to recipients that have not provided their IRD number to their investment income payer. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2020. Key features Clause 211 proposes amendments to section 25 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (and renumbers section 25 as section 26C) to remove the requirement to provide RWT withholding tax certificates to interest (or dividends treated as interest and dividends subject to section RE 9(2)) recipients that have provided their IRD number to their investment provider. Instead, the investment providers will only have to provide end- of-year certificates to recipients who have not provided their IRD number. Background Currently, payers of interest (or dividends treated as interest and dividends subject to section RE 9(2)) that have made payments to recipients and have deducted RWT are required to provide a tax certificate to the recipient (typically after the end of the tax year). There are a number of specific pieces of information that are required to be included on the certificates and a number of financial institutions face significant time pressure to send out the certificates. As Inland Revenue will be getting investment income information more frequently and making it available on the person’s MyIR account there is no longer a need to have such tight requirements around sending out tax certificates. If payers want to continue to provide year-end tax information they will still be able to do that but they will not be required to do it. The exception is for people that have not provided their IRD number to their investment provider. As the investment income paid to these people may not be able to be associated with their tax records there will still be a requirement to provide them with year-end withholding tax certificates. This will also help to highlight to these people that they are being subjected to the higher non-declaration rate which may prompt them to file a tax return (which would involve providing their IRD number). 58 Payers of dividends and taxable Māori authorit y distributions will still need to send shareholder dividend statements or Māori authority distribution statements (as applicable) to the recipients of these types of income as they are likely to be paid sporadically and it would be useful for the recipient to be informed at the time of the payment. 59 CORRECTION OF ERRORS IN INFORMATION PROVIDED (Clauses 122, 123, 212 and 283) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are proposed that will make it easier to correct errors when the payer has not deducted enough withholding tax in the following tax year. The ability to make adjustments in the following tax year will be subject to a threshold, and the payer will be required to notify Inland Revenue of the correction. Subject to meeting the requirements, the correction will not be subject to penalties or interest. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2020 or on 1 April 2019 for payers who choose to apply the new investment income information rules before they become compulsory. Key features The proposed changes mean that errors will still be able to be corrected in the year that they occurred in, but in addit io n, they will be able to be corrected in the following year if they are under the threshold for error correction. The payments made to correct the error would be treated as having been made in time and as such would not be subject to penalties or interest. Where tax has been withheld at a higher rate than it should have been, the addit io nal tax credits will be pre-populated into the recipient’s tax records and will be able to be refunded by Inland Revenue if it results in the recipient’s income tax being overpaid. These changes also broaden the application of the error correction provisions and apply to all forms of income subject to RWT or NRWT. Background Currently, errors where the payer has not deducted enough withholding tax from interest subject to RWT or non-resident passive income that is subject to NRWT can be corrected in the same tax year by payers of investment income but where the errors are not discovered until the following tax year the correction must be done by amending a prior year return. The proposed amendments are intended to make it easier for payers to correct errors where the correction is made within a reasonable length of time. The error correction provisions do not change the obligation to provide correct returns initially and are only available to correct errors as opposed to allowing payers to choose to defer the payment of withholding tax. 60 Detailed analysis Clauses 122 and 123, which propose changes to sections RA 11 and RA 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and clauses 212 and 283, which propose new sections for the Tax Administration Act 1994, codify the changes on error correction. The table below outlines the provisions of these sections and highlights the changes that are proposed. Changes at a glance Current section Proposed change Section RA 11 – sets out the rules regarding error correction where there is an underpayment of RWT (in respect of interest or dividends treated as interest) or NRWT caused by a failure to deduct enough from a payment made to a recipient. The section allows the error to be corrected in the same year by subtracting the amount from a later payment to the recipient or recovering the amount from the recipient. The later payment can only be a payment of interest, a dividend treated as interest or a payment of non- resident passive income. Clause 122 provides that the error correction can be made in respect of any payment subject to RWT or NRWT. The correction can be made by subtracting an amount from a subsequent payment to the payee (no restriction on the type of payment) or by recovering an amount from the payee directly provided the correction is made in the same year. The error can also be corrected by deducting an amount from a subsequent payment to the payee made in the following year provided that the tax being corrected is no more than the greater of $2,000 or 5 percent of the payer’s RWT or NRWT withholding liability (as applicable) for the year in which the error occurred. For example, if the payer paid $1,000,000 of RWT in the year of the error an RWT error of up to $50,000 could be corrected in the following year. Proposed section RA 11(5) provides that a correction made that meets the requirements set out above will be treated as being made on the due date for the withholding tax and as such it would not be subject to interest or penalties. A requirement to notify the Commissioner of the adjustments made in the following year is also included in the clause. This notification would be expected to be made separately to the main withholding tax information being filed to allow Inland Revenue to have a correct understanding of the recipient’s tax positions for each income year. Section RA 12 – sets out the rules regarding error correction when there is an overpayment of RWT or NRWT because the payer has in error withheld too much tax. The error can only be corrected by the payer in the same year (before the relevant certificate has been sent out or if the certificate has been returned and cancelled). Section RA 12(5) requires that the Commissioner must refund the payment if the excess amount has been paid to the Commissioner. Clause 123 allows the payer to pay the excess amount to the recipient at any time before the 20 th of April after the end of the tax year provided the payer has not reported to the payee via a RWT withholding certificate, shareholder dividend statement, or Māori Authority distribution statement. If the relevant certificate has been sent out, the payer will need to inform the Commissioner and the payee of the amount that needs to be refunded to the payee. This means the payer can make the correction up to the point that the final withholding information for the year is provided to the Commissioner/or the payee when the certificate has been sent out earlier. Once the year-end information has been provided to the Commissioner the information will be pre- populated into the recipient’s tax records and if 61 Current section Proposed change the excess tax puts the recipient’s overall income tax position into a refund position the recipient will be able to claim a refund from Inland Revenue. Clause 212 inserts proposed section 25P, which effectively directs withholding tax payers to the error correction sections at sections RA 11 and RA 12. Clause 283 introduces proposed section 227E, which gives transitional provisions for early adopters of the new investment income information rules. Section 227E(2) provides that early adopters who choose to apply the new rules in the period between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020 can also apply the new error correction rules. 62 Other Making Tax Simpler items 63 64 SETTING A NEW DUE DATE FOR DEFAULT ASSESSMENTS (Clauses 273 and 274) Summary of proposed amendment Currently, section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets different due dates for payment of an Electronic Default Assessment (EDA) and Non-electronic Default Assessment (NDA). There are also different treatments for any tax payable from a subsequent amendment to that default assessment. The amendments bring the two different types of default assessment under the same rules to reduce confusion and simplify the rules around default assessments. Application date The amendments will apply on a date appointed by the Governor-General by Order in Council, and one or more orders may be made appointing different dates for different tax types and purposes. The new rules will only apply to taxes that have migrated to Inland Revenue’s new computer system, START, and do not have incremental penalties applying. Key features Amendments to section 142A align the due date for payment of tax for default assessments. Currently there are different treatments between default assessments that are made by electronic means and those that are made manually. There is no reason why these treatments should be different, and taxpayers can be confused about which payment rules apply. The amended rules will only apply when the default assessment relates to a tax type that has been migrated to the new START system and when incremental penalties do not apply to the particular tax type. Background Section 142A sets different due dates for payment of an EDA and NDA. For an EDA: • The amount payable from the default assessment is due on the original due date for the tax type and period. This means that if the EDA is made after the original due date, as is always the case for GST, late payment penalties will be immediately applied, back-dated to the original due date. 65 • When the EDA is amended, a new due date will be set that is at least 30 days following the notice advising the taxpayer of the new amount to pay. Therefore, any late payment penalties applied to the EDA will be reversed, and the taxpayer will not be penalised further unless they do not pay any amount due by the new due date. Example Horribear Ltd the maker of zombie teddy bears is due to file its GST return for the period 31 March 2017 on 28 April 2017. Because of an upward demand for the new Demon Teddy range, Horribear forgets to file the return in its attempts to produce more Demon bears. Because the return is unfiled the Inland Revenue computer system automatically applies an EDA of $1,000 on 14 May 2017. The due date for the EDA is 28 April 2017, so immediately retrospective penalties are applied on the amount of the EDA, with effect from the day after the original due date. Horribear then files the return on 30 May 2017, and the information from that return is used to replace the EDA with a new assessment of $1,500 to pay. The taxpayer is given at least 30 days – until 30 June 2017 to pay the $1,500 assessment. There are no back-dated penalties unless they do not pay by the new due date. For an NDA: • The amount payable from the default assessment is due at least 30 days from the notice of assessment. • If the assessment is subsequently amended, then the taxpayer is only given a new due date for any amount payable that is greater than the amount previously payable from the NDA. This new due date will also be at least 30 days after the notice advising the taxpayer of the additional tax to pay. Example Dream Liner Ltd a manufacturer of scented industrial bin liners is due to file its GST return for the period ended 31 March 2017 on 28 April 2017. An Inland Revenue investigator decides to make a Commissioner’s assessment of $1,000 on 14 May 2017 due to Dream Liner not having filed a number of returns, including this one. Dream Liner is given a due date to pay the $1,000 on 15 June 2017. The taxpayer then files its return, and the information from the return is accepted as an amendment to the NDA on 30 June 2017, with the resulting assessment being $1,500 to pay. The $1,000 from the NDA is still due, as of 15 June 2017, and the taxpayer is given a new due date of 30 July 2017 to pay the additional $500 of the increased assessment. 66 Detailed analysis Proposed new section 142AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will apply from the date appointed by the Governor-General through Order in Council, and one or more orders may be made appointing different dates for different tax types and for different purposes. It is intended that as tax types are migrated to Inland Revenue’s new START system the new rules will apply. The new rules will also only apply to tax types where incremental penalties have been removed. The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 contains provisions that remove incremental penalties from goods and services tax (GST), income tax and Working for Families tax credits. Section 142AB will apply to set a new due date for certain assessments. Section 142AB will not apply to assessments made in the absence of a return and to which section 106(1) applies. Section 106 deals with the issue of default assessments, both electronic and non-electronic. Section 142A, which applies to tax types that proposed section 142AB does not apply to, has application to assessments other than EDAs made in the absence of a return and to which section 106(2) applies, which relates to EDAs only. Section 142AB removes this distinction entirely so that no new due date is set for any default assessment, manual or automatic. In addition, proposed section 142AB does not set a new due date for an increased assessment from a default assessment. This will mean that any subsequent amendments to a default assessment will be due at the original due date. This change reflects the fact that no return was originally filed and removes a benefit to those who do not file compared with those who do file returns and pay tax on time. Example Using the facts in the Dream Liner Ltd example above, Dream Liner is due to file its GST return for the period 31 March 2019 on 28 April 2019. GST is a tax which has migrated to START and has had incremental penalties removed. An Inland Revenue investigator decides to make a Commissioner’s assessment of $1,000 on 14 May 2019 due to Dream Liner not having filed a number of returns. Section 142AB will not apply to this default assessment and the tax will be due on the original due date of 28 April 2019. The taxpayer then files its return, and the information from the return is accepted as an amendment to the NDA on 30 June 2017, with the resulting assessment being $1,500 to pay. Again, section 142AB will not apply as the reassessment relates to the reassessment of a default assessment and thus the $1,500 from the reassessment is still due on the original due date for the tax, 28 April 2019. 67 Example Carrying on from the Horribear Ltd example above, in the 2019 year Horribear has a GST review performed by Inland Revenue on its GST return for the period ended 31 March 2017. Inland Revenue discovers that Horribear has understated its GST output tax for the period by $500. The investigator issues a reassessment for the period to reflect the increase in GST payable. Assuming that GST has been migrated to the START system and that no incremental penalties apply to GST, section 142AB will apply to the reassessment as it is not a reassessment of a default assessment and therefore a new due date can be set for the payment of the extra GST. The due date for the tax is set for at least 30 days after the reassessment. 68 THE DATE INTEREST STARTS (Clause 263) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment reduces the number of working days referred to in the definit io n o f “date interest starts” from 15 working days to 10 working days because of the migration of GST to Inland Revenue’s START system. This will mean taxpayers who have a GST refund and file early will have use of money interest (UOMI) calculated on that refund earlier than is the current rule. This reflects efficiencies in processing time for GST returns in the new START system. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section 120C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 outlines the date on which UOMI is calculated from. Specifically, in the definition of “date interest starts”, paragraph (c) outlines the date on which a GST refund begins to accrue UOMI. With the migration of GST to Inland Revenue’s START system, and the efficiencies this creates, it is now possible to reduce the time before UOMI begins to accrue on GST refunds from 15 working days to 10 working days. Background Under the current rules the definition of “date interest starts” in section 120C(c) outlines the date at which interest commences to accrue on a GST refund. This is the latest of the following dates: (i) The day after the earlier of – (A) the 15 th working day after the taxpayer provides a tax return for the return period to which the GST refund relates; and (B) the original due date for payment of output GST in respect of that return period; and (ii) the day after the day on which the tax return is provided; and (iii) the day after the date on which the payment is made. The 15 working days was originally designed to give Inland Revenue time to review and process the GST refund before interest would accrue. 69 Example The Drake Ltd operates a bar specialising in vegan cocktails. Due to the strong demand for vegan cocktails The Drake files its GST return monthly but for the month of June 2018 it has a GST refund, due to a large number of purchases made that month getting ready for the Vegan July festival and files its GST return before the due date of 28 July. The GST return is filed on 7 June 2018. Interest will start accruing to The Drake 15 working days after that, being 28 June if it has not been refunded. Because of efficiencies in processing GST returns through Inland Revenue’s business transformation it is now possible to reduce the 15 working day delay in paying interest in section 120C(1)(c) which will enable taxpayers to earn UOMI sooner when a refund is delayed. Example Using the facts from The Drake example above under the proposed rule The Drake would earn UOMI on its refund from 21 June rather than the 28 th under the current rules. 70 THE DATE AN EXCESS CREDIT ARISES (Clause 276) Summary of proposed amendments There are currently rules within section 173L, and in particular section 173L(2), which outline the earliest date that taxpayers are able to transfer all or part of an excess credit. The current rules do not appropriately deal with taxpayers who file their returns early or late. The proposed amendment alters the date a credit arises in respect of goods and services tax (GST) to better reflect when a taxpayer files their return as this is the date that establishes the amount of the credit. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The date that a credit arises for a taxpayer in respect of GST will change to more closely reflect the date the taxpayer files their return, as this is the day that the amount of the credit is established. For taxpayers who file their GST return on time there will be no change from the current position and the credit will arise the day after the end of the GST return period in which the refund arose. For those taxpayers who file their return before the due date, the refund will be available on the earlier of: • the day after the date on which the return is filed; or • the day after the end of the GST period to which the refund relates. For taxpayers who file after the due date, the refund will be available on the day after the date the return is filed. Background The current rules around when excess tax is available to be transferred, does not reflect the date on which a taxpayer files a GST return. The filing of a return establishes the amount of the credit which is available to the taxpayer to use or be refunded. For taxpayers who file their GST return early this can cause a delay in obtaining a credit when they may be closing down a business or require the funds for other liabilities. Conversely, for taxpayers who file their return late a credit can be available at a date that is earlier than the amount of the refund has been calculated. 71 Detailed analysis To more closely align the calculation of the refund with its availability to taxpayers, the proposed change alters the current rules around when the excess tax is available to be used by a taxpayer by moving this date closer to when the return is filed. For most taxpayers who file their GST return on time, the proposed new rules will not change the current date on which a credit is available. These new rules will only affect taxpayers who file their returns early or late. For taxpayers who file early the date the excess tax becomes available will be the earlier of: • the day after the date on which the return is filed; or • the day after the end of the GST return period in which the refund arose. This will mean that a GST credit will be available to a taxpayer on the day after a GST return is filed if that return is filed before the end of the taxable period. This situation will be rare but may be when a business is closing down and files a return until the date of cessation. In this situation the credit will be available to the taxpayer the day after the return is filed or the end of the GST return period, whichever is the earlier. Example Scotty Cycles Ltd sells spin bikes to gyms. They are in an unusual position for the two-month GST period ending 30 June 2018. They have imported a large number of spin bikes and associated parts on 1 June 2018 from the United States for a large order for a leading New Zealand chain of gyms. It will take the rest of the month of June to assemble and test the bikes before they are handed over to the buyer. Scotty works out that the company will have no other GST credits arising for the rest of the month and it will have no output tax. Because of the timing of the sale and the supply of the bikes Scotty has a GST refund arising for the June period and would like to transfer the refund as soon as possible to pay some other tax liabilities. Scotty completes and files its GST return online through its accounting software on 5 June. The credit is processed by Inland Revenue and is available for Scotty to transfer on 6 June. Conversely, for taxpayers who file after the due date, the credit arising will only be available to them once the credit has been established, which is when they file their return for the GST period in question. 72 Example Campbell’s Hemp Emporium Ltd is a company that sells products made of hemp. It files its GST on a two-monthly basis with the next return due on 30 September 2018. In October 2018 Campbell has a strong upturn in the sale of hemp swimwear as people gear up for the summer season. Because the company is busy making hemp swimwear Campbell, the owner, forgets to file his 30 September GST return. He realises this in November and files his September return on 18 November. His calculation is a refund amount of $3,000. This credit is available to Campbell’s Hemp Emporium Ltd on 19 November. 73 TAX TREATMENT OF ADVANCE PAYMENTS OF HOLIDAY PAY OR SALARY OR WAGES (Clauses 142, 294(1) and 306(1)) Summary of proposed amendment To strike a balance between the desire for more accurate withholding of PAYE and the impact on compliance costs, a proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 will give employers the option to tax holiday pay (or salary or wages) paid in advance as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which it relates, or under the existing extra pay method. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2018. Key features Proposed replacement section RD 13 will allow employers to tax holiday pay (or salary or wages) paid in advance as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which it relates, or under the existing extra pay method. Employers who choose, under section RD 13, to treat the lump sum advance payment as if it had been paid over the pay periods to which it relates will be required, if they make future payments for these pay periods, to calculate PAYE based on all earnings for the pay period, less PAYE already deducted for the pay period. Background The tax treatment of holiday pay depends on whether the holiday pay is a lump sum payment (in which case it should be treated as an extra pay), or is included in an employee’s regular pay or paid in substitution for an employee’s ordinary salary or wages when annual paid holidays are taken (in these cases it should be treated as salary or wages). In the case of holiday pay paid in advance (for example, where an employee takes four weeks’ annual leave and receives a lump sum payment of holiday pay covering the four weeks in advance), extra pay tax treatment has a tendency to result in over- withholding of PAYE. This is because extra pay tax treatment essentially over-taxes the leave payment by using the employee’s marginal rate (for a payment that does not represent an increase in total annual earnings), while the payments made in each of the subsequent periods that have only part of the earnings are under-taxed. 74 More accurate withholding outcomes could be achieved if PAYE was deducted as if the lump sum payment was paid in its normal cycle over the pay periods to which the leave relates (the alternative approach). Feedback received from the Government’s Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of PAYE and GST consultation suggested it was common practice to apply this alternative approach for end of (calendar) year holiday pay paid as a lump sum. Anecdotally, it is common for employees in some industries to work longer hours in the lead up to Christmas, which can exacerbate the over-withholding if the extra pay formula is used. This, combined with receiving no income during the following weeks when the holiday is taken, may cause financial hardship. Moreover, prior to Inland Revenue clarifying its operational position on the correct tax treatment of holiday pay in November 2015, some payroll software applied the alternative approach described above to holiday pay paid in advance, and some payroll software providers expressed a desire during consultation to be allowed to use this more accurate alternative withholding method. This alternative treatment would, however, be more complicated for employers to apply than treating the payment as an extra pay. This is due to the need, when future payments are made for pay periods to which the leave relates, for employers to calculate PAYE based on all earnings for the pay period, less PAYE already deducted for the pay period. This will occur for pay periods that are not taken entirely on leave, but partially taken on leave and partially worked in. This makes the alternative method too complex to be suitable for employers who do their payroll manually to be required to use; extra pay tax treatment remains appropriate for them. A similar issue arises in the situation of salary or wages paid in advance. Detailed analysis Proposed replacement section RD 13 will apply when an employee receives: • an advance payment of salary or wages; or • a lump sum payment of holiday pay made before the employee takes their holiday, if the employee’s employment is continuing. That is, section RD 13 will not apply to a lump sum payment of holiday pay made on termination of employment. Employers will continue to be required to tax lump sum payments of holiday pay made on termination of employment as extra pays. When section RD 13 applies, an employer may choose, for the purposes of withholding PAYE, to treat the lump sum payment: • as an extra pay; or • as if it had been paid in its normal cycle for the pay periods to which it relates. If an employer chooses that latter option, the employer would calculate the amount of PAYE to withhold from the lump sum payment by: • apportioning the lump sum payment to the pay period or pay periods to which it relates based on the employee’s usual hours of work; and 75 • calculating the amount of PAYE for each portion of the lump sum, as if the portion were the only salary payment they made to the employee for the particular pay period; and • adding together the PAYE amounts for each portion. If an employer, subsequent to making a lump sum payment to an employee where PAYE was calculated using the proposed new method, makes a salary payment to the employee for one of the pay periods to which the lump sum relates, the employer will be required to calculate the amount of PAYE to be withheld from the salary payment by: • adding together the salary payment and the portion of the lump sum that relates to the pay period; and • calculating the amount of PAYE that would be required to be withheld from this aggregate amount, as if that amount were a single payment of salary paid by the employer to the employee for the pay period; and • subtracting the amount of previously withheld PAYE for the portion of the lump sum that relates to the pay period. The proposed amendment to section 67(3)(a) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 specifies that proposed replacement section RD 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 does not apply for the purposes of calculating employee KiwiSaver contribution deductions. The proposed amendment to schedule 2 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 specifies that proposed replacement section RD 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 does not apply for the purposes of calculating student loan deductions from payments of salary or wages. 76 Example This example concerns an employer who chooses to treat holiday pay paid in advance as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which it relates. An employee on an “M” tax code is paid weekly wages with the pay period ending on a Sunday and a normal payday of the Tuesday following the end of the pay period. She takes annual leave for the period Thursday, 10 December to 16 December and requests that this is paid to her prior to her taking this leave. The gross payment for this leave is calculated based on Holidays Act calculations at $1,000. Her ordinary wages payment for Monday to Wednesday of the first pay period containing the leave is $600, and her ordinary wages payment for the Thursday to Friday of the second pay period containing the leave is $400. On the Tuesday of the week in which the leave is taken, the employee is paid for the previous week as normal and is also paid her holiday pay as a separate payment. Note that, in the table below which forms part of this example, the weekly PAYE table for the 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016 tax year, has been used to determine the PAYE deductions. This is intended to be purely illustrative. To determine PAYE deductions, employers will have to use the relevant PAYE table for the tax year in which the payments are made and their pay period length. Pay period end date Payment type Pay date Payment amount PAYE withheld Notes 8 Nov Ordinary salary or wages 10 Nov $1,000 $180.26 15 Nov Ordinary salary or wages 17 Nov $1,000 $180.26 22 Nov Ordinary salary or wages 24 Nov $1,000 $180.26 29 Nov Ordinary salary or wages 1 Dec $1,000 $180.26 6 Dec Ordinary salary or wages 8 Dec $1,000 $180.26 13 Dec Holiday pay 8 Dec $400 $56.95 PAYE initially calculated based on $400 for the pay period (for 2 days of leave) 20 Dec Holiday pay 8 Dec $600 $94.85 PAYE initially calculated based on $600 for the pay period (for 3 days of leave) 13 Dec Ordinary salary or wages 15 Dec $600 $123.31 PAYE calculated on the new total for the pay period of $1,000 ($400 + $600).

PAYE withheld from this pay is the difference between the PAYE on $1,000 ($180.26) and what has already been deducted for the pay period ($94.85) Total $7,000 $1,261.82 77 APPLICATION OF LEGISLATED RATE AND THRESHOLD CHANGES (Clauses 140, 144, 152, 293, 301 and 304) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007, the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 align the rules about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied across the different types of PAYE income payments and social policy initiatives administered through the PAYE system, such that the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the date the payment is made. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2018. Key features Proposed new section RD 10C of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that, when a tax rate or threshold change occurs that affects the amount of tax for a PAYE income payment, the rates and thresholds to be applied to determine the amount of tax to be withheld are those in force on the date on which the PAYE income payment is paid. If the PAYE rules treat a PAYE income payment as paid on a particular date (which may differ from the actual date of payment), the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the date on which the PAYE income payment is treated as paid. Section RD 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which sets out the current rules for determining the amount of tax to be withheld from a payment of salary or wages when a change occurs to tax rates or thresholds, is proposed to be repealed. Proposed new section RD 67B of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that, when a tax rate or threshold change occurs that affects the amount of tax for an employer’s superannuation cash contribution, the rates and thresholds to be applied to determine the amount of tax to be withheld are those in force on the date on which the PAYE income payment to which the contribution relates is paid. If the PAYE rules treat a PAYE income payment to which the contribution relates as paid on a particular date (which may differ from the actual date of payment), the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the date on which the PAYE income payment is treated as paid. Where an employer’s superannuation cash contribut ion is made that is not tied to a particular PAYE income payment, the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the date on which the contribution is paid to the superannuation fund or under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to Inland Revenue (whichever applies). 78 Proposed new section 64(3B) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides that, when a change occurs to the minimum employee KiwiSaver contribution rate that affects the contribution that must be deducted from a payment of salary or wages, the rate to be applied to determine the amount of the contribution is the rate applying on the day on which the salary or wages are paid. Proposed amendments to section 101D of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provide that the compulsory employer contribution rate to be applied in calculating the amount of a compulsory employer KiwiSaver contribution to be made for a payment of gross salary or wages is the rate applying on the day on which the salary or wages are paid. Proposed new section 37(3B) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 provides that, when a change occurs to the rate at which student loan deductions are required to be fro m a payment of salary or wages, the deduction rate to be applied is the rate applying on the day on which the salary or wages are paid. Background At present, different types of PAYE income payments and social policy initiatives administered through the PAYE system have different rules about what is to be done when there is a legislated rate or threshold change during a pay period, or if there is a legislated rate or threshold change between the date the payment is made and the pay period to which the payment relates. The rates and thresholds that apply are sometimes based on the pay date, sometimes pay period end-date or pay period start- date, while sometimes apportionment applies. This creates complexity and confusion for employers, in particular for pays that occur in the period around the end of one tax year and start of the next, when there has been legislated rate and/or threshold changes. This adds to employers’ compliance costs and increases the risk of errors. 79 TAX TREATMENT OF A RETROSPECTIVE INCREASE IN SALARY OR WAGES (Clause 134) Summary of proposed amendment The de minimis rule in section RD 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 relat ing to the tax treatment of a retrospective increase in salary or wages is to be repealed, as it is now redundant. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2018. Key features The proposed amendment to section RD 7 repeals the de minimis rule in relation to the tax treatment of a retrospective increase in salary or wages. Background Under the PAYE rules, a retrospective increase in salary or wages is treated as an extra pay. This is subject to a de minimis provision, so only applies where the total salary or wages a person earns in a week (including the increase) is more than $4. If a person earned less than $4 for the week, the payment would be treated as salary or wages. This restriction has been part of the PAYE rules since PAYE was introduced in 1958, with the only change to the provision being when it changed to $4 from its original £2 upon the change to decimal currency in 1967. Given that the current adult minimum wage is $15.25 an hour and the current starting- out and training minimum wage is $12.20 an hour, it is extremely unlikely anyone earning salary or wages in New Zealand would receive less than $4 in a week. Therefore, the existing restriction is effectively redundant. 80 ELECTRONIC FILING REQUIREMENT FOR GST RETURNS (Clauses 187(18), 227, 231 , 232 , 269(3), (7) and 275(1)) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes an electronic filing requirement for some GST-registered persons over a taxable supplies threshold. The threshold will be set by Order in Council following appropriate consultation. A limited exempt ion will be provided in some circumstances. A penalty will apply to registered persons required to file their GST return electronically but who fail to do so. Application date The proposed amendments will apply from the date of enactment. However, it will only affect registered persons once a threshold for the electronic filing requirement is set by Order in Council at a later point in time. Key features Proposed section 36BD will provide for the setting of a threshold above which GST- registered persons are required to file their GST return with Inland Revenue electronically in a prescribed format. The threshold will be set separately by Order in Council. Subsection (1)(a) of section 36BD preserves the option for GST-registered persons below the threshold to voluntarily file electronically. As currently, registered persons who choose to transmit their return electronically must do so in a format prescribed by Inland Revenue. There will be an exemption to the electronic filing requirement available for registered persons who do not have sufficient digital services available to them, and if the cost incurred in complying with the electronic filing requirement would be unreasonable in the circumstances. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will publish guidelines on how the exemptions will apply. To encourage taxpayers to file electronically and to recover the additional costs of administering paper returns it is proposed that a penalty of $250 applies for taxpayers who are, in the future, required to file in an electronic format and who fail to do so. Section 142G is being amended to set the due date for the payment of the penalty 30 days after the end of the month in which the registered person is required to provide the return to the Commissioner electronically. 81 Background Currently GST-registered persons have a choice whether to provide Inland Revenue with their GST return on paper or electronically. The use of electronic channels for filing GST returns has increased over recent years. Electronic transfer of GST returns compared with paper returns has the long-term benefit of reducing compliance and administrative costs and transcription errors. The proposed changes will enable further encouragement of electronic filing, if necessary, in the future. 82 Employee share schemes 83 84 OVERVIEW Employee share schemes – arrangements for companies to provide shares and share options to their emplo yees – are an important form of employee remuneration in New Zealand and internationally. Although the design and the accounting treatment of these plans have evolved considerably over recent decades, the tax rules applying to them in New Zealand have not been comprehensively reviewed during that period and are now out of date. Employee share schemes can have beneficial economic effects and it is important that the tax rules do not raise unintended barriers to their use. In some circumstances, the current rules can result in over-taxation; in others they result in under-taxation. The current system impedes the use of employee share schemes in a number of ways. • There is considerable uncertainty about how the current rules apply to taxation of employees and employers, which may deter firms from offering these schemes. • The cost to an emplo yer of providing shares directly to an employee is not explicitly deductible. Non-deductibility creates over-taxation, which is a disincentive to using employee share schemes. Arrangements which currently do allow employers to take deductions for shares provided directly, or indirectly by other companies, produce deductions which do not reflect the amount or timing of the income recognised by the employee. The current treatment of some sophisticated employee share schemes can result in employment income being treated as tax-free capital gains and so escaping taxation. This undermines the fairness of the tax system. The Bill proposes new core rules for determining the amount and time of derivation of income and incurring of expenditure under an employee share scheme. The objective of the proposals is neutral tax treatment of employee share scheme benefits. That is, to the extent possible, the tax position of both the employer and the employee should be the same whether remuneration for labour is paid in cash or shares. Generally these rules will apply to benefits where the taxing point under current law has not occurred before the day 6 months after the enactment of the Bill. The Act also currently provides a concessionary regime to encourage employers to offer shares to employees under certain widely-offered employee share schemes (commonly referred to as “exempt schemes”). Income derived by employees under these schemes is exempt from tax and there is a deemed 10% notional interest deduction allowed to employers who provide loans as part of such schemes. The law governing these schemes is out of date, complex and no longer fit for purpose. In addition, it not consistent with our broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) income tax system. Accordingly, the Bill also proposes a simplified set of rules for these exempt schemes, with a greater level of exempt benefit able to be provided and more flexibility in the design of these schemes. The Bill aims to clarify that employers offering exempt benefits will not be entitled to a deduction for the cost of providing those benefits. 85 The retention of the tax exemption for exempt schemes is an exception to the neutrality principle, but is justified on compliance cost grounds. The Bill also proposes a number of consequential and miscellaneous changes, and provides transitional arrangements for existing schemes. The proposed new rules for employee share schemes have been developed through a public consultation process beginning with the release of the officials’ issues paper Taxation of employee share schemes in May 2016 and further consultation in September 2016. 86 SCOPE OF THE NEW RULES (Clauses 11, 12, 14 and 41) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed new income and deduction rules will apply to arrangements where employees receive shares as part of their remuneration package. There are a number of qualifications and carve outs to the definition of “employee share scheme” to ensure the rules are appropriately targeted. Application date The new rules will generally apply to benefits provided under employee share schemes which are not taxed under the existing rules within 6 months of enactment of the Bill. There is further detail of the transitional arrangements below. Key features The proposed new rules will apply to benefits provided under arrangements that involve issuing or transferring shares to past, present and future employees 5 or shareholder-employees (or their associates) of the issuing company (or a group company). However, they will not apply to arrangements that require emplo yees to: (a) pay market value for the shares on the “share scheme taxing date” (described in more detail below, but generally the date on which the employee holds the shares like any other shareholder); (b) put at risk shares they acquired for market value, where the scheme provides no protection to the person against a fall in the value of the shares. They will also not apply to exempt schemes (which have their own specific rules, discussed below). Background The definition of “employee share scheme” is a key component of the rules. The core employee share scheme rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 currently apply to “share purchase agreements”. These are agreements to dispose of or issue shares to an employee, entered into in connection with the employee’s employment or service, whether or not an employment relationship exists when the employee receives a benefit under the agreement. 5 Which includes any person receiving a PAYE income payment (for example, certain directors). 87 Under current rules there is some uncertainty as to whether this definition encompasses arrangements entered into before a person commences a formal employment relationship and has received a PAYE income payment. This definition also excludes shareholder-employees to the extent to which they choose not to deduct PAYE. There is no policy rationale for excluding these classes of recipients of employee share scheme benefits. Detailed analysis Clauses 11, 12 and 14 propose that under sections CE 1(1)(d), CE 2, and CE 6 – 7D, a benefit received under an employee share scheme is income of a person. Similarly, clause 41 proposes a new section DV 27 that governs what deductions are available when a person is party to an employee share scheme. Clause 14 proposes a definition of “employee share scheme” in new section CE 7. The definit io n is init ially fairly wide. It is an arrangement with a purpose or effect of issuing or transferring shares in a company to a person who will be, is, or has been an employee (or shareholder- employee) of that company or of another company in the same group. It also includes the provision of shares to an associate of the employee or shareholder-emplo yee, if the arrangement is connected with that person’s employment or service. The use of the term “arrangement” covers all aspects of a scheme, for example, direct transfers of shares, loans to buy shares, bonuses, put and call options and transfers to trusts etc. The definition also covers past, present and future employees, and includes shareholder-emplo yees. However, an employee share scheme does not include an arrangement that requires an employee, shareholder-employee or associate to: (a) pay market value for the shares on the “share scheme taxing date” (described in more detail below, but generally the date on which the employee holds the shares like any other shareholder); or (b) put at risk shares they acquired for market value, where the scheme provides no protection to the person against a fall in the value of the shares. 88 Example 1 Jim is employed by ABC Co, a closely-held company. As part of his employment agreement, after he has worked for the company for 3 years, if the company’s other shareholders are happy with his performance, they will let him buy 25% of the company’s shares for their current market value. While this is an arrangement with a purpose or effect of issuing or transferring shares in a company to a person who will be, is, or has been an employee (or shareholder-employee), market value will be paid for the shares on the share scheme taxing date. Accordingly, this arrangement is not an employee share scheme for the purposes of the proposed new definition. Example 2 Casey, Hamish and Steve get together and incorporate a company to develop some technology intellectual property (IP). They are each employed by the company in different roles. When the shares are issued they are worth virtually nothing (on a balance sheet basis) and a nominal subscription price of $0.01 is paid by each shareholder-employee. The shareholders’ agreement states that to ensure they commit to developing the IP over three years, if they leave within 3 years they lose their shares. After this point they keep their shares no matter what. While this is an arrangement with a purpose or effect of issuing or transferring shares in a company to a person who will be, is, or has been an employee (or shareholder-employee), market value was paid for the shares and the employees have then chosen to put the shares at risk. Accordingly, this arrangement is not an employee share scheme for the purposes of the proposed new definition. Example 3 Melissa is hired as CEO by X Co, a closely-held company with exciting but uncertain prospects. She is paid a $120,000 salary. Because she is an employee, she is also able to buy $50,000 worth of shares (which is the current market value – established by an independent valuation). If Melissa leaves employment within 3 years, X Co has the right to buy her shares back for the lesser of $50,000 and market value. After that date, it has to buy the shares back for full market value. This is because if she leaves, X Co does not want Melissa to hold its shares if she is not part of their team, but after 3 years they are prepared for Melissa to receive the upside in the shares. Before, then, she bears the risk of loss but no chance of gain. If the shares fall to $10,000 and Melissa leaves X Co within three years, the company will buy her shares back for $10,000 and she will lose $40,000 of her $50,000 investment. If Melissa leaves the company and the shares are worth $1m, then the company will buy them back and Melissa will be denied the upside. As above, this arrangement is not an employee share scheme as defined as Melissa has paid market value for her shares and has then effectively put them at risk for 3 years. The definition of employee share scheme also excludes exempt schemes (which have their own specific rules, discussed below). 89 TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEES’ INCOME (Clauses 11, 12, 14 and 41) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments ensure the timing and amount of employees’ income from employee share schemes is consistent with other forms of employment income. Application date The new rules will generally apply to benefits provided under employee share schemes which are not taxed under the existing rules within 6 months of enactment of the Bill. There is further detail on the transitional arrangements below. Key features Clauses 11, 12 and 14 provide that benefits provided under an employee share scheme (usually in the form of shares) are assessable income for an employee at the earlier of the date when: • the benefits are either transferred or cancelled for consideration; or • the employee share scheme beneficiary owns the shares in the same way as any other shareholder. They will not own the shares in the same way as any other shareholder if (for example) the employee is required to forfeit the shares if they choose to leave the company, or the employee is entitled to be compensated for a decline in the value of the shares. This is referred to as the “share scheme taxing date”. No change is proposed to the tax treatment of straight-forward employee share options, which already reflects this principle, in that the employee is not taxed until the option is exercised. The amount of the benefit should be the amount received for the transfer or cancellation, or the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date. It should be reduced by the amount paid (if any) for the benefit. The proposed rules require matching between the employee’s income and the employer’s deduction, so the rules outlined above also determine the amount and time of the deduction to the employer (the employer’s deduction is discussed further below). Background Any reward for services is generally taxable as income, under the ordinary definition. However, the application of the common law of income tax to the provision of rewards in the form of property, for example shares or options, has sometimes been problemat ic. 90 For that reason, since 1968, New Zealand tax law has contained special provisions relating to the taxation of employee share scheme benefits. Currently these are contained in sections CE 1 – CE 4, CE 6 and CE 7. Under current law, shares provided under an employee share scheme are taxable when the employee acquires the shares. Section CE 6(2) provides that: • shares acquired pursuant to an option are treated as acquired when the option is exercised. This means that an employee is not taxed on the grant or vesting of an option, but on its exercise; and • shares acquired by a trustee for the benefit of an employee (that is, a specific employee) are treated as acquired by the employee, even if the employee may be required to forfeit the shares. The second of these rules leads to outcomes that are neither tax-neutral nor consistent with the taxation of employee share options. Example 1 Jim has a tax rate of 33%. If his employer offers him a $1,000 bonus if he is still working for the employer in a year’s time, he will receive (if he satisfies the condition) $1,000 of taxable income. If instead his employer decides to pay Jim the same bonus in shares, the tax neutral outcome would be for the employer to provide $1,000 of shares, and for Jim to pay $330 tax. In both cases Jim receives $1,000 of before-tax income and has paid $330 of tax. Tax will not be a factor in how Jim wants to be paid. Example 2 Suppose that Jim’s employer offers him a cash bonus on the same terms as in example 1, except that the amount of the bonus is the value of 1,000 shares in one year’s time. Suppose that 1,000 shares are worth $1,000 at the start of the year, when the offer is made, and $1,500 at the end of the year. Jim will not be taxed on $1,000. He will be taxed on $1,500 when he receives the cash bonus. Instead of offering a cash bonus dependent on the value of the shares, suppose Jim’s employer transfers 1,000 shares to a trustee, on the basis that the trustee will transfer them to Jim at the end of the year if he is still with the company, and not otherwise. The economic benefit to Jim is the same as in the first variation of this example. However, under current law, Jim has income of $1,000 when the shares are transferred to the trustee. This is not consistent with the treatment of equivalent cash remuneration (i.e. the first variation of this example), and therefore is not a neutral tax treatment. Example 3 Jane’s employer decides to provide her with options to buy 1,000 shares in the company. The shares are currently worth $1, and the options have a strike price of $1 (that is, they are issued “at the money”). The options can be exercised only if Jane is still employed in a year. Suppose there is an equal chance that the shares will be worth $600 or $1,600 in a year’s time. If they are worth $1,600, Jane exercises the options, and has $600 of taxable income. If they are worth $600, she does not exercise the options, and gets nothing. 91 Example 4 Instead of providing options, suppose Jane’s employer sells her 1,000 shares for $1,000, and provides her with an interest-free loan to fund the purchase. The loan must be repaid after one year. The employer specifies that if the shares have fallen in value at the repayment date, Jane must sell the shares back to the employer for $1,000. Suppose the same share values and probabilities as in example 3. If the shares are worth $1,600 in one year, Jane will keep the shares and pay off the loan. If they are worth $600, she will sell them to the employer for $1,000 and use that money to pay off the loan. Under current law, Jane has no taxable income from this arrangement, even though it produces outcomes identical with the option arrangement, under which Jane has $600 of income if she acquires the shares. The proposed new rules prevent these inconsistent outcomes by deferring the time at which an employee recognises income from an employee share scheme in certain situations. In examples 2 and 4 above, under the new rules, both Jim and Jane would be taxed on the value of the shares once the employment condition is satisfied (in Jim’s case) or the employer’s right to acquire the shares for $1,000 no longer exists (in Jane’s case). Detailed analysis Timing of income The time when the employee is taxable is defined as the “share scheme taxing date”, and is defined in proposed section CE 7B (clause 14 of the Bill). Unless an employee first transfers its share scheme benefits to a non-associate, or the company cancels them, the share scheme taxing date is when: • there is no real risk that beneficial ownership of the shares will change, or that the shares will be required to be transferred or cancelled; • the employee is not compensated for a fall in the value of the shares; and • there is no real risk that there will be a change in the terms of the shares affecting their value. If the benefits are cancelled or transferred to a non-associate before these events occur, then the share scheme taxing date is at the time of the cancellation or transfer. In determining whether there is a risk of a change of ownership, transfer or cancellation, certain rights and requirements do not affect the employee’s status as the economic owner of the shares under the scheme (proposed section CE 7B(2)) and are ignored. They are rights or requirements: • for transfer for market value; • not contemplated by the employee share scheme; • that have no real risk of occurring; • that are of no real commercial significance; or • that also apply to shares not subject to the employee share scheme. 92 The following series of examples illustrate how these proposed rules will work in practice for common types of employee share schemes. Example 1 – Simple vesting period Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee leaves the company for any reason during the next three years, the shares are forfeited for no consideration. After three years, the shares are transferred to the employee. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the three years is up and the employee is still employed. Analysis The risk of loss of the shares for the first three years means there is a real risk that the beneficial ownership of the share will change. None of the exceptions applies. Example 2 – Vesting period with good leaver exception Facts As for Example 1, except that if the employee ceases employment because of death, illness, disability, redundancy or retirement within the three-year period they are entitled to the shares. Result The share scheme taxing date will be the end of the vesting period, or when the person leaves for any of the above reasons. Analysis There is a real risk that the employee will leave employment for some other reason than those listed (for example, a better opportunity presents itself) and therefore the share scheme taxing date does not occur so long as that risk exists. 93 Example 3 – Vesting subject to misconduct Facts As for Example 1, except that if the employee ceases employment for any reason other than being subject to disciplinary action or committing some form of employment-related misconduct during the three-year period (i.e. being a “bad leaver”) the employee is entitled to the shares. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the shares are initially transferred to the trust, and the income will be their value at that time. Analysis The risk of the employee losing their job for these “bad” reasons during the three year period is not sufficiently real to require deferral. Example 3A – Vesting subject to misconduct with accrual Facts As for Example 3, except that if the employee ceases employment for any reason other than being a bad leaver, they are entitled to only a pro rata portion of the shares based on completed years’ service (for example, nothing for the first year, one third of the shares if the employee leaves between one and two years, etc.). Result There will be three share scheme taxing dates – at the end of years 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The employee will be taxed at the end of each year on the value at that time of one third of the shares. Analysis Until the end of the first year, if the employee leaves for another job, they will not be entitled to any shares. Once the first year is completed, they will be entitled to one third of the shares, provided they are not a bad leaver during the next two years. The risk that the employee will leave for another job is sufficiently real that it defers the share scheme taxing date. The risk that the employee will leave as a bad leaver is sufficiently unlikely that it does not defer the share scheme taxing date. The fact that the shares are held by the trustee until the end of year three does not of itself defer the share scheme taxing date. Example 3B – Performance hurdles Facts As for Example 3A, except that the employee is not entitled to the shares at all unless a total shareholder return 6 hurdle (measured as an annual percentage) is also met. If the hurdle is met in year 1, one third of the shares vest. If it is met in year 2, a further one third of the shares vest. Also, if it was not met in year 1, but is met on a combined basis over years 1 and 2, a further one-third of the shares will vest. The same approach applies in year 3. 6 A nnual “ total sharehol der return” i s a combi nati on of di vi dends pai d and appreci ati on i n share price duri ng a year. 94 Result There will be three possible share scheme taxing dates – at the end of years 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The employee will be taxed at the end of each year on the value of the shares that vest at that time. Analysis Until the end of the first year, if the employee leaves for another job, they will not be entitled to any shares. Once the first year is completed, they will be entitled to retain one third of the shares, provided they are not a bad leaver during the next two years, and provided the year 1 performance hurdle is met. The risk that the employee will be a bad leaver is sufficiently unlikely that it does not defer the share scheme taxing date. The fact that the shares are held by the trustee until the end of year 3 does not of itself defer the share scheme taxing date. Example 4 – Vesting period, with compulsory sale for market value thereafter Facts As for Example 1, except that even after the three-year period ends, the trustee retains legal ownership of the shares, and the employee must transfer their rights back to the trustee or A Co when the employee leaves. However, once the three-year period is up, the employee will receive the market value of the shares when their beneficial ownership is transferred. Result As for Example 1. Analysis Once the three-year period has expired, the employer’s or trustee’s right to acquire the beneficial interest in the shares is for market value, and therefore is not taken into account in determining the share scheme taxing date. Example 5 – Insubstantial put option Facts As for Example 4, except that the employee has the right at all times to sell the shares back to the trustee for a total price of $1. Result The share scheme taxing date would be the same as in Example 4. Analysis The employee’s right to sell the shares for $1 is not, at the time it is granted, a right which has a real risk of being exercised, given that there is no liability attached to the shares and that they are then worth $10,000. This right would therefore not defer the share scheme taxing date. 95 Example 6 – Loan funded scheme A Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free full recourse loan of $10,000 to acquire shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee leaves within three years, the shares must be sold back to the trustee for $10,000, which must be used to repay the loan; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; and • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold. Result The share scheme taxing date will be the earlier of when the employee leaves employment, or the expiry of the three years. Analysis Until the three years are up, if the employee leaves B Co for whatever reason, they lose their beneficial ownership of the shares for an amount that is not their market value. So the share scheme taxing date will on the face of it be the end of that three-year period. If the employee leaves within that period and is therefore required to transfer their rights, the sale price will be taxed, but since the sale price is the same as the amount contributed, there will be no gain or loss. Once the three-year period is up, the employee will either have no income (if they sell the shares back to the trustee for $10,000) or will pay tax on the difference between the value of the shares at that time and their $10,000 price (if they choose to keep the shares). Example 7 – Loan funded scheme B Facts As for Example 6, except that: • the loan is limited recourse for the first three years (i.e., during that period, the amount repayable is limited to the value of the shares at the time of repayment); and • if the employee leaves within three years, or chooses at the end of the three years to sell the shares to the trustee, they must be sold back to the trustee for market value. Result As for Example 6. Analysis The limited recourse loan provides a benefit to the employee which compensates the employee for a fall in the value of the shares. Accordingly the share scheme taxing date is the same as for Example 6 – that is, the end of three years (when the loan ceases to be limited recourse) or when the shares are sold to the trustee. If the employee sells the shares for less than $10,000 (because that is their market value), the employee will have a deductible loss from the scheme under the employee share scheme rules. They will have debt forgiveness income of an equal amount. 96 Example 8 – Loan funded scheme C Facts As for Example 6, except that: • as in Example 7, the sale back to the trustee must be for market value, whenever it occurs; • at the time of such a sale, the employer must pay the employee the amount of any decline in the value of the shares since the grant date. Result As for Example 6. Analysis The employer’s promise to pay a bonus equal to the decline in the value of the shares is a benefit which compensates the employee for a decline in the value of the shares. If the employee sells the shares for less than $10,000 they will have a deductible loss from the scheme, which will be equal to the income they will recognise due to the payment from the employer. Example 9 – Loan funded scheme D Facts As for Example 8, except that there is no arrangement for the employer to pay the employee the amount of any decline in value of the shares. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the agreement is entered into. Analysis From the time the agreement is entered into, the employee has the full risk and reward of share ownership. Example 10 – Vesting only in the event of a sale or IPO Facts C Co transfers 1,000 shares to a trustee for an employee. The shares remain held on trust until the employee leaves, more than 50% of C Co is sold, or C Co is listed (whichever happens first). If the employee leaves first, the shares are forfeited. If more than 50% of C Co is sold, the employee’s shares must also be sold and the employee will receive the proceeds. If C Co is listed, the shares are released to the employee. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the employee leaves, or C Co is sold or listed. 97 Analysis Because the employee forfeits the shares for no consideration if they leave, the share scheme taxing date will be deferred until the employee leaves (in which case there will be no income), the shares are sold (in which case the sale price will be taxable), or the shares are released to the employee (the market value of the shares will be taxable). Amount of income The amount of income to the employee will be the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date (or the transfer price if transferred to a non-associate, or the amount paid for cancellation, if cancelled by the employer) less the amount paid for them. Even where benefits are conferred on or transferred to an associate of an employee, it is always the employee who is taxed on the income. If the amount paid exceeds the value of the shares, the difference is deductible to the employee (proposed new section CE 2(3) in clause 12 and proposed new section DV 27(3) in clause 41). Apportionment for overseas service The proposed new rules contain an expanded income apportionment formula (proposed section CE 2(5) and (6) in clause 12). The expanded formula applies to all employees (rather than only transitional residents as in current section CE 2(9)). It excludes from taxable income employee share scheme benefits which accrue while a person is neither New Zealand resident nor deriving New Zealand source income. The extent of such accrual is determined by first establishing the entire period over which the benefit accrues, and then determining the proportion of that period during which the person is non-resident and not deriving New Zealand source income from their employment. The period of accrual ends once the rights vest, rather than when the income arises. So, for example, in the case of an option, the period of accrual ends once the options are exercisable rather than when they are actually exercised. The employee share scheme income is treated as non-residents’ foreign source income (which is not taxable income) to the extent of this proportion. Transfers to associates No change is proposed for the treatment of transfers to associates. Such transfers are ignored for purposes of calculating the employee’s share scheme income. Rollover relief for transfer to new scheme If a person’s employee share scheme rights are cancelled and replaced with rights in a different scheme, the value of the replacement rights is not included in the person’s income arising due to the cancellation of the original scheme (proposed sections CE 2(2)(c) in clause 12 and CE 7D in clause 14). The benefit provided by the replacement scheme will be taxed appropriately by applying the proposed new rules to that scheme 98 TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYERS’ DEDUCTION (Clauses 23 and 41) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes to provide a deduction to employers providing employee share benefits which matches the income to employees in timing and quantity. Deductions currently available for other payments need to be disallowed where those payments would otherwise lead to a double deduction. Application date The proposed changes will have the same application date as for the provisions applying to the taxation of employees – that is, they generally apply to benefits provided under employee share schemes which are not taxed under the existing rules within six months of enactment of the Bill. Key features The proposals will allow a deduction to employers equal in amount and timing to the income derived by an employee under the new rules. It would explicitly preserve deductions for the costs of running an employee share scheme, and for the cost of any bonus associated with a share scheme paid to an employee. No other deductions will be allowed. Background The principle of neutral tax treatment of employee share scheme benefits supports employers being entitled to a deduction for the value of the benefit provided. The fact that the issue of shares by a company does not involve an explicit cash cost does not affect this principle. That is, there is a transfer of value to the employee from the other shareholders, which arises whether that value is transferred as cash or as shares in the company. Under the corporate tax system, where company expenses are deducted by the company as a separate taxpayer from its shareholders, this cost must be recognised in the calculation of income by the company rather than the shareholders on whose behalf it is earned. Ways to create a deduction do exist. For example, payment of a bonus to the employee which is used to fund a full value share acquisition, contributions to an employee share trust or reimbursement to a parent company. However, the tax treatment of these transactions can be uncertain, and structuring to achieve these should not be necessary (they just incur unnecessary transaction costs). 99 There is also the potential for the amount and timing of the deduction created by these transactions to not correctly reflect the economic cost to the company of providing the employee share scheme benefits. Detailed analysis An employer is denied a deduction for provision of employee share scheme benefits (proposed section DV 27 in clause 41), except for: • costs incurred in administering or managing the scheme (proposed section DV 27(4)). These costs include legal and accounting fees incurred in setting up the scheme, as well as on-going management fees. Deductibility of these costs will be left to the usual tests, e.g. the capital/revenue test. Costs incurred by an employee share scheme trust will be treated as incurred by the employer or issuing company, as a result of the new provision treating an employee share scheme trust as a nominee; • the amount of the employee’s income, which is treated as a cost incurred at the same time as the employee recognises the income (proposed section DV 27(6)- (8)). Deductibility of this cost will depend on meeting the usual tests; and • amounts which are taxable to the employee as employment income other than as employee share scheme benefits (proposed section DV 27(5)). This is intended to preserve a deduction for the cost of paying a bonus where the payment of the bonus is part of the terms of an employee share scheme. Accordingly: • payments to fund an employee share scheme trust to acquire shares, or to reimburse a parent for providing shares, will not be deductible; and • as a practical matter, employers will need to either prohibit employees from transferring their rights to a non-associate before the share scheme taxing date, or place a requirement on employees to inform them of the time and amount paid in such a transfer, in order to correctly calculate their deduction. In order to prevent double deductions, when shares are provided to an employee and a deduction has been taken for that provision other than in accordance with to the new section, the deduction under the new section is reduced by the earlier deduction (proposed section DV 27(8)(b)). 100 EFFECT OF DEDUCTION AND PAYMENTS ON AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL (Clauses 7 and 10) Summary of proposed amendment The new rules seek to tax any benefit conferred on an employee by the issue of shares in an employee share scheme in the same way as an equivalent cash payment followed by an acquisition of shares in the issuing company. Consistent with this principle, the proposed rules provide for an increase in the employer’s available subscribed capital (ASC) by the amount deemed to be paid (plus actually paid) for the shares. The proposed rules also cater for the situation where the employer is not the company issuing the shares. This is a taxpayer-friendly measure to ensure employee share schemes are not disadvantaged as a form of remuneration compared with an equivalent cash transaction, which would generally give rise to an ASC increase. Application date The ASC rules will apply to the provision of shares which are taxed under the new rules. Key features The ASC proposals deal with the effect of employee share scheme transactions on the employer and (if different) the company issuing the shares. The amount of the deduction to the employer will give rise to additional ASC for both the employer and, if the shares issued are in the parent of the employer, the parent. In the latter case, any reimbursement paid to the parent will reduce the subsidiary’s ASC but will not increase the parent’s ASC. If the employer has income from the issue of the shares, that will reduce its ASC. The proposals also ensure that the acquisition of shares as part of an employee share scheme can be treated as an acquisition of treasury stock, regardless of whether the shares are acquired by the company itself and not cancelled, or are acquired by a trustee who is treated as a nominee of the company. Background To ensure neutrality between provision of benefits under an employee share scheme and an equivalent cash transaction, as well as providing for the income and deduction consequences, the new rules must provide for changes to a company’s ASC. 101 To do this, the proposed rules provide for an increase in the employer’s ASC by the amount deemed to be paid (plus actually paid) for the shares. The proposed rules also cater for the situation where the employer is not the company issuing the shares (this is common where the employer company is a subsidiary and the employee receives shares in the parent company). Additionally, in order to cater for the common practice of acquiring employee share scheme shares from other shareholders rather than by a fresh issue of shares, it is also necessary to ensure that the treasury stock regime can apply sensibly to employee share schemes. Detailed analysis Under clause 10, if the employer is also the company whose shares are provided, then the emplo yer’s ASC will be: • increased by: – the amount received for the provision of the shares (under existing section CD 43(2)(b)); and – the amount of its deduction for the provision of the shares (under proposed section CD 43(6E)(a)); • decreased by the amount of any income arising if it has income because the value of the shares provided is less than the amount received from the employee (under proposed section CD 43(29)). Example 1 Facts Employer Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee for $2 per share (that is, at a $1 per share discount). The scheme taxing date is the date of issue. The employee has $700 income and Employer Co has $700 deduction. ASC Result Employer Co’s ASC increases by $2,100, being the total of the $1,400 received and its $700 expenditure. 102 Example 2 Facts Employer Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee for $2 per share, funded by a loan from the employer. If the employee is still employed by the company after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus, which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employee in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $4 each. ASC result Issuing the shares gives rise to ASC of $1,400. If the shares are repurchased because the employee does not remain employed, that will usually give rise to an ASC reduction of $1,400. Otherwise, at the share scheme taxing date, Employer Co’s ASC will increase by $1,400, the amount which is both taxable to the employee and expenditure for Employer Co (making for a total increase in ASC as a result of the employee share scheme of $2,800). Example 3 Facts As for example 2, except that after one year the shares are worth $1 each. ASC result As for example 2, except that if the employee remains employed, Employer Co’s ASC will decrease by $700, the same amount that is both deductible to the employee and taxable to Employer Co. If the employer is not the company whose shares are provided, then its ASC will be: • increased by the amount of its deduction for providing the shares (proposed section CD 43(6E)(a)); • decreased by the amount of any income arising if it has income because the value of the shares is less than the amount received from the employee (proposed section CD 43(29)); • decreased by the amount of any reimbursement paid to the share provider (proposed section CD 43(6H)). The adjustment should be made to the employer’s share class most similar to the shares provided under the scheme. If the decrease due to reimbursement exceeds the increase arising due to a deduction, and the excess is greater than the ASC of the relevant share class, the reimbursement amount is to that extent taxed as a dividend (proposed section CD 43(6I)). 103 Example 4 Facts Parent Co, the 100% owner of Employer Co, issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share. The scheme taxing date is the date of issue. The employee has $700 income and Employer Co has $700 deduction. ASC result for Employer Co Employer Co’s ASC increases by the amount of its $700 expenditure. Example 5 Facts Parent Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share, funded by a loan from Parent Co. If the employee is still employed by the Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus from Employer Co, which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $4 each. ASC result for Employer Co If the employee stays employed for the year, at the share scheme taxing date, Employer Co’s ASC will increase by $1,400, the amount which is both taxable to the employee and expenditure for Employer Co under the employee share scheme rules. Example 6 Facts As for example 5, except that if the shares are not forfeited, Employer Co pays Parent Co $1 per share reimbursement. ASC result for Employer Co Employer Co’s ASC will increase by $700 if the employee remains employed, which is the difference between its $1,400 deduction and its $700 reimbursement to Parent Co. If the shares are provided by the ultimate parent of the employer, the ASC of the parent company will be: • increased by: – the amount paid by the employee for the shares (under existing section CD 43(2)(b)); and – the amount of the employer’s deduction for the provision of the shares (proposed section CD 43(6E)(b)); 104 • decreased by the amount of any income arising to the employer if it has income because the value of the shares provided is less than the amount received from the employee (proposed section CD 43(29)); and • unaffected by any amount paid to it by the employer (proposed section CD 43(20B)). Example 7 Facts As for example 4 above. ASC result for Parent Co Parent Co’s ASC increases by the $1,400 received for the issue of its shares plus the $700 deductible to Employer Co (for a total ASC increase of $2,100). Example 8 Facts As for example 5. ASC result for Parent Co The issue of the shares gives rise to ASC of $1,400. If the shares are repurchased by Parent Co because the employee does not remain employed, that will usually give rise to an ASC reduction of $1,400. Otherwise, at the share scheme taxing date, Parent Co’s ASC will increase by $1,400, the amount which is both taxable to the employee and expenditure for Employer Co. ASC Example 9 Facts As for example 6, except that the shares are worth $1 each after one year. ASC result Parent Co’s ASC will increase by $1,400 when the shares are issued. If the employee remains employed, (a) the reimbursement of $1 per share does not affect Parent Co’s ASC (b) Parent Co’s ASC decreases by $700 – the amount of the income arising to Employer Co as a result of the amount payable by the employee for the shares ($1,400) being in excess of the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date ($700). 105 Treasury stock If an employee share scheme trustee acquires shares for the purposes of the scheme, it is proposed that those shares will be treated as acquired by the share issuer (proposed section CE 6). The amount paid to the selling shareholder for their acquisition will be a dividend, unless one of the exceptions to dividend treatment applies. If the shares are held by the trustee, the treasury stock rules will apply to them. Amendments are proposed to the treasury stock rules so that they apply more clearly in such a case. Proposed measures in clause 7 make it explicit that the treasury stock regime can apply to an acquisition by an employee share scheme trust, just as if the shares were acquired by the company and not cancelled (amendments proposed to section CD 25(1)(a)). It is proposed that the shares are allocated to an emplo yee within one year of their acquisit ion, their acquisit ion and re-issue will be ignored by the share issuer (but not an employer who is not the share issuer) for ASC purposes (amendments proposed to section CD 25(2)(b)). Note that the shares would only have to be allocated to the employee under the scheme to qualify for treasury stock treatment, they do not have to be transferred to the employee. It is proposed that shares which are allocated to an employee within a year and then forfeited are treated as acquired by the company at that time for the amount the trustee paid for them when originally acquired (proposed section CD 25(7)). It is proposed that shares which are not allocated within one year be treated as having been acquired on market and cancelled (also amendments proposed to section CD 25(2)(b)). Example 10 Facts As for example 6 except that the shares are sold to the employee at the start of the period by an employee share scheme trust which acquired them on market for $2.50 per share six months before the allocation. The $1,400 loan is also provided by the trust. The trustee will hold the shares until the 12 months is up, and then either retain them in satisfaction of the loan, or transfer them to the employee. ASC result for Parent Co The trustee’s acquisition of the shares is treated as an on-market acquisition of treasury stock by Parent Co. Therefore both the acquisition and provision of shares to the employee have no effect on Parent Co’s ASC. There is no increase in Parent Co’s ASC as a result of Employer Co’s $1,400 deduction. If the employee does not stay for 12 months, Parent Co will be treated as acquiring the shares for $2.50 per share, the amount for which they were initially acquired on market. This acquisition will not affect Parent Co’s ASC if the shares are allocated to another employee within 12 months. ASC result for Employer Co If the employee stays for 12 months, Employer Co will have additional ASC of $700, being the excess of its $1,400 deduction over the $700 reimbursement paid to Parent Co. 106 EXEMPT SCHEMES (Clauses 25, 31, 42 and 248) Summary of proposed amendment The Income Tax Act 2007 currently provides a concessionary regime to encourage employers to offer shares to employees under certain widely-offered “share purchase schemes” (commonly known as “exempt schemes”). The current rules are out of date, complex and no longer fit for purpose. They also do not fit within New Zealand’s broad base, low rate framework. The proposed amendments: • modernise and simplify the criteria for these schemes, including removing employers’ 10% notional interest deduction; • increase the monetary threshold for the schemes (which has not been increased since 1980); and • address the current ability for employers to claim unintended deductions for the cost of providing the exempt share benefit to employees. Application date It is proposed that the amendments will generally apply from the date of enactment. However, clause 42 (new section DV 28), which denies employers a deduction for the cost of acquiring shares provided under an exempt scheme, applies from the date of the Bill’s introduction. Key features The proposed amendments, seek to simplify and clarify the legislation relating to exempt schemes, while retaining many of the key features of the original schemes and their tax treatment. In many cases, the requirements will be relaxed. Where the original policy is no longer appropriate or unintended consequences have arisen, the proposed amendments address this. Under the proposed amendments, shares provided to employees under schemes that meet certain criteria (described below in the detailed analysis) will be exempt income to the employees. Benefits provided under schemes that qualify for the current tax- exempt treatment will simply continue to qualify under the new legislation, but such schemes will be entitled to provide the same level of exempt benefit as new schemes. For all exempt schemes, from the date of introduction of the Bill, employers will be explicitly denied a deduction for the cost of providing the shares (other than scheme management and administration costs) and the 10% notional interest deduction will be repealed from the date of enactment. 107 The automat ic exempt ion fro m fringe benefit tax (FBT) for loans provided under exempt schemes in section CX 10(2) will continue. Background Since the 1970s, the Income Tax Act has contained a concessionary regime to encourage employers to offer shares to employees under certain widely-offered employee share schemes. The concession is on the basis that the schemes are designed to increase employee engagement at all levels of the company and align employee and shareholder incentives. They may also assist employees to develop and improve financial literacy skills. There are currently two main tax benefits available under the regime. 1. Exemption for emplo yee: The value of a benefit received by an employee under a concessionary scheme is not taxable to the employee. 2. Deemed interest deduction for employer: The employer is given a deemed deduction of 10% notional interest on loans made to employees to buy shares. This is addit io nal to any deduction for actual interest incurred on money borrowed to finance the scheme. Another benefit under the regime is that interest-free loans made under an exempt scheme are automatically exempt from FBT. The FBT-exempt status of the loans is a limited benefit. In most cases such loans would be FBT-exempt in any event, as “employee share loans” (that is, any loan provided by an employer to an employee to purchase its shares under an employee share scheme). The only real benefit of the specific FBT exemption is that the interest-free loan can be FBT-exempt regardless of the company’s dividend paying policy. To qualify as an exempt scheme, currently the scheme must meet all the following criteria. • The cost to employees of shares made available for purchase must not exceed their market value at the date of purchase (but may be less). • The amount that an employee spends on buying shares under the scheme (or a similar scheme) must not exceed $2,340 within a three-year period. • Every full-time permanent employee must be eligible to participate in the scheme on an equal basis with every other full-time permanent emplo yee. If the scheme applies to part-time employees or to seasonal employees, they must also be eligible to participate on an equal basis with every other part-time employee or every seasonal employee. • Any minimum period of service which may be required before a full-time permanent employee becomes eligible to participate must not exceed three years (or the equivalent of three years full-time service). • Loans to employees for the purchase of shares must be free of all interest and other charges. 108 • The repayment of loans by employees is to be by regular equal instalments at intervals of not more than one month over a period between three and five years from the date of the loan. • A trustee must hold the shares on trust for the employee for a period of restriction (generally at least three years). The benefits of the regime do not apply to shares given to directors of the company or a person who (with any associated person) holds 10% or more of the issued capital of the company. On the expiry of the restrictive period, the employee has two options. First, the employee can opt to have the shares transferred from the trust to them. Secondly, the emplo yee can opt for the trust to buy the shares back at the market value (but not more than the price paid by the employee). Problems with the current law There are various issues with the current regime: • the regime is complex and inflexible; • the tax benefits of the regime are uncertain and poorly targeted; • the regime does not explicitly limit the amount of tax-free benefit that can be conferred; • there are some minor drafting issues with the legislation; and • the maximum amount an employee can pay for shares ($2,340 over a three-year period) has not been adjusted since 1980, and this means as a practical matter that the benefits available under the regime are very limited. Adjusted for wage inflation, the figure would now be around $13,000. Detailed analysis Income tax exemption for shares provided under exempt schemes Clause 25 (new section CW 26B) provides that amounts derived from exempt schemes are exempt income. While a tax exemption for employment income does not fit generally within New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) tax framework, given there is a limit on the amount of benefit that can be provided under the scheme ($2,000 per employee per annum) and the scheme has to be offered to almost all employees, it is appropriate to retain the tax exemption to minimise compliance costs. The amendments propose retaining the exemption, but with a limit on the tax-free benefit that can be provided. 109 The existing law achieves the tax exemption by deeming the benefit derived under an exempt scheme to be zero (section CE 2(7)). The proposed amendments locate the exemption in subpart CW, which is a more appropriate part of the Income Tax Act for an exemption. Employer deduction for shares provided under exempt schemes There are currently several potential deductions associated with exempt schemes: 1. the 10% notional interest deduction with respect to employee share loans; 2. costs associated with setting up and running the scheme; and 3. in some cases, the direct or indirect costs of acquiring shares for the scheme. Clause 31 repeals the 10% notional interest deduction in 1 above. The original policy rationale for this benefit is unclear and it is inconsistent with our BBLR tax framework. Clause 42 proposes a new section DV 28 which denies a deduction for any costs associated with exempt schemes, other than administrative and management fees associated with setting up and running the scheme. This ensures that the unintended deductions identified in item 3 above are no longer available, but the deductions identified in item 2 are still available, subject to the usual limitations. This is consistent with the general deductibility provision for employee share scheme benefits in proposed new section DV 27 that only allows a deduction for administrative and management fees and for the provision of employee share scheme benefits to the extent that the benefit is assessable income to the employee. Meaning of exempt scheme and criteria for qualifying for exemption The proposed amendments have been designed to ensure existing schemes that meet the criteria described below can continue to operate without unnecessary disruption. Therefore, to the extent possible the existing rules have been retained and simply clarified. It is proposed that existing exempt schemes approved by the Commissioner under previous legislation (for example, section DC 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007), would continue to be “exempt schemes” and be eligible for the tax exemption, provided they continue to meet the existing criteria as modified by the increase in the benefit level in proposed section CW 26C(2). See proposed section CW 26C(1)(a). The underlying policy of the criteria is to ensure: 1. the scheme is genuinely offered to the vast majority o f emplo yees on equal terms – for example, it cannot just be targeted towards executives; 2. related to 1, all employees have to be able to afford to participate in the scheme, not just the more highly paid employees – this is achieved by limiting the cost of the shares that can be offered, requiring employers to provide financing for any cost or because the employee does not have to pay anything for the shares; 110 3. there is a limit on the benefit that can be provided tax-free; and 4. the scheme is genuinely a share scheme and not just a mechanism to provide tax-free cash to employees (this is why there is a restriction period). Criteria To achieve this policy, all the following proposed criteria must be met in order for a scheme to be exempt. • The cost to employees of shares made available for purchase must not exceed their market value at the date of purchase but may be less (proposed section CW 26C(2)(a)). • The maximum value of shares provided under an exempt scheme is $5,000 per annum (proposed section CW 26C(2)(b)). • The maximum discount an employer can provide to an employee is $2,000 per annum (proposed section CW 26C(2)(c)). This means that the most an employee can spend buying shares per annum is $3,000 ($3,000 plus the $2,000 discount means a maximum value of $5,000 worth of shares). This equates to a maximum cost of $9,000 over three years. • 90% or more of full-time permanent employees who are not subject to securities law of other jurisdictions must be eligible to participate in the scheme. If the scheme applies to part-time employees or to seasonal employees, the same threshold applies (proposed section CW 26C(3)(a)-(c)). Currently, all full time employees must be eligible to participate. • If the scheme has a minimum spend requirement, the amount can be no more than $1,000 per annum (proposed section CW 26C(3)(d)). This is the updated equivalent of section DC 13(4) and increases the $624 per three year figure. • Any minimum period of service which may be required before an employee becomes eligible to participate must not exceed three years (or the equivalent of three years full-time service) (proposed section CW 26C(3)(e)). • If the employee is required to pay any amount for the shares, then the employer must provide a loan for that amount or allow the employee to pay for the shares in instalments (proposed section CW 26C(4)(a)). • Loans to employees for the purchase of shares must be free of all interest and other charges (proposed section CW 26C(4)(b)). • Emplo yees will repay loans by regular equal instalments at intervals of not more than one month over a period between three and five years from the date of the loan (proposed section CW 26C(4)(c)). • Generally speaking, the shares have to be held for three years (either by the employee or by a trustee of a trust on behalf of the employee) – this is to ensure that the scheme is really a share purchase scheme, and not a mechanism for providing cash remuneration. If the employee has paid full market value for the shares, then they only have to hold them until they have fully repaid the loan – at this point they are like any other shareholder and should not have extra restrictions placed on them (proposed section CW 26C(7)). 111 • The employee can choose to withdraw from the scheme by giving the employer 1 month’s notice and have their shares purchased back for the lesser of market value and cost (proposed section 26C(5)). • If participation in the scheme is causing serious hardship for the employee, the terms of payment can be varied or employees can be allowed to withdraw from the scheme and receive the market value of their shares (proposed section CW 26C(6)). • If the employee leaves employment before the three years is up, then: – if they leave because of death, accident, sickness, redundancy or retirement at normal retiring age they can keep the shares (subject to repayment of the loan) or have the shares bought back for the lesser o f market value and cost; and – if they leave for any other reason, the shares are bought back at the lesser of cost and market value. (see proposed section CW 26C(6) and (9)). • The exempt scheme is not required to be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, however, the Commissioner must be notified of the scheme’s existence and the employer must advise the Commissioner when grants are made under the scheme (see clause 248 which contains proposed section 63B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and clause 31 which repeals section DC 12 – DC 15). • There is no requirement for a scheme to have a trust – many schemes have trusts as a matter of convenience. Removing this requirement provides greater flexibility (especially for small employers who may not want the administrative expense of operating a trust for a fairly small scheme). 112 TECHNICAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL MATTERS (Clauses 12, 14, 28, 60, 70, 74 and 187(26)) Summary of proposed amendments A number of transitional and consequential provisions are needed to support the core amendments. These provisio ns: • specify a cost base for shares acquired under an employee share scheme (proposed section CE 2(4)); • provide for the treatment of employee share scheme shares subject to the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules (amended section EX 38); • specify the treatment of employee share scheme trusts (proposed section CE 6 and repeal of existing section HC 27(3B)); • introduce a specific anti-avoidance rule to counteract tax avoidance transactions with respect to employee share schemes (proposed section GB 49B); • make a minor amendment to the penalties applying to employers who do not take reasonable care in reporting employee share scheme benefits (proposed amendments to the definition of “tax shortfall” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994); • provide transitional rules for existing schemes to ensure taxpayers have sufficient time to amend schemes (if necessary) to take account of the new law following enactment of the Bill (proposed new section CZ 1); and • replaces the former terminology – share purchase agreement – with the new term – employee share scheme – throughout the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994. Application date There are various application dates for each of the amendments, as specified below. Detailed analysis Cost base It is proposed that income from an employee share scheme benefit, be added to the cost of the shares for tax purposes (clause 12, proposed new section CE 2(4)). Similarly a deduction reduces the cost base. This provision applies from the date six months after the date of enactment. 113 FIF regime The Bill effectively excludes from the FIF regime employee share scheme shares which are treated as owned by the employee for tax purposes but for which the share scheme taxing date has not arisen. Before that time, it is appropriate to tax the dividends on the shares, but not appropriate to tax any change in value, since that will be taxed when the shares give rise to income under section CE 2. See clause 60, proposed amendments to section EX 38. This provision applies from the date six months after the date of enactment. Trusts As referred to above, an employee share scheme trustee will be treated as the nominee of the employer and (if different) the share issuing company (see clause 14, proposed section CE 6). This means that the activities of the trustee on behalf of those companies will be treated as undertaken directly by the companies themselves. They will therefore have no effect on the trustee’s taxable income. Section HC 27(3B), which deals with the situation where an employer has claimed a deduction for a settlement on an employee share scheme trustee, is proposed to be repealed, as such settlements will no longer be deductible. See clause 74. These provisions apply from the date six months after the date of enactment. Specific anti-avoidance provision Clause 70 of the Bill contains a specific anti-avoidance provision, in proposed section GB 49B. This allows the Commissioner to counteract any tax advantage gained from an arrangement which attempts to circumvent the intent and application of the share scheme taxing date, by seeking to have shares taxed either earlier or later than is consistent with that intent. This provision applies from the date six months after the date of enactment. Penalties Clause 187(26) of the Bill amends the definition of a “tax shortfall”, so that an employer who is required to report the amount of an employee’s share scheme income in a tax return, and who fails to take reasonable care in determining the amount of that income, is liable for the same shortfall penalty whether or not the employer has elected to pay PAYE on the benefit. There is no basis for differentiating in this respect between employers who do and those who do not withhold PAYE. This provision applies from the date of enactment. Transitional rules Employee share schemes are often long-term arrangements, lasting three or more years. Additionally, new share schemes are set up fairly regularly by companies and it is important for companies and employee participants to have clarity around the tax laws when they enter into these arrangements. 114 Accordingly, it is important to provide sufficient transitional measures for existing and contemplated employee share schemes. It is not desirable to put employers and employees in a position where employees are being granted employee share scheme benefits without certainty as to their tax treatment. However, it would also not be appropriate for employers and employees to be able to unduly extend the application of the existing rules by artificially qualifying for grandparenting grants of employee share scheme benefits which are not, in substance, intended to be conferred until a much later time. To balance these competing objectives, a 6 month period after enactment is proposed when benefits can continue to be taxed under the old law in specific circumstances. Clause 28 proposes section CZ 1 which provides that the new employee share scheme rules do not apply to shares granted or acquired before the publication of the officials’ issues paper on 12 May 2016. The new rules would also not apply to a particular share if: (i) that share was granted or acquired before the date that is six months after the date of enactment; (ii) the shares were not granted with a purpose of avoiding the application of the new law; and (iii) the share scheme taxing date under the new law is before 1 April 2022. If shares benefits are taxed under both the existing and proposed new rules, the new rules provide the employee with a credit for income recognised under the old rules. This transit io nal provision applies from the date six months after the date of enactment. 115 116 Other policy matters 117 118 ANNUAL SETTING OF INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2017–18 tax year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same that applied for the 2016–17 tax year. Application date The provision will apply for the 2017–18 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2017–18 tax year will be set at the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 119 DEMERGERS – COMPANY SPLITS BY AUSTRALIAN ASX LISTED COMPANIES (Clauses 8, 45, 63, 172(3) and 182) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments to the dividend rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 are proposed so that certain transfers of shares received by New Zealand shareholders as a result of a company split (demerger) by a listed Australian company are not treated as a dividend. Application date The amendments will apply for the 2016–17 and later income years. Key features New section CD 29C proposes that the transfer by an Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listed company of shares in a subsidiary company is not a dividend. New section ED 2B sets out the conditions needed for section CD 29C to apply and the tax consequences for taxpayers who hold the ASX-listed company’s shares as revenue account property. The new section also provides for the adjustment of available subscribed capital amounts. Consequential changes are proposed to sections FC 2 and YA 1. Schedule 25 is also to be consequentially amended. Background A demerger occurs when a corporate group splits off part of itself and distributes that part to its shareholders. As a consequence, companies that were grouped under a single shareholding are separated into two different shareholdings. Demergers, which do not involve a distribution of income, should not give rise to taxation consequences. However, under the Income Tax Act’s current dividend rules, the full value of the shares in the demerged (spun-out) company is treated as a dividend (even though there is no distribution of income and the shareholder’s economic ownership does not change). In practice, the amount of the dividend is usually significant, as it will equal a significant percentage of the corporate group’s total market value. The proposed amendments in the Bill deal with demergers by certain ASX-listed companies. The limited scope of the amendments is intended to deal with where the tax problems with demergers are the most immediate. Consideration of a more comprehensive set of rules for demergers by New Zealand and non-resident 120 companies generally would need to be separately prioritised under the Government’s tax policy work programme. Detailed analysis Scope of the proposed amendments The proposed amendments apply to shares and stapled securities issued by Australian- resident companies listed on the ASX. A company is considered an ASX-listed Australian company if it has shares included in an index that is an approved index under the ASX Operating Rules. From the 2017–18 income years, the scope of the ASX-listed Australian company definition will be widened to include a company included on the official list of ASX Limited, in line with the changes to the term made by the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016. The requirement that the Australian company maintain a franking credit account means that the proposed amendment does not apply to unit trusts. Unit trusts are not generally taxed as companies under Australian tax law and distributions from unit trusts are not taxed as dividends in Australia. To ensure that the proposed changes are not used to effect an in-substance distribution of income, proposed section ED 2B(1)(d) requires that the transfer is not a dividend under the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Taxpayers can refer to statements from the Australian Taxation Office or the company’s demerger documents to help determine this. As different countries have different taxation rules for companies and dividends, the scope of the provision is limited to companies that are resident in Australia. Australian tax law already includes anti-avoidance rules that are designed to prevent abuse and ensure that any relief from dividend taxation applies to demergers that do not involve an in-substance distribution of income. Treatment of shareholders Proposed section ED 2B sets out the consequences for taxpayers affected by a demerger that holds the shares as revenue account property. The new section sets out the rules for determining a new cost base for shares in the splitting company and shares in the new company. For pragmatic and compliance reasons, it is proposed that available subscribed capital amounts should be unchanged for the splitting company, and set at zero for the new company. 121 BANK ACCOUNT REQUIREMENT FOR IRD NUMBERS (Clause 244) Summary of proposed amendment Currently, offshore persons applying for an IRD number generally need to provide the Commissioner with evidence of a functional New Zealand bank account. Due to practical issues associated with this requirement, the proposed amendment gives the Commissioner a discretion to issue IRD numbers in cases where there is no New Zealand bank account but the Commissioner is satisfied with the applicant’s identity. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from the date of enactment of the Bill. Background Section 24BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner must not allocate an IRD number in response to an offshore person’s request unless the Commissioner first receives a current New Zealand bank account number for the offshore person. This section is subject to a limited number of exceptions. A bank account is not required when: • A person requires an IRD number only because they are a non-resident supplier of goods and services under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. • A reporting entity under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 has conducted customer due diligence procedures for the offshore person. The bank account requirement is also simplified for non-resident seasonal workers. They can use the NSW tax code for the first month of their employment, even though they may not have an IRD number and/or a New Zealand bank account. After that month, an IRD number must be provided for the NSW tax code to continue to apply, and a bank account is then required. The current bank account requirement has however caused practical issues in a number of cases. Significant delays or inability to obtain a New Zealand bank account in some cases have made it difficult for people to comply with their New Zealand tax obligations. The requirement can also impose undue compliance costs in some cases. The proposed amendment provides the Commissioner with a discretion to issue IRD numbers to offshore persons who do not have a New Zealand bank account, if she is satisfied with the identity of the offshore person. 122 PETROLEUM MINING DECOMMISSIONING (Clauses 17–21, 33–38, 48–52, 57, 95, 99, 100, 102–104, 113, 172(8), (44), (45), (47) and (49), 265 and 266) Summary of proposed amendments The tax rules for petroleum mining currently include a “spread-back” process which allows prior income tax periods to be reopened to include losses arising from decommissioning expenditure incurred in the current year. This method ensures that decommissioning expenditure, which is a large cost incurred near or at the end of production, does not result in a loss carried forward that would be of no value to the petroleum miner unless it had income from another source. As the spread-back requires Inland Revenue to amend assessments for previous periods it incurs high compliance and administration costs and is considered an outdated process. A number of other issues have also been identified where the current petroleum mining decommissioning rules are not sufficiently detailed or arrive at an incorrect outcome. As well as correcting the identified issues, the spread-back mechanism for deducting decommissioning costs is proposed to be replaced with a refundable credit similar to other refundable credits already included in the Income Tax Act 2007, most relevantly the refundable credit for mineral mining rehabilitation expenditure. Application date The proposed replacement of the spread-back with a refundable credit and other related provisions will apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. The proposed repeal of the terminating provisions in sections IZ 2 and IZ 3 and consequential changes will also apply for the 2018–19 and later income years. The proposed correction of the cross-reference in section IS 5(1)(a) will apply for the 2008–09 and later income years to align with the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed change to confirm credit use-of-money interest (UOMI) does not arise for the loss spread-back will apply to income tax returns filed after the introduction date of the Bill. This provision will be repealed for the 2018–19 and later income years along with the other spread-back provisions, as noted above. 123 Key features Refundable credit The main effect of the proposals in the Bill is to replace the existing spread-back process for petroleum mining decommissioning with a refundable credit. As part of these amendments a number of further refinements to the existing legislation have been included. Under the proposed new rules, a petroleum miner will be eligible for a refundable credit for the following amounts: • any decommissioning expenditure in the year it is incurred; and • any development expenditure that has not been deducted at the time commercial production ceases. The refundable credit will be calculated by multiplying the qualifying expenditure by the petroleum miner’s current tax rate. The maximum refundable credit will be limited to income tax paid by the petroleum miner, or a consolidated group it is a member of, in prior years. The exception to this is when a petroleum miner is decommissioning operations outside New Zealand, in which case the maximum refundable credit will be limited to income tax paid on petroleum mining operations outside New Zealand. To prevent a petroleum miner from temporarily ceasing commercial production in order to access a refundable credit, any expenditure qualifying for a refundable credit will be added back as income if production restarts. Use-of-money interest When a petroleum miner uses the spread-back process it receives a refund of income tax paid in prior years. This is a mechanism for recognising the tax benefit of expenditure incurred in a current period rather than a reduction in tax payable in those prior years. Accordingly, it was never intended that these refunds should be eligible for credit UOMI. The current provisions do not reflect this intent. The Bill therefore proposes to introduce a provision to ensure credit UOMI is not paid on any refunds arising from the current spread-back process. Terminating provisions Sections IZ 2 and IZ 3 are terminating provisions to preserve concessionary treatment that applied to petroleum miners before the rules changed in 1990. These provisions, and a number of consequential provisions, are now redundant and are proposed to be repealed. One of these consequential provisions is the section YA 1 definition of a “petroleum mining company”. The Bill proposes to remove this definition and several provisions that employ it. Under the proposals in the Bill, one instance of “petroleum mining company” will remain in the Income Tax Act 2007 – in the section YA 1 definition of a “controlled petroleum mining holding company”. This usage was not intended and will not rely on the “petroleum mining company” definition. Instead it will continue 124 to rely on the ordinary meaning of the words as a company that undertakes petroleum mining. Background The tax rules for petroleum mining split the life of a petroleum field into two distinct phases: exploration and development. “Exploration” is generally done under a prospecting or exploration permit and involves looking for oil and gas reserves that can be extracted in commercially feasible quantities, whereas “development” is done under a mining permit and involves the extraction of oil or gas for commercial production. “Exploration expenditure” is deductible when incurred whereas “development expenditure” is spread over either seven years or under the reserve depletion method which spreads the deduction over the remaining life of the field. A petroleum miner will incur significant decommissioning expenditure before relinquishing its mining permit. Decommissioning is what happens to wells, installations and surrounding infrastructure when a petroleum field reaches the end of its economic life. Offshore decommissioning usually involves: • the plugging and abandoning of wells; • removal of equipment; and • the complete or partial removal of installations and pipelines. The policy underlying the current tax rules recognises that this expenditure is an unavoidable consequence of the production process and that industry-specific timing rules should allow deductions for this expenditure to be effectively offset against income derived in earlier periods. In the absence of industry-specific tax rules a petroleum miner may pay tax in earlier periods then incur decommissioning expenditure which would be carried forward as a loss to future periods. Unless the petroleum miner had income from other sources, such as a separate field, this loss would never be utilised. The petroleum mining rules recognise that this would be inappropriate and would discourage petroleum exploration and development. Or, it could encourage a petroleum miner to decommission a field that still contained economically recoverable reserves to ensure that any deductions could be offset against the higher income amounts that are derived in earlier years of a field’s life. To address this issue, a petroleum miner can request that the Commissioner reopen earlier tax years to claim a deduction for losses arising “because of the relinquishment of the permit”. This process is referred to as a “spread-back”. Deductions are spread back to a previous year to the extent taxable income was returned generating a refund of tax, and if those deductions exceed the amount of profit the remainder is carried back another year and so on. 125 Historically, there were a number of spread-back provisions, for both income and deductions, in the Income Tax Act 2007. These spread-backs are viewed as an outdated approach that results in high compliance and administration costs. Many spread-back provisions have been removed as part of previous reforms and there are no remaining provisions that spread back deductions equivalent to the petroleu m decommissioning rules. The need to amend the petroleum mining rules is an opportunity to modernise the decommissioning rules in a manner that is broadly consistent with existing policy but reduces compliance and administration costs. Detailed analysis Amount of the refundable credit Under the proposed amendments a refundable credit will only be available to a petroleum miner for qualifying deductions. The deductions that can qualify for a refundable credit are expenditure on decommissioning or any previously undeducted development expenditure at the time petroleum mining operations are permanently ceased. To the extent a petroleum miner has a loss that is equal to or less than the qualifying deductions this amount is multiplied by the petroleum miner’s tax rate. For example, a petroleum miner with a $1,000,000 loss for a year, including $800,000 of decommissioning expenditure, could qualify for a refundable credit of $800,000 x 28% = $224,000. The refundable credit will be capped at the amount of income tax paid by the petroleum miner, and any consolidated group it is a member of, in all previous years. If the refundable credit arises from petroleum mining operations outside New Zealand, the amount of the refundable credit will be limited to New Zealand tax paid on those operations. No similar ring-fencing is proposed for petroleum mining operations within New Zealand. Any losses that did not qualify for a refundable credit would continue to be carried forward, subject to satisfying ordinary rules. Relinquishment of a permit The current spread-back process is driven off either the year in which a petroleum permit is relinquished or expenditure is incurred because of the relinquishment of the petroleum permit. This restriction causes a number of issues where the law is either unclear if a spread- back is available or disallows a spread-back when there is no good policy reason to do so. These issues include: • when a petroleum miner is required to undertake actions that are akin to removal or restoration operations while production is still continuing; 126 • when a petroleum miner has undertaken removal or restoration operations as part of a wind-up phase when production has ceased but there is a delay in relinquishing the permit; and • when a petroleum miner incurs removal or restoration expenditure before surrendering acreage from a petroleum mining permit but does not relinquish the entire permit. The Bill proposes that the requirement for a permit to be relinquished is replaced. Instead, a refundable credit will be available in the year qualifying decommissioning expenditure is incurred. In addition, a refundable credit will be available to the petroleum miner for any previously undeducted development expenditure in the year commercial production ceases. Decommissioning The definition of “removal or restoration operations” will effectively be replaced by the new definition of “decommissioning”. This change arises predominately due to the removal of the relinquishment of a permit criterion, as discussed above. The proposed definition of “decommissioning” is intended to cover actions undertaken by (or on behalf of) a petroleum miner to transition from the commercial production of petroleum to the eventual relinquishment of the permit. These actions can be undertaken at any point during the life of the permit area and will no longer be linked directly to the relinquishment of the permit. It is intended that, except as noted below, the definition of “decommissioning” does not apply to an exploration well. Expenditure on abandoning an exploration well will continue to be deductible under section DT 1(1) but will generally not meet the definition of “decommissioning” so will not qualify for a refundable credit. Actions to abandon a well that was drilled as an exploration well will only meet the definition of “decommissioning” in the following circumstances: • Exploration wells that have been subsequently used for commercial production. These wells will have triggered sections CT 3 and DT 7 and will meet the definition of a “commercial well” in paragraph (b)(i) of the decommissioning definit ion. • Exploration wells that are geologically contiguous with, and abandoned as part of an arrangement that includes decommissioning a commercial well. Such wells are used, or are suspended for potential future use, to support the extraction from commercial wells, and it may be commercially sensible for them to be abandoned at the same time that the commercial well is decommissioned. In addition to the actions above, the decommissioning definition also includes the ongoing monitoring of a commercial or exploratory well that had itself met the “decommissioning” definit io n. 127 Petroleum mining operations The definition of “petroleum mining operations” in section CT 6B is proposed to be amended by removing the “removal or restoration operations” criteria. The equivalent of “removal or restoration operations” in the proposed legislation is “decommissioning”. However, decommissioning has not been added to the definition of petroleum mining operations as the proposed definition of decommissioning uses the term “petroleum mining operations” so including decommissioning as part of petroleum mining operations would create a circular reference. So that the scope of petroleum mining operations is broadly maintained, a number of references within the Income Tax Act 2007 to petroleum mining operations are proposed to have “and decommissioning” added. Ceasing commercial production A petroleum miner who meets the other requirements will be entitled to a refundable credit for any previously undeducted development expenditure. This entitlement will be triggered once a petroleum miner permanently ceases commercial production. The definition of “petroleum mining operations” will be amended to exclude removal or restoration operations so that decommissioning will not be part of petroleum mining operations. As a consequence, in most instances, a petroleum miner that ceases commercial production will do so while continuing to undertake decommissioning, and production will cease in a period prior to the relinquishment of the permit. “Commercial production” is not a defined term but is already used in a number of places in the Income Tax Act 2007. It aligns with the term used in section DT 6 as “petroleum produced in commercial quantities on a continuing basis under a petroleum permit”. Petroleum extracted from an exploration well or under an exploration permit would not be treated as commercial production as it is not intended to be extracted on a continuing basis. Undeducted development expenditure will arise when a petroleum miner spreads development expenditure: • under the default method and ceases commercial production within seven years of development expenditure being incurred; or • under the reserve depletion method and ceases production before extracting all of the petroleum included in the probable reserve amount in the formula in section EJ 12B(3). The justification for allowing a refundable credit when commercial production ceases is that at this point the petroleum miner will no longer be deriving an enduring benefit from this development expenditure in future years even if the petroleum permit has not yet been relinquished. Restarting commercial production To prevent a petroleum miner from temporarily ceasing production in order to obtain a refundable credit before restarting production, a provision will add back as income amounts of undeducted development expenditure qualifying for a refundable credit in the year commercial production restarts. This income will then be spread, consistent 128 with other development expenditure, in a similar manner to that which already applies for the claw-back of exploration wells used for commercial production. This provision will apply when production is restarted to the extent that petroleum assets that were used in the original commercial production are reused in the resumed commercial production. This provision will not apply when a petroleum miner restarts production in the same area using entirely new assets. Notification requirements A petroleum miner must notify Inland Revenue before filing a return that includes a refundable credit. A separate email address for the petroleum mining desk within the Assurance area of Inland Revenue will be set up for this notification to be sent to. Further details on this notification process will be set out in a Tax Information Bulletin shortly after enactment of the Bill. This requirement has been included in the proposed legislation due to the potential size of a refundable credit and also because a petroleum miner that has finished decommissioning may no longer have a presence in New Zealand if the refundable credit was subsequently found to be incorrect. Aside from being before filing the return of income, no specific time will be specified for this notification to be provided. However, officials expect that providing the notification as soon as possible prior to the return being filed may assist in facilitating a timely refund. A petroleum miner that did not satisfy the notification requirement may be prevented from accessing a refundable credit in which case any losses would be carried forward in the standard manner. Interaction with imputation credit accounts A petroleum miner that is an ICA company will be required to have a sufficient credit balance in its imputation credit account to obtain a refund from a refundable credit. This arises under the existing legislation, as a refundable credit is a refund of overpaid tax under section RM 2(1B) and a refund of overpaid tax for an ICA company is restricted by section RM 13. Farm-out arrangements Farm-out arrangements are an existing feature in the petroleum mining rules where another party undertakes work for the petroleum miner in exchange for an interest in the permit or the profits arising from the permit. A farm-in party is already entitled to a deduction for farm-in expenditure, that if it were incurred by a farm-out party would be petroleum development expenditure, exploratory well expenditure, or prospecting expenditure. To the extent a farm-in party incurs decommissioning expenditure or has unamortised development expenditure upon the cessation of commercial production these deductions will also be eligible for a refundable credit. For the avoidance of doubt a number of provisions are proposed to specifically allow for this treatment by a farm-in party. 129 As wit h a petroleum miner, a farm-in party with unamortised development expenditure will only be eligible for a refundable credit when commercial production in a permit area ceases. If a farm-in party ceases production in that permit area but commercial production continues by a petroleum miner or another farm-in party no refundable credit will be available. 130 SCHEDULE 32 OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS (Clause 183) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 by adding five charities to the list of donee organisations in schedule 32. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 April 2017. Key features It is proposed to add five charitable organisations to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007, making donors to the following charities eligible for tax benefits on their donations. • Byond Disaster Relief New Zealand • Flying for Life Charitable Trust • Médecins Sans Frontières • Tony McClean Nepal Trust • Zimbabwe Rural Schools Library Trust. Background Donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 are entitled, as individual taxpayers, to a tax credit of 33 1 / 3 % of the monetary amount donated, up to the value of their taxable income. Companies and Māori Authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net inco me. Charities that apply funds towards purposes that are mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. Detailed analysis The five charitable organisations proposed to be added to schedule 32 are engaged in the fo llowing act ivit ies: 131 Byond Disaster Relief New Zealand Byond Disaster Relief New Zealand was formalised in 2015 to carry out New Zealand’s operations under the United Kingdom charity Byond Disaster Relief banner. The New Zealand charity’s purposes are directed at providing sustained support and assistance to communities in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster (emergency relief and supplies) and early long-term recovery. Their work focuses on supporting the rebuild and repair of infrastructure, particularly damaged schools, hospitals and medical clinics. The New Zealand trust has been involved in the responses to the recent Nepal earthquake and the 2016 cyclones and typhoons affecting Vanuatu and Fiji. Flying for Life Charitable Trust Established in 2009, Flying for Life Charitable Trust is the humanitarian aid arm of Mission Aviation Fellowship New Zealand (a charity that has been in existence since 1959). Flying for Life’s objectives are directed at the relief of poverty and providing emergency responses to natural disasters in the form of mobile (aviation) medical assistance and supporting aid agencies with transport of personnel and freight. Flying for Life’s largest project is focused on Papua New Guinea. It is also currently active in Africa, Timor Leste, Bangladesh and Mongolia. Médecins Sans Frontières New Zealand Charitable Trust Formed in 1971, Médecins Sans Frontières (also known as “Doctors Without Borders”) is a humanitarian organisation focused on providing emergency medical assistance to people affected by armed conflicts, epidemics, natural disasters and exclusion from healthcare around the world. The Médecins Sans Frontières New Zealand Charitable Trust was incorporated on 9 March 2016. The New Zealand trust activities are directed at raising funds in New Zealand to support Médecins Sans Frontières’ projects in nearly 70 countries around the world. Tony McClean Nepal Trust The Tony McClean Nepal Trust is active in the Lamjung district of Nepal. The Trust’s efforts are directed at improving education outcomes and the district’s infrastructure. Projects include providing the means for communities to access clean drinking water, reducing air pollution in homes through flued wood burners and funding the salaries of teachers and health care professionals in Lamjung. More recently, the Trust has been involved in providing disaster relief in the region following the 2015 Nepal earthquake. Zimbabwe Rural Schools Library Trust The Zimbabwe Rural Schools Library Trust, established in 2013, provides education and reading resources to underprivileged rural schools in Zimbabwe. 132 TRUSTEE CAPACITY (Clauses 77(1), (2), and (4), 172(5), 172(35), 173, 175, 176, 185, 187(10), 264(1), and 309, and schedule 1) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes to introduce a general rule into Part Y of the Income Tax Act 2007 to distinguish between a trustee’s personal or body corporate capacity, and their separate trustee capacity. A number of exceptions to this general rule are proposed where it would be contrary to the policy intent of the provisions to exclude a corporate or natural person trustee. There are also a number of proposed consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 result ing from the general trustee capacity amendment. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The key changes proposed in the Bill relate to the following: Income Tax Act 2007 • The introduction of a general rule to recognise that a person acting as a trustee of a trust is acting in a capacity that is separate from their other capacities. • An amendment to the “company” definition in section YA 1 excluding a company acting in its capacity as trustee. • An amendment to the “natural person” definition in section YA 1 excluding a natural person acting in their capacity as trustee. • A number of consequential amendments of a rationalising nature resulting from the general trustee capacity amendment. • An amendment to the “close company” definition in section YA 1 to allow trustees to continue to qualify as shareholders of a close company. • An amendment to section HD 15 (asset stripping of companies) to ensure the provision applies to a company that is acting in the capacity of trustee. • An amendment to the residence rules in sections YD 1 and YD 2 to ensure that the residence rules for natural persons and companies continue to apply to these persons acting in the capacity of trustee. 133 Tax Administration Act 2007 • Introducing a new definition of “natural person” to exclude a natural person acting in their capacity as trustee except for the purposes of the definition of qualifying resident foreign trustee and the serious hardship provisions in sections 177 and 177A. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 • The introduction of a provision into the GST associated person definition to associate a trustee and a person with the power to appoint or remove that trustee. Background The measure is intended to address the uncertainty surrounding the application of the voting interest test for corporate trustees as a result of two recent High Court decisio ns, Concepts 124 Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] NZHC 2140 and Staithes Drive Development Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2015\] NZHC 2593. These decisions have changed how the voting interest test, which is used to measure the ownership of companies, including their association, is applied to corporate trustees. In both cases, the High Court held that the voting interests in the relevant companies were held by the legal owner of shares, and effectively ignored the capacity in which those shares were held. This means that the voting rights attached to shares owned by a corporate trustee are attributed to that trustee’s natural person shareholders in their personal capacity. Applying this approach may lead to overreach of the application of the associated person rules. For example, if a solicitor holds shares in a trustee company, which in turn holds shares in a number of unrelated client companies on trust for unrelated beneficiaries, the otherwise unrelated client companies would be associated for tax purposes (see Table 1). This could also be the case for other trustee companies that hold shares in companies for otherwise unrelated trusts. While the High Court’s decision resulted in the correct outcome in these cases (that the companies were associated), the approach is inconsistent with the stated policy intention, which is that corporate trustees should be treated as ultimate shareholders and not looked-through. 134 The Bill proposes an amendment to align the legislation with the original policy intent as reflected in Tax Information Bulletin No 5, November 1989; Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 7, April 1992; and Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 8, 2009. The proposed amendment addresses this by introducing a general rule for trustee capacity, and some consequential changes to defined terms and operative provisions. The general rule confirms that a person’s trustee capacity is separate from a person’s other capacities. Detailed analysis General rule - general trustee capacity amendment Proposed section YA 5 will provide the core rule to distinguish between a trustee’s personal, body corporate, or other capacity, and their separate trustee capacity. The proposed amendment will clarify that when a person is acting in the capacity of trustee of a trust, they are treated, for income tax purposes, as acting in that capacity and not in their personal, body corporate, or other capacities. The proposed amendment clarifies that: • any reference to “company” in the Income Tax Act does not include a corporate trustee (subject to any identified exceptions); and • any reference to “natural person” in the Income Tax Act does not include a natural person trustee (subject to any identified exceptions). Officials consider that the amendment is consistent with the policy intent of most of the rules referring to companies and natural persons. Officials have also identified some specific exceptions to the general rule which are explained below. Table 1: Corp Trustee Co. Solicitor Client A Co. Client B Co. Client C Co. Client A beneficiary Client B beneficiary Client C beneficiary 100% 100% 100% 100% 135 The proposed amendment will also address the overreach that may arise as a result of the High Court decisions by ensuring that if a person is the trustee of more than one trust, the person is acting in a different capacity for each trust. In particular, the amendment will ensure that a corporate trustee is not looked-through, including for the purpose of association. “Company” and “natural persons” definitions As part of the introduction of the general trustee capacity rule, the Bill proposes amendments to the section YA 1 definitions of “company” and “natural person”. “Company” The amendment to the definition of “company” in section YA 1 introduces a new limb which excludes corporate trustees from the definition. Under this proposed rule, if a company is acting in its capacity as corporate trustee, it will be treated, for tax purposes, as a trustee (and not a company). This is consistent with the policy intent of most of the rules referring to companies. For example, the various company loss grouping and dividend provisions are not intended to apply to a company acting in its capacity as trustee. Also the exemption in section CW 9 for dividends derived from a foreign company would not apply to dividends derived by a corporate trustee resident in New Zealand. Another consequence of the general rule is that corporate trustees will not be able to apply the automatic interest deduction for companies in section DB 7. Like other non-corporates, they will need to satisfy the general permission to claim a deduction for interest expenditure under section DB 6. “Natural person” Similarly, the amendment to the definition of “natural person” introduces a new limb which excludes natural person trustees from the definition. Under this proposed rule, if a natural person is acting in their capacity as natural person trustee, they will be treated, for tax purposes, as a trustee (and not a natural person). Exceptions to general rule Officials have also identified a number of exceptions to the general rule which are explained below. “Close company” definition In response to the general trustee capacity amendment, the Bill proposes an amendment to section YA 1 to include trustees (natural person or corporate) in the definition of “close company”. The amendment recognises that many close companies are owned in family trust structures. As a consequence of this change, a minor amendment to section DG 3 is proposed to remove the reference to natural person trustees – as the clarification will no longer be necessary. 136 Asset stripping of companies The Bill proposes an amendment to section HD 15 (asset stripping of companies) to ensure the provision applies to a company acting in its capacity as trustee. The amendment is consistent with Inland Revenue’s view that section HD 15 applies to corporate trustees. Section HD 15 authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to recover income tax from the directors and shareholders of a company who have entered into an arrangement or transaction to deplete the company’s assets so that it is unable to satisfy its tax liabilities. Without the proposed amendment, a corporate trustee could enter an arrangement to deplete its assets so that it is unable to satisfy its tax liabilities, and the Commissioner would have no means of recovering any of the corporate trustee’s unpaid income tax from its directors or shareholders. Residence rules The Bill proposes an amendment to the residence rules in subpart YD of the Income Tax Act to clarify that both the natural person residency test in section YD 1, and the company residency test in section YD 2, continue to apply to trustees. Without this amendment, there would be no means of testing trustee residence. Along with this amendment, the Bill proposes to align section YD 1 with its original policy intent by replacing all references to “person” in the section with “natural person”. This clarifies the current practical application of section YD 1 to natural persons only. Consequential amendments A number of consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act are proposed to ensure the core rule applies consistently throughout the Act. These amendments either remove or replace phrases that will no longer be necessary given the general trustee capacity rule, or they repeal provisions that will no longer be necessary as a result. The proposed consequential amendments affect the following provisions: • CQ 5(1)(d) (When FIF income arises) • DG 3(3) (Meaning of asset for this subpart) • DG 14(1)(b)(i) (Interest expenditure: non-corporate shareholders) • DN 6(1)(d) (When FIF loss arises) • EX 68(1)(a) (Measurement of cost) • FE 3(1)(a) (Interest apportionment for individuals) • FE 4(1), paragraph (c) of the definition of excess debt entity • FE 4(1), definition of natural person • HA 7(1)(a) (Shareholding requirements) • MA 1 (What this subpart does) • OB 1(2)(ii) (General rules for companies with imputation credit accounts) 137 • RE 11(1) (Notification by companies) • RE 12(5)(a)(ii) (Interest) • YA 1, paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of initial provisional tax liability • YA 1, paragraph (a)(i) of the definition of “look-through counted owner” • YA 1, paragraph (c) of the definition of “look-through interest” • YB 3(5) (Company and a person other than company) • Schedule 1, part D, clause 4 (Basic tax rates: income tax, ESCT, RSCT, RWT, and attributed fringe benefits) Tax Administration Act 1994 The Bill proposes a new “natural person” definition in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to exclude a natural person acting in their capacity as trustee, consistent with the position under the Income Tax Act. The “company” definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 will continue to apply to the Tax Administration Act 1994 by virtue of section 3(2). The proposed amendment includes a carve-out to ensure all references to “natural person” in the “qualifying resident foreign trustee” definition and both sections 177 and 177A (serious hardship provisions), include a natural person trustee. The proposed carve-out is consistent with Inland Revenue’s policy that the hardship provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 are applicable to natural person trustees as natural person trustees are personally liable for trustee debts. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 The Bill proposes new section 2A(1)(hb) in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This will provide a mirror provision to section YB 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007, by providing a test associating a trustee and a person with the power to appoint or remove that trustee. This will help ensure that there would be association in similar situations to those that arose in the above High Court decisions. The proposed provision excludes a person holding the power of appointment or removal from the associated person test if they hold their position by virtue of their position as a provider of professional services. This carve-out is consistent with the equivalent test in section YB 11 of the Income Tax Act. 138 PHARMAC REBATES AND GST (Clauses 308 and 310) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment addresses current uncertainty around the GST treatment of rebates paid to Pharmac under an agreement to list a pharmaceutical on the Pharmaceutical Schedule. The amendment would ensure that the GST treatment for rebates paid to Pharmac is the same regardless of whether the rebates relate to pharmaceuticals purchased for use in the hospital setting (hospital rebates) or purchased for use in the community setting (community rebates). Application date The amendment will apply to rebates paid to Pharmac on or after 1 July 2018. Key features Section 25 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) is being amended to exclude rebates paid to Pharmac (either acting on its own account or as an agent for a public authority) under a Pharmac agreement, from altering the previously agreed consideration for the supply of pharmaceuticals. The amendment would mean that regardless of the rebate, pharmaceutical suppliers and recipient DHBs will not have to make the necessary GST adjustments required under section 25 of the GST Act. The terms “Pharmac”, “Pharmac agreement”, and “Pharmaceutical” are defined in proposed section 25(7) of the GST Act and are linked to the definitions and concepts in the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000. Background Under section 25 of the GST Act, suppliers and recipients are required to make adjustments when the agreed consideration for the supply of goods and services changes – for example, because of an offer of a discount or otherwise. The adjustments ensure that the correct amount of GST is returned and claimed on the supply. Credit and debit notes are used to adjust GST if a tax invoice or GST return has already been issued. Currently, rebates are paid to Pharmac (acting as agent for GST-registered DHBs) under a Pharmac agreement for a range of different circumstances, including when the pharmaceutical supplier wishes to provide a discount on a confidential basis. These rebate payments are passed onto DHBs in full. Owing to the unique way pharmaceuticals are publicly purchased in New Zealand, these rebates paid by 139 suppliers to Pharmac can have different GST treatments depending on whether the pharmaceuticals are purchased in the community setting or the hospital setting. Community rebates (which relate to pharmaceuticals purchased for use in the community by pharmacies) are not subject to GST as these payments are not considered to alter the previously agreed consideration for the supply of pharmaceutical products. In other words, there is not a sufficient connection between the rebate payment and the original purchase of the pharmaceuticals. Conversely, hospital rebates (which relate to pharmaceuticals purchased by DHBs for use in hospitals) are considered to alter the previously agreed consideration for the supply of pharmaceuticals and, therefore, are subject to GST. The different GST treatment gives rise to uncertainty and compliance costs for Pharmac and their suppliers in having to differentiate, for GST purposes, between community and hospital rebates and has become unworkable in practice. In the 2015–16 financial year, community rebates comprised 93 percent of all Pharmac rebates, while hospital rebates made up the remaining 7 percent. The proposed amendment clarifies the current uncertainty associated with the different GST treatments. It would also minimise the administrative costs of change to Pharmac and its suppliers by aligning the GST treatment of hospital rebates with 93 percent of Pharmac rebates that are already not subject to GST. The fiscal impact of the rebates is neutral under either setting. In the hospital setting the supplier grosses up the rebate payments by the GST amount, and the subsequent adjustments made by the supplier and DHBs cancel each other out. 140 LLOYD’S OF LONDON – TAX SIMPLIFICATION (Clauses 16, 43, 62, 76, 78, 91, 172(31), (33), (38), (55) and (69), 179 and 180(1)) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 are proposed to simplify tax compliance obligations for Lloyd’s of London (Lloyd’s) in connection with the taxation of life insurance business carried on in New Zealand. Application date The amendments will apply to Lloyd’s term life insurance policies sold on and after 1 April 2017. Key features Collectively the proposed amendments create a special presumptive tax on premiums received by Lloyd’s from the sale of term life insurance policies in New Zealand. Tax would be assessed and returned by Lloyd’s authorised New Zealand agents. The presumptive tax would be calculated on the basis of 10 percent of gross premiums. The tax rate applicable to this income would be 28%, consistent with the current rate of company tax. This approach is consistent with the policy framework for taxing general insurance sold to the New Zealand market by non-resident insurers. New section YD 8B determines when the sale of life insurance by Lloyd’s has a source in New Zealand. The new section specifies that 10 percent of the gross premium has a source in New Zealand if the life insurance policy is offered or was offered and entered into New Zealand. The section also specifies the special tax rules that apply to the New Zealand sourced income and the type of life insurance policies affected. The section applies to term life insurance policies – life insurance policies that insure life risk only. Profit participation policies and savings product policies are not within the scope of the proposed amendments. New section CR 3B treats the portion of the premium that has a source in New Zealand as taxable income. New section DW 3B denies deductions for any expenditure or loss that has a nexus to income under section CR 3B. Section EY 10 is being amended to ensure that the life insurance taxation rules do not apply to Lloyd’s in respect of any income to which section CR 3B applies. This change ensures that section EY 48 does not have application to Lloyd’s New Zealand life business. 141 New section HR 13 sets out the obligations on Lloyd’s under the Income Tax Act 2007 and treats Lloyd’s underwriters as one person. This section establishes that Lloyd’s is a New Zealand taxpayer in respect of income that is treated as having a source in New Zealand. This section allows for the operation of section HD 17B in connection with the payment and return of tax by Lloyd’s authorised agents. New section HD 17B treats an agent for Lloyd’s as responsible on Lloyd’s behalf for: • calculating the tax payable on income under section CR 3B; • paying the required amount of tax; and • providing the necessary returns of income. The obligation on the agent under section HD 17B is limited to the premiums the agents is required to pay to Lloyd’s. The section ensures that the agent is only responsible for the Lloyd’s business it facilitates, not the entire extent of Lloyd’s New Zealand life business. Section HD 17B also ensures that banks and other non-bank deposit takers are not treated as an agent of Lloyd’s to the extent that they facilitate payment of any life insurance premiums. Section HD 3 is being consequentially amended in respect of the obligations on Lloyd’s agents under section HD 17B. Schedule 1 is being amended to specify that the tax rate on income under section CR 3B is 28%. Background Lloyd’s is an insurance market, not an insurance company, and has regulatory approval from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to underwrite life risk in New Zealand. Members of Lloyd’s, both corporate and individuals, join together in syndicates to insure risk. The current taxation rules for non-resident life insurers would mean that each Member would be required to obtain an Inland Revenue number and file an annual tax return for any life business in New Zealand. The cost of compliance and associated administration cost under current tax law is considered to be disproportionate to the projected tax revenue involved and could act as a barrier to enter the New Zealand life insurance market. The proposed amendments seek to reduce compliance and administration costs with an associated immaterial fiscal impact relative to the status quo. Precedent exists in tax and prudential supervision law in New Zealand and Australia to accommodate Lloyd’s unique business structure. Tax policy officials propose to review in 2020, and periodically thereafter, whether the proposed amendments fairly reflect the tax that should be paid on profit Lloyd’s makes from selling life insurance in New Zealand. 142 Remedial items 143 144 EMPLOYEE MEAL ALLOWANCES AND DEFINITION OF “EMPLOYER’S WORKPLACE” (Clause 24) Summary of proposed amendments The term “employer’s workplace” in section CW 17CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 (Payments for certain work-related meals) is to be clarified as meaning the workplace of the employer at which the employee normally works. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2015, to coincide with the application date of section CW 17CB. Background Generally meal allowances and similar payments made to employees are taxable to the employee as they provide a private benefit to the employee. However, there is an exemption for meal allowances and similar employer meal payments that are provided to employees who are working away from their emplo yer’s workplace. This exemption is a practical way of recognising that although the cost of a meal is a private expense, there are additional costs for the employee as a result of their emplo yer requiring them to work away from their usual place o f work. Section CW 17CB, enacted in 2014, specifies the situations when the exemption applies. For the exemption to apply, the legislation requires the employee to be working away from his or her “employer’s workplace”. When an emplo yer has mult iple workplaces, the issue is whether the workplaces that are not the employee’s normal place of work are intended to be covered by the term “employer’s workplace”. For example, an employer may have offices throughout New Zealand and while employees are generally based at particular offices, their work may require them to occasionally work at other offices. 7 From a policy perspective, meal allowances and reimbursements should be tax-free if they are genuinely business-related, irrespective of where the work takes place away from the employee’s normal workplace. This includes work at other offices of the employer. The proposed amendment clarifies this intention. 7 Officials’ understanding is that even in the case of employees that have multiple workplaces the employee will be assigned to a particular cost centre or office. 145 PIE REMEDIALS (Clauses 80, 82–83, 86–88, 172(25) and 217) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill makes a number of amendments to the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules to ensure the legislation aligns with the policy intent and operational practice. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Notification requirements A mult i-rate PIE must elect to use any of the exit calculation, quarterly calculation or provisional tax calculation options. The provisions that allow for these elections state that the notice requirements are set out in section 31B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. While existing section 31B sets out the notification requirements for PIEs, the provisions only relate to notification requirements when an entity elects to become a PIE or cancel its PIE status. Proposed section 31B(1B) will provide the notification requirements for these elect ions consistent with the existing process. PIE losses In general, mult i-rate PIEs are able to cash out their tax losses for the current tax year. Provisional tax PIEs are an exception to this general approach – they are required to carry forward their losses to a later tax year. This less favourable treatment of tax losses was part of the policy trade-off for provisional tax PIEs getting simpler rules. When an entity elects to become a PIE any loss brought forward is treated as a formation loss and spread over three years. Allowing that loss balance to be immediately cashed out could potentially have a significant impact on aggregate tax collections. The formation loss rules therefore exist largely to protect the Government’s revenue flows. The legislation does not currently cover the treatment of a loss carried forward by a provisional tax PIE when it elects to use the quarterly or exit options. The policy intention is this should also be treated as a formation loss so that a provisional tax PIE cannot cash out its losses by electing out of the provisional tax calculation method. 146 However, the current definit io n of a “formation loss” only includes losses incurred prior to the entity becoming a PIE rather than when it was already a PIE using a different calculation method. The Bill proposes to extend the definit io n o f “formation losses” to include a tax loss arising from a period a PIE applied the provisional tax calculation method before applying a different calculation method. Ownership interests Subject to a number of exceptions, a PIE (or investor class within a PIE) can only own up to 20 percent of another entity. This is known as the outbound investment test and is designed so that the PIE cannot exert a significant influence on the underlying entity. Unlike most comparable tests in the Income Tax Act 2007, this test currently only applies to voting interests without having a market value interest test. A consequence is that a PIE can potentially undertake investments that are any proportion of the value of the underlying entity provided voting interests do not exceed 20 percent. This would allow the PIE to undertake investments that could not be considered portfolio investments and would not be comparable with anything available to an individual investor other than through a PIE. The Bill proposes to insert a rule that a PIE cannot hold a market value interest of greater than 20 percent other than when an existing exemption applies. Unit trusts and the PIE rules The entrance criteria to the PIE rules for collective schemes and foreign PIE equivalents, in addition to other entity types such as a company or a superannuation scheme, both include a criteria starting with “the trustee of a trust that would be a unit trust”. Two issues arise from these provisions. The intention of this category is to allow trusts, which meet the other requirements, to be a PIE, including when an entity with sufficient owners to meet the PIE entrance requirements in its own right holds all the units in a trust that elects to be a PIE. The phrase “the trustee of a trust” is used in numerous places in the Income Tax Act 2007 and reflects that a trust has no legal personality and instead the trustee is liable for the trustee’s actions on behalf of the trust and its beneficiaries. However, in this context, applying the test to the trustee instead of the trust is inappropriate. This is because the PIE rules are intended to apply to widely held investment vehicles, or vehicles that are used for investment by other widely held investment vehicles. However, the current provisions would allow a person who was not intended to receive the benefits of the PIE regime (for example, a New Zealand trading company) to set up a PIE using a trust where the trustees met the PIE entrance requirements. This issue could be resolved by removing the words “the trustee of” from the relevant provisio ns. 147 Historically it was considered that one of the requirements for a trust to be a unit trust was that it had more than one unit holder (for example, see public ruling BR Pub 95/5A Relationship between the “unit trust” and “qualifying trust” definitions). This restrict ion was not considered necessary for the purposes of a trust accessing the PIE rules, hence the wording of sections HM 3(1)(b)(iii) and HM 9(c) including “a trust that would be a unit trust if there were more than 1 subscriber, purchaser, or contributor participating as beneficiaries under the trust”. On 29 July 2016 Inland Revenue released interpretation statement IS 16/02: Income Tax – Unit Trusts – When a unit trust can have a single unit holder. This interpretation statement concludes that the essential feature of a unit trust is the provision of the facilities for subscribers to participate, and that is not altered by there being only one subscriber or the intention that there will continue to be only one subscriber. On the basis of this interpretation the relevant wording of the entrance provisions shown above is now largely redundant as a trust that would be a unit trust if there were more than one subscriber, purchaser, or contributor would already not be excluded by only having one subscriber, purchaser, or contributor provided there were facilities for more than one subscriber, purchaser, or contributor. These trusts will therefore be unit trusts which meet the existing entrance criteria as a company in sections HM 3(1)(b)(i) and HM 9(a). The Bill therefore proposes to repeal sections HM 3(1)(b)(iii) and HM 9(c) as they are no longer necessary. 148 DONATION TAX CREDITS FOR DONATIONS TO COMMUNITY HOUSING ENTITIES (Clause 109) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment to section LD 3(2)(ac) of the Income Tax Act 2007 clarifies that tax credits for donations made to community housing entities can only be claimed for the period the entity qualifies for the income tax exemption in section CW 42B. Application date The amendment will apply from 14 April 2014, when the sections LD 3(2)(ac) and CW 42B came into force. Key features The proposed amendment to section LD 3(2)(ac) will ensure that donation tax credits are only available for donations made to a community housing entity during the period the entity qualifies for the income tax exemption under section CW 42B. Background From 14 April 2014 donations made to community housing entities that meet the requirements to derive exempt income under section CW 42B qualify for a donation tax credit. Due to an earlier change to section LD 3(2)(ac), donors have been able to claim a tax credit for a donation made to a community housing entity when the entity does not meet the requirements of section CW 42B. This has occurred because the current wording of section LD 3(2)(ac) states that a donation tax credit is available for donations made in a tax year that the entity meets the requirements to derive exempt income under section CW 42B. This means that a donation made to an entity that began a tax year qualifying for the section CW 42B income tax exemption, but ceased to qualify later in that year, would still qualify for a donation tax credit. For example, if a community housing entity met the section CW 42B requirements from 1 April 2016 until 30 September 2016, under the current wording of section LD 3(2)(ac), any donations made to that entity between 1 October 2016 and 31 March 2017 would qualify for a donation tax credit because the donation was made during the 2016–17 tax year. This was not the intention of the provision. The amendment will bring the provision in line with its underlying policy intention. 149 THE USE OF PART-YEAR ACCOUNTS FOR THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TEST (Clauses 58(2) and (3), and 59) Summary of proposed amendment New section EX 21F of the Income Tax Act 2007 will allow a person (or a member of their group) who only holds an income interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC) for part of an accounting period to use accounts that cover that part-period to calculate whether the CFC passes the active business test under the accounting standards test. Application date The amendment will come into force on 1 July 2009. Background The proposed amendment addresses the concern that a person who only owns an income interest in a CFC for part of an accounting period may not have access to the CFC’s prepared accounts for the full accounting period and must therefore use the default test to determine whether the CFC passes or fails the active business test. To determine whether a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B, two different methods are available – the default test in section EX 21D and the accounting standards test in section EX 21E. The default test uses tax concepts specified in the Income Tax Act 2007, while the accounting standards test allows the taxpayer to use accounts prepared under a permitted accounting standard (for example, International Financial Report Standards (IFRS) with some adjustments. If less than 5 percent of the CFC’s total income is passive income under either method, the active business test is passed, the CFC is a non-attributing active CFC and no CFC income or loss is required to be attributed. If a person uses the accounting standards test and breaches the 5 percent threshold, they may then do the calculation using the default test. If they fail the active business test using the default test, they are required to calculate their attributable CFC income or loss for the accounting period. There is some overlap between the calculations undertaken for the default test and the calculations undertaken to calculate the attributable CFC income or loss. The calculation under both the default test and the accounting standards test look at the full accounting period for the CFC. Under the accounting standards test, this requires a set of accounts for the full accounting period prepared under an applicable accounting standard, for example IFRS. 150 One issue is that when a person only has an income interest in a CFC for part of the accounting period, they may not have a set of accounts for the full accounting period which meets the required standard. This means they are unable to use the accounting standards test and must instead use the default test, which can be more compliance intensive, even if it is clear that the CFC is an active business. Proposed new section EX 21F will allow a person who (or a member of their group) only holds an income interest in a CFC for part of an accounting period to determine whether the active business test is passed under the accounting standards test, using accounts prepared for that part-period of ownership, provided the accounts meet the other requirements set out in sections EX 21C and EX 21E. If the accounts do not meet the requirements of section EX 21C or if they do not cover the entire part of the accounting period when the CFC is owned by the person or a member of the person’s group, they must use the default test in section EX 21D. If the CFC passes the active business test using the part-period accounts, it will be a non-attributing active CFC for the full accounting period, but only for that person (or a member of that person’s group) whose income interest in the CFC covers the part- period, as provided for in proposed new section EX 21F(3). Other income interest holders must undertake their own calculations. In the event that the CFC fails the active business test using the accounting standards test for the part-period, proposed new section EX 21F(4) clarifies that the person must use the default test for the full accounting period. 151 AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS (Clause 112) Summary of proposed amendment Under the proposed change, a foreign tax credit will be available under section LK 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for foreign income tax paid in relation to a CFC from which attributable income is derived, when the foreign income tax has been paid by the taxpayer’s parent or a member of the taxpayer’s group. Application date The amendment will come into force on 1 July 2009. Background The proposed amendment recognises that there are some situations in which foreign income tax has been paid, but not by the CFC or the direct New Zealand shareholder and that a foreign tax credit should be available when it has been paid by a person who is part of the same functional economic unit – for example, the New Zealand shareholder’s group. Under section LK 1, a person with attributed CFC income is provided a tax credit for income tax paid in relation to the CFC. This ensures that the income derived by the CFC is not double taxed. Similarly, a foreign tax credit is also provided under section LK 1 for foreign income tax (including withholding tax) paid in relation to the CFC against the New Zealand shareholder’s income tax liability. For a foreign tax credit to be available under section LK 1, the foreign income tax must be paid by the CFC from which the income is derived or by the person with the attributed CFC income in relation to the CFC from which the income is derived. In some situations, it is possible that foreign income tax has been paid in relation to the CFC from which the attributed income is derived, but neither by the CFC nor by the person with the attributed CFC income. This could occur, for example, if both the CFC and the person are seen as transparent by the CFC’s home jurisdiction. As a result, the foreign income tax may in reality be paid by the person’s parent company or another member of the person’s group. Section LK 6 provides for the use of credits by group companies in some situations. To make a tax credit available to another group company under section LK 6, the requirements of the loss grouping rules under subpart IC must be met (by reading references to a tax loss as a reference to a tax credit). 152 However, as a starting point, a tax credit must first exist under section LK 1. This means that the person must have an amount of attributed CFC income before a tax credit can be used under section LK 6. In the example outlined above, the company that has paid the foreign income tax in relation to the CFC may not necessarily have attributed CFC income, which means it does not have a tax credit under section LK 1 and therefore cannot allow the taxpayer that does have the income tax liability under the CFC rules to access the credit under section LK 6. Proposed new section LK 1(1B) will provide the person paying the foreign income tax, whether it be the parent or a group member of the person with the attributed CFC income, a tax credit under sections LK 1 and LK 6. The rationale for the proposed amendment is that foreign income tax has been paid in relation to the CFC and by a taxpayer who is economically part of the same unit as the person who has the income interest in the CFC. 153 INSURANCE BUSINESS CFCS (Clause 260) Summary of proposed amendment Section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may issue a determination that an overseas insurance business is a non-attributing active CFC. The proposed amendment removes the requirement that the CFC must have been owned prior to 30 June 2009 for a determination to be issued under section 91AAQ, which will allow overseas insurance businesses acquired after 30 June 2009 to qualify. Application date The amendment will come into force on 1 April 2017. Background Under the CFC rules, income from insurance is treated as passive income and therefore must be attributed to the New Zealand shareholder. As a result, New Zealand insurance companies with foreign subsidiaries operating active insurance businesses in foreign markets do not pass the active business test and are required to attribute income back to New Zealand under the CFC rules. Several constraints, including the complexity of the issues involved precluded the drafting of special rules for financial institutions (including insurance companies), it was not possible to do so at the same time the active income exemption was introduced. This work was due to be taken forward in the second phase of the international tax review, alongside the work on non-portfolio FIFs and offshore branches. Legislation for the extension of the active income exemption for non- portfolio FIFs was enacted in 2012 and work on the application of the active business test to financial institutions would have followed the work on offshore branches, but for other priorities. A transitional measure was introduced at the same time as the active income exemption, which allows the Commissioner to issue a determination under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This measure allows a New Zealand insurance company to pass the active business test in relation to an offshore active insurance business if it can demonstrate that the offshore insurance business is an active business. The determination facility was not made available for other types of financial institutions because the boundary between active and passive income is less apparent. 154 One of the requirements that must be met for the Commissioner to be able to issue a determination is that before 30 June 2009, the offshore insurance business must have been controlled by a New Zealand resident and it must have operated a business of insurance in its country of residence. This date requirement was deemed necessary as the determination facility was only intended to be a transitional measure until further work could be completed on extending the active business test to financial institutions more generally. As it is not clear when this work will be progressed, the Bill proposes to remove the 30 June 2009 ownership requirement from section 91AAQ. This will allow New Zealand insurances companies with offshore insurance subsidiaries to apply for a determination under section 91AAQ to deem the subsidiary a non-attributing active CFC, regardless of when the subsidiary was acquired. Section 91AAQ also lists a number of other requirements that the Commissioner must be confident are satisfied before issuing a determination. There is no proposal to amend these as they ensure that only legitimate active insurance businesses are able to make use of section 91AAQ and not subsidiaries that are only set up to arrange insurance for related parties, for example. 155 UPDATING THE STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES SCHEDULE (Clause 184) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill adds two state enterprises to the list of state enterprises in schedule 36, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007. Under the Income Tax Act 2007 public authorities are exempt from income tax. State enterprises and mixed- ownership enterprises are excluded from this exemption and are required to pay income tax. Schedule 36, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains a list of state enterprises that are excluded from the public authority exemption. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features It is proposed to add the following state enterprises to schedule 36, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007: • Animal Control Products Ltd • Kordia Group Ltd. 156 TRADING GAINS OF NON-RESIDENT INVESTMENT FUNDS (Clauses 26 and 30) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment clarifies that the trading gains of non-resident investment funds (foreign PIE equivalents) from the disposal of shares and financial arrangements are to be treated as excluded (non-taxable) income. It is also provided that foreign PIE equivalents are not entitled to a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving that excluded income. This amendment ensures consistency of tax treatment for foreign PIE equivalents and other methods of inbound foreign portfolio investment in New Zealand, such as the foreign investor variable rate PIE regime. Application date The amendment will have retrospective effect from 1 April 2012, the date on which the foreign investor variable rate PIE provisions came into effect. 157 PREVENTING UNINTENDED DEDUCTIONS FOR CONSOLIDATED GROUPS (Clause 29) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment addresses an anomaly whereby a member of a consolidated group is currently entitled to a deduction for the cost of purchasing shares (or other excepted financial arrangements) as revenue account property in a company outside the group which subsequently joins the group. The deduction the amendment seeks to remove arises when the shares are cancelled (whether by redemption, amalgamation, liquidation or otherwise) and where at the time of cancellation the issuer of the shares and the holder are members of the same consolidated group. Because the cancellation does not give rise to any income to the holder, removing the deduction results in a net nil posit ion for inco me tax. This matches the economic reality. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2016–17 and later income years. Key features The anomaly sought to be addressed by the proposed amendment arises when a company subscribes for shares in an entity that is not in the same consolidated group, then the two entities subsequently become members of the same consolidated group thus cancelling the shares. In this case the holder is currently st ill entit led to a deduction for the cost of the shares but the amount derived from the cancellation of the shares will be excluded income under the consolidation regime. This anomaly arises as the consolidation provision that eliminates the income only achieves the correct result if there has not already been a deduction. To address this anomaly the amendment in new section DB 23B will deny the holder a deduction for the cost of the revenue account shares that cease to exist in that year as a result of a transaction or arrangement between two members of a consolidated group. Where the shares are cancelled in the year they are acquired, the deduction denied is the expenditure incurred as the cost of revenue account property. When the shares are cancelled in a subsequent year the deduction denied is the value of the shares at the end of the previous income year calculated at their cost price. Background When a person acquires shares, or any other excepted financial arrangements, as revenue account property they are entitled to a deduction for the cost of the shares in the year they are acquired. If the shares are still held at the end of the year they derive income equal to the cost of those shares, so there is no net deduction. In following 158 years they are entitled to a deduction for the cost of the shares at the start of the year and if still held at the end of the year they derive income equal to the cost of the shares so again there is no net deduction. In the year the shares are disposed of or are cancelled the person derives income for the amount they receive from that transaction. In that final year the opening deduction (for the original cost of the shares) and income on disposal or cancellation result in net income or a net loss. If the shares were issued by a company in a consolidated group to another company in that consolidated group, the consolidation provisions ensure no assessable income or deductions arise as all transactions are within that consolidated group. However, under current law, if a holder acquires shares (and so is entitled to a deduction as described above) and then enters a consolidated group with the issuer of the shares the group will not derive income if the shares are cancelled, as that cancellation occurs entirely within the consolidated group. Through this process the consolidated group will be entitled to a deduction with no corresponding income even though there has been no economic loss to the group. The amendment will align the law wit h the policy intent by preventing a deduction in this circumstance. 159 CHILD SUPPORT (PRISON WORK INCOME) (Clauses 313 and 314) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment clarifies that payments made by the Department of Corrections to prisoners are not considered “income” for the purposes of granting an exemption from payment of financial support. Application date The amendment comes into force on 1 April 2017. Key features Sections 89D and 89F of the Child Support Act 1991 clarify that income earned from employment under section 66 of the Corrections Act 2004 does not prevent a liable person from receiving an exemption from payment of financial support. Background Under the Child Support Act 1991 liable parents who are long-term prisoners are eligible to seek an exemption from payment of financial support (child support and domestic maintenance) on the grounds that they have no income, or only a very small amount of income from investments, while in prison. The Department of Corrections makes small incentive payments to prisoners participating in prisoner employment activities (under section 66 of the Corrections Act 2004). Prisoners receiving these payments have historically qualified for an exemption as the payments were not considered “income”. Inland Revenue recently determined that these payments are, in fact, income. This means prisoners receiving them will no longer qualify for an exemption. The policy intent is that prisoners should be eligible for an exemption despite receiving these small payments. 160 TAX ON NET ASSETS OF DEREGISTERED CHARITIES – REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS (Clause 90) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments are being made to the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that the net assets tax for deregistered charities also applies to non-registered entities exempt under section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act and which cease being “charitable” at law. The amendments also clarify that all entities that cease to be charitable at law must transfer their accumulated income and assets for charitable purposes. Application date The amendments will have retrospective effect from 14 April 2014 (when section HR 12 of the Income Tax Act was first enacted), with a “savings” provision to allo w taxpayers who have already filed returns before the introduction of this Bill to rely on the position they have taken. Key features Amendments are being made to section HR 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that: • The tax on the net assets of deregistered charities applies to the accumulated assets and income of non-registered entities exempt under section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act which cease being charitable at law. • Entit ies that cease to be charitable at law must transfer their accumulated income and assets for charitable purposes. Background In 2014 new rules were introduced to address the tax consequences for deregistered charities – that is, when a charity is removed from the Charities Register. These rules ensure that any income or assets accumulated while an entity was exempt from tax as a registered charity are always destined for a charitable purpose. Tax concessions should only be available to genuine charities. To protect the integrity of the revenue base, deregistered charities are held to account for assets and income accumulated while they were exempt from income tax. Section HR 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 taxes the net assets of deregistered charities. One year following the day of the final decision to deregister the entity, the accumulated assets and income of the organisation will be included as income of that organisation. Excluded from this net asset calculation are assets distributed or applied for charitable purposes, or in accordance with the entity’s rules contained on the 161 register. Also excluded are assets received from the Crown in relation to a Treaty of Waitangi settlement claim, and non-cash assets which were gifted to the organisation. The proposed amendments are aimed at ensuring that the policy objectives are met by: • amending section HR 12 so that it applies to any person who is not registered as a charity under the Charities Act 2005 but derives exempt income under section CW 42, and subsequently ceases to meet the requirements of section CW 42; and • amending the wording of section HR 12 so that deregistered charities are required to “transfer” their assets, as opposed to “distribute or apply”. The current wording of section HR 12 may allow deregistered charities to escape payment of the deregistration tax in certain circumstances. 162 LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND CONSOLIDATED GROUPS (Clauses 64, 68(6) and (7)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment corrects an inadvertent outcome resulting from amendments to the eligibility rules for consolidated groups in the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. This protects tax positions taken by local authorities on the basis of the existing law. Key features A local authority will no longer be eligible to form or join a consolidated group from the date of the Bill’s enactment. Nor will a local authority be eligible to continue as a member of a consolidated group from the first day of the first income year (or earlier at the election of the taxpayer) commencing after the date of enactment. Background The correct policy intention is for a local authority to be fully taxed on income derived from its council-controlled organisations (CCOs), as if the council was the ult imate individual shareholder. A 2006 amendment to the consolidated group rules relating to dual resident companies inadvertently permitted local authorities to enter or form a consolidated group. If a local authority forms a consolidated group with its council-controlled organisat ions, the local authorit y would not be taxed on any income derived from its CCOs. The proposed amendment corrects this unintended outcome. 163 LOSSES FROM SPECIFIED ACTIVITIES (Clauses 92–94, 97, 101, 172(29), (63) and (68)) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments repeal the restriction on the use of losses from “specified activities” and incorporate any residual amounts of those losses in the general loss use and carry-forward rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The amendments will apply to losses from specified activities that remain at the end of the 2017–18 income year. Key features The current rule limiting the use of losses from specified activities to $10,000 in any one income year will be repealed. When a taxpayer has an amount of loss from specified activities remaining at the end of the 2017–18 income year, that amount will be subtracted from the taxpayer’s net income (if any) for the 2018–19 income year before taking into account any other loss balance carried forward from the 2017–18 income year. The amount subtracted is limited to the amount of net income for the 2017–18 income year. Any excess amounts of loss from specified activities remaining after this subtraction from net income are added to the taxpayer’s tax loss for the year. If the taxpayer has zero net income for the 2018–19 income year, the entire amount of loss from specified activities remaining at the end of the 2017–18 income year would be added to the person’s tax loss for the income year. The use of losses from specified activities is also proposed to be subject to the ordering rule for the use of losses from the 2018–19 income year. The ordering rules ensure that, if a taxpayer with losses from specified activities is a company, the continuity and commonality rules must be satisfied in order for the company to either: • carry the losses beyond the 2018–19 income year, or • to group the losses from specified activities in the 2018–19 income year or later income year. 164 Background The specified activity loss rules were introduced in the early 1980s, at a time when the top personal marginal tax rate reached 66%. Their purpose was to discourage the use of a range of primary sector activities as tax shelters. Examples of primary sector activities subject to the specified activity loss rules include: animal husbandry, bloodstock, bee farms, silviculture, vit iculture, aquaculture and land leasing or licensing. These specified activity loss rules ensured that losses incurred from these primary sector activities that were not a taxpayer’s main business activity were subject to a maximum tax deductible loss of $10,000 in each income year. Any loss exceeding that threshold was carried forward and offset, initially against any profit arising from the specified activity in the immediately following income year and then against income from other sources up to a maximum of $10,000. This process was repeated for each subsequent income year. The reduction in the top marginal tax rates to 33% from the 1989 tax year resulted in a significant decline in the use of these primary sector activities as tax shelters. As a result, the specified activity loss rules were amended from the 1991 income year to ring-fence them from the general loss rules. The ring-fencing of these rules required any unabsorbed balance at the end of an income year to be carried forward and offset, initially against any profit arising from the specified activity in the 1991 income year and then against income from other sources up to a maximum of $10,000. This process was repeated in 1992 and subsequent income years, until the loss was extinguished. The specified activity loss rules are now largely spent, as there are a very low number of affected taxpayers and the amount of affected losses is immaterial. The proposed amendments are to give effect to the spent nature of these rules. 165 TAX RATE FOR EXTRA PAYS PAID TO NON-RESIDENT SEASONAL WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES ON NON-NOTIFIED TAX CODES (Clauses 138(1), (2) and (4), 145(1) and (4) and 181(8)) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed amendments will ensure that employers are required to withhold tax from extra pays paid to non-resident seasonal workers and to employees on non-notified tax codes at rates of 10.5% and 45%, respectively. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Proposed amendments to section RD 10 and schedule 2, part B, table 1 provide that the amount of tax that an employer must withhold from an extra pay paid to a non- resident seasonal worker is to be calculated at a 10.5% rate. Proposed amendments to section RD 10 and schedule 2, part B, table 1 provide that the amount of tax that an emplo yer must withhold from an extra pay paid to an employee who has not notified their employer of their tax code is to be calculated at a 45% rate. A proposed amendment to section RD 17, which contains the general rule for calculating the amount of tax to withhold from an extra pay, specifies that this section does not apply to extra pays paid to non-resident seasonal workers or emplo yees who have not notified their employer of their tax code. Background A non-resident seasonal worker is either employed by a recognised seasonal employer under the RSE scheme or is employed in line with Immigration instructions for the foreign crew of fishing vessels instructions. These workers use the “NSW” tax code which attracts a withholding rate of 10.5% on their salary or wages. Non-resident seasonal workers are not required to file an income tax return, so the tax withheld is a final tax for them. Non-resident seasonal workers are entitled to holiday pay under the Holidays Act 2003, which is either included in the worker’s regular pay or paid as a lump sum at the end of the worker’s emplo yment. 166 If the holiday pay is paid as lump sum at the end of their employment, the amount is treated as an extra pay under the PAYE rules. Under the rules for taxing extra pays, tax will generally be withheld from non-resident seasonal workers at a higher rate than 10.5%. The taxation of extra pays paid to non-resident seasonal workers at a rate higher than 10.5% is contrary to the policy intent for this class of employee, which is that the 10.5% flat rate should apply to all their employment income and be full and final. An employee who has not provided their tax code to their employer is taxed at a withholding rate of 45% on their salary or wages. Notifying their employer of their tax code also requires an employee to provide their name and IRD number to their employer. However, under the rules for taxing extra pays, tax will be withheld at a lower rate than 45%. The taxation of extra pays paid to employees who have not notified their employer of the required information at a rate lower than 45% is contrary to the policy intent for this class of employee, which is that all employment income paid to them should have tax withheld at a 45% rate. 167 MULTIPLE PAYMENTS OF SALARY OR WAGES (Clause 141) Summary of proposed amendment Section RD 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that where an employee receives multiple payments of salary or wages in a week or part of a week ending on a Saturday the total amounts of tax to be withheld is calculated as if all the payments were treated as one payment from one employer. Section RD 12 does not apply when an employee leaves one full time employment before commencing another and it does not apply to wages derived as a casual agricultural employee, election day worker or non-resident seasonal worker. Clause 141 proposes to amend section RD 12 to clarify that it only applies to multiple payments from the same employer. The limitation to a week or part of a week “ending on a Saturday” has also been removed as pay periods commonly end on other days. These amendments are intended to clarify rather than change the operation of this section. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2019. 168 RWT FROM NON-CASH DIVIDENDS CLARIFIED (Clauses 6, 106, 159 and 160) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will ensure that the taxation of non-cash dividends derived from overseas is the same, irrespective of whether the dividend is derived: • directly by an individual resident in New Zealand; or • by an intermediary acting on behalf of an individual resident in New Zealand. The dividend rules are also being clarified to confirm that the amount of a dividend includes any withholding tax paid or withheld in relation to that dividend. Application date The amendment will apply to non-cash dividends distributed during the 2017–18 and later income years. The amendments clarifying that withholding taxes are included in the amount of the dividend will apply from date of enactment. Key features A New Zealand-resident intermediary will not be required to account for withholding tax on a distribution of a non-cash dividend derived from overseas provided that: • the non-cash dividend is distributed to a New Zealand resident; and • the distribution occurs in the same income year that the intermediary derives the non-cash dividend. Background When a non-cash dividend derived from a foreign company by an intermediary on behalf of an individual resident in New Zealand is distributed to that person, the distribution is resident passive income. The current rules require the intermediary to account for RWT on that distribution. As the intermediary would have no funds to account for the withholding tax, this imposition of RWT generally results in the withholding tax being funded by the individual person receiving the non-cash dividend distributed by the intermediary. 169 This aspect of the RWT rules can result in different tax imposts on non-cash dividends ultimately derived by a New Zealand resident natural person, depending on whether the dividend is derived directly or indirectly via an intermediary. It is also unclear whether resident withholding tax paid for a non-cash dividend is included in the amount of the dividend. The proposed amendments clarify the correct outcome. 170 MEMORANDUM ACCOUNTS: OPENING BALANCES (Clauses 116, 117 and 121) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendment ensures that: • the closing balance of a memorandum account as at 31 March of any tax year is equal to the opening balance of that memorandum account on 1 of April following; and • the original debit or credit dates are retained for all debit or credit amounts included in the closing balance of a memorandum account (at 31 March, as memorandum accounts are required to be balanced at that date each year). Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 tax year. Key features The proposed amendments clarify that the original date on which a credit or debit is made to a memorandum account is to remain the date for that credit or debit to be carried forward in the closing balance from one tax year to the next. In addition, the references to the date of the debit or credit for an opening balance of a memorandum account are omitted from all tables in the memorandum account rules. Together the proposed amendments ensure that the opening balance of a memorandum account cannot be interpreted as being reset to zero on 1 April of each tax year. Background An imputation system allows the benefit of tax paid at the corporate level to be passed through to shareholders (as tax credits attached to dividends paid) so that a shareholder’s tax liability on dividends is limited to the shareholder’s marginal rate of tax. Our imputation system requires most New Zealand-resident companies (and some Australian companies) to maintain memorandum accounts. These memorandum accounts are balanced annually to ensure that companies do not over-distribute tax credits to shareholders. 171 The most common form of memorandum account is the imputation credit account. This is used to record tax paid by the company (credits to the imputation credit account) and also to record when the benefit of the tax is passed through to shareholders (debits to the imputation credit account). In general the use of imputation credits is governed by a “first-in first-out” basis and is subject to the company satisfying shareholder continuity rules. A recent review of the rules for memorandum accounts identified some issues that could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with the policy intention of the memorandum account rules. Under that interpretation, the legislation could reset the opening balance of each memorandum account to zero at 1 April each tax year (except when applying the shareholder continuity rules to imputation credits). The proposed amendment makes it clear that this interpretation is incorrect. 172 Rewrite remedials 173 174 AVAILABLE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION AMOUNT AND DISREGARDED DIVIDENDS (Clauses 9, 27 and 61) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments clarify that dividends and gains that are disregarded in calculating foreign investment fund (FIF) income are treated as excluded income. Application date The amendments apply from the date of enactment. Background Some offshore investments by New Zealand residents are taxed under the FIF rules. There are four methods that can be used to calculate FIF income: the comparative value method, the deemed rate of return method, the fair dividend rate method or the cost method. Because these returns are effectively taxed on an accruing basis, actual dividends derived by the investor from an interest in a FIF and gains from disposing of the interest, are disregarded for income tax purposes. However, under the rewritten core provisions, an amount derived by a New Zealand resident is excluded from the calculation of taxable income only if that amount is either excluded income or exempt income. In the rewrite of the FIF rules, this relationship with the core provisions was not made clear when stating that distributions or gain arising from an interest in a FIF are disregarded when calculating the person’s income tax liability. This has resulted in a question being raised about whether a disregarded amount derived by a corporate investor from a FIF is treated as a capital amount and able to be included in the available capital distribution amount, which, in some circumstances, is able to be later distributed tax-free. The policy intention is that a dividend or gain arising from an interest in a FIF and which is disregarded when calculating taxable income has an income nature and so should not be included in the available capital distribution amount. The amendments ensure the correct policy outcome is achieved. 175 IMPUTATION CREDIT ACCOUNTS AND USE OF PRE- CONSOLIDATION IMPUTATION CREDITS (Clauses 118–120) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment corrects an unintended change arising from the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 2007, which relates to the limit on the use of pre-consolidation imputation credits belonging to an individual company in a consolidated group. The proposed amendment restores the law to the position that existed in the Income Tax Act 2004. This limits the amount of pre-consolidation credit the individual company may transfer to the consolidated group’s imputation credit account (group ICA) to no more than the amount of the debit balance that would otherwise arise after a debit entry to the group ICA. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 tax year. Key features A consolidated group of companies maintains an imputation credit account for tax paid for the consolidated group. Each member company of a consolidated group may also have an imputation credit account in relation to imputation credits the company has before it joins a consolidated group. Those pre-consolidation credits may be used to offset a debit balance arising in the consolidated group’s imputation credit account. However, an ambiguity arising in the rewrite of this provision into the Income Tax Act 2007 may permit pre-consolidation imputation credits in excess of this limit to be transferred to the consolidated group’ s imputation credit account. The transfer of imputation credits from an individual company’s imputation credit to the imputation account of a consolidated group (of which the individual company is a member) is intended to be allowed when: • a debit entry is made to the group ICA; and • that debit entry would result in the group ICA having a debit balance after the debit entry. 176 ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS TO FORM OR JOIN A CONSOLIDATED GROUP (Clause 69) Summary of proposed amendments The amendment restores the law to the same outcome that existed under the Income Tax Act 2004 so that when one company elects to leave an imputation group, the imputation group continues to exist. Application date The amendment will come into force on 1 April 2008, and ensures that the adverse effect of the unintended legislative change does not arise. Background The rewrite of the consolidated group rules into the Income Tax Act 2007 has resulted in an unintended legislative change in relation to the meaning of “eligible company” for imputation group purposes. The issue relates to a member of a consolidated group (company X) electing to leave the imputation group (that consisted of companies X, Y and Z) but remaining within the consolidated group. The consolidated group consists of companies X, Y and Z. The unintended change results in the following differences between the two Acts: • Under the 2004 Act, Company X’s election to leave the imputation group would not affect the eligibility of Companies Y and Z to be in the imputation group. • Under the 2007 Act, Company X’s election to leave the imputation group results in companies Y and Z no longer being eligible to be in the imputation group. The proposed amendment restores the original intention of the 2004 Act. 177 RECIPROCAL SHIPPING EXEMPTION (Clause 178) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendment corrects an unintended change arising from the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 2007, with respect to the reciprocal shipping exemption at section YD 6(3) of the Act. The exemption applies on the basis of reciprocity. That is, New Zealand will agree not to tax the income of a shipping operator of another country if in reciprocal circumstances a New Zealand resident shipping operator will not be taxed by that other country. Prior to the rewrite, the legislation referred to a New Zealand resident shipping operator either being “not liable to, or exempt from” income tax in the other country. During the rewrite, however, the words “not liable to” were omitted. Concerns have since been raised that this inadvertently narrowed the scope of the provision. The proposed amendment therefore reinstates the words “not liable to”, to restore the full original meaning. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2008 (the date from which the Income Tax Act 2007 had effect). Key features The original policy intent of the provision was for it not to matter whether the income is exempt from tax or not liable to tax in the first instance. Under the rewrite of the Income Tax legislation, this was narrowed to only permit the exemption to apply when the income is exempt from tax. This proposed remedial amendment will restore the original wider meaning. 178 Maintenance and minor rewrite items 179 180 MAINTENANCE AMENDMENTS Summary of proposed amendments The following amendments reflect minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of Income Tax legislation and subsequent changes.

These strategies are known as base erosion and profit shifting or “BEPS”. The issue of BEPS formed part of the G20 agenda in 2013, who asked the OECD to report back to it with global strategies to address international concerns. The end result was the adoption of a OECD/G20 15-point Action Plan recommending a combination of domestic reforms, tax treaty changes, and administrative measures that would allow countries to strengthen their laws in a consistent manner and work together in combatting BEPS. Recognising our own vulnerability to BEPS and the value of working cooperatively, New Zealand actively participated in the OECD/G20 project, which was finalised at the end of 2015. In June 2016, in response to the OECD’s BEPS work, the New Zealand Government released its own BEPS programme to address BEPS issues in New Zealand. New Zealand’s response to BEPS is generally aligned with Australia’s. It is also broadly consistent with the OECD/G20 Action Plan, although the specific proposals are tailored for the New Zealand environment. In some instances, New Zealand’s existing tax laws are already consistent with OECD recommendations. In other cases, however, tax treaty and domestic law changes are required to address BEPS. The measures proposed in this Bill will prevent multinationals from using:  artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties to shift profits out of New Zealand (interest limitation rules);  hybrid mismatch arrangements that exploit differences between countries’ tax rules to achieve an advantageous tax posit ion;  artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence (a permanent establishment) in New Zealand; and  related-party transactions (transfer pricing) to shift profits into offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore. The Bill makes amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Each provision of the Bill comes into force on the date specified in the Bill for that provisio n. For most provisions this is income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. 3 4 Interest limitation rules 5 6 OVERVIEW The use of debt is one of the simplest ways of shifting profits out of New Zealand. Robust rules limiting the use of debt (and limiting interest payments on that debt) are therefore important base protection measures. In March this year the Government released the discussion document BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules proposing two key changes to these rules:  a new method for limiting the deductible interest rate on related-party loans fro m a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower (referred to as the interest rate cap); and  a change to how allowable debt levels are calculated under the thin capitalisation rules (referred to as an adjustment for non-debt liabilities). While submitters acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS concerns, many submitters did not support the specific proposals put forward. The government has refined the proposals to address submitters concerns including better targeting the proposals at borrowers at a high risk of BEPS. The methodology proposed in this Bill is a better way of achieving the interest rate cap’s objective. Like the cap, this approach will generally result in the interest rate on the related-party debt being in line with that facing the foreign parent. This is because, under the rule, debt will generally be required to be priced on the basis that it is “vanilla” (that is, without any features or terms that could push up the interest rate) and on the basis that the borrower could be expected to be supported by its foreig n parent in the event of a default. Implementing these restrictions in legislation will address the problem that the transfer pricing guidelines, in so far as they apply to related-party debt, are open to interpretation, subjective, and fact intensive in their application. The interest rate cap as initially proposed in the discussion document will continue to be available as a safe harbour. A related-party loan with an interest rate consistent with the interest rate cap would automatically be considered acceptable. This is expected to be an attractive option to many companies as it is both simple and provides certainty. The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a taxpayer can claim interest deductions on in New Zealand (“deductible debt”). Currently, the maximum amount of deductible debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer’s assets as reported in its financial accounts (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer’s assets is allowable). The Bill proposes changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest bearing debts). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities. The core objectives of the thin capitalisation rules are better served with a non-debt liability adjustment. For example, one of the objectives of the rules is to ensure that a 7 taxpayer is limited to a commercial level of debt. A third-party lender, when assessing the credit worthiness of a borrower, would take into account its non-debt liabilities. Moreover, the current treatment of non-debt liabilities means companies are able to have high levels of debt (and therefore high interest deductions) relative to the capital invested in the company. Certain deferred tax liabilities have been carved out from the proposed non-debt liability adjustment. Deferred tax is an accounting concept – accounting standards require that companies recognise deferred tax on their balance sheets in certain situations. In principle, a deferred tax liability is supposed to represent future tax payments that a taxpayer will be required to make. However, deferred tax liabilities can also represent technical accounting entries that do not reflect tax on current accounting profits will be payable in the future. The Bill also proposes a number of other changes to the thin capitalisation rules. One of these proposals is a special rule for infrastructure project finance. This proposal will allow full interest on third-party debt to be deductible even if the debt levels exceed the thin capitalisation limit if the debt is non-recourse with interest funded solely from project income. This will allow a wider group of investors to participate in public-private partnerships without interest expense denial than has been possible previously. Further minor changes are: • the de minimis in the outbound thin capitalisation rules, which provides an exemption from the rules for groups with interest deductions of $1 million or less, will also be made available to foreign-controlled taxpayers provided they have no owner-linked debt; • when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, interest deductions on any related-party debt will be denied to the extent the entity’s debt level exceeds 60 percent; • clarifying when a company can use a value for an asset for thin capitalisation purposes that is different from what is used for financial reporting purposes; • introducing an anti-avoidance rule that applies when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end of a year to circumvent the measurement date rules; and • clarifying how the owner-linked debt rules apply when the borrower is a trust. 8 RESTRICTED TRANSFER PRICING (Clauses 35, 37 and 43(20)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes new rules requiring related-party loans between a non-resident lender and a New Zealand-resident borrower to be priced using a restricted transfer pricing approach. Under these rules, specific rules and parameters are applied to inbound related-party loans to: • determine the credit rating of New Zealand borrowers at a high risk of BEPS, which will typically be one notch below the ultimate parent’s credit rating; and • remove any features not typically found in third-party debt in order to calculate (in combination with the credit rating rule) the correct amount of interest that is deductible on the debt. Separate rules will apply for financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. Application date The amendments are proposed to apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. Key features Proposed new section GC 6(1C) provides for the rules to restrict interest deductions fro m a non-resident on related-party debt or a loan from a person in the same control group. “Related-party debt” is an existing term in the NRWT rules in section RF 12I while a “control group” is a new term used throughout the Bill proposals and defined in proposed section FH 14. The rules, where they apply, will alter the terms and conditions of a borrower and/or an instrument considered before applying the general transfer pricing rules, including the amendments to transfer pricing also proposed in the Bill and discussed elsewhere in this commentary. The rules are contained in proposed sections GC 15 to GC 18: • Section GC 15 sets out how the rules operate and also defines an “insuring or lending person” as the rules operate differently for these persons. • Section GC 16 calculates how the credit rating of a borrower, other than an insuring or lending person, may be adjusted. • Section GC 17 calculates how the credit rating of an insuring or lending person may be adjusted. 9 • Section GC 18 disregards certain features of a financial arrangement for the purpose of calculating an interest rate. Background New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of deductible debt a company can have, rather than directly limiting interest deductions. In order for the rules to be effective at actually limiting interest deductions in New Zealand to an appropriate level, allowable interest rates on debt also need to be limited. Historically this limitation has been achieved through transfer pricing. However, this approach has not been wholly effective. The transfer pricing rules require taxpayers to adjust the price of cross-border related- party transactions so they align with the arm’s length price that would be paid by a third party on a comparable transaction. The arm’s length interest rate on a debt is affected by a number of factors, including its term, level of subordination, whether any security is offered, and the credit rating of the borrower. This Bill also proposes to update and strengthen New Zealand's transfer pricing rules including adopting economic substance and reconstruction provisions similar to Australia’s rules. The proposed transfer pricing rules would disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction. They would also allow transactions to be reconstructed or disregarded if such arrangements would not be entered into by third parties operating at arm’s length. Even with these stronger transfer pricing rules, transfer pricing will not be the most effective way to prevent profit shifting using high-priced related-party debt. When borrowing from a third party, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to try to obtain as low an interest rate as possible – for example, by providing security on a loan if possible, and by ensuring their credit rating is not adversely affected by the amount being borrowed. These same pressures do not exist in a related-party context. A related-party interest payment, such as from the New Zealand subsidiary of a multinational to its foreign parent, is not a true expense from the perspective of the company’s shareholders. Rather, it is a transfer from one group member to another. There are no commercial tensions driving interest rates to a market rate. Indeed, it can be profitable to increase the interest rate on related-party debt – for example, if the value of the interest deduction is higher than the tax cost on the resulting interest income. In addit ion, related-party transactions are fundamentally different to third-party transactions. Factors that increase the riskiness of a loan between unrelated-parties (such as whether the debt can be converted into shares or the total indebtedness of the borrower) are less relevant in a related-party context. For example, the more a third party lends to a company, the more money is at risk if the company fails. However, the risks facing a foreign parent investing in New Zealand do not change whether it capitalises its invest ment with related-party debt or equity. 10 Some related-party loans feature unnecessary and uncommercial terms (such as being repayable on demand or having extremely long terms) that are used to justify a high interest rate. Simply making the related-party debt subordinated or subject to optionality may also be used as justifications for a higher interest rate. In other cases, a very high level of related-party debt may be loaded into a New Zealand subsidiary to depress the subsidiary’s credit rating, which also is used to justify a higher interest rate. It can be difficult for Inland Revenue to challenge such arrangements under the transfer pricing rules as the taxpayer is typically able to identify a comparable arm’s length arrangement that has similar conditions and a similarly high interest rate. With the proposed stronger transfer pricing rules, the taxpayer would have to provide evidence that the legal form was consistent with the economic substance and that a third party operating at arm’s length would agree to enter the arrangement. These new requirements should limit the use of artificial or commercially irrational funding arrangements. However, these still provide scope for taxpayers to choose to borrow from related parties using higher priced forms of debt than they would typically choose when borrowing from third parties. In addition, the highly fact dependent and subjective nature of transfer pricing can make the rules complex and uncertain to apply. Assessing compliance with the arm’s length principle requires very detailed and specific information and analysis of how a comparable transaction between unrelated parties would have been conducted. This makes complying with the transfer pricing rules a resource-intensive exercise which can have high compliance costs and risk of errors. Transfer pricing disputes can take years to resolve and can have high costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. New Zealand is not alone in these concerns. The OECD’s final report on interest limitation rules notes that thin capitalisation rules are vulnerable to loans with excessive interest rates. This was one of the reasons behind the OECD favouring the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) approach to limit interest deductions. Detailed analysis Borrower’s credit rating A borrower that is subject to the proposed rules will follow the process set out below in order to arrive at one of the following long-term issuer credit ratings: • Group rating: the higher of the parent’s credit rating minus one notch or the borrower’s own rating. • Borrower’s credit rating: the borrower’s own rating. • Restricted credit rating: the borrower’s own rating if they had no higher than 40 percent debt and the credit rating cannot be lower than BBB-. The group rating in proposed section GC 16(9) has been referred to in earlier documents on these proposals as the safe harbour. It will apply where the borrower has an identifiable parent and either represents a high BEPS risk or chooses to use it to reduce compliance costs. A New Zealand borrower’s rating, in comparison with 11 their foreign parent rating, is reduced by the smallest division within the credit rating categories, commonly referred to as one notch (for example, from AA to AA- or AA- to A+). The borrower’s credit rating in proposed section GC 16(7) is the rating that will apply to the borrowing including any implicit parental support. This is the rate the borrower should be using under the current rules. It will continue to be available where the borrower represents a low BEPS risk. The restricted credit rating in proposed section GC 16(8) will apply where the borrower does not have an identifiable parent and represents a high BEPS risk. This is based on the borrower’s standalone rating but adjusted to reduce their debt level to 40 percent if it is above this and subject to a BBB- minimum, or equivalent given by a rating agency approved by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank approves rating agencies for their non-bank deposit taker rules which are published at https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation-and-supervision/non- bank-deposit-takers/requirements/credit-ratings. There are four rating agencies currently approved by the Reserve Bank. BBB- is the lowest investment grade credit rating by Standard & Poor’s, Fitch, and Equifax Australasia and is equivalent to a Baa3 Moody’s rating. What is a high BEPS risk? A borrower will be moved away from their standalone credit rating when they have a high BEPS risk. This will occur when at least one of three factors is present: 1. A high leverage ratio A borrower has a high leverage ratio when they have more than 40 percent debt unless their debt percentage is within 110 percent of the leverage ratio of their worldwide group under section GC 16(1)(e)(ii). Where there is no identifiable parent the 110 percent safe harbour cannot apply so the relevant test is in section GC 16(1)(b)(ii). When a borrower is required to calculate their leverage ratio this may not be on a thin capitalisation measurement date. To reduce compliance costs of doing this calculation, section GC 16(5) allows the borrower to estimate their leverage ratio by making appropriate adjustments to the calculations done on the most recent measurement date rather than having to re-do the entire calculation. Appropriate adjustments are intended to be including the effect of the new loan as well as any actions related to that wider arrangement such as using the loan to repay an existing loan or purchase a new asset. 2. Borrowing from a low tax rate jurisdiction different from the ultimate parent Borrowing from a low tax jurisdiction in any country where the lender is subject to a lower than 15% tax rate. These tests are in section GC 16(1)(b)(iii) and (e)(iii) for borrowers without and with an identifiable parent respectively. To be consistent with OECD recommendations, if the lender is in a jurisdiction with a lower tax rate this test is not failed provided the ultimate parent of that lender is 12 also in that jurisdiction. This qualification is intended to show a high BEPS risk for people routing lending through a tax haven but not simply because a lender group is based in a low tax country. This test also carves out entities that are subject to lower, or no, tax due to a policy decision (such as exempt sovereign wealth funds) by looking at the tax rate that would apply to a company with the usual tax status of a company. 3. A low inco me-interest ratio A borrower has a low income-interest ratio when their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is at least 3.3 times their interest expense. EBITDA is a well-used accounting measure to assess a company’s performance without having to consider financing and accounting decisions. An inco me-interest ratio of 3.3 is consistent with OECD BEPS recommendations. These tests are in section GC 16(1)(b)(iv) and (e)(iv) for borrowers without and with an identifiable parent respectively and refer to the formula in section GC 16(2) which is based on the similar existing formula in section FE 5(1BC). To address concerns about the volatility of an EBITDA test – due to earnings not necessarily being within the control of the borrower – proposed section GC 16(6) applies the income-interest ratio test looking backwards at any of the following periods: • the four most recent quarters for which data are available; • the twelve months prior to the most recent balance date that data are available; • the two years prior to the most recent balance date that data are available; and • the three years prior to the most recent balance date that data are available. Unlike the leverage ratio, the income-interest ratio is calculated without considering the impact of the new loan. The reason for this is it would be much more difficult to accurately forecast future earnings and interest expense including the new loan than to assess the impact of the loan, including any related transactions, on the borrower’s balance sheet. De minimis To minimise compliance costs of borrowers with smaller amounts of related-party cross-border loans, a de minimis has been included in proposed section GC 16(1)(a). A borrower with less than $10 million of related-party cross-border loans will not have to consider the credit rating adjustment part of the proposed rules and will apply the borrower’s credit rating as they do now. This $10 million threshold is calculated on the date the new rules apply for existing loans and each time a loan is entered into or extended. If the de minimis applies to a loan it will continue to apply to that loan in future years even if the de minimis is not satisfied in those future years unless the loan is renewed, 13 extended or renegotiated. The borrower will have to consider whether the de minimis applies each time they enter into a new related-party cross-border loan. An equivalent de minimis also applies for proposed section GC 18 which is discussed further below. Implicit parental support When determining a borrower’s own credit rating to calculate the borrower’s credit rating it will be necessary for the borrower to include any implicit support provided by being a member of the foreign parent’s worldwide group. This is consistent with the OECD transfer pricing guidelines 1 as demonstrated in paragraphs 1.157 and 1.164 to 1.167 of those guidelines, as reproduced below: 1.157 Comparability issues, and the need for comparability adjustments, can also arise because of the existence of MNE group synergies. In some circumstances, MNE groups and the associated enterprises that comprise such groups may benefit from interactions or synergies amongst group members that would not generally be available to similarly situated independent enterprises. Such group synergies can arise, for example, as a result of combined purchasing power or economies of scale, combined and integrated computer and communication systems, integrated management, elimination of duplication, increased borrowing capacity, and numerous similar factors... Example 1 1.164 P is the parent company of an MNE group engaging in a financial services business. The strength of the group’s consolidated balance sheet makes it possible for P to maintain an AAA credit rating on a consistent basis. S is a member of the MNE group engaged in providing the same type of financial services as other group members and does so on a large scale in an important market. On a stand-alone basis, however, the strength of S’s balance sheet would support a credit rating of only Baa. Nevertheless, because of S’s membership in the P group, large independent lenders are willing to lend to it at interest rates that would be charged to independent borrowers with an A rating, i.e. a lower interest rate than would be charged if S were an independent entity with its same balance sheet, but a higher interest rate than would be available to the parent company of the MNE group. 1.165 Assume that S borrows EUR 50 million from an independent lender at the market rate of interest for borrowers with an A credit rating. Assume further that S simultaneously borrows EUR 50 million from T, another subsidiary of P, with similar characteristics as the independent lender, on the same terms and conditions and at the same interest rate charged by the independent lender (i.e. an interest rate premised on the existence of an A credit rating). Assume further that the independent lender, in setting its terms and conditions, was aware of S’s other borrowings including the simultaneous loan to S from T. 1.166 Under these circumstances the interest rate charged on the loan by T to S is an arm’s length interest rate because (i) it is the same rate charged to S by an independent lender in a comparable transaction; and (ii) no payment or comparability adjustment is required for the group synergy benefit that gives rise to the ability of S to borrow from independent enterprises at an interest rate lower than it could were it not a member of the group because the synergistic benefit of being able to borrow arises from S’s group membership alone and not from any deliberate concerted action of members of the MNE group. Example 2 1.167 The facts relating to S’s credit standing and borrowing power are identical to those in the preceding example. S borrows EUR 50 million from Bank A. The functional analysis suggests that Bank A would lend to S at an interest rate applicable to A rated borrowers without 1 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (2017). 14 any formal guarantee. However, P agrees to guarantee the loan from Bank A in order to induce Bank A to lend at the interest rate that would be available to AAA rated borrowers. Under these circumstances, S should be required to pay a guarantee fee to P for providing the express guarantee. In calculating an arm’s length guarantee fee, the fee should reflect the benefit of raising S’s credit standing from A to AAA, not the benefit of raising S’s credit standing from Baa to AAA. The enhancement of S’s credit standing from Baa to A is attributable to the group synergy derived purely from passive association in the group which need not be compensated under the provisions of this section. The enhancement of S’s credit standing from A to AAA is attributable to a deliberate concerted action, namely the provision of the guarantee by P, and should therefore give rise to compensation.

To mitigate this risk, the following features, subject to the exempt ions below, will be disregarded when considering the pricing of a particular instrument: 1. The term of the loan being greater than five years Almost all bank debt and the majority of third-party bond issues are for a term of five years or less. Due to a (generally) positive sloping yield curve and the lack of comparables with terms of over five years, debt with very long duration can be priced higher than equivalent shorter terms. If the term of the loan is more than five years, proposed section GC 18(3) and (7)(b) will price it as if its term is five years unless an exception applies. This pricing should apply for the term of the loan. Further detail is provided on this provision below. 2. Subordination Subordination is where an instrument ranks behind other instruments in the event of default. This reduces the chance of the creditor receiving all their money back in the event the borrower runs into financial difficulty and can be used to justify a higher interest rate. Often in a related-party context, any subordination will not affect the amount the parent would receive in the event the subsidiary failed. Arrangements with subordination will have that subordination disregarded by proposed section GC 18(2)(g) for the purpose of calculating the price. 3. Exotic features Exotic features are those generally not seen with third-party lending. Proposed section GC 18(2) provides a list of features that will be disregarded. The types of exotic features that will be disregarded include: • payment-in-kind or other forms of interest payment deferral; • options which give rise to premiums on interest rates (for example, on early repayment by the borrower); • promissory notes or other instruments which do not provide rights to foreclose/accelerate repayment; • convertibility to equity or other exchange at the option of the borrower; and • contingencies (for example, where interest is repaid only under certain conditions). Third party features While the above features will generally be disregarded under the proposed rules, they will be taken into account under proposed section GC 18(8) if the borrower (or its 16 foreign parent, if there is one) has a significant amount of third-party debt with that feature. The extent to which disregarded features should be taken into account depends on the structure of either the borrower’s, or its worldwide group’s, third-party debt. The presence of related-party debt should not change the overall character of the borrower’s debt. That is: • the borrower’s related-party debt can have a disregarded feature in proportion to its third-party debt. For example, if the borrower had $100m of senior third- party debt and $50m of subordinated third-party debt, related-party debt that is 2:1 senior:subordinated would be allowable; or • the character of debt owed by the borrower matches the character of the borrower’s parent’s third-party debt provided that type of debt is commercially appropriate in the New Zealand context. For example, say on a worldwide consolidated basis the borrower’s parent has $200m of ordinary debt and $50m of convertible notes. If the borrower has $40m of ordinary related-party debt, this means that up to $10m of convertible related-party debt would be allowable (as this means the borrower’s debt character – a 4:1 mix of ordinary and convertible debt – would match that of its parent). In order for the borrower to use its own third-party debt to justify an otherwise disregarded feature, that third-party debt must be significant. That is the related-party debt with a feature cannot be more than four times the third-party debt with that feature. This is to prevent taxpayers agreeing to small amounts of third-party debt in order to justify expensive related-party debt. Terms greater than five years Proposed section GC 18(3) to (5) determines whether a term greater than five years is disregarded for the purposes of calculating the interest rate. Proposed section GC 18(3) includes that the five year term restriction does not apply to instruments that qualify as regulatory capital under proposed section GC 18(9). The reason for this is Tier 2 capital of banks has a minimum term of five years at issue but provides a reduced, and declining, regulatory benefit once it has less than four years remaining to maturity. This provides a commercial incentive to issue Tier 2 capital that has a longer term than five years so will be included in calculating an interest rate. Other regulatory capital of banks, insurers and non-bank deposit takers is already required to be issued for a perpetual term so this exclusion will have no practical effect. This is explained further below. For other New Zealand borrowers whether a term of greater than five years can be included in calculating an interest rate is determined under a similar process to the general third-party features test above. Subject to the other conditions explained below, related-party debt will be able to have a term greater than five years if the term is less than or equal to the weighted average term of third-party debt that exceeds five years – either o f the worldwide group or the New Zealand group consistent with the general third-party test. This is 17 defined in proposed section GC 18(5) as the threshold term. The other conditions are consistent with the general third-party test in that: • The related-party debt with this feature must be in an equal or lesser proportion than third-party debt with this feature – defined as the threshold fraction in proposed section GC 18(4)(b). • The related-party debt with this feature must be not more than four times the third-party debt with this feature – in proposed section GC 18(7)(b)(ii) and (iii). If related-party debt is issued with a term greater than the threshold term the term of the related-party debt will be adjusted to the threshold term, rather than five years, provided the threshold fraction and four times tests are satisfied. Example Foreign Parent Ltd has debt from third parties of the following amounts and terms: Loan Principal Original term at issue #1 $70 million Less than 5 years #2 $10 million 7 years #3 $10 million 9 years #4 $10 million 11 years Total $100 million The threshold term under proposed section GC 18(4)(a)(i) is nine years which is calculated under proposed section GC 18(5) as: Loan Term Term Debt Total Debt Threshold Term #2 7 years $10 million $100 million 2.3 years #3 9 years $10 million $100 million 3.0 years #4 11 years $10 million $100 million 3.7 years Total 9 years The threshold fraction under proposed section GC 18(4)(b)(i) is $30 million/$100 million or 3/10. NZ Subsidiary Ltd 2 has existing loans of $700,000 from Foreign Parent with a term of less than five years. It enters into three further loans with terms over five years on successive days and needs to consider what term will be included for setting the interest rate. 2 For simplicity for the purpose of this example disregard the $10 million de minimis in GC 18(1)(a). 18 Loan 1 A $50,000 loan with a term of seven years. • Section GC 18(7)(a) does not apply as the term of the loan (seven years) does not exceed the threshold term (nine years). • Section GC 18(7)(b)(i) does not apply as related-party loans having a term of more than five years ($50,000) as a proportion of total related-party loans ($700,000 + $50,000 = 750,000) is 6.7 percent which is less than the threshold fraction of 30 percent. • Section GC 18(7)(b)(ii) does not apply as related-party loans having a term of more than five years ($50,000) is less than four times the value of worldwide loans with this feature (4 × $30,000,000). • Section GC 18(7)(b)(iii) does not apply as the threshold fraction was not determined under subsection (4)(b)(ii). Therefore the seven year term is not adjusted and is included in calculating the interest rate. Loan 2 A $100,000 loan with a term of 11 years. • Section GC 18(7)(a)(i) is met as the term of the loan (11 years) exceeds the threshold term (nine years). • Section GC 18(7)(a)(ii) is met as related-party loans having a term of more than five years ($50,000 + $100,000 = $150,000) as a proportion of total related-party loans ($750,000 + $100,000 = $850,000) is 17.6 percent which is less than the threshold fraction of 30 percent. Therefore the 11 year term is adjusted to the threshold term of nine years for the purpose of calculating the interest rate. Loan 3 A $200,000 loan with a term of nine years. • Section GC 18(7)(a) does not apply as the term of the loan (nine years) does not exceed the threshold term (nine years). • Section GC 18(7)(b)(i) is met as related-party loans having a term of more than five years ($150,000 + $200,000 = $350,000) as a proportion of total related-party loans ($850,000 + $200,000 = $1,050,000) is 33.3 percent which exceeds the threshold fraction of 30 percent. Therefore the nine year term is adjusted to five years for the purpose of calculating the interest rate. 19 Figure 2: Flowchart 2 - Determining the interest rate on a particular instrument– not for insuring or lending persons Yes No Yes No Yes No Use credit rating determined in flowchart 1 (fig ur e 1) Does the loan have any exotic features?

Credit ratings of insuring or lending persons Financial institutions (referred to in the proposed legislation as an “insuring or lending person”) are required to use their parent’s long-term issuer credit rating rather than the three alternatives above. There are two reasons for this: 20 • Financial institutions are more integral to their worldwide group in that a default is more likely to affect the risk perception of the worldwide group. This results in a higher level of implicit support. • Financial institutions apply a different business model with much higher levels of leverage and, as interest is their main income source, calculating earnings before interest is not a suitable measure of economic activity. An “insuring or lending person” is defined in proposed section GC 15(2) to incorporate the following groups: • Banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers regulated by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. • A member of a group not regulated by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand whose main business is lending to third parties. • An individual entity or sub-group in the business of lending to third parties where the wider group is in a business other than as a financial institution. These last two bullet points are dealt with by section GC 15(2)(d) and (e) respectively. The distinction is subsection (e) applies where the main business activity of the group is other than providing funds to unassociated persons but there is a subsidiary that has the main business activity of providing funds to unassociated persons. One occurrence of this may be a motor vehicle importer which also operates a finance company to allow their customers to lease their products. This will essentially require the group to be split into two for the purpose of applying the proposed rules with the finance company subsidiary having a credit rating under section GC 17 and the remainder of the group applying section GC 16. Regulatory capital of banks, insurers and non-bank deposit takers The Reserve Bank requires banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers to hold certain levels of capital to support their continued solvency. For banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers some of this regulatory capital has certain features that result in it being treated as debt with deductible interest for tax purposes. There are legitimate commercial reasons why these entities would issue regulatory capital to a related party. However, this related-party regulatory capital would not necessarily satisfy the general third-party exception as: • the foreign parent will often be subject to different regulatory requirements in their home jurisdiction so will have issued instruments with different features; or • the worldwide group may have a more comprehensive range of activities in their home jurisdiction. For example, a group that operates a bank and an insurance company internationally but only operates as an insurance company in New Zealand. 21 It is important that the tax rules do not discourage the existence of regulatory capital as to do so would increase the risk of that business being unable to meet its obligations to depositors, policy holders and other creditors. For banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers the Bill proposes replacing the third-party test with a regulatory capital test. This test will allow a bank, insurance company or non-bank deposit taker to include features in pricing related- party debt if that feature was included so that that instrument qualified as regulatory capital for Reserve Bank purposes. There are four further areas of detail on this test which are: • minimum standards; • terms; • disqualification; and • back-to-back loans. Minimum standards Banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers maintain regulatory capital above the minimum standards, primarily so they can remain above the standard if a future event, including losses and payments of dividends, causes their level to drop. Banks can also issue different levels of capital depending on what features it has. Tax should not influence these behaviours. Any features that are required to meet the Reserve Bank requirements should be included in pricing even where the entity is over the minimum standard or where it issues a level of capital that has a greater risk than another level of capital. Terms Under the current regulatory framework banks can issue Tier 2 capital which, amongst other requirements, must have a minimum original maturity of at least five years. However, when such an instrument has less than five years to maturity the amount that is recognised as regulatory capital is amortised on a straight-line basis at a rate of 20 percent per annum as fo llows: Years to maturity Amount recognised More than 4 100% Less than and including 4 but more than 3 80% Less than and including 3 but more than 2 60% Less than and including 2 but more than 1 40% Less than and including 1 20% Due to this amortisation, banks are incentivised to issue Tier 2 capital for terms exceeding the minimum five years. Proposed section GC 18(3) recognises this by allowing any term of greater than five years to be included in pricing on any 22 instrument that is recognised as regulatory capital, even though that longer term is not required in order for the instrument to qualify as regulatory capital. Disqualification From time to time the Reserve Bank will change the regulatory capital requirements. For example, it is currently consulting on removing the requirement for regulatory capital to convert to common equity in certain circumstances. Where there is a regulatory change there will often be a transitional period where a former regulatory capital instrument will only be partially recognised and eventually it will cease to qualify as regulatory capital. Where this occurs, the bank or insurance company will not necessarily repay the instrument as there may be other commercial reasons to retain it (such as meeting the expectations of external investors). Even where an instrument ceases to qualify as regulatory capital the features that formerly qualified it will still be present. In these circumstances these features will still be included in the pricing so the test is based on the instrument qualifying as regulatory capital when it was entered into rather than any subsequent changes. Back-to-back loans Often banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers have an entity, such as a New Zealand holding company or a New Zealand branch of the foreign parent, which is not itself regulated by the Reserve Bank but that raises funds from the worldwide group to on-lend to the regulated entity. A consequence of this is a New Zealand taxpayer may receive high priced debt with features that provide no direct benefit to it as a stand-alone entity but will match the instrument/funding on-lent to a group member which is regulated and therefore the group is provided with a regulatory benefit. Any features included in an instrument issued by a non-regulated entity that would be necessary for it to qualify as regulatory capital (refer to the tests above) if the entity was a regulated entity will be included in pricing provided that instrument is part of a back-to-back loan to the regulated entity/group. 23 Figure 3: Flowchart 3 - Determining whether a feature can be included in pricing for banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers No Yes No Yes No Use credit rating determined in flowchart 1 (fig ur e 1) Does the loan q ualify as reg ulator y capital by the Reserve Bank?

The Bill proposes to change this, so that debt percentages are based on an entity’s assets net of its “non-debt liabilities”. The Bill proposes a number of other changes to strengthen the thin capitalisation rules. These are: • a de minimis in the inbound thin capitalisation rules; • reducing the ability for companies owned by a group of non-residents to use related-party debt; • new rules for when a company can use an asset valuation for thin capitalisation purposes that is different from what is used for financial reporting purposes; • an anti-avoidance rule that applies when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end of a year to circumvent the thin capitalisation rules; and • a minor remedial to clarify how the owner-linked debt rules apply when the borrower is a trust. Application date These amendments are proposed to apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. A grandparenting provision is proposed for the 110 percent debt threshold for non-residents acting together, which is set out in more detail below. Key features The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a foreign parent can lend to its New Zealand subsidiary. The Bill proposes several changes to strengthen these rules, which relate to the general thin capitalisation regime in subpart FE of the Income Tax Act 2007 as well as consequential changes to the CFC rules in subpart EX. The proposed changes are: • Modify how a company’s total assets are determined for the thin capitalisation rules – that is, to require assets to be determined net of a company’s non-debt liabilities. Proposed new section FE 16B defines total group-non debt liabilities for a New Zealand group and for a worldwide group. This change is intended to better align New Zealand’s thin capitalisation regime with its core objectives and with other countries’ thin capitalisation rules. 25 • Extend the de minimis in section FE 6 of the outbound thin capitalisat ion rules (New Zealand companies with foreign subsidiaries) to the inbound thin capitalisation rules (foreign controlled New Zealand companies). • Reduce the 110 percent worldwide debt threshold to 100 percent for a New Zealand group controlled by a group of non-residents acting together for the purposes of the interest apportionment rule in section FE 6. • Strengthen the integrity of the rules that allow taxpayers to value assets using values not reported in their financial accounts for the purposes of determining total group assets under section FE 16. • Provide for an anti-avoidance rule in proposed new section GB 51B to prevent taxpayers circumventing the thin capitalisation rules by repaying a loan just before a measurement date. • Amend the owner-linked debt provisions in section FE 18(3B) to ensure they operate correctly for trusts. Detailed analysis Non-debt liabilities adjustment The Bill proposes that in calculating its New Zealand debt percentage, an entity will be required to measure its assets net of its non-debt liabilities, as defined in new section FE 16B, excluding shareholder funding that is akin to group equity. As this change is proposed to apply to both the inbound and outbound thin capitalisation rules, the Bill proposes consequential amendments to sections EX 20D and EX 20E to ensure the proposed non-debt liabilities adjustment to the thin capitalisation calculation also applies in relation to the CFC rules. For a borrower’s New Zealand group, non-debt liabilities are defined as all liabilities as shown in the company’s financial accounts that are not counted as debt under section FE 15 except for: • certain interest-free loans from shareholders; • certain shares held by shareholders; • provisions for dividends; and • certain deferred tax liabilities. These carve-outs are discussed in more detail below. Interest-free loans from shareholders Proposed section FE 16B(1)(b) excludes from non-debt liabilities any financial arrangements providing funding to the company from a shareholder in respect of which no deduction for interest arises if either: • the funding is advanced pro rata with shareholding; or 26 • the shareholder (along with any associated persons) holds 10 percent or more of the voting interests in the company. This exclusion does not include related-party agreements for sale and purchase of property or services (defined in section YA 1 and colloquially known as trade credits), which will therefore be treated the same way as other non-debt liabilities under the proposal. Preference shares Shares can be treated as liabilities for accounting purposes in some circumstances (for example, if the shares are redeemable at the holder’s option or on a specific date). Proposed section FE 16B(1)(c) excludes shares held by a shareholder from the definition of a non-debt liability if either: • the funding is advanced pro rata with shareholding; or • the shareholder (along with any associated persons) holds 10 percent or more of the voting interests in the company. Such shares are akin to group equity if they are held pro rata with shareholding, or by a substantial shareholder. Provisions for dividends Proposed section FE 16B(1)(d) excludes a provision for dividends from the definition of a non-debt liability because it is similar in substance to an interest-free loan from shareholders. Deferred tax liabilities Proposed section FE 16B(1)(e) excludes a deferred tax liability from the definition of a non-debt liability if: • it arises as a result of the difference between the value of an asset in the financial statements and the amount which is depreciable or deductible for tax purposes; • it reflects an amount of tax that would not arise if the relevant asset were sold or otherwise realised for the value in the financial statements; and • the value of the relevant asset in the financial statements takes into account the deduction or depreciation for tax purposes in relation to the asset (rather than the deduction or depreciation recorded in the financial statements). Proposed changes to section FE 18 introduce a similar definition of non-debt liabilities for a company’s worldwide group, being: • all liabilities (as shown in the company’s financial accounts) that are not counted as debt under section FE 18; less • any owner-linked debt that is excluded under section FE 18(3B), as such debt is effectively treated as equity for the purposes of the worldwide group debt test. 27 Example Z Co’s balance sheet is as follows: Assets 100 Interest-bearing debt 20 Non-debt liability – trade credits 10 Interest free loan from parent 20 Equity 50 Z Co’s debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules is $20. Its total liabilities are $50, but $20 of this is an interest-free loan from Z Co’s parent company. Its non-debt liabilities are $10 and its thin capitalisation debt percentage under the proposed change is 20 ÷ (100 – 10) = 22.2 percent. De minimis for inbound thin cap Currently section FE 6(3)(ac) provides a de minimis where a person subject to the outbound thin capitalisation rules will not derive an amount of income (equivalent to any disallowed interest) if they have a group finance cost for a year of less than $1 million. The de minimis applies partially from $1 million to $2 million of group finance cost. Proposed amendments to section FE 6(3)(ac) extend this de minimis to a person subject to the inbound thin capitalisation rules unless they have owner-linked debt – that is debt from a person with an ownership interest in the entity – under section FE 18(3B). This proposal is intended to reduce compliance costs for smaller firms. Worldwide debt test for non-residents acting together The inbound thin capitalisation rules were extended in 2014, with application from the 2015–16 year, to include non-residents that act together as a group in relation to the way they fund a New Zealand investment and own 50 percent or more of that investment. The 2014 review also tightened what is known as the “110 percent worldwide debt test” in the inbound rules, which compares the amount of debt in a group’s worldwide operations to the debt in their New Zealand operations. The effect of section FE 18(3B), inserted in 2014, is that owner-linked debt (as discussed above) is excluded when calculating the debt level of a company’s worldwide operations. At present, when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, its allowable debt level under section FE 5(1)(a) is the greater of 60 percent of its assets and 110 percent of its worldwide debt. Because a company owned or controlled by a group of non-residents acting together has no identifiable parent, the worldwide group is deemed to be the New Zealand group itself under section FE 31D. As such, the 110 percent worldwide debt test is effectively a measure of the New Zealand group’s total debt relative to its third-party debt. 28 This means that shareholders of firms with high levels of third-party debt have been able to invest in New Zealand predominantly through debt. For example, a project funded 90 percent with third-party debt could have nine percent shareholder debt and only one percent equity without breaching the thin capitalisation limit. Proposed new sections FE 5(1)(ab) and FE 6(3)(e)(iii) will require that when an entity is owned or controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, interest deductions will be denied if the entity has any owner-linked debt and its total debt level exceeds 60 percent. In effect, this means that its allowable debt level would be the greater of 60 percent and 100 percent of its third-party debt rather than 110 percent of its third- party debt under the current rules. Grandparenting For entities affected by this change that are above 60 percent total debt and 100 percent of their third-party debt, transitional provisions are proposed in section FZ 8. The entity will be able to continue using their current percentage of third-party debt up to the 110 percent threshold for up to five years from the rules applying. The borrower’s current percentage of third-party debt can be calculated at either the date of introduction of the Bill or the thin capitalisation measurement date immediately prior to this. Example NZ Co.’s debt level as a percentage of its worldwide debt is 109 percent in year 1. NZ Co. enters into a new loan with a third party in year 2. As a result, its debt level as a percentage of its third-party debt drops to 105 percent (because NZ Co.’s related-party debt level has not changed since year 1). NZ Co.’s maximum debt level under the transitional provisions will stay at 109 percent. In year 3, NZ Co. repays a number of large loans and, as a result, the debt percentage of its New Zealand group drops to 55 percent. NZ Co. does not need to rely on its grandparented 109 percent of worldwide debt anymore, but is still covered by the grandparenting provisions for the remainder of the five-year period. This means that NZ Co. will not be denied interest deductions if its debt percentage exceeds 60 percent in year 4 unless its debt level also exceeds 109 percent of its worldwide debt. Other proposals in this Bill, such as the treatment of non-debt liabilities, will increase the thin capitalisation debt percentages for a number of entities. So that the grandparenting provision reflects the position under the new rules proposed in the Bill, the calculations on either measurement date referred to in the paragraph above will measure the percentage of worldwide debt using the amended thin capitalisation rules that apply from the first balance date after 1 July 2018 as if they applied on the measurement date. Asset valuation In general, the thin capitalisation rules are based on the value of a company’s assets as reported in its financial statements. However, a company may use the net current value of an asset as an alternative provided that would be allowable under generally accepted accounting principles. 29 Asset valuations reported in financial statements are subject to a higher level of scrutiny than asset valuations that are adopted solely for thin capitalisation purposes. Moreover, there is a concern that taxpayers may be valuing assets for thin capitalisation purposes without seeking an independent valuation. Proposed new section FE 16(1BAA) provides that taxpayers can only use the net current value of an asset if they have received a valuation from an independent valuer or the valuation methodology, assumptions and data have been approved by an independent valuer. Anti-avoidance rule around measurement dates Section FE 8 provides that a taxpayer’s assets and liabilities can be valued for thin capitalisation purposes on a daily, three-monthly or annual basis. An annual measurement date is the simplest and most widely-used of these approaches. The current legislation has the potential for a taxpayer to use the annual measurement date to effectively breach the thin capitalisation debt limits for up to one year without facing any interest denial, by partly repaying a loan or converting it to equity on or before their balance date. Existing section FE 11 prevents taxpayers from producing temporary increases or decreases in values if the change or arrangement has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the thin capitalisation rules. However, this section only applies to changes between measurement dates and does not cover the initial year when an arrangement is entered into. The Bill proposes amendments to section FE 11 and new section GB 51B to reconstruct certain situations, transactions or arrangements where a taxpayer subject to the thin capitalisation rules substantially repays a loan or, more generally, enters into a transaction near a measurement date with the purpose or effect of manipulating the thin capitalisation rules. Owner-linked debt when the borrower is a trust The owner-linked debt provisions in section FE 18(3B) only count debt as owner- linked if the owner has an ownership interest in a member of the group of companies of five percent or more to reduce compliance costs. This test works correctly when the entity is a company but not when it is a trust as settlements on a trust do not convey ownership interests. Proposed amendments to section FE 18(3B) will only count debt as owner-linked if the owner: • has a direct ownership interests in a member of the group of five percent or more; or • has made five percent or more (by value) of the settlements on the trust. 30 INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FINANCE (Clauses 5, 17, 20, and 43(18)) Summary of proposed amendments These proposed amendments will provide entities carrying out eligible infrastructure projects a limited exemption from the thin capitalisation rules by allowing them to claim deductions on debt that exceeds the thresholds set out in section FE 5(1). The debt that is allowed to exceed the ordinary thin capitalisation thresholds under this rule would be limited to third-party debt (or debt that is from an investor but is made in the capacity of a third-party lender) that only has recourse against the assets associated with the infrastructure project and the income arising from those assets. Application date The amendments are proposed to apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. Background This proposal is intended to improve the competitiveness in the bidding process for eligible infrastructure projects by ensuring that investors are subject to similar levels of thin capitalisation restrictions. Currently, a New Zealand entity that is owned by a group of non-residents (none of which have a controlling interest in their own right) is unrestricted in how much third- party debt it can take on (provided that debt is not guaranteed by its owners). This exemption does not however extend to other entities. The amendments proposed in the Bill would provide other entities involved in eligible infrastructure projects with an exemption from the thin capitalisation rules, similar to the concessions already provided for non-residents acting together. Detailed analysis Public project assets This exemption would apply only to debt that relates to public project assets – defined in proposed section FE 4B(1), which are assets arising from a project performed under a contract that meets the following criteria: • The project is established at the request of the New Zealand Government or a public authority. • The project is to provide, upgrade, or create assets in New Zealand and to operate or maintain those assets. 31 • The contract is for a period of at least 10 years. • The public funding relating to the contract is approved by the Minister of Finance. • The contract provides that the assets are owned by the New Zealand Government or public authority after the completion of the contract. Public project debt The proposed exemption would apply only to public project debt – defined in proposed section FE 4B(2). This debt must meet the following criteria: • The debt is applied to a project in order to give rise to public project assets. • The debt is secured against a public project asset, or the income derived from public project assets. • The debt must not be on-lent to a party that is not associated with the performance of the project, unless the on-lending is minor or incidental, such as depositing the debt with a financial institution. • The debt must give rise to interest expenditure that is incurred in New Zealand. Threshold debt amount The threshold debt amount is the amount of debt that an entity carrying on an eligible infrastructure project could have without breaching the existing thin capitalisation threshold. If the amount of public project debt exceeds this amount, only interest on debt that is eligible for the proposed rule would be deductible. If the amount of public project debt is less than this amount, all interest on the public project debt will continue to be deductible, even if the debt is participant debt or is made on terms that give the creditor recourse over assets or income not related to the project. Public project participant debt Public project participant debt, defined in proposed section FE 4B(3) and used in the formula in proposed section FE 7B(4)(i), is public project debt issued by a participant in the infrastructure project that is not made in the capacity of a third-party lender and would not get the benefit of this exemption. This is in line with the existing rule for entities owned by a non-resident owning body, which can get an unlimited amount of third-party debt, but is limited in the amount of owner-linked debt it can take on. Recourse debt Recourse debt, defined in proposed section FE 7B(4)(f), is public project debt that is made on terms that give the creditor recourse over assets that are not public project assets or income not derived by those assets. Recourse debt does not get the benefit of this proposed rule. 32 Excess debt Excess debt, defined in proposed section FE 7B(4)(b), is public project debt that exceeds the value of the public project assets and would not receive the benefit of this exemption. If, after any participant and recourse debt has been denied a deduction, an entity carrying out an eligible infrastructure project has more public project debt than public project assets, any interest expense associated with that excess debt would be denied. Scope of exemption Under proposed section FE 7B(1) this exemption would apply to entities controlled by a single non-resident, partnerships entered into by non-residents, and New Zealand resident entities subject to the outbound thin capitalisation rules. A similar exemption already applies (in effect) where a separate entity is controlled by a group of non- residents. Where a person has more than one project, each would be treated separately under proposed section FE 7B(5) so that excess debt in one project cannot be sheltered by a below threshold level of debt in a second project. Example Infrastructure Co. is building a road in New Zealand at the request of the Government that will be worth $100m. Infrastructure Co. has borrowed $80m from Bank on limited recourse terms to fund the construction of the road. The remaining $20m of funding is from Infrastructure Co.’s shareholders, who have advanced $15m of equity and $5m of debt. The loan from Bank Co. is not owner-linked debt and is on limited recourse terms, so meets the relevant conditions of this exemption. Infrastructure Co. and the road project also meet all the other requirements. Infrastructure Co. is able to exceed the 60 percent safe harbour without facing interest denial in relation to its loan from Bank Co. However, the $5m of shareholder debt does not qualify for the exemption. None of the interest on the shareholder debt would be deductible. 33 34 Permanent establishment rules 35 36 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT RULES (Clauses 4, 34, 43 (definitions), and 44 to 48) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes a new anti-avo idance rule for large mult inat ionals (wit h over EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover) that structure to avoid having a permanent establishment (PE) in New Zealand. The proposed rule will deem a non-resident entity to have a PE in New Zealand if a related entity carries out sales-related activities for it here under an arrangement with a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance (and the other requirements of the rule are met). This PE will be deemed to exist for the purpose of any applicable double tax agreement (DTA), unless the DTA incorporates the OECD’s latest PE article. 3 In addition, under the proposed amendments an amount of income will be deemed to have a source in New Zealand if that income can be attributed to a PE in New Zealand. If a New Zealand DTA applies to the non-resident, the definition of a PE in that DTA will apply for this purpose. If no New Zealand DTA applies to the non- resident, then a new domest ic law definit ion of a PE will apply. Application date The amendments are proposed to apply to income years starting on or after the date of enactment of the Bill. Key features The proposed amendments introduce a new anti-avoidance rule into New Zealand domestic tax law (PE avoidance rule). The rule will deem a PE to exist in New Zealand for a non-resident if all the following criteria are met: • The non-resident is part of a large multinational group. The OECD has defined a large multinational group as a group with at least EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover for the purpose of filing Country-by-Country reports. The same revenue threshold is used for the PE avoidance rule. • The non-resident makes a supply of goods or services to a person in New Zealand. • A person (the “facilitator”) carries out an activity in New Zealand for the purpose of bringing about that particular supply. • The facilitator is associated with the non-resident or is commercially dependent on it. 3 This is contained in Article 12(1) of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures To Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) 37 • The facilitator’s activities are more than preparatory or auxiliary. • The non-resident’s income from the supply is subject to a DTA that does not include the OECD’s latest PE article. • A more than merely incidental purpose of the arrangement is to avoid New Zealand tax, or a combination of New Zealand tax and foreign tax, for the non- resident. Under the proposed rule the non-resident will be deemed to make any supplies that are subject to the rule through that PE. The activities of the facilitator in relation to the supply will also be attributed to the PE. The deemed PE will exist for all the purposes of both the Act and the applicable DTA, notwithstanding anything in New Zealand’s DTAs. The tax consequences of the deemed PE will be determined by the other provisions of the Act and the DTA. For example, New Zealand will have a right to tax the profits attributable to the PE under the business profits article of an applicable DTA. The anti-avoidance rule may also apply in the context of a third-party channel provider arrangement. This is a single arrangement under which the non-resident supplies goods or services to an unassociated New Zealand resident and the New Zealand resident on-supplies the goods or services to identified New Zealand customers with the assistance of the facilitator. If the proposed rule applies in these circumstances, then the facilitator’s activities will give rise to a PE for the non- resident in respect of its supplies to the third-party channel provider. The proposed amendments would also introduce a new source rule for PEs. This rule would provide that any income attributable to a PE in New Zealand has a source in New Zealand. To define a PE, the Bill contains the following provisions: • Where a taxpayer is resident in a jurisdiction that has a DTA with New Zealand, the definition will be the same as the definition of a PE in that DTA. It will also include any PE deemed to arise under the proposed PE anti-avoidance rule (but only if the DTA does not include the OECD’s new PE definition). • Where a taxpayer is resident in a jurisdiction that does not have a DTA wit h New Zealand, the definition of a PE will be that set out in the new Schedule 23 to the Act (domestic PE definition). This definition includes the OECD’s new PE definit io n. The high level application of all these proposed amendments can be summarised as follows: • If the jurisdiction where the non-resident is resident has a DTA with New Zealand, but that DTA does not incorporate the OECD’s new PE definition, then the new PE anti-avoidance rule will apply to determine whether the non- resident has a deemed PE in New Zealand. • If the jurisdiction where the non-resident is resident has a DTA with New Zealand, and that DTA does incorporate the OECD’s new PE definition, then the new PE anti-avoidance rule will not apply. Instead the OECD’s new PE definition in the DTA will apply to determine whether the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. 38 • If the jurisdiction where the non-resident is resident does not have a DTA with New Zealand then the new PE anti-avoidance rule will not apply. Instead the new domestic PE definition (which incorporates the OECD’s new PE definition) will apply to determine whether the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. In all the above circumstances, if the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand then any income attributable to that PE will be considered to have a New Zealand source. Whether income is attributable to the PE will be determined under the standard PE profit attribution methodology applied by New Zealand. Background PE anti-avoidance rule New Zealand’s ability to tax non-residents on their New Zealand sales income is determined by our domestic tax rules in conjunction with our DTAs. Under our DTAs, New Zealand is generally prevented from taxing a non-resident’s business inco me unless the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. This is the case even if that income has a source in New Zealand under our domestic legislation. A PE is basically a fixed place of business of the non-resident, but it also includes a dependant that habitually concludes contracts on behalf of the non-resident. If a PE exists, then under the DTA New Zealand may tax only the income attributable to that PE (unless that income is also subject to another DTA provision). The non-resident must also have a PE in New Zealand (if a DTA applies) for New Zealand to charge non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on certain payments by the non-resident (such as a royalty) to other parties in connection with the New Zealand sales income. The problem the proposed rule is trying to address is the ability of some multinationals to structure their affairs so they do not have a PE in New Zealand, despite having significant economic activity carried on for them here. This usually involves the non-resident entity establishing a New Zealand subsidiary to carry out local sales related activities. The OECD and the G20 are also concerned about PE avoidance, and have recommended measures to address it as part of their 15 point base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. This includes a new, broader definition of a PE for DTAs. Under this new PE definition, a representative of the non-resident will only need to habitually play a principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts in order to give rise to a PE for the non-resident. This contrasts with the current PE definition in most DTAs, where the representative must habitually conclude contracts on behalf of the non-resident in order to give rise to a PE. The OECD has prepared the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) to rapidly implement the treaty changes recommended as part of its BEPS Action Plan. New Zealand signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Under the MLI, the OECD’s new widened 39 PE definition will be included in New Zealand’s DTAs, but only if the other country signs the MLI and elects to adopt the new PE article. This new, widened definition should be effective in addressing the kinds of PE avoidance we have seen in New Zealand. However most of New Zealand’s trading partners are not expected to adopt the widened PE definition, including some countries from which significant investment into New Zealand is made. Therefore, the OECD’s widened PE definition will not be sufficient to address the issue of PE avoidance in New Zealand. Source rules Under the current rules, there is a possibility that New Zealand may be entitled to tax a non-resident on its sales income under the PE article of a DTA, but cannot do so under our domestic source rules. There is general international consensus that if income is derived through a PE in a country, then it is sufficiently connected with that country to be taxed there. Accordingly, any income that is derived by a PE should also have a New Zealand source under our domest ic rules. In addition, in order to tax a non-resident on its New Zealand sales income, it is currently necessary to show that the income both has a New Zealand source and is attributable to a PE under a DTA. This increases the compliance and administrative burden of determining a non-resident’s tax liability for its sales to New Zealand customers. Detailed analysis PE anti-avoidance rule The proposed rule will deem a PE to exist in New Zealand for a non-resident if all the listed criteria in proposed section GB 54(1) of the Income Tax Act (2007) are met. These criteria are discussed below. The non-resident is, or is part of, a large multinational group - para (j) A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 of the Bill to include multinational groups that exceed the revenue threshold of EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover described in paragraph 5.53 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. This revenue threshold was agreed by the OECD as a way to define large multinational groups for the purpose of filing Country-by-Country reports. The non-resident makes a supply of goods or services to a person in New Zealand - para (a) The definit io n of “goods or services” from the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 will apply for this purpose. In addition the relevant supply may be made by the non- resident either: 40 • directly to a person in New Zealand; or • to another person in New Zealand (the intermediary) under an arrangement that includes the intermediary on-supplying the goods to another person in New Zealand. The intermediary does not need to be associated or otherwise related to the non-resident. The provision for intermediaries is intended to include third-party channel provider arrangements within the scope of the proposed rule. Specifically, the provision is intended to ensure the proposed rule can cover the sale by a non-resident to a third party where that sale is part of an arrangement under which those same goods or services are to be on-sold by the third party to an identified customer, and the non- resident’s facilitator deals with the end-customers to bring the particular sale about. Figure 4 illustrates this kind of arrangement. Figure 4 N on-res id en t Sa le of go ods Third party channel provider Sa le of go ods Related party 10 0% owner ship Sales p rom otion and ser vices Customer There can be good commercial reasons for third-party channel provider arrangements. However they should also give rise to a PE for the non-resident in respect of its sale to the third party in appropriate circumstances. This is because, under such an arrangement, the non-resident and the third party are working together to sell the particular goods or services to the end customer. Further, the non-resident’s sale to the third party is wholly dependent on the customer agreeing to purchase the goods. This means that the facilitator’s activities are made in relation to the non-resident’s sale to the third party as well as the third party’s on-sale to the end customer (which makes sense given that the facilitator acts for the non-resident, not the third party). Therefore the activities of the non-resident’s facilitator should still be able to give rise to a PE for the non-resident (provided the other requirements of the proposed rule are met). A person (the “facilitator”) in New Zealand carries out in New Zealand an activity for the purposes of bringing about the supply - para (b) The facilitator must carry on an activity for the purpose of bringing the supply about. It is intended that only activities designed to bring about a particular sale to an identifiable person should potentially result in a deemed PE. Therefore activities that do not relate to a particular sale, such as advertising and marketing, would not be 41 sufficient to trigger a possible PE under this requirement. After-sales activities, such as technical support, would not be sufficient to meet this requirement, as they occur after the supply has been made. The kinds of activities that are within the intended scope of this provision primarily include activities designed to convince a particular customer to acquire the supply. The proposed requirement also specifies that the facilitator cannot also be the intermediary. This is to ensure that the proposed PE anti-avoidance rule does not apply to an ordinary distributor arrangement. In such a case, the distributor would be carrying out all the particular sales activities on its own behalf, rather than the non- resident’s behalf (and the non-resident would not have a separate facilitator in New Zealand assisting with the sales). Accordingly, the distributor’s activities should not give rise to a PE for the non-resident. The facilitator is associated or commercially dependent on the non-resident - para (c) The proposed rule is aimed at circumstances where the facilitator is part of the same economic or control group as the non-resident. It is these circumstances which allow the multinational to avoid having a PE by splitting its activities between related companies (for example, the non-resident supplier and the facilitator). Accordingly, for the rule to apply, the facilitator must be associated with the non-resident. The same concern also arises where the non-resident’s sales activities are carried out by a New Zealand entity that is not associated with the non-resident, but is commercially dependant on it. In this case, the non-resident is also able to have sales activities carried out by a special purpose entity over which it has significant de-facto control (by virtue of its commercial dependency). Accordingly, the proposed PE anti- avoidance rule may also apply in these circumstances. The concept of “commercially dependant” is subjective. Therefore the criterion instead uses the more precise test of whether the facilitator derives more than 80 percent of its assessable income from the non-resident or its associates. As a result of this criterion, any sales-related activity carried on by an unrelated independent agent will generally not give rise to a PE under the proposed rule. This also reflects the current definition of a PE in New Zealand’s DTAs. The activity is more than preparatory or auxiliary - para (d) As stated above, only activities that are designed to bring about a particular sale should be within the scope of the proposed rules. To support this, any activities that are preparatory or auxiliary to the non-resident’s supply of goods or services will not be sufficient to trigger the potential application of the rule. An example of preparatory or auxiliary activities is general marketing or advertising of a non- resident’s products. Warehousing and delivery of the supplied goods would also usually be preparatory or auxiliary. However, this would not be the case for example where the main business activity of the non-resident was delivering goods. This criterion is also intended to incorporate the exception in most DTAs, which provides that preparatory and auxiliary activities do not give rise to a PE. Therefore in interpreting the meaning of “preparatory or auxiliary” in the proposed rule, it is 42 intended that the OECD’s Commentary on the articles of the Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital (Commentary) will be relevant. The non-resident is relying on a DTA that does not include the OECD’s new PE definition – para (e) As discussed above, the OECD has drafted a new PE definition to counter PE avoidance. This new PE definition has been included into its Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital (Model Treaty), and will also be inserted into the DTAs of participating countries under the MLI (provided both jurisdictions elect to include it). The OECD’s new PE definition has several components. The relevant component here is that contained in article 12(1) of the MLI. In particular, the part of article 12(1) providing that a dependant agent PE will arise for a non-resident where a person habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts by the non-resident that are routinely concluded without material modification. The Government’s view is that this amended definition should be sufficient to prevent the kind of PE avoidance we have seen in New Zealand. It is also expected that the proposed PE rule and the OECD’s new PE definition will apply in broadly similar circumstances. For this reason, the proposed new PE rule will not apply where the non-resident’s income from its supplies to New Zealand customers is covered by a DTA which incorporates the OECD’s new PE rule. It does not matter for this purpose whether the OECD’s new PE rule is inserted into the DTA by the MLI, or is subsequently agreed by New Zealand and the other party in bilateral treaty negotiations. The domestic law definition of a PE does not apply to a non-resident – para (f) As part of the Bill, a definition of a PE is proposed to be included into the Act for non-residents to whom no DTA with New Zealand applies. This domestic definition includes the OECD’s new PE definition. Accordingly, the proposed PE anti- avoidance rule also does not need to apply for non-residents to whom no DTA with New Zealand applies. The income from the supply is not already attributable to a PE – para (g) This is a mechanical provision. If the non-resident’s income is already attributable to a PE under a DTA (or under the domestic law following the Bill’s enactment), then there should not be any PE avoidance occurring in respect of that income. Accordingly, the proposed PE rule will not apply in these circumstances. The arrangement does not have a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance – paras (h) and (i) In order for the proposed PE anti-avoidance rule to apply, the relevant arrangement must have a more than merely incidental purpose of avoiding tax. This requirement has been inserted for two reasons: • to target the rule’s application at BEPS activities, rather than more ordinary commercial arrangements; and 43 • to make the rule consistent with New Zealand’s DTA obligations. The Commentary states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between anti- avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA (as discussed further below under “other matters”). Tax for this purpose means both New Zealand tax, and a combination of New Zealand tax and foreign tax. This is to prevent any argument that an arrangement’s avoidance of New Zealand tax was only incidental to its avoidance of foreign tax. The general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) in section BG 1 also requires that an arrangement has a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance. However, in applying the GAAR, the courts have imposed a further requirement that the arrangement uses the relevant provisions in a manner not contemplated by Parliament (see Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSC 115). This further requirement arises out of the need to reconcile Parliament’s purpose for the specific tax provisions (which may have been intended to confer a benefit in the circumstances) with its purpose for section BG 1 (see Ben Nevis at \[102\]). This further requirement is usually referred to as the Parliamentary contemplation test. The proposed PE anti-avoidance rule is a specific anti-avoidance provision, rather than a GAAR. Further, the scope in which the PE anti-avoidance rule applies has been carefully circumscribed. For these reasons, there is no need to reconcile the application of the PE anti-avoidance rule with the intended application of any other provisions. Therefore, the intention is for only the merely incidental purpose test to be used in determining whether the proposed PE anti-avoidance applies. It is not intended for the Parliamentary contemplation test to also apply. Subparagraphs (h) and (i) have been drafted in order to achieve this intention. It would not be appropriate to refer directly to the Parliamentary contemplation test in the legislation, as this is a judicial rather than a statutory requirement (and so might change in the future). Instead, to achieve its purpose the subparagraph has been drafted without reference to the definitions of “tax avoidance arrangement” or “tax avoidance” used by section BG 1. This is to make it clear that the test under subparagraphs (h) and (i) does not import the Parliamentary Contemplation test (or the earlier scheme and purpose test) associated with those definitions. However, it is intended that only the case law relevant to whether there is a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance should apply (for example, excluding any Parliamentary contemplation or scheme and purpose component of the test under the GAAR) in determining whether the more than merely incidental purpose test in subparagraphs (h) and (i) is met. In this regard, the omission of the word “effect” from subparagraph (h) and (i) is not intended to have any effect. This criterion should also ensure that the proposed PE anti-avoidance rule will only deem a PE to exist if the non-resident would have had a PE but for its arrangement with the facilitator (that is, if the non-resident had carried out all the facilitator’s activities itself using all the facilitator’s assets and personnel). In this regard, the rule is intended to prevent the avoidance of a PE. It is not intended to deem a PE to exist where one does not in substance. 44 Consequences of application (GB 54(2), BH 1(4)) If the proposed PE anti-avoidance rule applies, then under section GB 54(2) the non- resident is treated as having a PE in New Zealand. Supplies made by the non-resident are then treated as being made though that PE – but only if section GB 54(2) applies to them. So for example if the non-resident made some supplies in New Zealand in respect of which a related entity in New Zealand carried out sales activities (and the other requirements of the rule were met), then those supplies would be treated as made through the PE. However, if the non-resident also made other supplies in New Zealand and no related entity in New Zealand carried out any sales related activities in respect of them, then those supplies would not be treated as made through the PE for tax purposes. The activities of the facilitator in relation to the supplies will also be attributed to the PE for the purposes of determining the profit attributable to it (and so the taxable income in New Zealand). The normal PE profit attribution rules would then apply to determine the amount of attributable profits. In this regard, New Zealand follows an earlier version of the OECD’s latest PE profit attribution rules (known as the “authorised OECD approach”, or AOA). This is for two reasons: 1. The AOA only applies to DTAs which incorporate the latest version of Article 7 (business profits) of the Model Treaty. None of New Zealand’s DTAs incorporate this version of Article 7, so the AOA is not relevant to New Zealand’s DTAs. 2. New Zealand does not agree with some aspects of the AOA and has made an explicit reservation against it. DTAs, as international agreements, do not have any legislative effect except to the extent provided for in domestic legislation. DTAs are given legislative effect for tax purposes by section BH 1(4) of the Act. This provides that DTAs have effect, despite anything else in the Act. To make it clear that the proposed PE avoidance rule overrides any applicable DTA, the Bill proposes amending section BH 1(4) to include section GB 54 in the list of sections in respect of which a DTA does not have overriding effect. The effect of this is that section GB 54 will deem a PE to exist for all the purposes of the Act and any applicable DTA, notwithstanding anything in that DTA. It is important to note that proposed new section GB 54 on its own simply deems a PE to exist. It does not directly impose any tax or deem any assessable income to arise. Instead the tax consequences of a deemed PE will be determined under the other provisions of the Act and any applicable DTA. For example, if the proposed PE anti-avoidance rule applies to a non-resident subject to the New Zealand-Australia DTA, then: • The taxpayer will be deemed to have a PE for the purposes of that DTA under Art icle 5. 45 • The business profits article of the DTA (Article 7) will apply to allow New Zealand to tax the profits attributable to that PE. 4 • The ordinary tax rules will apply on the basis that the taxpayer has a PE in New Zealand. In particular, proposed new section YD 4(17C) will deem the income attributable to the PE to have a New Zealand source. • The PE under section GB 54 will exist for the purposes of any other provision of the DTA. For example, it will be deemed to exist for the purposes of Art icle 12(5) of the DTA. This means that New Zealand could impose NRWT on any royalties paid by the non-resident that are connected with the PE and deductible in determining its profits. • Items of income that are dealt with by other articles of a DTA will continue to be taxed in accordance with those other articles. This is because any conflicts between the tax treatment under a specific article (assuming the existence of a PE) and the tax treatment under Article 7 are dealt with under Article 7(8) of the DTA. This provides that the provisions of the other articles are not affected by the provisio ns o f Article 7. For example, an Australian resident’s profits fro m shipping and air transport would continue to be dealt with under Article 8 of the DTA (rather than Article 7), even if section GB 54 applied to deem the non- resident to have a PE in New Zealand. Other matters The Government anticipates that some multinationals may wish to restructure their New Zealand operations in response to the proposed PE anti-avoidance rule. One of the policy goals of the proposed rule is to encourage taxpayers to move away from PE avoidance structures. Therefore, the Government is happy for taxpayers to restructure their New Zealand operations in response to the rules by either adopting a formal PE, or by moving to a standard local distributor model (where the goods or services are sold by the non-resident to an associated party, who then on-sells the goods to unrelated customers). While the proposed rule will override DTAs, it should not conflict with New Zealand’s obligations under those DTAs. This is because New Zealand’s DTAs are based on the OECD’s Model Treaty. The OECD Commentary is an important part of the context in which these DTAs are internationally understood. The proposed rule is an anti-avoidance provision, as it only applies to an arrangement with a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance. The OECD Commentary states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between such anti-avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA. It also confirms that states are not obliged to grant the benefits of a DTA if the DTA has been abused (noting that this should not be lightly assumed). However, it is important that the proposed PE anti-avoidance rule applies notwithstanding anything in a DTA. This is to simplify the application of the rule, otherwise it would be necessary to show that the application of the rule was consistent with a DTA in each particular case. This would be a time-consuming and resource intensive exercise. The Government also considers that taxpayers should not be able 4 This is unless the income is from insurance. Under the DTA income from insurance is not subject to Article 7 (see Article 7(9)). Accordingly, New Zealand will continue to tax insurance income under its domestic rules notwithstanding the existence of a deemed PE under section GB 54. 46 to rely on DTAs to protect their tax avoidance arrangements. This is the same position as the UK and Australia have taken in respect of their PE avoidance rules. Finally, the Government expects the proposed rule to apply in broadly similar circumstances to the OECD’s new PE definition. However, there will be differences in the application of the two rules, due to their different formulations. PE source rule A new source rule is proposed in new section YD 4(17C) under which income will have a New Zealand source if it is attributable to a PE in New Zealand. If a New Zealand DTA applies in respect of the taxpayer, then the definition of a PE in that particular DTA will be used for the purpose of this source rule (proposed section YD 4B(2)). The effect of this will be that where income is attributable to a PE in New Zealand under an applicable DTA, that income will automatically have a New Zealand source. The income will also have a New Zealand source if it is attributable to a deemed PE under the proposed new PE anti-avoidance rule (proposed section YD 4B(2)(b)). The Bill also proposes introducing a new domestic definition of a PE in schedule 23 of the Act. This definit ion will apply if no New Zealand DTA applies to the taxpayer. The PE definition in schedule 23 is based on New Zealand’s model PE article, and incorporates the OECD’s new PE definition. Proposed section YD 4B(4) has been included to clarify that the Commentary should be used as a guide in interpreting the definition of a PE in schedule 23. However, the OECD Commentary does not itself have legislative effect. Therefore, the guidance in the Commentary should not be applied in contradiction to the words of Schedule 23. In particular, the Commentary applies in respect of the OECD’s model PE definition, which the definition in schedule 23 departs from. In addition, New Zealand has made reservations and observations on the Commentary to the PE definition (Art icle 5). The Commentary should be used as a guide subject to these differences, reservations and observations. It is the Commentary, as amended from time to time by the OECD, which is to be used as a guide under the proposed section YD 4B(4). Therefore, the latest version of the Commentary should be used for this purpose, rather than the version applying when the Bill is enacted (or the version applying when the relevant amount of tax became payable etc). This is consistent with the application of the Commentary to DTAs generally. Proposed new section YD 5B sets out how the profits attributable to a PE are to be determined. This section has been drafted to replicate the wording of the business profits articles of most of New Zealand’s DTAs (adjusted to reflect differences in terminology between the Act and DTAs). Accordingly, whether income is attributable to a PE for the purposes of the new source rules should be determined under the normal PE profit attribution principles (as applied by New Zealand). As noted above, New Zealand follows an earlier version of the AOA profit attribution method. The AOA also only applies in respect of the latest version of the business 47 profits article in the OECD’s Model Treaty. Section YD 5B has been deliberately worded to follow the earlier version of the business profits article, rather than the latest version in respect of which the AOA applies. Accordingly the AOA should not apply to determine the profit attributable to a PE under proposed section YD 5B. Instead, the earlier version of the OECD’s profit attribution method current ly followed by New Zealand should be used. It is important to note that the source rules in subpart YD only apply to determine the amount of income with a New Zealand source. They do not apply to determine the amount of net profit. Consistently with this, section YD 4(17C) and YD 5B should be applied to determine the amount of gross income attributable to the PE, before the deduction of any expenses. A deduction for any expenditure incurred in deriving the New Zealand sourced income will be then available under the Act’s usual deductibility rules. However, the net income under the Act and the amount of net taxable profit attributable to the PE under the DTA should be the same. This is because the deductibility of expenses attributed to a PE under the DTA is also determined under the Act’s general deductibility rules (see paragraphs 30–34 of the Commentary to Article 7). The Act currently has specific source apportionment rules for income from sea transport (sections YD 4(15) and YD 6), non-resident general insurers (sections YD 4(16) and YD 8(2)) and non-resident life insurers (sections YD 4(17) and EY 48). The intention is for these specific apportionment rules to still apply to income fro m these sources, rather than the proposed PE income apportionment rules in section YD 5B. To allow for this, the proposed new source rule in section YD 4(17C) is stated to be subject to sections YD 4(15)–YD 4(17). We note that the Act already contains a source apportionment rule in section YD 5 for income from carrying on business in New Zealand (section YD 4(2)) or making or performing a contract in New Zealand (section YD 4(3)). A PE in New Zealand will also usually derive income from carrying on business in New Zealand or making or performing contracts in New Zealand. Accordingly without amendment section YD 5 would also apply to apportion the income attributable to a PE. Consequently, section YD 5(1BA) is being inserted to confirm that, where there is a PE, the PE attribution rules in section YD 5B should be used, rather than the existing apportionment rules in section YD 5. It is not expected that there would be material differences in the amount of income apportioned to New Zealand under section YD 5B or section YD 5 in most cases. However, one of the purposes of the PE source rule is to simplify the taxation of income from a PE, by not requiring taxpayers and Inland Revenue to apply two sets of rules (the DTA rules and the domestic source rules). Consequently, the Bill proposes inserting section YD 5B to remove any doubt that the PE profit attribution methodology which applies under the DTA should also be used in the domestic source rules. 48 Transfer pricing payments rules 49 50 TRANSFER PRICING RULES (Clauses 35 to 36) Summary of proposed amendments Transfer pricing rules guard against multinationals using related-party payments to shift profits offshore by requiring these payments to be consistent with an arm’s length price and conditions that unrelated parties would agree to. The Bill proposes amendments to strengthen the transfer pricing rules so they align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules. Application date The proposed amendments to the transfer pricing rules generally apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Arrangements that comply with an Advance Pricing Agreement issued by the Commissioner before 1 July 2018 will be grand- parented so they remain subject to the existing transfer pricing rules until the Advance Pricing Agreement expires. Key features The Bill proposes the following amendments to New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation: • Including a reference to using the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines as guidance for how the rules are applied. • The economic substance and actual conduct of the parties will have priority over the terms of the legal contract. This is achieved by requiring the transfer pricing transaction to be “accurately delineated” consistent with section D.1 of chapter I of the new OECD transfer pricing guidelines. • The ability to disregard or replace transfer pricing arrangements which are not commercially rational. For instance, because they include unrealistic terms that unrelated parties would not be willing to agree to. This is consistent with the guidance in section D.2 of chapter I of the new OECD guidelines. • Referring to arm’s length conditions (as per Australia’s legislation) to clarify that the transfer pricing rules can be used to adjust conditions other than the price. • The onus of proof for demonstrating that a transfer pricing position aligns with arm’s length conditions is shifted from Inland Revenue to the taxpayer (consistent with the onus of proof being on the taxpayer for other tax matters). • The time bar that limits Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position is increased from four to seven years (in line with Australia). 51 • In addition to applying to transactions between related parties, the transfer pricing rules will also apply when non-resident investors “act in concert” to effectively control a New Zealand entity, such as through a private equity manager. Background New Zealand’s current transfer pricing legislation dates back to 1995 and no longer reflects modern transfer pricing practices and the associated tax risks. In particular, New Zealand’s existing transfer pricing legislation is based on analysing the legal form of the transaction and adjusting the consideration that is paid to match an arm’s length amount. In contrast, Australia’s transfer pricing rules and the OECD’s 2017 transfer pricing guidelines are based on broader, economic substance approach. This includes requiring the conditions of the transaction to align with the economic substance and actual conduct of the parties. The OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines were substantially updated in 2017 as part of the OECD’s BEPS project. The updates to Chapter I of the Guidelines were designed to align transfer pricing outcomes with value creation (BEPS Act ions 8–10). The OECD has noted that the new guidance ensures that: • actual business transactions undertaken by associated enterprises are identified, and transfer pricing is not based on contractual arrangements that do not reflect economic reality; • contractual allocations of risk are respected only when they are supported by actual decision-making; • capital without functionality will generate no more than a risk-free return, assuring that no premium returns will be allocated to cash boxes without relevant substance; and • tax administrations may disregard transactions which are commercially irrational. The proposed amendments to New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation are intended to allow New Zealand to implement these BEPS recommendations. Detailed analysis GC 6(1B): Applying the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines New Zealand has contributed to and applied the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines since they were first published in 1995. As transfer pricing practices have become more sophisticated, the OECD through its BEPS work has updated its guidelines to represent the agreed international best practice. 52 The Bill proposes that New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation explicitly refer to the OECD transfer pricing guidelines by requiring the rules to be applied consistently with these guidelines. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines are defined in section YA 1 as the guidelines published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as OECD 2017, OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017, OECD Publishing, Paris. This definition refers to the July 2017 edition of the guidelines available on OECD’s website at http://www.oecd.org/tax/transfer-pricing . The OECD transfer pricing guidelines are periodically updated. These updates are developed by OECD’s Working Party 9, which New Zealand participates in, and are approved by the OECD’s Committee of Fiscal Affairs. When these updates occur, we will review the revisions to the guidelines with a view to updating the definition of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines in section YA 1 so it refers to the latest version of the guidelines. Future taxation bills would be used to include these updates to the definit ion in sect ion YA 1. The proposed application date for new section GC 6(1B) is income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. This means transfer pricing positions taken on or after 1 July 2018 will need to be analysed in a way that is consistent with the July 2017 version of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. GC 6(2)(b): Application of transfer pricing rules to suppliers and acquirers in the same control group In addition to applying to transactions between associated parties, the proposed new transfer pricing rules will also apply when non-resident investors “act together” to effectively control a New Zealand entity, such as through a private equity manager. This is achieved through the introduction of a new definition of “control group” which is defined in new section FH 14. The definition of control group includes associated persons (as defined in section YA 2), but is also broader than just associated persons. The definit io n of “control group” includes companies that are consolidated for accounting purposes or associated companies (under section YA 2), as well as investors who are “related” or “act together” to effectively control another person. “Related” and “act together” are also defined in new section FH 14. GC 13(1) and (4): Adding a requirement to apply “arm’s length conditions” The transfer pricing rules require an amount of consideration to be replaced with an arm’s length amount of consideration. The Bill retains the existing wording of section GC 13(1) which describes the process for determining an arm’s length amount of consideration. However, the proposed new section GC 13(1) supplements the existing wording of section GC 13(1) of the transfer pricing rules by clarifying that the arm’s length amount of consideration must be calculated by applying “arm’s length conditions”. 53 This reflects the fact that in some cases, before the arm’s length amount of consideration can be correctly determined, it will first be necessary to make adjustments to some non-numerical conditions of the transfer pricing arrangement. The term “conditions” is not a defined term in the Bill but is intended to include financial values such as the price, gross margin, net profit, and the division of profit between the acquirer and supplier as well as other conditions which may not involve a numerical value such as the absence or presence of a loan guarantee. This is consistent with paragraph 1.7 of the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines which refers to “...conditions (including prices, but not only prices).” Arm’s length conditions are defined in section GC 13(4)(b) as the conditions that would apply for an uncontrolled transaction in circumstances comparable to the accurately delineated transfer pricing arrangement and that might be expected to be agreed upon by independent parties after real and independent bargaining. The second part of this definition is intended to be similar to the definition of “arm’s length conditions” in section 815.125 of Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. GC 13(2): Updating names of approved transfer pricing methods Section GC 13(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 currently refers to the five transfer pricing methods that are described in Chapter III of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. However, the names used for the two methods in (d) and (e) are based on terminology used in the 1995 version of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines that do not reflect the modern OECD terminology that is used for these methods in the 2010 and 2017 OECD guidelines. The Bill therefore proposes replacing the references to “the profit split method” and “the comparable profits methods” with references to “the transactional net margin method” and the “transactional profit split method”. GC 13(4)(a): Accurately delineating the transfer pricing arrangement The proposed new transfer pricing rules require the overall economic substance of the arrangement to be considered. The analysis is not limited to the legal contracts and takes into account the wider economic arrangement and commercial environment. In particular, if the legal contracts do not reflect the actual conduct of the parties, the actual conduct of the parties will be used to apply the transfer pricing rules. Proposed new section GC 13(4)(a) achieves these outcomes by requiring the transfer pricing arrangement to be “accurately delineated using the approach described in section D.1 of Chapter I of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. Section D.1 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines describes the process for accurately delineating the transaction. This process involves identifying the following economically relevant characteristics: • The contractual terms of the transaction (as described in section D.1.1). • The functions performed by each of the parties to the transaction, taking into account assets used and risks assumed, including: 54 - how those functions relate to the wider generation of value by the MNE group to which the parties belong, the circumstances surrounding the transaction; and - industry practices (D.1.2). • The characteristics of property transferred or services provided (D.1.3). • The economic circumstances of the parties and of the market in which the parties operate (D.1.4). • The business strategies pursued by the parties (D.1.5). When deciding what characteristics are economically relevant, the test is to ask what characteristics two independent enterprises would take into account when dealing with each other. This test is explained in paragraph 1.38 of the guidelines which states that: “Independent enterprises, when evaluating the terms of a potential transaction, will compare the transaction to the other options realistically available to them, and they will only enter into the transaction if they see no alternative that offers a clearly more attractive opportunity to meet their commercial objectives. ...identifying the economically relevant characteristics is essential in accurately delineating the controlled transaction and in revealing the range of characteristics taken into account by the parties to the transaction in reaching the conclusion that there is no clearly more attractive opportunity realistically available to meet their commercial objectives than the transaction adopted.” As part of accurately delineating the controlled transaction, the terms of the legal agreement may be disregarded to the extent that they are inconsistent with the actual conduct of the parties. This is explained in paragraphs 1.45 and 1.46 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines provide several examples that illustrate particular aspects of how to accurately delineate transactions. This includes examples of clarifying and supplementing the terms of the written contract with the actual conduct of the parties (see paragraph 1.44) and examples of how risks should be assumed according to how the parties actually manage and control these risks (see paragraphs 1.83–1.85 and 1.89). GC 13(5): Disregarding or replacing commercially irrational transactions Where the transfer pricing arrangements entered into are not commercially rational there is consequently no price which would be acceptable to independent parties in exchange for the relevant goods or services being supplied and acquired. In such cases it is not possible to apply a transfer pricing analysis as transfer pricing relies on being able to identify the arm’s length price which would be agreed between independent parties. To address this problem, section D.2 of chapter I of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines provides guidance about the circumstances where a transaction can be 55 disregarded or replaced with an alternative transaction that allows for a transfer pricing analysis to be performed. Proposed new section GC 13(5) applies when the requirements of paragraph 1.122 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines are met. In summary, this paragraph states that the accurately delineated transaction can be disregarded, if it would not be commercially rational for independent enterprises to enter into the transaction, because it would not be possible to determine a price which would be acceptable to both of the independent parties at the time that the transaction was entered into. In cases where the transaction is replaced it should be replaced with a new arrangement that enables a price that would be commercially rational for independent enterprises to agree on. As noted in paragraph 1.124 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines, the new arrangement should preserve the relevant facts of the original transfer pricing arrangement (as accurately delineated) to the extent that this is possible. Paragraph 1.128 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines provides an example where an arrangement is replaced. The example involves a lump sum payment for all future intangibles developed by an associated company over the next 20 years. This arrangement would not be commercially rational for independent parties to agree on as it is not possible to value these future intangibles. In this example, a number of potential replacement transactions could be considered including a financing arrangement, a contract for research services or a licencing agreement for some specific identified intangibles. If the alternative transaction that independent parties could agree on would have involved no supply or acquisition occurring, then the transaction can be replaced with a transaction involving no supply and acquisition. This is provided for by new section GC (13)(5)(a). This means that the transaction is effectively disregarded and is null and void for determining the person’s New Zealand income tax liability. Note that there may still be NRWT on the payments as existing section GC 12 means that transfer pricing adjustments do not affect NRWT obligations. Paragraphs 1.126 and 1.127 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines provide an example of a transaction which is disregarded and not replaced. This example involves a property prone to flooding which an independent insurer would not agree to insure as evidenced by there being no active insurance market for properties in that area. Onus of proof shifted to the taxpayer When New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules were introduced in 1995 they placed the onus of proof on the Commissioner. That is, the arm’s length amount of consideration is generally determined by the taxpayer under section GC 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Bill proposes replacing sections GC 13(4) and (5) of the Income Tax Act 2007. This means that the general onus of proof in section 149A(2)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will place the onus of proof for transfer pricing issues onto the taxpayer. This proposal is consistent with the fact that the onus of proof is already on the taxpayer for other tax matters. 56 It also reflects the practical reality of transfer pricing analysis. As transfer pricing is driven by specific facts and circumstances and involves comparisons with similar arm’s length transactions, the taxpayer is far more likely to hold the relevant information to support its pricing than Inland Revenue. The onus of proof is on the taxpayer for transfer pricing matters in most OECD and G20 countries, including Australia. This means most multinationals already prepare transfer pricing documentation that satisfies the burden of proof for other countries. For this reason, the additional compliance costs that would be imposed under New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules from shifting the burden of proof onto taxpayers are not expected to be substantial. Extending the time bar to seven years Inland Revenue currently has four years from the end of the tax year in which a taxpayer files an income tax return to investigate and amend the tax position taken by the taxpayer in their return. This four year limit is known as the time bar. The Bill proposes inserting a new section GC 13(6) that will apply despite the general four year time bar in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This new section will extend the time bar for the purposes of the transfer pricing rules by allowing the Commissioner to amend an assessment of tax, under the transfer pricing rules, within a seven year period after the tax year in which the relevant tax return was originally filed. The proposed seven year time bar will also apply in respect of “cross-border related loans” that are subject to new section 6(1C) and sections GC 15 to 18. The extension of the time bar applies from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. This means that tax positions taken in returns relating to income years that began before 1 July 2018 will continue to be subject to the existing four year time bar. 57 COUNTRY–BY–COUNTRY REPORTS (Clause 52) Summary of proposed amendments Inland Revenue already requires New Zealand headquartered multinational groups with annual consolidated group revenue of EUR €750m or more in the previous financial year to file a Country-by-Country report using the IR 1032 prescribed form for all income years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The Bill proposes inserting a specific provision in the Tax Administration Act which will codify the requirement for large multinationals to file a Country-by-Country report. Application date The Country-by-Country reporting requirements apply to income years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. This means groups with 31 December balance dates are impacted first, with data to be collected for the 12 months beginning 1 January 2016. For 31 March balance date and 30 June balance date groups, data needs to be collected for the 12 months beginning 1 April 2016 and 1 July 2016 respectively. Background One of the OECD’s BEPS recommendations was to require large multinational groups (those with annual consolidated group revenue of EUR €750m or more in the previous financial year) to provide a Country-by-Country report which contains certain high- level information on the groups’ global activities to tax authorities who would then exchange this information with each other. The following aggregate information will need to be collected for 2016 and subsequent years for each jurisdiction in which the impacted groups operate: • gross revenues (broken down into related party and unrelated party categories); • profit (loss) before income tax; • income tax paid (on cash basis); • income tax accrued (current year); • stated capital; • accumulated earnings; • number of employees; and • tangible assets other than cash and cash equivalents. 58 In addition, impacted groups will need to list all of their ent it ies that are resident in each jurisdiction, noting also the main business activity of each entity. While this information is too high level to be used to make tax assessments, it will assist tax authorities in providing them with a starting point for assessing risk and potentially requesting more detailed information that could be used to investigate a mult inat ional’s tax posit ion. Inland Revenue already requires New Zealand headquartered multinational groups with annual consolidated group revenue of EUR €750m or more in the previous financial year to file a Country-by-Country report using the IR 1032 prescribed form for all income years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. This requirement applies to about 20 multinational groups, who have been notified by Inland Revenue. A specific legislative provision to require multinationals to file Country-by-Country reports is not strictly necessary as Inland Revenue is already able to use sections 17 and 35 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enforce these requirements. Section 17 allows the Commissioner to request a taxpayer to provide specific information. Section 35 is a general power that enables the Commissioner to prescribe a form. In the case of Country-by-Country reporting an IR 1032 form has been prescribed. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines includes a template for the Country-by-Country report and instructions and definitions for the compiling the information in the template in Annex III of Chapter V of the guidelines. However, the Bill proposes including a specific provision in the Tax Administration Act 1994 that requires Country-by-Country reports to be filed. A specific provision is useful because it will provide a more explicit signal to the affected multinationals and other countries of New Zealand’s commitment to Country-by-Country reporting. For example, accounting firms produce information about each country’s relevant reporting requirements and they may not realise New Zealand is requiring Country- by-Country reports to be prepared and filed if they are not mentioned in our relevant tax legislation. Detailed analysis Proposed new section 78G applies to large multinational groups with an ultimate parent that is a resident of New Zealand. A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 of the Bill to include multinational groups that exceed the revenue threshold of EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover described in paragraph 5.53 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. This revenue threshold was agreed by the OECD as a way to define large multinational groups for the purpose of filing Country-by-Country reports. 59 Large multinational groups with an ultimate parent that is a resident of New Zealand are required to disclose a Country-by-Country report to the Commissioner that includes: • The information described in Annex III of Chapter V of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. This annex includes the OECD template for the Country-by- Country report. • Other information as may be required by the Commissioner. This provides flexibility for future changes to the Country-by-Country report or any additional information that the Commissioner may require. The deadline for filing a Country-by-Country report is within the 12 months after the 12 month period to which the information in the report relates. This means that a Country-by-Country report relating to 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 would need to be filed with Inland Revenue on or before 31 December 2017, Inland Revenue would then exchange this report with other countries by July 2018. 60 Hybrid and branch mismatch rules 61 62 OVERVIEW Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements are cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an instrument, entity or branch under the laws of two or more countries. A hybrid or branch mismatch arrangement can result in a deduction with no corresponding taxable income inclusion or a single payment leading to a double deduction. The result of a hybrid mismatch arrangement is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates. The OECD in its BEPS Action Plan made a number of recommendations to help countries deal with hybrid and branch mismatches. This Bill includes a comprehensive adoption of the OECD recommendations with suitable modification for the New Zealand context. Some of the OECD’s recommended rules are divided into “primary” and “defensive” responses. A defensive response will generally only apply if the other country affected by the arrangement does not have hybrid rules. Where there are two or more parties to a mismatch, the mismatch rules generally only apply if there is some degree of association between the relevant parties to the arrangement, or if the arrangement has been structured to achieve a mismatch. This Bill contains proposed rules designed to address the following hybrid and branch mismatches: • hybrid financial instruments; • disregarded hybrid payments; • structures producing double deductions; • reverse hybrids; • dual resident entit ies; • imported mismatches; and • deemed branch payment and payee mismatches. 63 HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RULE (Clause 30, section FH 3 and FH 4) Summary of proposed amendments A payment under a hybrid financial instrument is a deductible interest payment in the jurisdiction of the payer, and is not fully taxed as interest in the jurisdiction of the payee, or is taxed at a later time. As the payment will result in a deduction for the payer and no corresponding income inclusion (or delayed or less than full inclusion) for the payee, this is a deduction/non-inclusion hybrid mismatch. Proposed sections FH 3 and FH 4 implement recommendation 1 of the OECD Hybrid Report. They are respectively the primary and defensive rules relating to hybrid financial instruments (generally, financial arrangements plus shares). Section FH 3 denies a New Zealand tax deduction for a payment under a hybrid financial instrument. Section FH 4 taxes a payment under a hybrid financial instrument which would otherwise not be subject to tax, or would be taxable on a deferred basis. Application date The sections apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018 (clause 30(2)). This means that section FH 3 applies to payments for which deductions are claimed in that income year or subsequently. The date on which the payment giving rise to the deduction is paid is not relevant. Section FH 4 on the other hand applies only to payments received on or after the start of a person’s income year. There is an exception from sections FH 3 and FH 4 in clause 30(3) of the Bill for payments under a financial instrument entered into on or before 6 September 2016 which: • are intended to qualify as regulatory capital for purposes of the requirements imposed under the Reserve Bank Act 1989 or equivalent legislation in another country; and • are for the direct or indirect purpose of complying with the regulatory capital requirements imposed under the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010 or equivalent legislation in another country. Expenditure, and payments received, in respect of such instruments are not subject to sections FH 3 and FH 4 until the first date on which the issuer has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the instruments without penalt y. 64 Detailed analysis Section FH 3 Section FH 3 applies to a person who is party to a financial instrument and incurs expenditure in relation to a payment under the instrument if: • the tax law of a country outside New Zealand treats the payment as received by a person in that country (who may be a resident of that country or a non-resident carrying on business there). It should not matter that the other country will not treat the payment as received until a later year than the year in which the deduction is claimed; • the financial instrument is or is part of a structured arrangement or the payer and payee are related; • the tax treatment of the payee in its country meets either subsection (2) or subsection (3). Subsection (2) applies to what might be called character mismatches. It applies, if under the law in the payee country in the year the deduction is claimed, any portion of the payment is not treated as ordinary income, and would have been so treated if the classification of the payment or the instrument were varied. Ordinary income is defined in subsection (9). It is income taxed at the full (or usual) marginal rate of a person for income from financial instruments, and which is not eligible for any exemption, exclusion, credit or tax relief, other than for withholding tax imposed on the payment. Although the legislation may require the tax status of the payment in the other country to be determined before the payment is in fact treated as received in the other country, in determining whether a character mismatch arises, the treatment of the payment by the actual payee must be determined. This is different from the approach proposed in the Final Report, which asks how the payment would be taxed to a payee of ordinary status. Example 1 An offshore parent tax resident in Country A lends money to a New Zealand subsidiary on the basis that the loan is subordinated to general creditors and interest payments are subject to a solvency requirement. If the interest is not paid, it compounds. The loan is treated as a share under Country A tax law, and payments are treated as dividends. Country A taxes only 10 percent of any dividend received from a foreign subsidiary. The tax rate imposed on this 10 percent is the same as the tax rate imposed on interest income. In this case, 90 percent of the interest payment is not taxed as ordinary income. However, it would be taxed as ordinary income if the loan were treated as a debt instrument for purposes of Country A tax law. Accordingly, the entire amount of the payment meets the requirements of subsection (2). Alternative 1 However, Country A also has a rule that denies the 90 percent exclusion to dividends from foreign subsidiaries if they are deductible to the subsidiary (similar to section CW 9(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007). In this case section FH 3 would not apply. The dividend would remain deductible, since it is taxable as ordinary income to the offshore parent. Alternative 2 65 The loan is to the New Zealand branch of a subsidiary also resident in Country A, and the offshore subsidiary and the offshore parent are in a tax consolidated group, pursuant to which payments between the two companies are disregarded for Country A tax purposes. In that case, the payment would not be included in the offshore parent’s income regardless of the classification of the payment or the loan. Accordingly the payment is not subject to section FH 3 (though it may well be subject to section FH 5). Subsection (3) applies to what might be called “timing mismatches”. These arise if an amount of a payment: • is recognised as ordinary income; • the financial instrument does not have an explicit term of three years or less; and • the payee is not using a reasonable accrual method to recognise income from the amount and the amount is not, or is not reasonably expected to be, recognised in the payee country in an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the year in which the amount is deductible. Example 2 An offshore parent makes an advance to a New Zealand subsidiary, with interest accruing but payable only if demanded by the parent. The loan has no specified maturity date. The New Zealand subsidiary deducts interest as it accrues, but the parent only has to recognise the interest when it is paid. In this case, although demand for repayment of the advance could be made at any time, there is no requirement for the advance to be repaid within three years, so the de minimis does not apply. In the absence of section FH 3, the group can expect to generate a tax advantage by the subsidiary not paying the interest. Accordingly, unless there is some evidence to support an expectation that the interest will be paid within the required period, the interest payment will be subject to deduction denial under section FH 3. Subsection (4) defines the amount for which the payer is denied a deduction when subsection (1) is satisfied. The deduction has two components. The first component is for the incurred amount. This is the expenditure incurred by the payer relating to the amount received by the payee (which expenditure may be different from the amount of the payment itself). The payment is the amount of the payment received by the payee as referred to in subsection (1)(b). In relation to expenditure which is subject to section FH 3 because of subsection (2), if the financial instrument is denominated in a foreign currency, the expenditure may be calculated taking into account the effect of changes in the NZ$ value of both the principal amount and the payment itself. In this case, the incurred amount in subsection (4) is also intended to include both amounts. This inclusion does not apply to expenditure which is subject to section FH 3 because of subsection (3). In that case, changes in the NZ$ value of the foreign currency principle should be recognised in the usual way. Only the portion of the deduction relating to the payment is denied. The second component is a fraction, which is payee tax divided by ordinary tax. 66 Payee tax is intended to be the total of: • the tax to which the payment is liable in the payee country in the year the deduction is claimed, calculated by determining the amount of the payment that is recognised as income by the applicable rate of tax; and • the amount of income tax actually imposed on the income under CFC rules in another country. In relation to this second component, there must be actual tax payable on the income. This test will not be met if the CFC tax is reduced by losses or credits, other than credits for withholding tax imposed by New Zealand on the payment. The requirement that payee tax only includes payee or CFC country tax on income which arises from the payment received by the payee in the income year means that tax payable on income arising in a later year is not included in this component of the formula. Ordinary tax is the amount of tax which would be imposed on the payment if it were ordinary income in the payee country. Proposed subsection (7) applies to amounts for which a deduction is denied because of a timing mismatch (that is., the amounts fall within subsection (6)). Once the payment is recognised as ordinary income in the payee country, the payer is allowed a deduction for the amount previously denied under subsection (4). The intention of subsection (8) is to deal with the effect of foreign currency gains of a person who, but for such gains, would be denied a deduction for a payment under a financial arrangement because it falls within subsection (2). If such a person has net Example 3 Take the facts of example 1 above. In this case: • the incurred amount is the deduction claimed by the payer in a given year • if a payment is made in the same income year in which the deduction is claimed, “payee tax” will include an amount equal to 10 percent of the payment × the payee’s ordinary tax rate. The formula in section FH 4 will deny a deduction for the incurred amount × 90 percent. Otherwise payee tax will be zero, even if tax is paid in a later year. Example 4 Take the facts of example 2 above. It is determined that the amount for which a deduction is claimed is not likely to be included in the offshore parent’s income within the required time period, so that section FH 3 does apply to the expenditure. In this case: • the incurred amount is the deduction claimed by the payer in a given year • as no payment is made within the year in which the deduction is claimed (if it were, there would be no timing mismatch), there will be no payee tax. 67 income from the financial arrangement due to the foreign currency gain, subsection (8) provides that the income will be excluded income. If the deduction for the payment would have been only partially denied, the income is excluded income in the same proportion. Section FH 4 Section FH 4 is the defensive rule for hybrid financial instrument mismatches. It applies when a person subject to New Zealand tax receives a payment under a financial instrument of an amount that would not give rise to assessable income but for this section and section FH 6 (relating to disregarded payments by a hybrid payer and discussed below), if:  the payment is treated in another country as deductible (or entitled to equivalent tax relief) to a person in that country;  that country does not have an equivalent to section FH 3 (the primary rule for hybrid financial instruments);  the financial instrument is part of a structured arrangement or the payee and payer are related; and  the payment meets the requirements of subsection (2) or (3). A payment meets the requirements of subsection (2) if it does not give rise to assessable income to the payee, but would do so if the classification of the payment or the financial instrument were varied. Generally, it is not expected that subsection (2) would apply to a dividend, since New Zealand already taxes deductible dividends. Nor is it intended that section FH 4 would apply to payments under a finance lease where the payer in another country treats the lease as an operating lease and claims a deduction for the entire amount of the payment. In this case, so long as the instrument remains a financial instrument, there is no variation to its terms that would result in the payments being assessable to the extent they represent a payment of principal in respect of the deemed loan under the finance lease. Subsection (3) deals with timing mismatches. It applies to a payment under a financial instrument which does not have an explicit term of three years or less. It applies if the payment gives rise to assessable income, but the gap between the year in which the deduction is claimed by the payer in its country and the derivation of assessable income in New Zealand meets the requirements of subsection (7). An amount meets the requirements of subsection (7) if it is not included, or is not reasonably expected to be included, in income in New Zealand in an income year beginning within 24 months of the end of the accounting period in which it is deductible in the payer country. Subsection (4) is the main operative subsection for a character mismatch. It provides that a payment which is subject to the section gives rise to assessable income equal to the amount that would be assessable if the classification of the financial instrument were varied. Under subsection (6), this income is allocated to the year in which: 68 • it would be derived if the terms of the instrument were varied so that the payment gave rise to income; or • in the case of a timing mismatch, the payment is received. Subsection (5) provides for the case where a New Zealand taxpayer receives a replacement payment under a returning share transfer. Replacement payments are taxable income. However, if the returning share transfer is also a share lending arrangement, the replacement payment can carry an imputation credit (section OB 64 of the Income Tax Act 2007). If the share borrower is entitled to a deduction in its country for the replacement payment, the attachment of such a credit would give rise to a hybrid mismatch. In order to reverse this, the imputation credit is denied. 69 DISREGARDED HYBRID PAYMENTS AND DEEMED BRANCH PAYMENTS (Clause 30, sections FH 5 and FH 6) Background A hybrid entity is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in the jurisdiction of an investor (Country A) but opaque for tax purposes in another jurisdiction, generally where it is established (Country B). In figure 5, B Co. is the hybrid entity. Figure 5 A Co. + - InterestLoan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co. An interest payment from a hybrid entity (B Co.) to its investor (A Co.) will be deductible in Country B and disregarded in Country A. This can result in a deduction/non-inclusion hybrid mismatch and results in double non-taxation if B Co. groups its tax loss with the income of another entity (B Sub 1) whose income is not taxable in Country A. The same outcome can arise if B Co. is instead a branch of A Co. in Country B and is entitled in Country B to a deduction for a charge made to it by A Co. in Country A, if that charge is not also recognised in Country A. Summary of proposed amendments Proposed sections FH 5 and FH 6 introduce recommendation 3 of the OECD Hybrid Report and recommendation 3 of the OECD Branch Report. They are respectively primary and defensive rules designed to deal with disregarded hybrid payment and deemed branch payment mismatches which produce deduction/no inclusion (D/NI) outcomes. 70 The provisions identify amounts of expenditure relating to:  payments that are deductible in the country of the payer and are disregarded in the country of the payee due to the status of the payer; and  mismatches in the deductibility and recognition of charges by a head office to a branch in another country which are recognised for tax purposes, generally as a way of a branch country ensuring that it taxes only that portion of a mult inat ional ent ity’s income that corresponds to the activities undertaken in the branch country. Section FH 5 applies where the relevant deduction is in New Zealand, whereas FH 6 applies where New Zealand is not including a payment as income and the payment is deductible in another country. These identified amounts are made non-deductible under FH 5 or are included as assessable income under FH 6. However a deduction for them is provided under section FH 12 to the extent they do not exceed surplus assessable income under the offsetting rule in proposed section FH 12. Application date The rules will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Section FH 5 applies to payments for which deductions are claimed in that income year or subsequently. Section FH 6 applies only to payments that are treated by the payer jurisdiction as paid on or after the start of a person’s income year. Detailed analysis Primary rule (proposed section FH 5) – disregarded payments The primary rule concerns New Zealand residents and New Zealand branches of non- residents that incur an amount of expenditure relating to disregarded hybrid payments and deemed branch payments. Subsection (1) sets out the conditions that must be satisfied before the primary rule applies. They are that:  the expenditure is deductible in New Zealand;  the amount is treated as not being received in a foreign country due to the status of the payer;  the amount would be treated as received in a foreign country if the tax status of the payer were different;  the amount does not give rise to tax under CFC rules in a foreign country; and 71  either: - the relevant parties are a New Zealand branch and a part of the entity located outside New Zealand or a New Zealand resident who makes a payment to another person in the same control group; or - the payment is part of a structured arrangement. For the primary rule to apply to a deduction claimed by a New Zealand branch for a charge paid to a non-New Zealand part of the legal entity (deemed branch payments) that charge must satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) and some further requirements set out in subsection (2). The charge must:  be in relation to non-New Zealand activities;  exceed expenditure or loss of the head office that belongs to the same category of expenditure; and  not relate to a payment by the head office (or a member of the same control group) to a person outside of the control group. The payer of the payment has a mismatch amount for all expenditure (that is, including foreign exchange gains and losses) relating to the payment. This mismatch amount is non-deductible. However, under proposed section FH 12, if the payer has surplus assessable income the mismatch amount may be set off against that amount. Example 1 Jefferson Co., a foreign company resident in Washington Country (a foreign jurisdiction) owns 100 percent of Hamilton Co., an unlimited liability company resident in New Zealand. Jefferson Co. provides Hamilton Co. a foreign currency loan under which interest is payable annually. In the relevant income year, the foreign currency strengthens relative to the New Zealand dollar. The interest payments and any foreign currency movements on the loan are deductible to Hamilton Co. in New Zealand. The laws of Washington Country allow Jefferson Co. to treat Hamilton Co.’s income and expenditure as attributable to Jefferson Co. because of Hamilton Co.’s unlimited liability. This means that the interest payment is disregarded in Washington Country due to the status of the payer (Hamilton Co.). If Hamilton Co. were treated differently, for example if it were treated as a separate entity in Washington Country, the interest payment would be treated as received by Jefferson Co. Under proposed section FH 5(3), Hamilton Co. has a mismatch amount for its incurred expenditure on the debt instrument. This expenditure will be non-deductible under section FH 5(5). Hamilton Co. would have to apply section FH 12 to determine whether a deduction can be claimed. 72 Example 2 Root Co., a foreign company resident in Ashes Country (a foreign jurisdiction) operates through a branch in New Zealand. Root Co. manufactures cricket bats in Ashes Country, and sells them to retail stores in various countries, generally via branches in those countries, including the one in New Zealand. Root Co. transfers its cricket bats from Ashes Country to its branch in New Zealand. Each cricket bat transfer is compensated for tax purposes by a $250 charge from the branch to Root Co. representing $150 of costs per cricket bat to Root Co. as well as a $100 mark up in recognition of the profit generating activities of the manufacturing process in Ashes Country. Currently, the entirety of the $250 charge is deductible to Root Co.’s branch in New Zealand and can be offset against income earned by the branch for cricket bat sales. Ashes Country exempts active branch income from taxation. The $250 is potentially within scope of proposed section FH 5 as a deemed branch payment. The $150 cost component of the charge is not within scope of section FH 5. This is because it does not satisfy proposed section FH 5(2)(b) due to the amount being determined by reference to the actual costs of Root Co. (though this amount may be subject to proposed section FH 9). However, the $100 mark up component of the charge meets the requirements of section FH 5(2)(b) as it is a profit-based amount and so it is not determined by reference to any payments made by Root Co. or any other person in a control group with Root Co. To the extent that the $100 mark up portion of the transfer price for each bat is not treated as income of Root Co. in Ashes Land, it will be considered a mismatch amount under section FH 5(3) and it will be denied a deduction under section FH 5(5). Defensive rule (proposed section FH 6) The defensive rule mirrors the primary rule and is targeted at payments that are deductible to a foreign entity but disregarded in New Zealand and foreign branches of New Zealand persons making deemed branch payments. Subsection (1) of proposed section FH 6 sets out the requirements for the defensive rule to apply:  a non-resident, or foreign branch of a New Zealand resident, must be treated by the relevant foreign jurisdiction as having made a payment to a person in New Zealand;  the relevant foreign jurisdiction allows the payer a deduction for the payment or equivalent tax relief;  the person in New Zealand does not derive assessable income from this payment;  the payment would result in assessable income for the person in New Zealand if: - in the case of a hybrid mismatch, the tax status of the payer were different. New Zealand tax law does not generally provide for foreign entities to be entirely disregarded. Even if they are fiscally transparent, such as partnerships, a payment by the entity to a member is generally taken account of for tax purposes (albeit that inclusion by the member of the payment may be largely offset by attribution of a share of the deduction – 73 this means the payment is potentially subject to section FH 9). One case where a payment can be disregarded in this way is where it is made by one member of a tax consolidated group to another member – see section FM 8(2); or - in the case of a branch mismatch, the payer and payee were separate persons; and  the defensive rule applies where the relevant parties are a New Zealand person and its foreign branch, the New Zealand person is in the same control group as the payer, or where the payment is part of a structured arrangement. Additionally, subsection (1)(b) provides that the defensive rule does not apply where the relevant foreign country has hybrid mismatch rules (that is, that country’s primary rule, equivalent to section FH 5, would take priority). In the case of deemed branch payment made by a foreign branch of a New Zealand person, the amount of the payment is determined in proposed section FH 6(2) by reference to amounts allocated to the branch relating to New Zealand activities, to the extent they exceed expenditure or loss of the New Zealand person that belongs to the same category of expenditure. Additionally, the amount of the payment cannot relate to a payment by the New Zealand person (or a member of the same control group) to a person outside of the control group. The payee of the payment has a mismatch amount for the amount of the payment. This amount is assessable income, derived in the year in which it would be derived if the payer and payee were separate persons or the payer’s tax status were different. This assessable income can be reversed by proposed section FH 12. 74 REVERSE HYBRID RULE AND BRANCH PAYEE MISMATCH RULE (Clause 30, section FH 7) Background A reverse hybrid entity is an entity which is opaque for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but transparent for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In figure 6, B Co. is the reverse hybrid. Figure 6 A Co. - Interest Loan Country B Country A B Co. C Co. Country C + If B Co. receives a payment that is deductible for the payer (C Co.), that payment may not be taxed in Country A or B. This is because Country B views the payment as being earned by A Co., while Country A views the payment as being earned by B Co. If the payment would have been taxable had it been made directly from C Co. to A Co., this is a deduction/no inclusion hybrid mismatch outcome. A similar outcome can arise as a result of a branch mismatch. For example, if figure 6 is modified so that:  there is no B Co., but Country A treats C Co.’s payment as received by a Country B branch of A Co., and exempts it under a territorial approach to active inco me; and  Country B does not recognise the payment as received by a permanent establishment in Country B the result will be that the payment by C Co. is not taxed anywhere. 75 Summary of proposed amendments Section FH 7 implements recommendation 4 of the OECD Hybrid Mismatch Report, denying a deduction for a payment to a reverse hybrid in certain cases. It also implements recommendation 2 of the OECD Branch Mismatch Report, denying a deduction for a payment which is not taxed due to a branch mismatch in certain cases. Application date Section FH 7 applies to deductions claimed in income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Section FH 7(1) denies a deduction for a payment: • to a person who “exists” under the law of another country (the “payee jurisdiction”). This requirement assumes that the person is not a natural person, and owes their existence to the laws of a particular country. For example, in the case of a company, the company must be formed or otherwise owe its existence to a particular country’s laws; • treated in the payee jurisdiction as either: - received in another country. This will be the case where there is a potential branch mismatch. A branch mismatch requires that the payee treats the payment as attributable to operations outside its residence country; or - income of another person in the same control group as the payer. This second limb will apply in the case of a reverse hybrid. The payee jurisdiction treats the reverse hybrid as fiscally transparent, so that the payment is treated as the income of its owners. The requirement is only met in the case of an owner who is in the same control group as the New Zealand payer; • where the payee and payer are also in the same control group, or the payment is made under a structured arrangement; • the payment is not subject to taxation of a person in the same control group as the payee. This will be the case where: - in the case of a potential branch mismatch, the branch country does not tax the payment; - in the case of a reverse hybrid, the owner country does not tax the payment; • the payment would have been taxable if it were made: - in the case of a branch mismatch to the payee directly in the payee jurisdiction; - in the case of a reverse hybrid, directly to the owner. 76 If these requirements are met, section FH 7(2) denies a deduction for the payment. If the payment relates to a foreign currency loan, the payer is also denied a deduction for any other expenditure relating from foreign currency movements. There is no reference to income arising from such movements. 77 DEDUCTIBLE HYBRID AND BRANCH PAYMENTS RULE (Clause 30, sections FH 8 and FH 9) Summary of proposed amendments In addition to disregarded hybrid payments, a hybrid entity can also generate a double deduction mismatch if it makes a deductible payment to a third party. This is because the expenditure of a hybrid entity is attributed to its owners under the laws of the owner country, while the same expenditure is treated as deductible in the country of the hybrid entity. Branch structures can also achieve the same result, particularly if the country where the entity with the branch is resident taxes the branch income (as New Zealand does). Proposed sections FH 8 and FH 9 implement recommendation 6 of the OECD Hybrid Report and recommendation 4 of the OECD Branch Report. They are respectively primary and defensive rules designed to deal with hybrid and branch payment mismatches which produce double deduction (DD) outcomes. The primary rule applies where the hybrid entity or branch is owned by a New Zealand resident and located in a foreign country, whereas the defensive rule applies where the hybrid entity or branch is in New Zealand and owned by a person in another country. Notably, the primary rule’s application is restricted such that only foreign branches or hybrid entities that are capable of offsetting their losses against the income of a foreign (non-hybrid) entity are within scope of the rule. This means that simple offshore structures, such as a New Zealand company with (only) a foreign branch in a country are excluded from the rule. The primary rule also contains a transitional rule that ensures that a person that transitions into the scope of the rule will not benefit from the restricted scope in relation to previous year foreign losses. The effect of these provisions is to identify gross amounts of expenditure relating to a person’s branch or hybrid entity. These identified amounts are non-deductible in New Zealand unless they can be offset under proposed section FH 12 (see below). Application date The rules will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Primary rule (section FH 8) New Zealand residents that are related to a foreign hybrid entity or have a foreign branch may fall within the scope of this rule. The main requirement for the rule to apply is in sections FH 8(1)(a) and FH 8(1)(b) which together require that the relevant foreign country allows losses of the hybrid entity/branch to be offset against income of a person whose income is not taxed in 78 New Zealand (other than that which is sourced in New Zealand). This is often referred to (though not in the legislation) as non-dual inclusion income. Section FH 8(2) provides that a New Zealand person to which section FH 8 applies has a mismatch amount for the expenditure it incurs through the hybrid entity or branch. This amount of expenditure is denied a deduction under section FH 8(3). The mismatch amount can then be offset against surplus assessable income under proposed section FH 12. Example 1 The Globe group consists of Prospero Co., Falstaff Co. and Mercutio Co. Prospero Co., a company resident in New Zealand, owns 75 percent of Falstaff Co., a hybrid entity resident in Titania (a foreign country). Falstaff Co. is treated as a company in Titania, but is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as a partnership. Its income and expenditure is thus attributed to its owners (Prospero Co. and the 25 percent minority owner). Falstaff Co. owns 100 percent of Mercutio Co., a company resident in Titania, and the two entities are consolidated. The consolidation regime of Titania allows the losses of one entity to be offset against the income of the other. Mercutio Co. is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as a company, and undertakes an active business in Titania, such that its income is not attributed to Prospero Co. under the CFC regime. Falstaff Co. performs a financing function for the Globe Group, which means that it regularly makes tax losses in Titania due to the deductibility of its financing costs. The financing expenditure is also attributed to Prospero Co. under New Zealand law, and Prospero Co. claims deductions for its 75 percent share of that expenditure. Because Falstaff Co. borrows in Titanian dollars, fluctuations in the NZ$/T$ exchange rate mean the amount of its deductions attributed to Prospero Co. under New Zealand tax rules can be much larger or smaller than the amount calculated for Titanian tax purposes. Prospero Co. satisfies section FH 8(1) due to the ability of its related hybrid entity Falstaff Co. to offset its losses against the income of Mercutio Co., which is not generally assessable in New Zealand. Under section FH 8(2), Prospero Co. has a mismatch amount equal to its expenditure from Falstaff Co. There is no need to compare the amount of this expenditure with the amount of expenditure Falstaff Co. calculates for Titanian tax purposes. A person that is outside the scope of section FH 8(1) because its foreign hybrid or branch is not able to set off expenditure or loss against another person’s non-dual inclusion income and then falls within the scope of the subsection due to a change of group structure (for example, the acquisition of a new non-hybrid entity in the same country as the hybrid entity) is subject to the rule on a prospective basis and also must consider the proposed subsection (4) and (5) of section FH 8. These provisions function as a transitional rule for persons in such a situation to reverse their historic foreign hybrid or branch losses if they become usable in the other country in a way that would defeat the integrity of the primary rule. This transitional rule only applies if: • the person was related to a foreign hybrid entity or had a foreign branch prior to subsection (1) applying to the person; and • the laws of the relevant foreign country allow accumulated losses of the hybrid entity or branch to be set off against income that is not assessable in New Zealand under the new structure. 79 To the extent those requirements are met, proposed section FH 8(5) treats the net loss of the hybrid entity or branch as assessable income and a mismatch amount. Example 2 Drake Co., a company resident in New Zealand, has for many years sold guitars in Pink Moon Country (a foreign country) through a branch. In the last two years trading conditions have been poor in Pink Moon Country and the branch has made losses. These accumulate in Pink Moon Country and can also be offset against Drake Co.’s assessable income from other activities. Drake Co. has had no other activities or interests in Pink Moon Country. Drake Co. does not satisfy the section FH 8(1)(a) and section FH 8(1)(b) requirements because the branch losses cannot be offset against the income of an entity that is not taxable in New Zealand. However, Drake Co. has now decided to expand its operations in Pink Moon Country by acquiring Bryter Co. - a company resident in Pink Moon Country that sells pianos and has a very solid profit history. Bryter Co. is treated as a company for New Zealand tax purposes. The tax laws of Pink Moon Country allow Drake Co. to group its Pink Moon branch operations with Bryter Co. profit such that its future branch losses can be offset against the income of Bryter Co. Drake Co. must now apply section FH 8 to any future branch losses; they will become non-deductible mismatch amounts under section FH 8(2). The laws of Pink Moon Country have no rules preventing the branch losses of Drake Co. accumulated before the Bryter Co. acquisition to be carried forward and offset against Bryter Co. income post- acquisition. Drake Co. must thus apply section FH 8(5) and will have to include as assessable income the accumulated Pink Moon Country branch losses, as calculated for New Zealand tax purposes, in its New Zealand income in the income year of the Bryter Co. acquisition. Defensive rule (section FH 9) The defensive rule mirrors the primary rule. It is applied by a foreign resident operating in New Zealand through a branch or a New Zealand hybrid entity in the same control group as a foreign resident. The defensive rule does not apply where the country of that foreign resident has enacted the primary rule. The rule applies when expenditure of the hybrid entity/branch is deductible in New Zealand and the country of the foreign resident also allows that expenditure as a deduction for the foreign resident. Proposed section FH 9(2) provides that the hybrid entity or foreign resident through its branch has a mismatch amount for the expenditure it incurs in New Zealand. A deduction is denied for this mismatch amount unless and until it is set off against surplus assessable income under proposed section FH 12. 80 Example 3 Jefferson Co., a foreign company resident in Washington Country (a foreign jurisdiction) owns 100 percent of Hamilton Co., an unlimited liability company resident in New Zealand. Hamilton Co. is a hybrid entity (see below for commentary as to the definition of this term). Hamilton Co. incurs various expenses in carrying out its business. These expenses are deductible in New Zealand and are treated as deductible against the income of Jefferson Co. under the tax laws of Washington Country. Washington Country has not enacted hybrid rules. Under section FH 9(2), Hamilton Co. has a mismatch amount for its incurred expenditure. This expenditure will be non-deductible, except as provided for in section FH 12. This denial is intended to ensure that the expenses incurred by Hamilton Co. cannot be used to offset income which is taxable in New Zealand but is not taxable to Jefferson Co. in Washington Country. 81 DUAL RESIDENT PAYER RULE (Clause 30, section FH 10) Summary of proposed amendments Proposed section FH 10 implements recommendation 7 of the OECD Hybrid Report. It is a rule designed to deal with companies that are resident in two countries and which produce double deduction (DD) outcomes. New Zealand tax law already prevents a dual resident company from grouping its losses or forming a tax consolidated group, which are two ways that dual resident company losses can be offset against income that is not taxed in both countries. This rule will more thoroughly prevent this outcome by removing the ability of a dual resident company to offset its expenditure against income earned through a reverse hybrid, such as (potentially) a New Zealand limited liability partnership. Application date The rules will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Proposed section FH 10(1) provides that the rule applies to a company that is a New Zealand resident and is liable to tax in another jurisdiction due to its domicile, residence or place of incorporation. Proposed section FH 10(2) states that a company meeting the requirements of subsection (1) has a mismatch amount for all of its expenditure. A deduction is denied for the expenditure under section FH 10(3). Such a company must then apply section FH 12 to determine whether the denial can be reversed. Generally, the two sections will interact by allowing the expenditure to be offset against the income of the company, less any income that is not and will not be included in the other jurisdiction that the company is resident in. 82 IMPORTED MISMATCH RULE (Clause 30(1), section FH 11, and clause 30(4)) Background An imported mismatch occurs when a payment that does not directly result in a hybrid mismatch outcome funds another payment that creates a hybrid mismatch outcome. Figure 7 is an example of an imported mismatch. Figure 7 Loan A Co. + - H yb rid Financial Instrument Country B Country A Borrower Co. B Co. Country C - + The imported mismatch here occurs between B Co. and Borrower Co. Borrower Co. gets a deduction for its payment and B Co. includes that payment as taxable income, meaning there is no direct hybrid mismatch on that payment. However, that payment is used to fund the payment on a hybrid financial instrument from B Co. to A Co. This payment results in a deduction for B Co., but no corresponding income inclusion for A Co. The loan between Borrower Co. and B Co. then ‘imports’ the hybrid mismatch back to Country C, where there is a resulting indirect deduction/no inclusion hybrid mismatch. Summary of proposed amendments This section denies a deduction for a payment (the imported mismatch payment) which does not itself give rise to a hybrid or branch mismatch, but which is treated as funding such a payment (the funded payment). Imported mismatch payments are split into payments where the imported mismatch payment and the funded payment are part of an arrangement (a structured arrangement) and those where they are not. 83 Application date Section FH 11(3), which denies a deduction for an imported mismatch payment which is part of a structured arrangement, applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Deductions for other imported mismatch payments are not denied until income years beginning on or after 1 January 2020. Detailed analysis For purposes of section FH 11, the person who makes the deductible payment is referred to as the funder. Subsection (1) provides that the section applies to a payment which is made by the funder to a person in a country which does not have hybrid mismatch rules and which: • directly or indirectly funds a hybrid mismatch payment. In order for the funded payment to be a hybrid mismatch payment, it must be between two persons who do not have hybrid mismatch rules that counteract the mismatch (paragraphs (a), (d) and (e)); • is otherwise deductible to the funder (paragraph (b)); and • is: - made under a structured arrangement; or - funds a hybrid mismatch between two persons (the payer and the payee) who are in the same control group as the funder (paragraph (c)). The amount of the deduction denied to the funder depends on whether the payment is made under a structured arrangement or not. The definition of a structured arrangement is the definition used for the hybrid rules generally. A structured arrangement can exist between control group members. For example if funds are provided by a foreign parent to a New Zealand borrower via a series of consecutive intra-group funding transactions, and a transaction in that series gives rise to a hybrid mismatch, it is highly likely that the loan to the New Zealand borrower is part of a structured arrangement. If the payment is under a structured arrangement, the amount of the denial is given by subsection (3). It is the amount of the deduction, limited to the amount of the funded payment for which a deduction would be disallowed to the payer of the hybrid mismatch payment if hybrid mismatch legislation applied to that person. If the payment is not under a structured arrangement, the amount denied is the amount that can fairly and reasonably be treated as providing funds for the portion of the funded payment giving rise to a hybrid mismatch. Subsection (5) provides that this portion should be determined consistently with the approach used in chapter 8 of the OECD Final Report. 84 SURPLUS ASSESSABLE INCOME (Clause 30, section FH 12) Summary of proposed amendments Section FH 12 allows a deduction for hybrid mismatch amounts to the extent that the person paying or deriving the amounts has income which is taxable in New Zealand and can be expected to also be taxed in the other country giving rise to the hybrid mismatch. This income can arise in a different income year from the year the hybrid mismatch amount is disallowed. Application date Section FH 12 applies to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Key features Section FH 12 applies separately to each mismatch situation to which a person is party, but it applies to all mismatch amounts with respect to that situation. A key feature of the section is the definition of surplus assessable income. Generally, this is surplus assessable income from earlier years which has not been offset by deductions for mismatch amounts, plus assessable income arising during the year from the structure which can be expected to be taxed in the other country also. Exempt dividends can also be included in some cases. The carry forward of surplus assessable income and hybrid mismatch amounts is subject to the usual 49 percent ownership continuity test that applies to tax losses. Background Deduction/no inclusion of taxable income (D/NI) payments give rise to double non- taxation where the deduction is used against income which is taxed only in the payer country. In that case the effect of the D/NI payment is to reduce payer country tax without increasing payee country tax. To the extent that the entity or branch earns income which is taxable in both countries (referred to by the OECD reports as dual inclusion income, and in the Bill as surplus assessable income), the D/NI payment will still reduce payer country tax, but it will increase payee country tax. That is because the payee country income calculation will not give a deduction for the D/NI payment. So, any tax reduction as a result of that payment in the payer country will simply reduce the amount of tax for which a credit can be claimed in the payee country. The same result holds for double deductible payments. If a double deductible payment by a hybrid payer is used against non-dual inclusion income, that can produce double non-taxation. However, if the hybrid is profitable in both the hybrid 85 and owner countries, all of the double deduction expenditure will, broadly speaking, be deducted against dual inclusion income, and there is no mischief. The purpose of section FH 12 is to reverse the denial of deductions (or inclusion of income, in the case of section FH 6) that arises under sections FH 5, FH 6 and FH 8– FH 10 where there is dual inclusion income. Detailed analysis Section FH 12(1) applies when a person has a hybrid mismatch amount for a mismatch situation. A person can have more than one mismatch situation. Example 1 Burr Ltd, a New Zealand resident company, owns 99.9 percent of Philip LP, a limited partnership formed under the laws of, and operating in, Country A (the remaining 0.1 percent is held by another group company). Philip LP is a hybrid entity, because it is taxed as a company in Country A and a partnership in New Zealand. It has a branch in Country B. Income and expenditure of the branch is not taxed in Country A because of an exemption for active branch income. Burr Ltd also owns 100 percent of Mercer Ltd, a company incorporated and tax resident in Country A, which is in a tax consolidated group with Phillip Partnership for Country A tax purposes. Payments by Philip LP that relate to its Country A activities are deductible in New Zealand (to Burr Ltd) and Country A (to Philip LP). Payments by Philip LP that relate to its Country B activities are not deductible in Country A but are deductible in New Zealand and the US. In this case, Burr Ltd is party to two mismatch situations, one with respect to its interest in Philip LP and one with respect to its interest in Phillip LP’s Country B branch. It will have a different mismatch amount for each one. Subsection (2) requires a person’s mismatch amounts from a mismatch situation to be set off against the person’s surplus assessable income from the situation. Surplus assessable income is the total of: • surplus assessable income not offset by mismatch amounts in previous years (subject to a reduction also for foreign tax credits in the other country, discussed below); plus • assessable income derived from the situation during the year; plus • if the person is a New Zealand resident hybrid entity, exempt New Zealand source dividends derived during the year if these are taxable to the foreign owner with no tax credit other than for withholding tax; less • unrecognised amounts. These are assessable income which is not subject to tax in the other country because of the residence of the person who earns the income, or the source of the income; less • the amount of assessable income earned by the entity which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit; less 86 • deductions incurred in earning assessable income which do not give rise to mismatch amounts. Example 2 In the example, above, suppose the following amounts of income and expenditure during the year. The tax rate in all three countries is 25%. Burr Ltd, before applying subpart FH New Zealand only Country A only Country B only Total Assessable income 300 200 100 600 Expenses 150 210 40 400 New Zealand taxable income 150 (10) 60 200 For the Country A mismatch situation, Burr Ltd has: • a double deduction amount of $210; and • surplus assessable income of $200, being: – $300 (the amount of assessable income earned through Phillip LP including through the Country B branch); less – $100 (the amount not recognised in Country A because it is from an active business in Country B ); less – assuming no tax is paid in Country A, no credit protected amount; less – deductions incurred in deriving assessable income other than hybrid deductions. This should be zero in this case. Accordingly, the deduction denied to Burr Ltd under section FH 8 for the $210 which is a mismatch amount is allowed under section FH 12 as to $200, and Burr Ltd has $10 of denied deduction to carry forward to the next year. For the Country B mismatch situation, Burr Ltd has: • a double deduction amount of $40; and • surplus assessable income of $100, being the $100 assessable income earned through the US branch. The other amounts in the calculation of surplus assessable income are zero. So all of the $40 deduction denied under section FH 8 for the Country B mismatch situation is allowed under section FH 12. For the Country B situation, Burr Ltd also has $60 surplus assessable income which it can carry forward to the next year under subsection (6). This surplus assessable income cannot be used to claim a deduction for the $10 of denied deduction for Phillip LP’s Country A double deductions. 87 Carry forward of a mismatch amount or surplus assessable income not offset in a year is provided for in subsection (6). Carry forward is subject to subsection (7), which imposes the same 49 percent continuity of ownership test as applies to tax losses. Example 3 In year 2, Phillip LP (excluding Country B) has $30 of double deductions and $50 of surplus assessable income. The $10 mismatch amount for which a deduction was not allowed in year 1 can prima facie be deducted against the $20 of surplus assessable income. However, the group that includes Burr Ltd, Phillip LP and Mercer Pty Ltd is sold to a new owner at the beginning of year 2. This sale will terminate the carry forward of the $10 denied deduction with respect to the Country A mismatch situation. So that amount cannot be deducted in year 2. Subsection (8) provides for a situation where an amount for which a deduction is denied under section FH 8 (a double deduction amount) ceases to be a mismatch amount because the person treated as having the loss in the other country ceases to exist before the loss is used in the other country. This means the loss is no longer able to be used in that other country. This is referred to in the OECD hybrid report as a “stranded loss”. The section applies where: • a New Zealand person has a mismatch amount arising under section FH 8 available to be carried forward at the end of a year; • the person who incurred the loss under the other country’s rules (which may be the New Zealand person or a hybrid entity) ceases to exist; and • under the law of the other country, in the year in which the mismatch arose or any later year, the person has not offset a loss against income which is not assessable in New Zealand. If these requirements are met, the mismatch amount will be: • in the case of a loss incurred by a foreign branch of a New Zealand person, treated as a tax loss component in the year the entity with the branch ceases to exist, in which case it can be offset against another group company’s income in that year; or • in the case of a loss incurred by a hybrid entity, treated as an ordinary tax loss of the owner. 88 DIVIDEND ELECTION (Clause 30, section FH 13) Summary of proposed amendments Section FH 13 allows a person who pays interest which is non-deductible by reason of section FH 3 to choose to treat the hybrid financial instrument on which the interest is paid as a share, and the payment as a dividend, for all tax purposes. Application date This election is available in income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Key features This election must be notified to the Commissioner before it takes effect, specifying the date on which it takes effect. On the effective date, the amount owing under the loan is treated as fully repaid by the person (which may trigger an NRWT obligation) and subscribed for an issue of shares having the same terms as the loan. An election ceases to have effect if the interest payments are no longer subject to deduction denial under section FH 3. At that time the deemed shares are treated as cancelled for an amount equal to the amount payable under the loan, and that amount is treated as re-subscribed for the loan. Background If a deduction is denied for an interest payment under section FH 3 and the payment is also subject to NRWT at 10% or 15%, there is an element of double taxation. People can generally avoid this by entering into non-hybrid loans, and so the election under section FH 13 is not strictly necessary to avoid double taxation. However, the election is proposed in order to ensure that the hybrid rules do not give rise to double taxation even if a person has entered into a hybrid loan. The election will allow a payment which is non-deductible under section FH 3 to be made free of NRWT if the payer either attaches imputation credits to the dividend or is entitled to a zero percent NRWT rate under an applicable treaty. The section treats the instrument on which a payment is made as a share for all circumstances in order to avoid any inconsistencies arising as a result of its being treated differently for different purposes. 89 Detailed analysis Subsection (1) states who can make the election – a borrower who would be denied a deduction of interest under section FH 3. Subsection (2) states the broad result of the election, that is,. that while the person is eligible to make it, the financial arrangement giving rise to the payment is treated as a share for all purposes of the Act. Since there will be no voting rights attached to the financial arrangement, it will generally have the same tax effect as a non-voting redeemable share. Payments on it will be subject to the benchmark dividend rule in section OB 61. Subsection (3) requires the election to be notified to the Commissioner specifying an elective date which must be on or after the date of the notice. Subsections (4) and (5) spell out in more detail the effect of an existing financial arrangement being subject to an election (the election can also be made for a financial arrangement yet to be entered into), and also the effect of it ceasing to be subject to the election. On the effective date for the election the borrower is treated as paying all amounts owing under the financial arrangement. If this includes unpaid interest, this interest will give rise to an NRWT or AIL obligation as appropriate. The amount so repaid, less any NRWT, is then treated as subscribed for the share. Once the interest payments on the instrument are no longer subject to section FH 3, the election becomes ineffective. The deemed shares are then treated as redeemed for the amount owing (which will include any accrued “dividend”) and that amount, against less any NRWT, is treated as re-subscribed for the shares. 90 OPAQUE ELECTION (Clause 30, section FH 14) Summary of proposed amendments This section allows a New Zealand resident who has a wholly owned foreign hybrid entity when the Bill is introduced to elect to treat it as a company for New Zealand tax purposes. It is intended to simplify compliance for people who set up foreign hybrid vehicles before the hybrid rules were introduced. Application date The election applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. It must be made before the due date for the return of income for the first year in which the hybrid mismatch rules apply to the person. Key features The section applies to a New Zealand resident who has, or is a member of a wholly owned group that has, a wholly owned hybrid entity. By making the election such a person can treat the entity as a company for New Zealand tax purposes. This will avoid the person having to apply many of the hybrid rules in relation to the entity. Of course, it will also mean that the entity’s income is separate from the owner’s income, so that, for example, losses from the entity do not reduce the owner’s taxable income. Background The hybrid rules impose a compliance burden on a person who is subject to New Zealand tax and has an interest in a foreign entity which is fiscally opaque for purposes of the foreign country but transparent for New Zealand tax purposes. The person has to determine whether there are any deductions claimed by the entity in the other country for payments which are disregarded in New Zealand. If section FH 6 applies, the person will also have to determine the expenditure attributable to the foreign entity and treat it as ring-fenced expenditure, only able to be deducted against income from the entity. These rules target avoidance of double non-taxation due to different rules relating to the tax classification of entities. The same result can be achieved by ensuring that New Zealand classifies the relevant entity in the same way as the other country. While that is not the approach recommended by the OECD, and it would undoubtedly raise issues which would need to be carefully thought through, adopting it in the very limited circumstances proposed here does not seem problematic. 91 Detailed analysis The election can be made by a person who, on the date of introduction of the Bill, owns, or is a member of a wholly owned group that owns, all the ownership interests in a hybrid entity (subsection (1)). Under subsection (3) the owner must notify the election to the Commissioner on or before the due date for the person’s tax return for the first income year in which the hybrid rules apply to the person. The election will be effective from the first day of the year (subsection 4) and will determine the New Zealand tax treatment of the entity for the remainder of its existence, regardless of who owns it in the future (subsection (7)). The effect of the election is that the owners of the entity (the actual owners that is, who may or may not include the person making the election) are treated as selling, on the first day of the income year, the hybrid’s undertaking to a new company in return for shares. The sale will in most cases trigger some taxable gain or loss, after which point the hybrid entity’s undertaking will no longer be in the New Zealand tax base. The available subscribed capital of the deemed new company will equal the net value of the undertaking it is deemed to acquire (subsection (6)). The owners of the hybrid entity will have to apply the FIF or CFC rules to it as appropriate, and will have to treat all distributions from it as dividends for tax purposes. 92 HYBRID RULE DEFINITIONS (Clause 30, Section FH 15) Act together This definition is relevant for determining whether two persons are in a control group or are related persons by virtue of paragraphs (g) or (h) of the control group and related person definitions. Paragraphs (g) and (h) include two persons in a control group if one effectively controls the other or the same group of persons effectively controls both. In both cases, interests held by persons who are related or who act together are aggregated. The definition of “act together” is intended to be highly fact dependent. For instance, two persons will act together if one “typically” acts in accordance with the wishes of the other, or if their actions are typically controlled by a third person (unless that third person is excluded by section FH 15(2)). Control group Many of the hybrid provisions only apply to payments between members of a control group (unless there is a structured arrangement). The control group definition is generally intended to include persons who are commonly controlled or meet a 50 percent common ownership threshold. For companies and partnerships (whether formed under New Zealand or foreign law) these tests are well established for other purposes, and the definition used in the hybrid rules incorporates these other definit ions. For trusts, it is more difficult to determine ownership (whether by reason of control or economic interests), and accordingly the legislation uses the same tests that apply to determine whether or not parties are associated. Financial instrument This definition is most relevant for sections FH 3 and FH 4. It is intended to encompass all forms of debt and equity. It builds on the financial arrangement definition, which is deliberately very broad. Additions to that definition are then made, including for: • shares: this inclusion may be of less significance given the deductible foreign equity dividend rule, but it would be odd to leave shares out of the definition; • annuities: which are only excluded from the financial arrangement rules because they are taxed under their own regime; • share lending arrangements: share repurchase agreements (share repos), and share lending arrangements which do not meet the statutory definition, are all financial arrangements. Share lending arrangements which do meet the statutory definit io n are excluded from the financial arrangement definition, and need to be brought back in for purposes of the hybrid rules, as they may be hybrid financial transfers, subject to either sections FH 3 or FH 4. 93 Hybrid entity No entity is inherently a hybrid entity. Hybridity exists only as a result of the inconsistent tax classification of the entity by two countries’ tax systems. A hybrid entity is defined as one which is recognised as a person subject to tax (that is, taxed like a company) in a country that treats it as a tax resident, and not recognised as a person that is subject to tax (that is, taxed like a partnership) in another country. The hybrid entity definition is used in sections FH 8 and FH 9 to help to define when those rules (OECD recommendation 6 primary and defensive rules applying to amounts which are deductible twice) apply. It is used in section FH 14 to define the kind of entity in respect of which an opaque election can be made. It is also used in section FH 12 Hybrid mismatch This definition is used in section FH 11, the imported hybrid mismatch section. A payment is only subject to deduction denial under section FH 11 if it funds in some way a hybrid mismatch. Hybrid mismatch legislation means subpart FH and corresponding legislation in other countries. Another country’s legislation will be “corresponding” if it is enacted in accordance with the OECD’s Action 2 recommendation, with or without the addition of branch mismatches. It is not to be expected that another country’s legislation will be exactly the same as New Zealand’s. This means that the amount that New Zealand might counteract, in a given situation, is different from that which would be counteracted by another country’s rules in exactly the same situation. This should not prevent that other country’s rules qualifying as hybrid mismatch legislation. Mismatch situation This means a situation giving rise to denial of a deduction, or assessable income, under sections FH 5, FH 6, or FH 8 to FH 10. A person can be involved in more than one mismatch situation. Also, a single mismatch situation can give rise to more than one kind of mismatch. For instance, a New Zealand resident hybrid entity can make payments which are subject to both section FH 5 (because they are made to a foreign owner who disregards the entity) and section FH 9 (because they are deductible in New Zealand and the foreign country). Related This definition is important for sections FH 3 and FH 4. It is closely based on the associated person definition, except that: • for two companies, it imposes a 25 percent common ownership test; • it applies the same 25 percent rule to a general partnership as for a limited partnership; and • there is a common control test, which also aggregates interests of persons who act together, also as defined in section FH 15. 94 Structured arrangement This definition is used for defining the situations where a hybrid mismatch between persons who are not related or in a control group is nevertheless subject to the hybrid rules. It follows the definition in chapter 10 of the OECD Hybrids Report, by having two (potentially overlapping) limbs, the first of which includes an arrangement where the pricing is based on the existence of a hybrid mismatch, and the second of which includes an arrangement whose terms are intended to produce a hybrid mismatch. The test of “intention” is an objective one, to be applied by looking at the facts and circumstances of the whole arrangement. An arrangement can be intended to produce a hybrid mismatch even if it is also intended to produce significant commercial outcomes. Section FH 15(2) provides that a person will not be treated as acting together with another person on the grounds that both persons’ interests in an entity are managed by the same person if the interests are held through investment funds that do not act together in relation to those interests. 95 FIF RULE CHANGES RELATING TO HYBRID RULES (Clauses 12–16) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill contains some amendments to the foreign investment fund (FIF) regime designed to ensure that a person holding a FIF interest must use the comparative value (CV) method to calculate FIF income from the interest if a distribution on the interest might otherwise be subject to hybrid rules counteraction. The amendments also turn off the ability for to a share supplier of a FIF interest under a returning share transfer to use the fair dividend rate (FDR) method in relation to an arrangement within the scope of the hybrid rules. Application date The changes apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Key features The key features of these clauses is that they require a person to use the CV method in relation to a FIF interest if: • the FIF is entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief in relation to the distribution (subject to certain additional requirements); • the person holds the shares as a share user under a returning share transfer which is within the scope of the hybrid rules. They also turn off the ability of a share supplier in a returning share transfer to use the FDR method in relation to FIF interests which are within the scope of the hybrid rules. Background A straightforward situation where the hybrid rules could apply to a person holding a FIF interest is where the arrangement is within the scope of the hybrid rules and the FIF is entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief for a distribution in its country. If the person is applying the FDR method: • technically, the dividend is exempt income (section CW 9(1)); • the distribution may be greater than the amount recognized under the FDR method. This may make it difficult to determine whether and to what extent the hybrid rules should apply to the deductible dividend. 96 A more complex scenario arises in relation to a FIF interest held by a share user pursuant to a returning share transfer. The hybrid rules apply to hybrid transfers giving rise to a deductible/non-includible result. One way this can occur is if a New Zealand person lends money to a foreign related party by way of a returning share transfer which is a share repo arrangement. In a share repo arrangement, the loan takes the form of an initial sale of shares by the borrower to the lender, followed by a sale back of equivalent shares. The lender may make a financing return by: • receiving and retaining the dividend on the shares; • receiving a greater amount for the sale back of the shares than it paid to acquire them. In some countries, the borrower in a share repo arrangement is treated for tax purposes as continuing to own the shares, which it has provided as security for a loan. In this case, the tax law applying to the borrower will usually treat any dividend paid on the shares and retained by the lender as if it were a deductible payment by the borrower to the lender. If the lender is a New Zealand person and exempt from tax on the dividend, this payment is deductible (to the borrower (share supplier))/non includible (to the lender/share user). Application of the FDR regime, which taxes a deemed 5% return, complicates the picture, and would make it difficult to know whether or how to apply the hybrid rules to such a payment. In order to avoid these complications, the legislation provides that the New Zealand lender (the share user) in such situations has to use the CV method to determine its income from the share. This ensures that the dividend is taxable to the lender, and the hybrid rules do not need to apply. It is analogous to the taxation of a deductible foreign equity distribution. A third scenario arises when a person supplies FIF interests under a returning share transfer which is a share loan. Under current law the person can continue to apply the FDR method as if they still held the shares. If the person is a share lender and receives a substitute payment which is deductible, this can give rise to a hybrid mismatch. In order to prevent this possibility, the changes prevent such a person fro m applying the FDR method if the counterparty is related to the person, or the returning share transfer is a structured arrangement. Detailed analysis Clause 13(2) deals with the more straightforward case of a person holding a share which is a FIF interest in respect of which a dividend is deductible or entit les the payer to equivalent tax relief. The clause inserts a new section EX 46(10)(db) which provides that in such a case the share is a non-ordinary share, which means income from it must be determined using the CV method. This method includes dividends in the calculation of the income, so there can be no hybrid mismatch arising from the payment. New paragraph (db) only applies if: • the arrangement is within the scope of the hybrid rules, because the parties are related or it is a structured arrangement; 97 • the non-resident is not a foreign PIE equivalent. In many countries, widely investment funds are entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief for distributions, designed to ensure that their investors, rather than the fund, are subject to tax on underlying income from the fund’s investments. An example is an Australian unit trust (AUT), where income to which unit holders are presently entitled is taxed to them rather than the trust. This change is not intended to remove the ability for a New Zealand taxpayer to use the FDR method in relation to an AUT undertaking portfolio investment Clauses 12, 13(1) and 14 relate to the returning share transfer scenario. Clause 12(1) adds new section EX 47B to the list of provisions which limit a person’s choice of FIF income calculation methods. Clause 13(1) amends section EX 46(6)(d) so that a person who holds a FIF interest as a share user in a returning share transfer can use the comparative value method to calculate FIF income from that interest if sect ion EX 47B applies to the person. The Bill is also broadening the definition of a returning share transfer so it does not require that the transfer shares are listed. Clause 14(1) adds new section EX 47B, which requires a person to use the comparative value method to calculate their FIF income or loss from a FIF interest subject to a returning share transfer if: • the share supplier is resident outside New Zealand; • the person is related to the share supplier, or the returning share transfer is or is part of a structured arrangement; • the share supplier is treated as the owner of the shares for purposes of its tax rules. Clauses 15 and 16 replace subsections EX 52(14C) and EX 53(16C) respectively. Currently these subsections allow a person who holds a FIF interest and calculates income from that interest under the FDR method to continue to apply that method even if the person has disposed of the shares under a returning share transfer. In practice, this seems to mean that replacement payments paid by the share user are treated as exempt (as dividends would be), and the share supplier continues to pay tax only on the “fair dividend”. In order to avoid the potential for a hybrid mismatch counteraction in such a case, clauses 15(1) and 16(1) respectively amend these subsections by denying the ability take this approach if the share user is related to the share supplier, or the returning share transfer is part of a structured arrangement. This means the share supplier has to apply the financial arrangement rules to the returning share transfer. The financial arrangement rules are comprehensive, and will ensure that replacement payments are taxable. 98 NRWT CHANGES CONSEQUENT ON HYBRID RULES (Clause 41) Summary of proposed amendments This clause amends the formula for determining whether a financial arrangement gives rise to non-resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI). It is intended to ensure that expenditure for which a deduction is denied or deferred under the hybrid rules is not taken into account in determining whether a loan gives rise to non-resident financial arrangement income. Application date The amendment applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Background The purpose of the NRFAI definition is to identify situations where there is a sufficient degree of deferral between: • deductions; and • payments under a financial arrangement between associated parties that NRWT should be imposed on an accrual basis, rather than the usual payments basis. The purpose is to ensure that in such cases, there is a better matching between deductions for the borrower and the imposition of NRWT on the lender. However, the NRFAI definition looks at when expenditure is incurred, rather when it is deductible. This means that where a deduction for expenditure is denied or deferred under the hybrid rules, that denial or deferral is not taken into account, for purposes of the NRFAI definition, because it does not affect the time when the expenditure is incurred. This is not appropriate. For example, if a deduction for interest expense is deferred under section FH 5 there can be no deferral between deduction and NRWT until the deduction is allowed. Detailed analysis Clause 42 reduces the amount of the denominator in the formula used to determine whether a loan gives rise to NRFAI. The denominator is intended to be reduced by the amount of deductions which have been denied or deferred under the hybrid rules. Once the deductions are denied, they are intended to be included in the denominator. 99 THIN CAPITALISATION CHANGES CONSEQUENT UPON HYBRID RULES (Clauses 19(1)–(3) and 26) Summary of proposed amendments The amendment is intended to ensure that interest for which deductions permanently denied under the hybrid rules do not give rise to additional income under the thin capitalisation rules, and that the debt associated with such interest is not treated as debt under those rules. Application date The amendment applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Background The thin capitalisation rules prevent a multinational group taking deductions for interest expense in New Zealand to the extent that it is excessively highly leveraged. Leverage is determined by comparing debt with assets (less, if the Bill is enacted, non-debt liabilities). If a deduction is permanently denied for interest under the hybrid rules, it is not appropriate for that amount to be treated as interest under the thin capitalisation rules. Such treatment could result in that amount being subject (effectively) to an additional denial of deduction. It is also not appropriate for the debt giving rise to that interest to be treated as interest-bearing debt. It should be treated as either equity or a non-debt liability. If a deduction is deferred under the hybrid rules, there is a possibility that that interest will subsequently be allowed, by reason of being offset against surplus assessable income. Deductibility of such interest should depend on the position of the New Zealand borrower and its worldwide group at the time the interest is incurred. Accordingly, no amendment to the current thin capitalisation rules is required in respect of such interest. Detailed analysis Section FE 6(3) provides that an entity subject to the thin capitalisation regime has income equal to, broadly speaking, that portion of its interest deductions that is equal to the extent to which its New Zealand debt/assets percentage exceeds the greater of 60 percent and 110 percent of its worldwide debt/assets percentage. Clause 19 is intended to amend subsection (3) so that it does not include in the amount of interest which can give rise to such income the amount of interest for which a deduction is permanently denied under the hybrid rules. 100 Clause 26 is intended to exclude from the definition of total group debt the amount of financial arrangements that give rise to interest for which a deduction is permanently denied under the hybrid rules. 101 NRWT ON HYBRID ARRANGEMENTS: TREATY ISSUE (Clauses 4 and 42) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed new section RF 11C inserts a new hybrid mismatch rule allowing New Zealand to charge NRWT on payments under certain cross border hybrid financing instruments if New Zealand treats the payment as interest. This rule would override our double tax agreements (DTAs). Application date The proposed rule would apply retrospectively from 1 April 2008. Where taxpayers have already adopted the position that NRWT or AIL is not payable in respect of such cross border interest payments made prior to the introduction of the Bill, a savings provisio n will be available. Background The Government has identified a further hybrid mismatch issue that arises in the following circumstances. The New Zealand PE of a non-resident company borrows money from another non- resident in the same overseas jurisdiction as the corporate headquarters of the PE. This occurs under a hybrid instrument which New Zealand treats as debt but the other country treats as shares. Under our DTAs, New Zealand is able to charge NRWT on interest payments made by a non-resident’s New Zealand PE to another non-resident. However, New Zealand is not able to charge NRWT on dividends paid by one non-resident company to another (regardless of whether the dividends are connected with a PE in New Zealand). This means that whether New Zealand can charge NRWT on payments under a hybrid financial instrument in these circumstances depends on whether the payments are classified as interest or dividends for DTA purposes. Inland Revenue’s view has been that New Zealand can charge NRWT on the payments. This is on the basis that the source state’s (that is, New Zealand’s) classification of the payment determines its tax treatment under the DTA. However, a question has recently been raised as to whether this view is correct. If this view is not correct, then the PE would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for the payments (as the payments are characterised as “interest” under New Zealand domestic law), but the payments would not be subject to NRWT (as the payments are characterised as “dividends” under the DTA). This is contrary to the intent of the relevant DTA provisions, as outbound interest, which is deductible in determining the profits of a PE, should always have NRWT withheld unless there is a 102 specific exemption providing otherwise (For example, some of our DTAs provide specific exemptions to the sovereign wealth funds of the other treaty party). The hybrid mismatch measures already proposed would ensure that payments made under such hybrids could not be both deductible in New Zealand and non-assessable overseas. This would remove the incentive to use these types of hybrids in most, but not all cases. In particular the existing hybrid measures would still permit payments under a hybrid financial instrument to be deductible in New Zealand, but not subject to NRWT in some cases. This tax treatment differs from that applying to either ordinary interest (which is deductible and subject to NRWT) or dividends (which are non-deductible), and could be attractive to some taxpayers. Australia already has a rule effectively providing that outgoing payments are not dividends for DTA purposes (and so are subject to Australian NRWT) if they are treated as interest under Australia’s domestic law. 5 Analysis The Bill proposes inserting a new section RF 11C to clarify this issue. Under proposed section RF 11C(1), the rule applies to a payment of interest (as defined in section YA 1) by a company that is resident outside New Zealand under an applicable DTA to another person who is also resident outside New Zealand under that DTA. Section RF 11C(2) then provides that, for the purposes of the NRWT rules, the payment is treated as interest, notwithstanding anything in the DTA. Section BH 1(4) is also being amended to make it clear that section RF 11C overrides the applicable DTA. The combined effect of the legislation is that New Zealand may withhold NRWT from a cross border payment that is interest under section YA 1, regardless of whether it is treated as a dividend under the applicable DTA. 5 Section 3(2A) of Australia’s International Tax Agreements Act 1953 103 104 Other policy matters 105 106 INCREASING INLAND REVENUE’S ABILITY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM OFFSHORE GROUP MEMBERS (Clauses 50, 51 and 53 to 55) Summary of proposed amendments In order to improve Inland Revenue’s ability to investigate multinationals, the Bill proposes amendments to allow the Commissioner to request offshore information that is held by large multinational groups. The proposals in the Bill are based on some existing powers that the Commissioner already has in sections 17 and 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Bill also proposes a new civil penalty so the Commissioner can impose a fine of up to $100,000 on a large multinational group member who has failed to comply with a request for information. Application date The proposed changes would apply from the date that the Bill is enacted. This means that these new powers can be used by Inland Revenue after the date of enactment when pursuing current or new investigations, even if those investigations cover income years prior to the date of enactment. Key features The proposed new rules only apply to members of large multinational groups. A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 of the Bill to include multinational groups that exceed the revenue threshold of EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover described in paragraph 5.53 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. This revenue threshold was agreed by the OECD as a way to define large multinational groups for the purpose of filing Country-by-Country reports. The Commissioner has an existing power under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to request specific information or documents from New Zealand residents as part of a tax investigation. New section 17(1C) proposes expanding the scope of the existing section 17 power by allowing it to also be used to request information or documents that are held by any member of a large multinational group. This includes members that are non-residents, such as a parent or a sister company. New section 21BA is designed to incentivise large multinational groups to comply with a request for information under section 17 by setting out some specific consequences that can be applied if the multinational fails to provide an adequate response within a reasonable timeframe. These consequences will enable Inland Revenue to make a tax assessment based on the (limited) information it has available and to prevent the requested information from being admitted as evidence in a dispute or court proceeding. 107 Background It can be difficult and resource intensive for Inland Revenue to investigate mult inat ionals wit h co mplex tax structures. Inland Revenue is at a significant evidential disadvantage, as the multinational possesses the information required to prove Inland Revenue’s case. Further, some of the information may be held by the non-resident offshore, making it difficult or impossible for Inland Revenue to obtain it. This can allow a multinational to stymie an Inland Revenue investigation through non-cooperation, particularly through withholding the information required by Inland Revenue to perform the investigation. Inland Revenue’s existing powers for requesting information in section 17 and section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are inadequate in respect of offshore information. Under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner can request any information or documents that she considers necessary to administer or enforce Inland Revenue’s functions. Section 17 is typically used to access information and documents held by a New Zealand resident. However, in many investigations of multinationals, the relevant information is held by an offshore group member. Section 17 only applies when the information is within the knowledge, possession, or control of a New Zealand resident. When the relevant information is held by a non- resident, section 17 only applies if that non-resident is controlled by the New Zealand resident (such as a Controlled Foreign Company). Section 17 does not currently apply to a non-resident that is the parent or sister company of a New Zealand resident or to a non-resident that is taxable in New Zealand (for example, because it has a PE in New Zealand). Under Section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner is able to deny a deduction for taxpayers who fail to adequately respond to information requests regarding payments by them to an offshore entity (section 21(1)). A failure to provide the requested information to Inland Revenue can also prevent the information from being subsequently admitted as evidence in court proceedings (section 21(2)). Section 21 is currently limited to deductible payments. In many BEPS arrangements the New Zealand entity does not make a deductible payment but instead the arrangement results in income being allocated to an offshore group member when the income was actually generated as a result of economic activity carried out by a New Zealand company or PE. Detailed analysis Section 17(1CB): Allowing Inland Revenue to request information held by non- resident members of large multinational groups New section 17(1CB) allows the Commissioner to apply section 17(1) to request information or documents that are in the knowledge, possession, or control of a member of a large multinational group, including members that are non-resident. 108 In practice, it is anticipated that the Commissioner would request the information from the group member who is resident or potentially subject to tax in New Zealand. This group member would then source the required information from non-resident members of their group. The information would be passed on to the relevant New Zealand taxpayer who would then supply this information to the Commissioner. For example, the Commissioner could ask a New Zealand subsidiary of a multinational corporation to provide transfer pricing documentation that was held by their offshore parent. The New Zealand subsidiary would ask their parent to provide this documentation to them, and they would then supply it to the Commissioner. Section 21BA: Consequences from failure to provide information New section 21BA applies if the Commissioner requests, under section 17, information from a large multinational group member and that group member fails to provide a response, or provides a misleading, incomplete or otherwise inadequate response within three months of the request. The Commissioner must then provide a further notice to the member with a one month deadline. If the member still fails to provide a sufficient response within one month of the further notice they will be subject to the following consequences: • the Commissioner can make a tax assessment based on the (limited) information it has available; and • the requested information will not be allowed as evidence in a dispute with Inland Revenue or in a court proceeding (unless a court or authority determines that the information request was unreasonable and admitting the evidence is necessary to avoid manifest injustice). Section 21BA(1) outlines the scenarios where section 21BA can be applied. Subparagraph 21BA(1)(a) deals with the case where no response is provided within three months. Subparagraph (b) deals with cases where a response is provided but the Commissioner considers the response to be misleading, including due to the fact that relevant information has been omitted from the response. Subparagraph (c) deals with cases where the response omits the information that the Commissioner requires to check compliance with the transfer pricing rules or attributing income to a PE. Subparagraph (c) can apply regardless of whether or not the relevant information is in the knowledge, possession, or control of the member. This ensures the consequences under section 21 can still be applied where the information does not exist because the multinational group has not prepared transfer pricing documentation or has not attempted to calculate the profits attributable to a PE. Subparagraph (d) deals with any other case where a response has been provided but the Commissioner does not consider the response fulfils the requirement of the section 17 request. 109 Penalties for failure to provide the requested information Currently, there are criminal penalties for not complying with a request for information under section 17. These penalties include fines of up to $4,000 (for a first offence of simply not providing the requested info rmat ion) or a fine of up to $25,000 (for a first offence of knowingly not providing the information or knowingly supplying false or misleading information). The Bill extends the existing criminal penalties for failing to respond to a section 17 request so that the penalties can also be applied to a large multinational group member that fails to provide information or documents that are in the possession or control of another member o f the mult inat ional group. This is achieved through the proposed amendments to sections 143 and 143A(2) of the Tax Administration Act. Because the existing penalties for section 17 offences are criminal penalties, Inland Revenue must take court proceedings against the taxpayer which is resource- intensive. In addit io n, the modest size of the current criminal penalties may be an insufficient deterrent for large multinationals. The Bill therefore proposes providing Inland Revenue with the ability to impose a fine of up to $100,000 as a civil penalty on large multinational groups which fail to comply with a section 17 request for information or documents. The proposed civil penalty in new section 139AB will provide an alternative to applying the criminal penalties. 110 COLLECTION OF TAX FROM LOCAL SUBSIDIARY OF MULTINATIONAL GROUP MEMBER (Clause 38) Summary of proposed amendment It is currently difficult for Inland Revenue to collect tax from large multinationals that have no direct presence in New Zealand. The Bill therefore proposes to introduce new section HD 30 into the Income Tax Act 2007. This provision will allow Inland Revenue to collect tax owed by a member of a large multinational group from any wholly-owned (local) group member. In the event that a non-resident company fails to pay its tax, this provision will allow Inland Revenue to collect the tax owed fro m any wholly-owned (local) member of the multinational group. Application date The new rule will apply from income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. Key features The proposed new rule only applies to members of large multinational groups. New section HD 30 will allow Inland Revenue to collect tax owed by a member of a large multinational group from any wholly-owned (local) group member. The rule does this by treating the wholly-owned (local) group member of the large multinational group as an agent for the non-resident member that owes the tax. The rule will apply only if: • the non-resident and the New Zealand entity are part of the same wholly-owned group; • the non-resident fails to pay the tax itself; and • the Commissioner has notified the New Zealand entity of its obligations as agent. A large multinational group will be defined in section YA 1 to include multinational groups that exceed the revenue threshold of EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover described in paragraph 5.53 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. This revenue threshold was agreed by the OECD as a way to define large multinational groups for the purpose of filing Country-by-Country reports. Background It is currently difficult for Inland Revenue to collect tax from large multinationals that have no direct presence in New Zealand. The new rule is therefore necessary to allow Inland Revenue to collect tax owed by a member of a large multinational group from 111 any wholly-owned (local) group member, because the non-resident and the subsidiary are part of the same wholly-owned group and therefore part of a single economic entity, the tax owned can be collected from the New Zealand subsidiary. 112 DEEMED SOURCE RULE (Clause 44) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes inserting a new subsection into section YD 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The new subsection will deem an item of income to have a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation if New Zealand has a right to tax that item of income under a DTA. The new rules aim to both simplify the test for determining whether an item of income has a source in New Zealand, and ensure that all items of income New Zealand is entitled to tax under a DTA will be taxable under domestic law. Application date The proposed application date for this amendment is income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. Key features Section YD 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains a list of the types of income that are treated as having a source in New Zealand for income tax purposes. The Bill proposes inserting new subsection (17D) into section YD 4. The subsection will deem an item of income to have a source in New Zealand if we have a right to tax the item of income under a DTA. Subsection (17D) is intended to ensure that if a DTA applies in respect of an item of income, that item of income will automatically have a New Zealand source. Currently, the Income Tax Act 2007 requires the domestic law provision relating to the particular item of income (section YD 4) to be applied. Following this, the relevant DTA articles are applied to determine whether the domestic law assessment requires amending. New subsection (17D) will simplify this two-stage inquiry by deeming an item of income to have a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax the item of income under a DTA. The new rule will also address the situation whereby New Zealand is permitted to tax an item of income under a DTA, but is unable to do so under domestic law. This could potentially arise in the context of the permanent establishment article and would undermine New Zealand’s negotiated taxing rights under our DTAs. Background Multinationals are currently able to structure their affairs so that their sales income does not have a source in New Zealand, even if they have a New Zealand-resident 113 subsidiary that is carrying out significant sales activities here. Under our current source rules, in order for New Zealand to tax a non-resident on all or part of its sales income here: • the sales income must have a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation; and • New Zealand must not be prevented from taxing the sales income under any applicable DTA. Domestic law Whether the sales income has a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation depends on the extent of the business activities carried on in New Zealand by the non- resident. In particular, a non-resident’s sales income will have a New Zealand source if: • the non-resident’s business is wholly or partly carried on in New Zealand; or • the non-resident’s sales contracts are either concluded wholly or partly performed in New Zealand. Because of this, a non-resident’s sales income will arguably only have a New Zealand source if their New Zealand-resident subsidiary is acting as an agent for the non- resident. Where the subsidiary is just contracting to provide sales activities for its non-resident parent, the sales activities might not be attributable to the non-resident. If this is the case then the non-resident would not be treated as carrying on any business activity in New Zealand, and therefore its sales income would not generally have a New Zealand source under our domestic law. This is an inappropriate result as the New Zealand-resident subsidiary is part of the same economic entity as the non- resident multinational and is effectively under its control. DTAs Under New Zealand’s DTAs, there is no requirement for the New Zealand-resident subsidiary to be an agent for the non-resident to carry on its business in order to determine whether a PE exists – a representative of the multinational only needs to play a principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts in order to give rise to a PE. Deemed source rule There is therefore an inconsistency between New Zealand’s domestic law rules and those found in our DTAs. This inconsistency raises the possibility that New Zealand may be able to tax a non-resident on its sales income under the PE article of a DTA, but be prevented from doing so under our domestic law. Proposed section YD 4 (17D) will therefore bring domestic law into alignment with our DTAs and prevent any argument that New Zealand is unable to tax an item of income. 114 LIFE REINSURANCE (Clause 9) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an amendment to section DR 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that no deductions for the reinsurance of life insurance policies are available if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand. The amendment will ensure that section DR 3 applies as intended, and that life insurance businesses operating out of Canada, Russia, Switzerland, and Singapore will no longer benefit from more favourable tax treatment compared with those operating in New Zealand or other countries. Application date The application date for this amendment is income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. Key features The amendment to section DR 3 denies a deduction for a life reinsurance premium paid to a non-resident life reinsurer if the premium is not taxable in New Zealand, including under a DTA. Background Life reinsurance premiums are currently deductible and therefore can be used to shift profits out of New Zealand. For this reason, section DR 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 denies a deduction for life reinsurance premiums when the corresponding premium income is not taxable in New Zealand. Section DR 3 achieves this result by providing that no deduction is available for the reinsurance of a policy unless the policy is offered or entered into in New Zealand. Under Article 7 of our DTAs, New Zealand is prevented from taxing business profits earned by a non-resident unless they are attributable to a PE of the non-resident in New Zealand. To ensure that the life insurance rules can continue to operate for non- resident life insurers without a New Zealand PE, New Zealand typically excludes insurance income from the scope of the business profits exemption in Article 7 of our DTAs. However, New Zealand’s DTAs with Canada, Russia, Switzerland, and Singapore include life insurance income in Article 7. Under these DTAs, New Zealand is unable to tax a non-resident life insurer on its New Zealand sourced premium income unless that premium income is attributable to a PE of the non- resident in New Zealand. The amendment to section DR 3 is therefore necessary to ensure that section DR 3 applies as intended, and that life insurance businesses operating out of Canada, 115 Russia, Switzerland, and Singapore will no longer benefit from more favourable tax treatment compared with those operating in New Zealand or other countries. 116

For example, because interest payments are deductible, a related-party cross-border loan between a foreign parent and their New Zealand subsidiary will reduce taxes payable in New Zealand. 1.2 New Zealand has rules that limit the interest deductions of firms wit h international connections (the inbound and outbound thin capitalisation rules together with the transfer pricing rules). Our thin capitalisation rules, first introduced in 1996 have been strengthened numerous times, such as reducing the safe harbour from 75 per cent to 60 per cent in 2011, and by extending the rules so they apply to New Zealand firms controlled by non-residents who act together in 2015. 1.3 Overall, we consider that our rules are serving us well. The rules are well understood and set clear and largely predictable limits on the amount of deductible debt allowable in New Zealand. Firms subject to the rules are significant taxpayers in New Zealand – for example, foreign controlled firms paid 39 per cent of company tax in the 2015 tax year. 1.4 While the majority of firms subject to the thin capitalisation rules have taken conservative debt posit ions, there is a minority that engages in more aggressive tax practices. Of particular concern is that some firms have borrowed from their foreign parents at high interest rates, resulting in very large interest deductions in New Zealand. A proposal to address this is discussed in chapter 3. 1.5 In reviewing our thin capitalisation rules, we have identified several other areas for improvement. A proposal to change how a firm’s total assets are determined for the thin capitalisation rules – that they should be determined net of a firm’s non-debt liabilities – is discussed in chapter 4. This change would bring New Zealand into line with other countries wit h thin capitalisation rules. 1.6 Chapter 5 discusses other proposals to improve the rules. These include introducing a de minimis, which will reduce compliance costs for smaller firms, and a permissive regime for project-financed infrastructure projects funded with third-party debt, reflecting the fact that such projects represent a low profit shifting risk. 1 Scope of review 1.7 New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules apply to outbound investment (New Zealand-based firms that have international operations) as well as inbound investment (foreign-owned firms operating in New Zealand). 1.8 We propose that the proposals discussed in this document apply to both foreign-owned firms and domestically-owned firms wit h foreign affiliates. While the focus of the BEPS project in New Zealand has been on inbound investment, similar base protection considerations can arise in an outbound context. We consider that it makes sense for a similar set of rules to apply to both inbound and outbound investment. 1.9 In the context of the interest rate proposal discussed in chapter 3, this means that the rule would apply to loans from a foreign-parent to a New Zealand owned subsidiary, and to loans from a foreign subsidiary to a New Zealand parent. 1 The rule would not apply to loans from a New Zealand parent to its foreign affiliates, as the same base protection concerns do not arise. 1.10 In the context of the changes discussed in the other chapters, this means that the proposals would apply in relation to both the inbound and outbound thin capitalisation rules. 1.11 A special thin capitalisation regime also applies to registered banks operating in New Zealand. Most of the changes discussed in this paper would not apply as they are not relevant to that regime. However, we propose to apply the interest rate proposal discussed in chapter 3 to banks subject to the banking thin capitalisation rules. 1.12 This paper does not discuss a reduction in the thin capitalisation safe harbour of 60 per cent. Setting the safe harbour is ultimately a matter of judgement, and the Government is satisfied with its current level. Submissions 1.13 The Government seeks submissions on the proposals set out in this discussio n document. 1.14 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.15 Submissions should be made by 18 April 2017 and can be emailed to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “BEPS – Interest limitation rules” in the subject line. 1 Loans between a foreign subsidiary and domestic parent are not common but are possible. For example, the recent Chevron case in Australia was about such a loan. 2 1.16 Alternatively, submissions may be addressed to: BEPS – Interest limit ation rules C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.17 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 1.18 In addition to seeking written submissions, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials intend to discuss the issues raised in this discussion document with key interested parties. 3 CHAPTER 2 New Zealand’s approach New Zealand’s inbound investment framework 2.1 New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) to fund domestic investment. FDI can also bring ancillary benefits to New Zealand, such as new technology and management practices. As such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest. 2.2 At the same time, it is important that firms operating here pay a fair amount of tax. Base protection measures, such as interest limitation and transfer pricing rules, are important to protect the tax base and ensure that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment. 2.3 As noted in New Zealand’s inbound invest ment framework, 2 the amount of tax payable to New Zealand on an investment is substantially affected by the choice of how it is funded. Investments funded with equity are subject to full taxation at 28%. In contrast, since interest paid on debt-funded investment is deductible, the New Zealand tax paid on debt is generally limited to non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) on the interest payments (at either 10% or 15%). 2.4 However, an important factor in determining the tax impost on FDI is how the foreign investor is taxed in their home jurisdiction. This is illustrated in the framework document with a hypothetical decrease in the thin capitalisation safe harbour to 50 per cent. 2.5 For some investors, this would decrease the attractiveness of New Zealand as an investment destination while for other investors it would have no impact. 3 As discussed by the Tax Working Group, 4 choosing the thin capitalisation safe harbour threshold involves trade-offs between the potential effect on the desirability of New Zealand as an investment location and the benefits to New Zealand arising from having taxes paid in New Zealand. 2.6 This discussion document does not propose a change to the thin capitalisation safe harbour. It does, however, suggest some changes that will reduce the ability for some foreign-owned firms to take interest deductions. This involves similar trade-offs to those discussed above. 2.7 The analysis of thin capitalisation rules in the inbound investment framework applies only if a firm borrows at a reasonable interest rate – at the very least, the marginal cost of debt should be no more than the marginal return fro m 2 The draft framework is available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-other-nz-framework-inbound- investment/overview 3 An investor who is tax exempt on interest income would face a lower effective tax rate on a New Zealand investment if they took advantage of the lower safe harbour. In contrast, an investor who is taxed at 28% or more on interest income would likely be indifferent to the change: increasing the gearing of their New Zealand investment would not reduce total tax paid (and could actually increase tax paid). 4 Debt and equity finance and interest allocation rules (2009), Background paper for the Tax Working Group. 4 further investment. If this is not the case, the use of debt will depress tax payments in New Zealand by far more than discussed in the framework. 2.8 With regards to the proposed adjustment for non-debt liabilities discussed in chapter 3, the fundamental question is whether a firm’s total assets should be determined on a gross basis or net of non-debt liabilities. The inbound investment framework paper did not consider this matter; it assumed a company’s assets would only be funded with debt and equity. As discussed in chapter 4, we consider measuring total assets net of non-debt liabilities is more consistent with the objectives of the thin capitalisation rules, and accordingly propose a change. 2.9 Overall, the Government considers that this package of proposals strikes an appropriate balance between ensuring New Zealand is an attractive place to invest while helping ensure that firms operating here pay a reasonable amount of tax. Link to the OECD’s BEPS Action 4 2.10 Because of the large potential for interest to be used to shift profits internationally, the OECD developed best-practice interest limitation rules as part of the OECD BEPS project (BEPS Action 4). 5 2.11 There are two broad approaches to the design of an interest limitation rule. One is the approach adopted by New Zealand, which is to limit the amount of tax deductible debt a company can have, usually based on either its level o f assets or equity. By restricting debt levels, allowable interest deductions are also restricted, albeit in an indirect manner. The second approach is to directly limit the interest a company can deduct based on some measure of the company’s profits (normally either EBIT or EBITDA). 6 2.12 There are advantages and drawbacks to each approach, which are outlined in the BEPS Action 4 Final Report (September 2015). These include the following: 5 Limiting Base Erosion Involving Interest Deductions and Other Financial Payments (2015), OECD. 6 Earnings before interest and tax, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, respectively. 5 Interest limitation rule comparisons Rule based on the level of debt relative to assets Rule based on the level of interest expense relative to earnings Advantages Disadvantages 1 The level of debt is more stable than profitability and is more within the control of management. The amount of interest expense may vary due to interest rate changes that are outside the control of management. 2 An assets-based approach is typically stable and predictable. Measuring economic activity using earnings, which might be relatively volatile, means it is hard to anticipate the level of interest expense that will be permitted from year to year. 7 3 There is no need to have specific provisions to deal with the effect of losses. Entities and groups with negative earnings (losses) require specific rules. Disadvantages Advantages 1 BEPS risks will not be addressed where an excessive rate of interest is applied to a loan. This rule is much less vulnerable to excessive rates of interest. 2 An assets-based approach requires a consistent and acceptable model for valuing each class of assets. Concerns over the recognition and valuation of assets is less of an issue. 3 The level of debt may vary throughout a period, so debt on a particular date may not be representative of an entity’s true position. The level of interest expense in an entity will reflect all changes in borrowings throughout the period. 2.13 The OECD acknowledged that fixed ratio rules are blunt tools which do not take into account the fact that groups operating in different sectors may require different amounts of leverage. However, it encourages countries to make their rules robust and effective. To avoid double taxation for groups leveraged above the fixed ratio level, countries are encouraged to combine a fixed ratio rule with a group ratio rule, as New Zealand has already done within its current interest limitation rules. 2.14 The OECD concluded that the advantages of a profit-based interest restriction outweighed the drawbacks. The best-practice rule it developed involves restricting interest deductions to between 10–30 per cent of a company’s EBITDA. However, the OECD outlined a number of issues that should be considered in designing a profit-based approach, including: • Whether to base earnings on EBITDA or EBIT. • Whether to adopt a worldwide group ratio rule. • Whether to apply a de minimis to remove entities which pose the lowest risk from the scope of an interest limitation rule. 7 Based on responses to Inland Revenue’s International Questionnaires, 54 groups had net finance costs greater than 30 per cent of EBITDA in the 2014 financial year; of these, only 23 (43%) had net finance costs greater than 30 per cent of EBITDA in the 2015 financial year. The variation was more extreme for groups with net finance costs and negative EBITDA; 20 groups had negative / nil EBITDA in the 2014 financial year; whilst the total number was similar in the 2015 financial year, only five (11%) had negative / nil EBITDA in both years. 6 • Whether to address volatility concerns, for example by carrying forward or backwards disallowed interest and/or unused interest capacity, or by averaging EBITDA over a three-year period. • Whether an entity in a loss-making position is able to deduct its net interest expense in the current period, or whether alternative mechanisms will be used to limit interest deductions when profits are negative. 2.15 The final report from the OECD did note that there are other effective methods to address profit shifting through interest – including a well- designed rule based on a company’s level of debt. 2.16 This discussion document does not consider the issue of whether New Zealand should change to an EBITDA-based rule. No decision on this has been taken at this stage. The purpose of this discussion document is to explore whether there are some rules that could address some of the disadvantages of an asset based rule outlined in the table above. 2.17 This is because, overall, we consider that our current approach to limiting interest deductions is working well. Accordingly it seems preferable to put forward specific proposals that seek to address some of the problems we are currently seeing in our rules without abandoning this general framework. 2.18 In particular, we consider an asset-based thin capitalisation regime must be bolstered by rules to restrict the ability of taxpayers to use excessive interest rates for related-party loans. A proposed rule to prevent this is discussed in chapter 3. We also consider that our rules will be more robust and effective if there is a change to how total assets are determined. A proposed rule to achieve this is discussed in chapter 4. 2.19 If it is not possible to address the problems in our rules, we acknowledge that an alternative approach would be to use an EBITDA based rule, as suggested by the OECD. We welco me submissions on which approach is preferable. 7 CHAPTER 3 Limiting the interest rate on related-party loans 3.1 This chapter discusses a proposal to limit the interest rate on cross-border related-party loans. While in principle transfer pricing should limit the interest rate on such loans, we are concerned that the rules are not always effective. Their application is also resource intensive for both Inland Revenue and taxpayers. 3.2 Under the proposal, the thin capitalisation rules will limit the deductible interest rate on related-party loans based on objective and readily observable factors, such as the credit rating of the borrower’s ultimate parent. Background 3.3 New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of deductible debt a company can have, rather than directly limiting interest deductions. In order for the rules to be effective at actually limiting interest deductions in New Zealand to an appropriate level, allowable interest rates on debt also need to be limited. 3.4 Historically this limitation has been achieved through transfer pricing. However, we are concerned that this approach has not been wholly effective. 3.5 The transfer pricing rules require taxpayers to adjust the price of cross-border related party transactions so it aligns with the arm’s length price that would be paid by a third party on a comparable transaction. The arm’s length interest rate on a debt is affected by a number of factors, including its term, level of subordination, whether any security is offered, and the credit rating of the borrower. 3.6 As discussed in the discussion document BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance, the Government is proposing to update and strengthen New Zealand's transfer pricing rules including adopting economic substance and reconstruction provisions similar to Australia’s rules. The proposed transfer pricing rules would disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction. They would also allow transactions to be reconstructed or disregarded if such arrangements would not be entered into by third parties operating at arm’s length. 3.7 Even with these stronger transfer pricing rules, we are not convinced that transfer pricing will be the most effective way to prevent profit-shifting using high-priced related party debt. 3.8 When borrowing from a third-party, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to try to obtain as low an interest rate as possible – for example, by providing security on a loan if possible, and by ensuring their credit rating is not adversely affected by the amount being borrowed. 8 3.9 These same pressures do not exist in a related-party context. A related-party interest payment, such as from the New Zealand subsidiary of a multinational to its foreign parent, is not a true expense from the perspective of the company’s shareholders. Rather, it is a transfer from one group member to another. There are no commercial tensions driving interest rates to a market rate. Indeed, it can be profitable to increase the interest rate on related-party debt – for example, if the value of the interest deduction is higher than the tax cost on the resulting interest income. 3.10 In addit io n, related-party transactions are fundamentally different to third- party transactions. Factors that increase the riskiness of a loan between unrelated-parties (such as whether the debt can be converted into shares, or the total indebtedness of the borrower) are less relevant in a related-party context. For example, the more a third-party lends to a company, the more money is at risk if the company fails. However, the risks facing a foreig n parent investing in New Zealand do not change whether it capitalises its investment with related-party debt or equity. 3.11 Some related-party loans feature unnecessary and uncommercial terms (such as being repayable on demand or having extremely long terms) that are used to just ify a high interest rate. Simply making the related party debt subordinated or subject to optionality may also be used as justifications for a higher interest rate. In other cases, a very high level of related party debt may be loaded into a New Zealand subsidiary to depress the subsidiary’s credit rating, which also is used to justify a higher interest rate. 3.12 It can be difficult to challenge such arrangements under the transfer pricing rules as the taxpayer is typically able to identify a comparable arm’s length arrangement that has similar conditions and a similarly high interest rate. With the proposed stronger transfer pricing rules, the taxpayer would have to provide evidence that the legal form was consistent with the economic substance and that a third party operating at arm’s length would agree to enter the arrangement. These new requirements should limit the use of artificial or commercially irrational funding arrangements. However, we are concerned that they may still provide scope for taxpayers to choose to borrow from related parties using higher-priced forms of debt than they would typically choose when borrowing from third parties. 3.13 In addition, the highly factual and subjective nature of transfer pricing can make the rules complex and uncertain to apply. Assessing compliance with the arm’s length principle requires very detailed and specific information and analysis of how a comparable transaction between unrelated parties would have been conducted. This makes complying with the transfer pricing rules a resource-intensive exercise which can have high compliance costs and risk o f errors. Transfer pricing disputes can take years to resolve and can have high costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. 3.14 For these reasons we consider an objective and certain rule such as an interest rate cap is a better option for ensuring the pricing of debt is reasonable. 9 3.15 We note that we are not alone in these concerns. The OECD’s final report on interest limitation rules notes that thin capitalisation rules are vulnerable to loans with excessive interest rates. 8 This was one of the reasons behind the OECD favouring the EBITDA approach to limit interest deductions. 3.16 Nevertheless, as discussed above, we consider it preferable to attempt to directly limit interest rates on related-party debts. If this is not possible or effective, we may need to consider other possible changes including an EBITDA-based rule. Proposal 3.17 We propose amending the thin capitalisation rules to limit the deductible interest rate on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower. We consider that such a cap is the best approach to ensure that the interest rate on related-party loans is roughly in line with the interest rate the borrower would agree to with a third-party lender. We consider that such a rule would also reduce or eliminate costly disputes over what an appropriate interest rate is under standard transfer pricing. 3.18 Our proposed design of a cap is set out below, but we welcome submissions on alternative approaches. 3.19 No cap would apply to loans from third parties. 9 Rejected approach: hard interest rate cap 3.20 One approach would be to set a hard cap – eit her limiting deductible interest rates to some absolute number or limiting them based on yields on corporate bonds at a certain credit rating. This approach has the advantage of clarity and simplicity, but it has numerous drawbacks. 3.21 It would not align well with the objective above of ensuring that the interest- rate on related-party debt is roughly in line with the interest rate the borrower would agree to with a third-party lender. In some cases the cap would be higher than what a taxpayer would have been willing to pay – so would either be ineffective or permit higher interest rates (if the interest rate cap operated as a safe harbour). In other cases the cap would be too low – because of a firm’s particular circumstances, it might be willing to borrow fro m third-parties at very high interest rates. 3.22 A hard cap would also not be well targeted. While, at first blush, a hard cap may appear to target only firms who have most egregiously structured their related-party loans to get the highest possible interest rates, this is not necessarily the case. The interest rate that a borrower would accept on a third-party loan is a question of fact and circumstance (such as the borrower’s industry, current interest rates, and general economic conditions). A hard cap is not able to take these factors into account. 8 Limiting Base Erosion Involving Interest Deductions and Other Financial Payments (2015), OECD. 9 Provided the third-party loan was not part of a back-to -back arrangement. 10 Preferred approach: cap based on parent credit rating 3.23 We consider a better approach to an interest rate cap is, wherever possible, to base the cap on the interest rate that the borrower’s ultimate parent 10 could borrow at on standard terms. That is, to set the maximum deductible interest rate on a loan from a non-resident to a New Zealand resident to: • where the ultimate parent of the borrower has a credit rating for senio r unsecured debt, the yield derived from appropriate 11 senior unsecured corporate bonds for that credit rating, plus a margin. • where the ultimate parent has no credit rating, the interest rate that would apply if the parent raised senior unsecured debt on standard terms, plus a margin. • where there is no ultimate parent, the interest rate that would apply if the New Zealand group raised senior unsecured debt on standard terms (with no margin). 3.24 We consider that the interest rate that a multinational could obtain when raising senior unsecured debt (either determined with reference to its credit rating, or calculated based on other factors) is a reasonable approximation of the multinational’s cost of funds. 3.25 This proposed rule would therefore anchor the deductible interest rate on intra-group debt to a multinational’s actual cost of debt. We consider this reasonable. For example, one funding option available to a multinational would be to raise third-party debt and on-lend the debt to its New Zealand subsidiary. We consider it unlikely that the mult inat ional would have it s New Zealand subsidiary borrow from a third party at an interest rate significantly higher than the multinational’s cost of debt, since this would lower its overall pro fits. 3.26 More detail of how this proposed rule would work is set out below. Appropriate margin 3.27 When the New Zealand borrower has an identifiable parent, we have proposed that some margin be added. The margin ensures, for example, that the rule does not apply in relation to a loan where there are only small differences between a multinational’s cost of funds and the interest rate on that loan. 3.28 This is similar to the approach taken in the thin capitalisation rules with the worldwide group debt test. The maximum amount of deductible interest is based on the debt to asset ratio of the worldwide group, plus a 10 per cent margin. 10 Where the ultimate parent is a holding company and the main operating entity in the group has a higher credit rating, the operating entity’s credit rating would be used. 11 For example, the margin on bonds at the same credit rating can vary across industries. A taxpayer should be able to demonstrate that their choice of comparator bonds is appropriate. 11 3.29 We welcome submissions on what an appropriate margin would be. 3.30 To illustrate, say the allowable margin attributable to the New Zealand subsidiary was limited to that which could be derived from appropriate bond yields one credit rating notch below that of the senior unsecured rating attributable to the ultimate parent. This means if a mult inat ional group had a credit rating for senior unsecured bonds of AA-, the deductible interest rate on an intra-group loan would be based on A+ corporate bond yields. 3.31 The exception to this rule would be if the New Zealand borrower itself has a credit rating. In this case, we propose that the maximum deductible interest rate would be based on the higher of: • the multinational’s credit rating for senior unsecured debt plus the margin; and • the New Zealand group’s credit rating for senior unsecured bonds. 12 Borrowers with no identifiable parent 3.32 Most firms subject to the thin capitalisation rules are controlled by a single non-resident, making it possible to determine the credit rating (or interest rate on senior unsecured debt) for its ultimate parent. However, this is not possible when a New Zealand firm is controlled by a non-resident owning body. Such a firm has no single parent company. 3.33 In this case, we propose that the appropriate cap for related-party debt is determined based on the rate at which the New Zealand borrower could issue senior unsecured debt. This is because it is not possible to base the cap on the cost of funds of the borrower’s parent. 3.34 Similar to when there is an identifiable parent company, we propose that the deductible interest rate be limited to the rate at which the company could raise senior unsecured debt (on standard terms). We believe this is a reasonable requirement as most companies typically raise the majority of their debt on standard senior unsecured terms. 3.35 In addit io n, this rule ensures that unusual features added to related-party debts (such as convertibility into shares) cannot be used to justify high interest rates. 3.36 However, the proposal to price debt as if it is senior unsecured debt does not prevent a firm’s owners loading it with uncommerical levels of debt, pushing down its credit worthiness and therefore increasing the allowable interest rate on related-party debt. We consider that there are two options for addressing this concern: 12 If the New Zealand group had a credit rating for another type of bonds, this would be used to calculate a rating for senior unsecured bonds for the purposes of this rule. 12 • determine the borrower’s credit worthiness based on an arm’s length amount of debt, as determined under transfer pricing (this is the approach taken in Australia); 13 or • deem all related-party debt to be equity for the purpose of determining the borrower’s credit worthiness. 3.37 This first approach is likely to result in higher interest rates, but is more uncertain and would result in higher compliance costs: the borrower would need to be able to justify the quantum of debt and this could be subject to challenge by Inland Revenue (for the purpose of determining the appropriate interest rate). We welco me submissio ns on this point. International comparison 3.38 We are not aware of other countries imposing a similar interest rate cap in relat ion to their thin capitalisat ion rules. However, many countries are instead adopting an EBIT or EBITDA based interest-limitation rule, in part because of concerns over the difficulty of pricing related-party debt appropriately through transfer pricing. 3.39 As discussed in the introduction, we consider that our proposed approach – implementing a regime to limit the interest rates on related-party debt – to be preferable to adopting an EBIT/EBITDA based rule. Further detail Interest rate cap 3.40 Interest rates on corporate debt can either be fixed for a period or floating (i.e. calculated using a benchmark index, such as the interest rate swap curve, plus a fixed margin). 3.41 With fixed interest loans, the interest rate cap would be determined on and apply from the day the interest rate on the loan is struck (or seven days prior to the date on which the funds are committed, if the interest rate on the loan is struck more than seven days from the commitment date). 14 Subsequent movements in bond yields would have no bearing on the allowable interest rate. 13 As in Australia, the overall level of deductible debt would continue to be determined under the thin capitalisation rules. Transfer pricing would be used to determine the level of debt solely for calculating the borrower’s credit worthiness. 14 This is to prevent gaming of the rule in situations where interest rates are viewed as likely to decrease, by striking an interest rate well before funds are committed. 13 Example 1 A New Zealand company is borrowing from its foreign parent in NZD at a fixed interest rate. The parent’s credit rating for senior unsecured bonds is BBB+. With a one notch margin this means the maximum deductible interest rate on the loan would be based on appropriate BBB bond yields. Say the interest rates on BBB bond yields (swapped into NZD) at the time the related party loan was arranged were: 1 year: 2% 2 years: 3% 3 years: 4% 5 years: 5% The interest rate on a NZD-denominated related-party loan will be restricted to no more than the above rates. So, a loan with a one year term will be restricted to a 2% interest rate, while a loan with a five year term will be restricted to a 5% interest rate. Subsequent movements in bond yields will not affect this maximum interest rate. 3.42 For floating-rate debt, the cap would apply to the fixed margin over the benchmark index, again on the day the fixed margin is struck and by reference to appropriate bonds trading at that time. The loan’s margin would be compared to the difference between the rate on the relevant credit curve and the rate on the relevant interest rate swap curve corresponding to the committed term of the loan. If the loan’s margin exceeded this difference, the excess would be non-deductible. Example 2 Say the company above decides instead to borrow in NZD at a floating interest rate with a term of five years. When the loan was entered into, the USD interest swap rate for five years was 1% and five year US corporate BBB bond yields were 3%. The maximum margin on the loan, for the life of the loan, would therefore be 2%. Since the loan is in NZD and has a floating interest rate, an appropriate benchmark index would be a NZD floating interest rate. 15 Say when the loan was entered into, the NZD floating interest rate benchmark rate was 2%. This means that, when the loan was first entered into, the maximum deductible interest rate would be approximately 4% (2% floating interest rate benchmark index plus the 2% margin). 16 Subsequent movements in the floating interest rate benchmark index would result in a higher or lower, as the case may be, maximum deductible interest rate. Say six months after the loan was entered into, the floating interest rate benchmark index increases to 3.5%. The maximum allowable interest rate on the loan would therefore be approximately 5.5% (3.5% benchmark index plus 2% margin). 15 For example, the New Zealand three-month bank bill rate. 16 This example is simplified. A 2% margin in USD does not equate to exactly a 2% margin in NZD due to financial market practice – for example, incorporating a basis swap. 14 Meaning of “related-party” 3.43 For the purposes of this rule, we propose that a loan be treated as being from a related-party if it originates from a member of the firm’s worldwide group, a member of a non-resident owning body, or an associated person of the group or body. Treatment of guarantee fees 3.44 When the New Zealand subsidiary of a multinational borrows from a third party, that loan is sometimes guaranteed by the multinational group. In some situations, the New Zealand subsidiary a fee is charged for this – known as a guarantee fee. 3.45 Guarantee fees are calculated based on the difference in credit worthiness of the multinational group and the New Zealand subsidiary. Under our proposal, the maximum deductible interest rate on a related-party loan is based on the credit worthiness of the multinational group, plus a margin. For consistency, we propose that guarantee fees be limited to the margin allowable under the interest rate cap. Otherwise there is a risk that the total cost of debt to the New Zealand subsidiary (third-party interest rate plus guarantee fee) could be significantly higher than the actual cost of debt facing the mult inational. De minimis 3.46 Applying this interest rate cap will likely require the engagement of financial analysts or other subject matter experts, who have access to bond yield data and are able to perform the required calculations. This is no different to the situation at present – firms borrowing from related-parties should be involving subject matter experts to perform comparability analysis and ensure that the interest rate (and the other terms and conditions) of the related-party loan is reasonable. 3.47 We therefore believe this proposal will not result in increased compliance costs; indeed, compliance costs may reduce in some instances. 3.48 However, consistent with current administrative practice to reduce compliance costs for smaller firms, 17 we propose a de minimis for groups where the principal of all cross-border related-party loans is less than NZ$10m. We propose that, for these firms, ordinary transfer pricing rules will apply. This will allow Inland Revenue’s approach to low value cross- border loans to continue, where a specified margin (currently 250 basis points) above the benchmark rate is allowable. Link to transfer pricing 3.49 We propose that this rule will override the general transfer pricing rules, except as provided for in paragraphs 3.36 and 3.48. This means that related- party loans that are subject to the interest rate cap would not also be subject to adjustment under transfer pricing. 17 http://www.ird.govt.nz/transfer-pricing/practice/transfer-pricing-practice-financing-costs.html 15 3.50 We propose that all other tax rules would continue to apply as normal. For example, the general anti-avoidance rule (or other anti-avoidance rule) could apply to an arrangement, even if its deductible interest rate has been adjusted under these rules. Anti-abuse rule 3.51 When market interest rates or borrowing margins increase, taxpayers have an incentive to reset the interest rate on related-party loans, as this increases the deductions available in New Zealand. For example, say a taxpayer has a loan fro m it s foreign parent at 4% with a maturity of 1 April 2020. Say market interest rates increase, such that a new loan with a maturity of 1 April 2020 would have an interest rate of 7%. The taxpayer may have an incentive to break the current loan early and enter into a new loan to take advantage of the now higher interest rate and thus increase New Zealand deductions. 3.52 We are not proposing a specific rule to prevent taxpayers from breaking loans to take advantage of increasing interest rates or borrowing margins. However, such an arrangement would defeat the intention of our proposals. We anticipate that the general anti-avoidance rules could apply to such an arrangement. Maximum loan term 3.53 It is unusual for a commercial loan to be committed for longer than five years. Most banks are reluctant to commit to funding for a longer period than this. Accordingly, for the purposes of this rule, we propose that a related-party loan with a term of longer than five years will be treated as having a term of five years for the purpose of determining the appropriate interest rate. Transitional rules 3.54 We do not propose any special transitional rule. This means that, once these rules take effect, related-party cross-border financing arrangements currently under foot will be subject to the interest rate cap. 3.55 Prevailing interest rates change over the economic cycle – current interest rates and floating-rate margins may be higher or lower than when a loan was first entered into. The maximum interest rate should therefore be calculated based on historic interest rate data for the day on which the interest rate was struck. Consistency with New Zealand’s DTAs 3.56 We believe that our proposed interest rate cap is consistent with New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTAs), including the articles of our DTAs relating to the arm’s length principle. This is for three reasons. 3.57 The interest rate cap proposed is consistent with our existing thin capitalisation rules, in that it denies deductions by reference to a group formula (debt to asset ratios) rather than by reference to arm’s length 16 amounts. The Commentary to the Model Tax Convention states that thin capitalisation regimes are consistent with the arm’s length principle insofar as their effect is to assimilate the overall profits of the borrower with those which would have accrued in arm’s length situations. This is on the basis that, while a thin capitalisation regime does not expressly refer to arm’s length amounts, it aims to approximate a similar overall level of interest expense for a taxpayer as would arise in arm’s length situations. 3.58 Our current thin capitalisation regime achieves this by allowing the taxpayer to borrow up to 110 per cent of the debt to asset ratio of its worldwide group instead of the safe harbour in determining the maximum amount of debt in respect of which interest can be deducted. Similarly, the proposed interest rate cap sets the maximum rate at which interest can be deducted by reference to the rate at which the taxpayer’s worldwide group can borrow from independent lenders (that is, the parent’s credit rating). In this regard, we note that independent lenders take the credit rating of the group into account when determining the interest rate payable by a New Zealand subsidiary, even without an explicit parent guarantee. Therefore, the interest rate cap should generally produce a similar level of interest expense as would arise in arm’s length situations. Consequently it should also be consistent with the arm’s length principle. 3.59 Second, both the Commentary to the Model Tax Convention and the BEPS Action 6 Report state that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between domestic ant i-avoidance provisions and a DTA. To the extent that it can be seen as going beyond a strict application of the arm’s length principle, the interest rate cap is a domestic anti-avoidance provision intended to stop profits being shifted out of New Zealand through the use of excessive interest payments between related parties. Related enterprises can adjust the legal terms of loans in order to impose higher interest rates, even though those terms do not have economic consequences on a group basis. This means that any departure from the overall profits that would result from application of the arm’s length principle is necessary to address the tax avoidance concerns arising from excessive interest payments (as noted by the OECD in its report on BEPS Action 4). Therefore the interest rate cap is consistent with our DTAs as a domestic anti-avoidance rule to the extent it does not produce an arm’s length amount of interest expense for the borrower. 3.60 Finally, the OECD specifically recommends countries adopt an interest limitation rule in its Report on BEPS Action 4. While the OECD recommends an earnings-based rule (such as one based on EBITDA) rather than an asset-based rule with an interest rate cap, one of the reasons the OECD favoured the approach is because it largely neutralises the effect of highly priced debt. However, as discussed above, we consider that our proposed approach of maintaining an asset-based rule combined with an interest rate cap is a better course of action. Like an EBITDA-based rule, it largely neutralises highly priced debt, but in a more consistent and predictable manner. On this basis we consider that our proposed thin capitalisation regime coupled with the interest rate cap is consistent with international practice and the OECD’s recommendations. 17 CHAPTER 4 Treatment of non-debt liabilities 4.1 This chapter proposes a change to how total assets are determined under the thin capitalisation rules. Currently the thin capitalisation rules are based on a firm’s gross assets; however, we consider that a better measure would be a firm’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities. 4.2 We consider that requiring this adjustment for non-debt liabilities would be more consistent with the core objectives of the thin capitalisation rules. Background 4.3 New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules are based on a company’s debt to asset percentage. A company’s assets are, in most cases, the value of its assets disclosed in its financial accounts. In contrast, a company’s debts for thin capitalisation purposes are much narrower than its liabilities for accounting. 4.4 Debt in the thin capitalisation rules is limited to financial arrangements that provide money and that give rise to deductions under the financial arrangement rules. 4.5 The remaining liabilities on a company’s balance sheet (its non-debt liabilities) do not count as debt for thin capitalisation purposes. Examples o f non-debt liabilities are trade credits, provisions, out-of-the-money derivatives and interest free loans. Example 3 ABC Co has the following balance sheet: Assets 100 Debt 60 Shareholder capital 40 ABC Co’s current thin capitalisation ratio is 60 per cent – reflecting that its assets are 60 per cent funded with debt and 40 per cent funded with equity. Say ABC Co makes an after-tax profit of $50. Its balance sheet then becomes: Assets 150 Debt 60 Retained earnings 50 Shareholder capital 40 18 ABC Co’s thin capitalisation ratio falls to 40 per cent, reflecting its higher level of assets and equity. ABC Co could pay out a dividend of up to $50 without breaching the thin capitalisation safe harbour. Say instead ABC Co makes an after-tax loss of $25. Its balance sheet would become: Assets 75 Debt 60 Retained earnings (25) Shareholder capital 40 ABC Co’s thin capitalisation ratio would increase to 80 per cent. It would have to pay down some of its debt, inject more equity, or face interest denial on some of its debt. The problem 4.6 We are concerned that this treatment of non-debt liabilities is inconsistent with the core objectives of the thin capitalisation rules. At present the rules limit an entity’s debt relative to its gross assets. However, we consider that a better basis for the rules is to limit debts with reference to its assets net of its non-debt liabilities (its net assets) – which is the same as its equity plus its interest-bearing debt. 4.7 The thin capitalisation rules have three interrelated objectives: • to restrict companies’ interest deductions to interest on only a commercial level of debt; • to ensure that only a reasonable portion of a multinational’s worldwide debt is allocated to New Zealand; and • to restrict the ability for companies to shift profits out of New Zealand using interest. 4.8 These three factors all suggest that net assets, rather than gross assets, would be a better basis for the rules. 18 Commercial debt levels 4.9 The thin capitalisation rules are intended to, in part, restrict the level of deductible debt to the amount a third-party would lend to an entity on reasonable terms (that is, a commercial level of debt). 4.10 In reality, third-party lenders consider numerous factors when considering how much to lend. However, the nature of thin capitalisation rules means only a single factor can be considered: the value of an entity’s assets. 4.11 We consider that third-party lenders would be more concerned with an entity’s net assets than its gross assets. The presence of non-debt liabilities reduces the assets the company may have available to repay its debt. The 18 The exception to this is interest-free loans from a parent or other associated person as they are in substance equity. 19 existence of non-debt liabilities may also impact on a borrower’s solvency and therefore whether it can continue to trade. 4.12 Measuring a company’s assets net of non-debt liabilities seems more consistent with the objective of ensuring commercial levels of debt. Worldwide apportionment 4.13 Multinational companies often borrow from external parties through a central treasury function. The central treasury then on-lends funds as needed across the mult inat ional’s operations. 4.14 The purpose of the worldwide test in New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules is to ensure that the amount of debt that has been on-lent to New Zealand is a reasonable portion of the multinational’s total debt, having regard to the relative size of its New Zealand operation. Interest deductions are denied if it appears too much debt has been placed in New Zealand. 4.15 The treatment of non-debt liabilities is relevant when considering the relative size of a multinational’s New Zealand operation. Again, we consider that the best approach is based on net assets. This is because, as discussed above, we consider net assets to be a better measure of a company’s commercial borrowing ability than gross assets. It is therefore a better measure of how the mult inat ional’s total debt should be spread across all its operations. Restrict profit shifting 4.16 The final objective of the thin capitalisation rules is to prevent companies from shifting profits out of New Zealand through excessive interest deductions. 4.17 An increase in a company’s non-debt liabilities with no change in its debt liabilities will also bring about an increase in its assets or a reduction in its equit y. If equity is reduced, this means that the company’s shareholders’ investment in the company has decreased. However, at present this decrease has no impact on the allowable level of debt under the thin capitalisation rules. 4.18 Alternatively, if assets increase, the level of allowable debt increases even though the shareholders have not increased their investment in the company. 4.19 We are therefore concerned that the current treatment of non-debt liabilities means companies are able to have high levels of debt (and therefore high interest deductions) relative to the capital invested in the company by shareholders. 4.20 We are also concerned that this treatment does not produce equal outcomes across companies. As illustrated below, firms earning the same level o f profit or loss can have very different thin capitalisation outcomes, depending on their non-debt liabilities. In addit ion, some companies naturally have high levels of non-debt liabilities, such as distributors that generally have large trade payable balances. The current treatment of such liabilities under the 20 thin capitalisation rules means a much smaller percentage of the company’s assets need to be funded with shareholder equity compared to a company with no non-debt liabilities. Example 4 Mining Company has the following balance sheet: Assets 100 Interest bearing debt 60 Shareholder capital 40 Mining Company opens a mine and earns $100 after tax; however, in the future Mining Company will be required to close the mine at a cost of $50 (which it records as a provision in its accounts). Its profit is therefore $50, and its balance sheet will be: Assets 200 Interest bearing debt 60 Non-debt liability – provisions 50 Shareholder capital 40 Retained earnings 50 Mining Company has made $50 profit and so is $50 more valuable. However, at present the thin capitalisation rules treat the company as if its value has increased by the full $100 cash it has earned, so its thin capitalisation ratio falls to 30 per cent (= 60/200). The company would be able to distribute its $100 of earnings without breaching the safe harbour (that is, pay out its $50 profit plus reduce shareholder capital to -10). This is in contrast to ABC Co in Example 3, which also made $50 after-tax profit. However, in that case ABC Co was only able to distribute its actual profit of $50 before breaching the thin capitalisation safe harbour. The treatment of non-debt liabilities is not neutral across firms. If instead the thin capitalisation rules were based on net assets, Mining Company’s thin capitalisation would have fallen only to 40 per cent (= 60/(200 – 50)). Accordingly, the company would only be able to distribute its actual profit of $50 without breaching the thin capitalisation safe harbour. Example 5 Instead, say Mining Co had opened a mine and earned $25 after tax. As above, however, it would be required to close the mine at a cost of $50 in the future. Mining Co would have an after-tax loss of $25. However, this is not captured in the current rules. Mining Co’s thin capitalisation ratio would fall to 48 per cent (= 60/125). It would be able to distribute its $25 of earnings (effectively withdrawing $25 of shareholder capital) without breaching the safe harbour. This is in contrast to ABC Co in example 4, which also made a loss of $25. However, in that case ABC Co’s thin capitalisation ratio increased to 80 per cent. It would have had to repay some of its debt, received an equity injection, or would face interest denial on some of its debt. 21 Example 6 Say Distributor Co has the following balance sheet: Cash 30 Other assets 70 Interest bearing debt 60 Retained earnings 30 Shareholder capital 10 Distributor Co’s thin capitalisation ratio is 60 per cent. Distributor Co then acquires $30 of trading stock, which it purchases on trade credit. At the same time, Distributor Co pays out its retained earnings. Its balance sheet is now: Cash 0 Other assets 100 Interest bearing debt 60 Non-debt liability – trade credits 30 Retained earnings 0 Shareholder capital 10 Under current rules Distributor Co’s thin capitalisation ratio is still 60 per cent, even though its owners have withdrawn $30 of their capital from the company. If, however, the thin capitalisation rules were based on net assets, Distributor Co’s thin capitalisation ratio would increase to 86 per cent (= 60/(100 – 30)). Proposal: non-debt liability adjustment 4.21 We propose that a company will be required to measure its assets net of its non-debt liabilities. 4.22 For a company’s New Zealand group, we propose defining non-debt liabilities as: • all liabilities (as shown in the company’s financial accounts) that are not counted as debt under section FE 15; less • any interest-free loans from a shareholder in the group, or person associated with a shareholder, as such a loan is more akin to equity. 4.23 We propose a similar definition of non-debt liabilities for a company’s worldwide group, being: • all liabilities (as shown in the company’s financial accounts) that are not counted as debt under section FE 18; less • any debt that is excluded from being counted under section FE 18(3B), as such debt is effectively treated as equity for the purposes of the worldwide group debt test. 22 Example 7 Z Co’s balance sheet is as follows: Assets 100 Interest-bearing debt 20 Non-debt liability – trade credits 10 Interest free loan from parent 20 Equity 50 Under the proposed change, Z Co’s thin capitalisation ratio would be 22 per cent. Its debt for the purposes of thin capitalisation rules is $20. Its total liabilities are $50, but $20 of this is an interest-free loan from Z Co’s parent company. Its non-debt liabilities are therefore $10 and its thin capitalisation calculation is 20/(100 – 10). International comparison 4.24 Like New Zealand, Australia has thin capitalisation rules that limit a company’s deductible debt based on a debt to asset test. However, unlike in New Zealand, Australia requires assets to be measured net of non-debt liabilities. 4.25 Indeed, New Zealand’s approach to basing a thin capitalisation rule on gross assets, rather than net assets or equity (which are equivalent), 19 appears to be unique. A recent study by the IMF 20 looked at 28 countries with thin capitalisation rules. It shows that, apart from New Zealand, all countries base their rules off either net assets or equity. 4.26 This reinforces our view that the proposed adjustment for non-debt liabilities is appropriate. Impact of the proposals 4.27 We do not expect this change to affect most companies, who either have low levels of non-debt liabilit ies, low thin capitalisat ion ratios, or both. However, we expect that as a result of this proposal, a small number of companies will face interest denial without a reduction in the level of debt, or injection o f new equity. 4.28 As discussed in chapter 5, we do not propose to grandparent existing arrangements. As with previous changes to the thin capitalisat ion rules, we consider that the delayed application of these proposals will give companies sufficient time to rearrange their affairs as required. 19 Assets = debts + non-debt liabilities + equity, or A = D + NDL + E. This means that if a country has a D/E limit of 1.5, this is the same as requiring equity to be at least (A-NDL)/2.5. This is equivalent to limiting debt to 60 per cent of A-NDL. 20 Blouin, J, Huizinga, H, Laeven, L, and Nicodeme, G, Thin Capitalisation Rules and Multinational Firm Capital Structure, IMF Working Paper WP/14/12. 23 4.29 As noted above, certain types of companies – such as distributorships, mining companies, and insurance companies, tend to have relatively large non-debt liability levels. We have considered whether specific rules are required for any industry but have concluded they are not necessary. We note that Australia does not have special rules for these industries. 24 CHAPTER 5 Other matters 5.1 This chapter discusses five additional proposed changes to our thin capitalisation rules. They are: • a de minimis for the inbound thin capitalisation rules • a special rule for infrastructure projects that are controlled by a single non-resident • reducing the ability for companies owned by a group of non-residents to use related-party debt • removing the ability to use asset valuations for the thin capitalisation rules that differ from those reported in a firm’s financial accounts • removing the ability to measure assets and debts on the final day of a firm’s income year; and • a minor remedial relating to the changes made in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 5.2 This chapter also discusses the application dates for all of the proposals in this paper. De minimis for the inbound thin capitalisation rules 5.3 Thin capitalisation regimes can be fairly complex. Accordingly, many countries provide an exemption for companies with little interest expense, on the basis that they present a low BEPS risk. The OECD’s final report on Action 4 also raises the possibility of a de minimis on this ground. 21 5.4 New Zealand does not currently have a de minimis in its inbound thin capitalisation rules, but does have one in its outbound rules (of $1 million of interest deductions). 22 Proposal: De minimis for companies with little interest expense and third-party debt 5.5 We recognise that some type of de minimis is appropriate for companies that pose litt le BEPS risk. We therefore propose extending the existing de minimis in the outbound rules so that it applies to inbound entities as well, provided none of the entity’s debt is owner-linked debt. 23 The de minimis would operate exactly as it does for outbound entities (for example, phasing out between $1m and $2m of interest deductions). 21 OECD 2015, op. cit, p. 35. 22 The de minimis then phases out between $1m and $2m of interest deductions. 23 Broadly speaking, owner-linked debt is debt from a person with an ownership interest in the entity or debt that is guaranteed by such a person. It is defined in section FE 18(3B). 25 5.6 Our proposed de minimis is restricted to firms with only third-party debt because firms wit h owner-linked debt carry a higher BEPS risk compared to firms with only third-party debt. This is because there are no commercial constraints that limit the amount of owner-linked debt an entity can take on. Infrastructure projects controlled by single non-residents 5.7 The OECD’s final report on Action 4 24 discusses an exemption for specific third-party loans, provided on non-recourse terms, used to fund infrastructure projects. This exemption recognises that such funding presents little risk of BEPS. 5.8 New Zealand’s rules do not feature such an exemption. Nevertheless, when a New Zealand entity is owned by a group of non-residents (none of which has a controlling interest in their own right), the entity is unrestricted in how much third-party debt it can take on (provided that debt is not guaranteed by its owners). In practice, this operates more or less like the exemption discussed by the OECD. 5.9 In contrast, New Zealand entities controlled by a single non-resident do face restrictions on how much third-party debt they can take on. In general this restrict ion is well-placed: it prevents mult inatio nals fro m allo cat ing a disproportionate amount of their worldwide debt in New Zealand. 5.10 However, in some situations – when all of a New Zealand investment’s financing is from third-party lenders who are lending on a limited recourse basis, there is limited ability for debt to be over-allocated to the investment because of the limited recourse nature of the loan. In addit ion, third-party debt provided on limited recourse terms will, by definition, be no more than a commercial level of debt. 5.11 At the same time, we are aware that the worldwide group debt test is not particularly effective in relation to multinationals involved in constructing new assets, such as infrastructure. This is because such projects generally start with high debt levels that reduce over time. However, the worldwide group debt test only allows the New Zealand subsidiary to have slightly more than its average worldwide debt level – which may be insufficiently low for a new project. Proposal: carve-out for infrastructure projects with third-party funding 5.12 Because of these two factors, we propose adopting the exemption discussed in the OECD’s final report. The restrictions to accessing the exemption discussed below are taken from that report. Under this proposal, a firm will be able to exceed the 60 per cent safe harbour if: • The firm has been established for a project to provide, upgrade, operate and or/maintain assets for at least 10 years, and the assets cannot be disposed of at the discretion of the entity; 24 OECD 2015, op. cit, p. 39. 26 • The project has been established at the request of the New Zealand Government, a Government department or a local/regional council. • The loan is not owner-linked debt, so that the lender is a third-party and only has recourse to and a charge over the assets and income streams o f the specific project; • The loan or loans made to the entity do not exceed the value or estimated value of the assets once constructed unless additional investment is made to maintain or increase their value. Subject to minimal and incidental lending to a third party (such as a bank deposit), none of the funds should be on-lent. • The entity, the interest expense, and project assets, and the income arising from the project assets must all arise or be incurred in New Zealand. Where the project assets are held in a permanent establishment, the exclusion applies only to the extent that the income arising from the project is subject to tax in New Zealand. 5.13 If a firm uses this exemption, any debt that does not qualify (such as shareholder loans) would not be deductible. The third-party debt of the firm is a reasonable measure of a commercial level of debt. As such, it does not seem appropriate to allow the firm to claim deductions on any additional debt, since one of the objectives of the thin capitalisation rules is to ensure firms can claim interest deductions on no more than a commercial amount. 5.14 Indeed, since these projects tend to have high levels of third-party debt, allowing additional shareholder debt would mean that shareholders could invest in the firm almost entirely through debt. Say, for example, total allowable debt is 110 per cent of the firm’s third-party debt. In this case, if a project was funded with 90 per cent third-party debt, its shareholders could make 90 per cent of their investment by way of debt without facing interest denial (and only 10 per cent through equity). 5.15 This exemption will apply only to entities controlled by a single non- resident. A similar exemption already applies (in effect) where an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents. 5.16 We are interested in submissions on this proposal, such as whether the restrictions above, taken from the OECD’s report on interest limitation rules, are reasonable. 5.17 We note that one of the restrictions is that the infrastructure project has been established at the request of the Government or other public body. We are not aware of any projects that would qualify for this exemption other than those established at the request of the Government or other public body – however, we would consider removing the exemption if submitters provide private sector examples where this rule could otherwise apply. 27 Example 8 Infrastructure Co is building a road that will be worth $100m in New Zealand at the request of the Government. Infrastructure Co has borrowed $80m from Bank on non-recourse terms to fund the construction of the road. The remaining $20m of funding is from Infrastructure Co’s shareholders, who have advanced $15m of equity and $5m of debt. The loan from Bank Co is not owner-linked debt and is on non-recourse terms, so meets the relevant conditions of this exemption. Infrastructure Co and the road project also meets all the other required conditions. Infrastructure Co is able to exceed the 60 per cent safe harbour without facing interest denial in relation to its loan from Bank Co. However, the $5m of shareholder debt does not qualify for the exemption. All of the interest on the shareholder debt would not be deductible. Firms controlled by non-residents acting together: related-party debt 5.18 A firm controlled by a group of non-residents acting together is able to have total debt equal to 110 per cent of its third-party debt. 25 This means, in effect, shareholders of firms with high levels of third-party debt are able to invest in New Zealand predominately through debt. As illustrated in paragraph 5.14, a project funded with 90 per cent third-party debt could have nine per cent shareholder debt and only one per cent equit y wit hout breaching thin capitalisation limits. 5.19 Allowing this addit ional shareholder debt is inconsistent with the objective of ensuring firms can claim deductions only for a commercial level of debt, since the third-party debt of a firm is a reasonable measure of a commercial debt level. Proposal: restrict the use of related-party debt 5.20 We propose to amend the rules for firms controlled by a group of non- residents acting together. If such a firm exceeds the 60 per cent safe harbour, any owner-linked debt will be non-deductible. 5.21 This aligns with the proposal for infrastructure projects with third-party funding discussed above. 5.22 These rules for firms controlled by non-residents acting together have only just come into effect. Companies controlled by a group of non-residents may have recently restructured their borrowing to include some level of related- party debt, on the reasonable expectation that the newly introduced rules would remain unchanged for some time. 25 Strictly, 110 per cent of its debt that is not owner-linked debt. 28 5.23 As such, we propose that this rule apply only on a prospective basis. Financing arrangements entered into before the application date of the proposals in this document (the first income year after the enactment of the legislation) will not be subject to this rule. Asset valuations 5.24 In general, the thin capitalisation rules are based on the value of a company’s assets as reported in its financial statements. However, under sections FE 16(1)(b) and FE 16(1)(e), a company is able to use the net current value of the assets as an alternative to its financial statement values, or a combination of the financial statement values and net current values, provided that would be allowable under GAAP. 5.25 This valuation method was originally provided as it was considered that valuation methods for financial reporting purposes are likely to have been adopted for non-tax reasons. 26 However, while this may be the case, we consider that the valuation method chosen for financial reporting purposes will be the one that most fairly represents the value of a company’s assets. It therefore seems appropriate to require the resulting asset valuations to be adopted for thin capitalisation purposes. 5.26 Moreover, asset valuations reported in financial statements are subject to a reasonable level of scrutiny – they will be reviewed by auditors and its directors, as both may face repercussions if the values are found to have been materially misstated. This is not the case with asset valuations adopted solely for thin capitalisation purposes. Proposal: remove net current valuation method 5.27 We therefore propose to remove the net current valuation method from the list of available asset valuation methods. Measurement date for assets and liabilities 5.28 Taxpayers currently can choose one of three methods for valuing their assets and liabilities. Taxpayers can use: • their value on the last day of the taxpayer’s income year; • the average of their values at the end of each quarter of the income year; or • the average of their value at the end of every day in the income year. 26 Inland Revenue Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No. 11 (March 1996). 29 5.29 The first method, valuing assets and liabilities on the last day of the income year, is clearly the simplest approach. However, there is the potential for taxpayers to breach the thin capitalisation debt limits for up to one year without facing any interest denial. Provided a taxpayer repays a loan or converts it to equity on or before its balance date, they can have any amount of debt without facing interest denial. This is one of the problems with an asset based thin capitalisation rule identified by the OECD. 5.30 The thin capitalisation rules do feature a specific anti-abuse rule (section FE 11) that requires temporary changes in asset or liability values to be ignored. However, this section does not apply to one-off events, such as a company borrowing large amounts at the beginning of the year and repaying it all at the end. Proposal: Allowing only average valuation methods 5.31 We propose to remove the first asset valuation method, so that assets and liabilities can only be valued based on the average values at the end of every quarter or at the end of every day. This would ensure that the rules apply effectively to a loan that was entered into and repaid within a year. Remedial change: trusts and owner-linked debt 5.32 The 2014 changes to the thin capitalisation rules introduced section FE 18(3B), which sets out the meaning of owner-linked debt in the context of both companies and trusts settled by non-residents. 5.33 Paragraph (c) provides that, in order for a financial arrangement to be counted as owner-linked debt, the owner must have ownership interests in a member of the group of companies of five per cent or more. This rule is intended to reduce compliance costs. 5.34 This test makes sense when the New Zealand entity is a company. However, the current legislation does not specify how the rule should work in relation to trusts as settlements on a trust do not convey ownership interests in the trust or entities owned by the trust. Proposal 5.35 We propose amending section FE 18(3B) to ensure it operates clearly in relat ion to trusts. That is, in addition to the requirements of FE 18(3B)(a), (b) and (d), in order for a financial arrangement to be counted as owner- linked debt: • the owner must have a direct ownership interests in a member of the group of five per cent or more; or • the owner must have made five perccent or more (by value) of the settlements on the trust. 30 Application date for all proposals 5.36 If these proposals are implemented, we generally propose that they apply fro m the first income year beginning after enactment of the legislation. 5.37 We expect that most foreign-owned firms will not face interest denial because of these proposals. This is because most foreign-owned firms either have low levels of debt, use only third-party debt, or both. 5.38 That said, some firms will face denial unless the firms change their mix of debt and equity funding. We consider this delayed application should give companies sufficient time to rearrange their affairs, so do not propose any special transitional measures. 5.39 The exception to this approach is the grandparenting of existing arrangements for the firms owned by non-residents acting together discussed in this chapter. 31
Black hole and feasibility expenditure A Government discussion document Hon Steven Joyce Minister of Finance Hon Judith Collins Minister of Revenue First published in May 2017 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Black hole and feasibility expenditure: A Government discussion document. ISBN 978-0-478-42447-8 CONTENTS CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1 Background 1 Submissions 2 CHAPTER 2 Background 5 The “black hole” problem 6 CHAPTER 3 Applying IFRS accounting treatment 9 Defining feasibility expenditure 9 Expenditure on an abandoned asset 14 Application date 15 CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1.1 As a general principle, business expenditure whose economic value is expected to decline in value should either be immediately deductible, or, when it provides an enduring benefit, deductible over time if that benefit declines over time. When the tax system does not provide for that treatment, an economic distortion is created. 1.2 This document discusses and seeks submissions on the Government’s proposals for a new treatment of feasibility expenditure and other expenditure that results in an economic cost to a taxpayer, but for which neither immediate deductions nor depreciation deductions are available (“black hole” expenditure). 1.3 There are two main proposals. In broad terms, the first proposal is that for expenditure that meets a new definition of “feasibility expenditure”, businesses will be able to apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to determine whether the expenditure is immediately deductible, or must be capitalised. The objective is to ensure that the tax treatment of “feasibility expenditure” is clearer, and to ensure that no expenditure that meets that definition will receive black hole treatment. 1.4 In addit io n, the second proposal is to allow taxpayers a deduction for expenditure that would have been deducted over time if the expenditure had been successful, but is denied a deduction because the expenditure did not result in a successful asset. The Government believes this would resolve a lot of black hole tax treatment. Background 1.5 Expenditure that provides an enduring benefit is not immediately deductible because the capital limitation in the Income Tax Act 2007 denies a deduction. Some expenditure that is not deductible immediately will be deductible over time if it forms part of the cost of depreciable property, or another class of asset whose expenditure can be spread over the asset’s expected life (for example, farm improvements). 1.6 Some expenditure will never be deductible, because it is not expected to result in an economic loss. 1.7 Feasibility expenditure is expenditure that is undertaken to determine the practicability of a new proposal. In some cases, the capital limitation will deny an immediate deduction. Because of the early-stage (and thus uncertain) nature of feasibility expenditure, determining whether the capital limitation applies can be difficult. 1 1.8 Inland Revenue has provided guidance on how to apply the legal test in its Interpretation statement 17/01. 1 This was issued after the Supreme Court’s decision in Trustpower Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 2 (the Trustpower decision), and replaced an earlier interpretation statement on feasibility expenditure. The earlier interpretation statement allowed a relatively wide variety of costs to be deducted immediately. The implication of the Trustpower decisio n is that less expenditure is immediately deductible, and it must be capitalised instead. 1.9 Requiring more of this expenditure to be capitalised increases the risk that it will ultimately become black hole expenditure. The Government considers that this economic distortion is damaging to the economy, as it is an impediment to productivity growth. 1.10 Feasibility expenditure will, perhaps more frequently than other classes of expenditure, be expected to occasionally result in black hole expenditure. This is because the expenditure may prove that a project is not viable. 1.11 In some cases where feasibility expenditure results in a project not going ahead, the expenditure does not result in a depreciable asset, whereby the feasibility expenditure is deductible over time through depreciation deductions. Instead, the expenditure in those cases can be said to have fallen into a black hole. The Government has already resolved many types of black hole expenditure under an incremental approach over the last few years (for example, software projects). 1.12 By addressing the complexity of the current state of the law, and by removing the black hole distortion, the proposals in this discussion document aim to improve economic efficiency, minimise distortion, reduce compliance and administration costs, and simplify the law where possible. The proposals are expected to result in a wider range of costs being deductible for tax purposes, to improve productivity and to remove a tax impediment to growth.

Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 3 4 CHAPTER 2 Background 2.1 “Feasibility expenditure” is not a defined term in tax legislation, nor is it a term of art. 2.2 Inland Revenue’s revised interpretation statement on feasibility expenditure (Interpretation Statement 17/01: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure) describes the term as “generally used to describe expenditure incurred by a taxpayer for determining the practicability of a new proposal”. This discussion document proceeds on the basis of that description. 2.3 The Supreme Court considered the deductibility of this type of expenditure in Trustpower Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 3 The legal test in the Trustpower decision is more restrictive than Inland Revenue’s original Interpretation Statement 08/02. 4 The revised interpretation statement reflects the Trustpower decisio n. 2.4 The original interpretation statement allowed a relatively wide scope for “preliminary” expenditure to be immediately deductible where there was no definitive commitment to proceeding wit h a project. The revised interpretation statement has moved away from that formulation, and interprets the test in the Trustpower decision as providing that expenditure may be deductible where it is of a type incurred on a recurrent basis as a normal incident of the taxpayer’s business, and is so preliminary as not to be directed towards materially advancing a specific project (or capital asset or enduring benefit). That is in contrast with expenditure that is aimed at making tangible progress on a capital project, to which the capital limitat ion would apply. 5 2.5 The Trustpower decision and the revised interpretation statement allow less expenditure to be immediately deductible for tax purposes than previously. This is because material advancement or tangible progress is likely to occur earlier than the prior interpretation of “definitive commitment”. 2.6 Depending on whether the project is implemented or abandoned, the expenditure may also not receive depreciation deductions over time. Non- deductibility of capitalised costs will be appropriate provided the expenditure created (or was intended to create) an asset that was not expected to decline in value. 2.7 But where taxpayers would have received depreciation deductions had the project gone ahead (because the asset was expected to decline in value), but 3 The case itself was about resource consent costs, which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue maintained were not immediately deductible. The Supreme Court agreed with that interpretation, but made comments on other feasibility expenditure that are inconsistent with Inland Revenue’s previous position. 4 “Interpretation statement 08/02: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure”, Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 20, No 6 (July 2008). 5 The revised interpretation statement has an extensive treatment of this complex area of law and represents the Commissioner’s legal interpretation. The revised interpretation statement is available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/5/9/59a7819f-ec1b-4db2-a54b-3ee1caff2e00/IS+1701.pdf 5 did not because the project was abandoned before it met the definition of depreciable property, this expenditure is referred to as “black hole” expenditure. 2.8 The tax treatment of black hole expenditure is a policy concern that undermines economic efficiency, as explained in the next section. The Government has already resolved many types of black hole expenditure under its incremental approach over the last few years. That includes expenditure on:  research and development;  resource consents;  software projects;  patents; and  plant variet y rights. 2.9 This area of law is relatively complicated, and the Government believes that compliance and administration costs could be reduced by simplifying it. The proposals discussed here address the black hole problem and aim to simplify the law by following accounting treatment where a taxpayer has “feasibility expenditure”. The “black hole” problem 2.10 Black hole expenditure is business expenditure that is expected to result in an economic cost to a taxpayer, but is neither immediately deductible for tax purposes, nor deductible over time. It is not deductible over time because it does not form part of the cost of depreciable property for tax purposes. 2.11 Capital expenditure on assets that are not expected to decline in value (for example, land) is not black ho le expenditure, despite the fact that it is not deductible immediately or over time. This is because the taxpayer does not expect to experience an economic loss when it purchases an asset that does not decline in value. 2.12 While assets that are not expected to decline in value sometimes do, it would only be appropriate to provide deductions for this expenditure if we taxed gains in asset values if they appreciated. Further, the tax system is economically neutral when it denies deductions for unexpected capital losses, provided that it also leaves untaxed unexpected capital gains, as New Zealand’s tax system does. 2.13 For a project that potentially involves black hole expenditure, the economic result is that the expected pre-tax rate of return of an investment that may result in some black hole expenditure must be higher than the expected pre- tax rate of return for a project that does not include such expenditure. Another way it can reduce economic efficiency is that businesses may be incentivised to complete projects that do not make economic sense, to avoid black hole treatment for sunk capital expenditure (as after completion, a 6 depreciable asset will have been created). In either situation, the tax system has introduced an investment distortion that lowers economic efficiency. 2.14 In the context of feasibility expenditure, there will be black hole expenditure where there is feasibility expenditure at or beyond the “material advancement” or “tangible progress” stage (see the revised interpretation statement), if the project is subsequently abandoned, and if the feasibilit y expenditure was directed at a project or asset that was expected to decline in value. If expenditure was before that stage, it may be immediately deductible. If the project was completed and the expenditure capitalised to the asset, there would be depreciation deductions provided that the asset was depreciable property that was expected to decline in value. 2.15 The following diagrams illustrate, in a simplified project timeline, when black hole expenditure arises in the context of feasibility expenditure under the older “commitment” test, and the newer formulation that refers to “material advancement” or “tangible progress”. The length of time during which expenditure is subject to black ho le risk is greater under the “material advancement” or “tangible progress” formulation.

It is expected that more feasibility expenditure would be immediately deductible than currently, including any capitalised feasibility expenditure on a capital asset that is abandoned (and thus impaired for accounting purposes). 3.2 The Government also proposes that all previously capitalised expenditure (not just feasibility expenditure) that would ultimately be part of the cost of depreciable property (excluding buildings), 6 is immediately deductible where that depreciable property is not created because the project is abandoned. 3.3 Where expenditure that meets a new legislative definition of “feasibility expenditure” is immediately expensed in general purpose financial statements (that is, under IFRS no asset is created on the balance sheet), it would be immediately deductible for income tax purposes. Where the feasibility expenditure is capitalised under IFRS (that is, an asset is created), the feasibility expenditure would be capital expenditure for tax purposes. As will be discussed below, expenditure that would form part of the cost of an item of depreciable property would be excluded from the definition of “feasibility expenditure”. 3.4 If expenditure that would be “feasibility expenditure” but for the fact that it would form part of the cost of an item of depreciable property were capitalised to any asset, that expenditure would be immediately deductible if the asset was later abandoned before completion, as part of more general relief for this sort of black hole expenditure. Defining feasibility expenditure 3.5 A necessary condition of this proposal is that we are able to adequately circumscribe what expenditure receives this treatment. We propose to do that by introducing a definition of “feasibility expenditure”. 3.6 “Feasibility expenditure” has no current tax definition, and is not defined under accounting standards. Creating an appropriate definition is the most challenging aspect of this proposal. 3.7 If “feasibility expenditure” is defined too widely, the risk is that any amendments encroach on well-settled and economically efficient existing capital/revenue tax law. If that were the case, the amendments would introduce new complexity, and potentially introduce economic distortions with no offsetting compliance or administration gains. 6 Buildings are “depreciable property” but depreciation deductions are set at 0% under the Income Tax Act 2007. 9 3.8 A common understanding of feasibility expenditure is “expenditure incurred by a taxpayer for determining the practicability of a new proposal” (the working definition in Inland Revenue’s revised interpretation statement). Without further restriction, this definition is not sufficiently certain from a legislative perspective. The Government suggests that the definition be further limited by restricting the expenditure to that incurred prior to a commitment to developing the proposal. In other words, the definitio n would in substance be: expenditure to determine the practicability of a proposal, prior to commitment to developing the proposal. Exclusions 3.9 As an additional restriction, the Government proposes that some expenditure would be explicitly excluded as deductible on the basis that our tax system already adequately deals with its deductibility. An Australian provision 7 that addresses black hole expenditure operates on this approach, by allowing a deduction (spread over five years) for capital expenditure not otherwise deductible, but excludes expenditure that forms part of the cost of a depreciating asset or part of the cost of land, amongst other exclusions. 3.10 The exclusions in a New Zealand provision would need to be more extensive than the Australian provision. This is because the Australian capital gains tax reduces the importance of the capital/revenue distinction. In the absence of such a tax in New Zealand, it is important to ensure that we do not introduce a distortion into the system that allows capital losses to be deductible, without taxing capital gains. 3.11 In principle, any expenditure on a capital project that does not depreciate should be excluded. However, in the case of feasibility expenditure it is likely that identifying whether any resulting “capital project” depreciates is impossible given the early stage at which this expenditure is often incurred, and the likelihood that the capital project is a combination of both depreciable and non-depreciable assets. As a result, we do not propose distinguishing on this basis. 3.12 The exclusions the Government proposes are:  Expenditure that would form part of the cost of depreciable property, if the proposal is successful. (See below for an explanation of why this would later be deductible on abandonment).  Expenditure for which any black hole treatment has already been remedied under the Income Tax Act 2007. This would include any expenditure incurred: – for the purpose of applying for the grant of a resource consent (section DB 19); – on research or development (section DB 34); – for the purpose of applying for the grant of a patent or of a design registration (section DB 37); 7 Section 40-880 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. 10 – in devising an invention for which a patent has been granted (section DB 38); – for the purpose of applying for the grant of plant variety rights (section DB 40BA); or – in the development of software for use in the person’s business (section DB 40B). 3.13 The list above is not intended to imply that the expenditure would necessarily meet the definition of feasibility expenditure but for the explicit inclusion, but it is possible that some of it would. Submission point  How could “feasibility expenditure” best be defined in legislation, taking into account the risk of including too much expenditure in such a definition? IFRS treatment 3.14 As IFRS treatment is central to the proposals, it is necessary to understand the relevant principles. As a basis for discussion, this section quotes some o f the standards. 3.15 Under IFRS, an asset must be recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity. Under NZ IAS 16.7: The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be recognised as an asset if, and only if: a) It is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item flow to the entity; and b) The cost of the item can be measured reliably. 3.16 Therefore, under the proposal, if an asset is not recognised in the balance sheet, an immediate deduction would be allowed for the feasibility expenditure. In the context of feasibility expenditure, this might include expenditure on, for example, investigating new inventory management systems, or new business processes to reduce costs. 3.17 For feasibility expenditure that has been capitalised for accounting (and thus for tax), a deduction would still be available in the event that the asset is impaired, provided that the project is abandoned. This might occur in a situation where a business has feasibility expenditure that provides probable future economic benefits, and that expenditure is capitalised to an asset that is being created. If circumstances change and it is found that the asset is not worth completing (for example), under IFRS the asset would be impaired. 11 3.18 NZIAS 36.8 states: An asset is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Paragraphs 12–14 describe some indications that an impairment loss may have occurred. If any of those indications is present, an entity is required to make a formal estimate of recoverable amount. Except as described in paragraph 10, this Standard does not require an entity to make a formal estimate of recoverable amount if no indication of an impairment loss is present. 3.19 NZIAS 36.12 states: In assessing whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, an entity shall consider, as a minimum, the following indications: External sources of information (a) during the period, an asset’s market value has declined significantly more than would be expected as a result of the passage of time or normal use. (b) significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity have taken place during the period, or will take place in the near future, in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the entity operates or in the market to which an asset is dedicated. (c) market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have increased during the period, and those increases are likely to affect the discount rate used in calculating an asset’s value in use and decrease the asset’s recoverable amount materially. (d) the carrying amount of the net assets of the entity is more than its market capitalisation. Internal sources of information (e) evidence is available of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset. (f) significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity have taken place during the period, or are expected to take place in the near future, in the extent to which, or manner in which, an asset is used or is expected to be used. These changes include the asset becoming idle, plans to discontinue or restructure the operation to which an asset belongs, plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date, and reassessing the useful life of an asset as finite rather than indefinite. (g) evidence is available from internal reporting that indicates that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected. 3.20 It is envisaged that where a taxpayer has abandoned a project, NZ IAS 36.12.f would provide an indication that the asset is impaired. In those circumstances, the taxpayer would be allowed a deduction for the previously capitalised feasibility expenditure that is impaired due to NZ IAS 36.8. There is a question of how much feasibility expenditure will fall into this category given that the definition excludes expenditure that would form part of the cost of depreciable property. However, it would include feasibility expenditure related to non-depreciable assets. 3.21 The deduction would be available in the tax year during which the amount was recognised as an expense under IFRS accounting standards. It would only be available in situations of total impairment loss. 12 Non-IFRS taxpayers 3.22 IFRS is used by larger companies. If a taxpayer does not apply IFRS accounting standards, they will still be allowed a deduction if the IFRS standards would be met, had they been applied. 3.23 As an example, assume a non-IFRS taxpayer has previously capitalised some feasibility expenditure. In a later income year, they abandon the project that called for the feasibility expenditure. The taxpayer would be allowed a deduction only where, had they been applying IFRS, they would have had a total impairment loss. Note that unlike for taxpayers who use IFRS, there would be no requirement that the asset is actually impaired under the taxpayer’s accounting system. 3.24 The deduction would be available in the tax year during which the amount would have been recognised as an expense under IFRS accounting standards. De minimis 3.25 Under a de minimis rule, expenditure could perhaps be deductible provided that expenditure:  meets the general permission;  is wit hin the definit io n of “feasibility expenditure”; and  is below a particular de minimis threshold. 3.26 Non-IFRS-taxpayers would need only to assess whether expenditure provided “probable future benefits” (NZ IAS 16.7) to determine whether the expenditure should be capitalised or expensed at the early stage. The criteria for impairment in this situation are cited in NZ IAS 36.12. In these circumstances, a de minimis to save compliance costs may not be necessary. 3.27 If a de minimis applied, the only requirements in that situation would be that the general permission was met, and the expenditure met the definition o f “feasibility expenditure”, and was below the de minimis threshold. 3.28 The de minimis threshold for legal and research and development expenditure in sections DB 62 and DB 34 respectively is $10,000. If a de minimis threshold is required for this proposal, matching it with the threshold in sections DB 62 and DB 34 may be appropriate. Submission points  Is it appropriate to require non-IFRS taxpayers to be familiar with IFRS for the purposes of deductions for black hole expenditure?  Should a de minimis apply? At what level of expenditure? 13 Expenditure on an abandoned asset 3.29 A deduction would be allowed when a person incurred expenditure that would form part of the cost of an item of depreciable property if:  the item would have been depreciable property if it had been completed;  the item is abandoned before it is available for use; and  the person recognises the expenditure as a loss under NZ IAS 36.8, which governs impairment of assets, or the person had not previously recognised the expenditure as the cost of an asset under NZ IAS 16.7. 3.30 For current purposes, provided that there is expenditure that would have formed part of the cost of an item of depreciable property, a deduction will be available in two cases. The first is if there is an impairment loss recognised due to NZ IAS 36.8 and the item is abandoned before it is available for use. The second is when the expenditure was never previously capitalised under IFRS, but it would have formed part of the cost of depreciable property (and so was excluded from the definition of “feasibility expenditure”). 3.31 This means that expenditure that would otherwise be “feasibility expenditure” but for the fact that it would form part of the cost of an item of depreciable property will be deductible if the asset is later abandoned. But the proposal is wider, in that any expenditure would be deductible if it would have formed part of the cost of an item of depreciable property that is abandoned before it is available for use, provided the expenditure is not capitalised under IFRS. 3.32 The deduction would be available in the tax year during which the amount was recognised as a loss under NZ IAS 36.8. 3.33 The amount of the deduction would be for the full amount of the expenditure, with the proviso that the expenditure was not allowed a deduction under any other section of the Income Tax Act 2007. All expenditure on depreciable property covered 3.34 This proposal would cover any feasibility expenditure that would form part of the cost of an item of depreciable property, but would also cover a wide variety of other costs that are capitalised to an asset that is abandoned. An example of this would be a partially-built boat that is abandoned before it is available for use. Under this proposal, the construction costs of the boat would be immediately deductible, instead of being neither deductible immediately nor over time. 14 Submission point  Is the accounting treatment sufficiently clear that a taxpayer would be able to apply the proposal above in a wide variety of circumstances? Clawback 3.35 If a taxpayer subsequently reverses its decision to impair the asset, the taxpayer would have to return as income any amount previously deducted under the proposal. Non-IFRS taxpayers 3.36 As with the first proposal, if a taxpayer does not apply IFRS accounting standards, they will still be allowed a deduction if the IFRS standards would be met, had they been applied. 3.37 As an example, assume a non-IFRS taxpayer has expenditure incurred in constructing a boat. In a later income year, they abandon the boat before it is available for use. The taxpayer would be allowed a deduction only where, had they been applying IFRS, they would have had a total impairment loss of the capitalised expenditure. Note that the requirement that the item is abandoned before it is available for use would st ill remain. Application date 3.38 There are a number of possible dates for application for the main proposals. Some taxpayers have expressed the view that any change should apply from the date of the Trustpower decisio n. Submission point  Is there any particular reason why any change to the law should not be prospective (that is, applying from the date of enactment)? 15

This includes re-shaping the way Inland Revenue works with taxpayers, and looking at possible changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994. This document discusses how to improve the administration of income tax for individuals, particularly those who only earn salary or wages and/ or investment income that has been subject to withholding tax at source. The Government released a consultation paper called Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on tax administration (the Green Paper) in March 2015. This set out its ideas for modernising New Zealand’s tax administration. The ideas presented July 2016 April 2016 December 2016 June 2017 Investment income information Better business tax Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act Better administration of Individuals' income tax Nov 2015 Better administration of Social Policy Nov 2015 Towards a new Tax Administration Act Better digital services Green paper on tax administration March 2015March 2015 The consultation time-line for the Making Tax Simpler series Better administration of PAYE and GST CHAPTER 1 OVERVIEW 5 in the Green Paper were in the early stages of development, and each area canvassed in that document would be consulted on separately. In relation to individuals’ filing obligations, the initial option outlined for consultation in the Green Paper was for all individuals to interact with Inland Revenue. Having considered the submissions received on the Green Paper and carrying out further work, the Government is not proposing that all individuals should have an obligation to interact with Inland Revenue on an end-of-year basis (i.e. have to provide an income tax return). The Better Administration of PAYE and GST and the Investment Income Information discussion documents contained proposals to require income payers to provide more information, more often to Inland Revenue about who they paid. These documents were released for consultation in November 2015 and July 2016 respectively. Changes to legislation as a result of the proposals in both those documents are contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which is currently before Parliament. This document contains proposals about how Inland Revenue should utilise information during the year to ensure that the right amount of tax is being withheld, and how end- of-year reporting obligations could be simplified for individuals that earn certain types of income. This consultation focuses on how the Government can make tax obligations more simple, open and certain for individuals. This document discusses some proposed changes and, if they go ahead, proposals for how Inland Revenue could work with individuals to ensure the right amount of tax is paid, and that individuals receive the correct entitlements. WHAT THIS DOCUMENT COVERS Chapter 2 outlines the framework for how individuals’ income is taxed in New Zealand and recaps the proposal that was in the Green Paper. Chapter 3 discusses proposals for what could occur during the tax year. Chapter 4 sets out two options about which individuals should have to provide information to Inland Revenue at the end of a tax year. The first is an improvement on the status quo and the second would further simplify the rules. Chapter 5 contains proposals for what could occur at the end of the tax year, and is relevant to both the options in chapter 4. Chapter 6 then discusses what happens if an error is discovered after the end of the tax year. The chapters describe Inland Revenue’s actions, as well as proposing which individuals would be required to provide information to Inland Revenue about their tax position. Some of the things described in this discussion document happen already. They are set out here alongside the proposals to give a fuller picture of what the future would look like if the proposals are adopted. This document contains proposals about how Inland Revenue should utilise information during the year to ensure that the right amount of tax is being withheld. ...two options as to which individuals should have to provide information to Inland Revenue at the end of a tax year. The first is an improvement on the status quo, and the second would further simplify the rules. ...the Government is not proposing that all individuals should have an obligation to interact with Inland Revenue on an end-of-year basis (i.e. have to provide an income tax return). 6 SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS During the year – chapter 3 • Inland Revenue will monitor the information it receives to help individuals get their tax payments right, and contact them to suggest changes. • Inland Revenue will make information held about an individual available to that individual during the year. • Individuals will be able to upload copies of donation receipts to myIR during the year. At the end of the year – chapter 4 • The discussion document sets out two options about which individuals should have to provide information to Inland Revenue at the end of a tax year. Improved status quo • With better, timelier third-party information, Inland Revenue will better target the issue of personal tax summaries. Alternative approach • Individuals would have to provide information to Inland Revenue if they earn income other than reportable income, as they do now. Inland Revenue would use information from previous years to prompt individuals to add information in future years. • Individuals would not have to provide any information to Inland Revenue if they only earn “reportable income”: ĔThis is currently PAYE income. ĔChanges to legislation in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017– 18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill in relation to investment income information will add interest income, and New Zealand-sourced dividends and Māori authority distributions from 1 April 2018 and 1 April 2020 respectively. • On the basis of information it holds about reportable income, Inland Revenue would calculate whether people are due a refund or have tax to pay. • If refunds or amounts of tax to pay are above specified thresholds, Inland Revenue would issue the refund or request payment. If the amounts are smaller than these thresholds Inland Revenue will not take any action. ĔThe document asks if the current $5 threshold for refunds should be retained for refunds by cheque, or if all refunds should be issued, no matter how small. ĔThe document notes the current $20 threshold for small amounts to pay and also the current threshold for not having to file ($200 of income, 7 which can be up to $66 of tax). It asks what factors the Government should take into account in setting a specified threshold for amounts of tax to pay. At the end of the year – chapter 5 • Individuals would be able to provide details about donations they would like to claim at the same time as they check or provide information about their income. • This document proposes that income tax refunds should be direct credited, rather than issued by cheque unless that would cause undue hardship. After the end of the year – chapter 6 • Individuals can ask Inland Revenue to change a return if they believe it does not correctly reflect their tax position. NEXT STEPS Following consideration of the submissions received about the proposals in this discussion document, the Government will refine the proposals and consider what items to proceed with. It will also consider when it would be best to implement any changes. These proposals would require changes to legislation and an amending bill is likely to be introduced to Parliament and considered in 2018. There will be further opportunity to comment on the legislative changes as part of the Parliamentary process.

It also outlines the ideas proposed in the Green Paper about improving tax administration for individuals and the feedback received. Finally, it sets out the opportunities for modernising and simplifying tax administration for individuals to achieve the following outcomes: • A tax system that is fair and supports high levels of compliance. • Payment requirements that are easy to get right and difficult to get wrong. • Compliance obligations that are quick and low effort for individuals. • Processes that are more certain and provide confidence that the right thing has been done. • A tax administration that costs less to administer and that lowers overall compliance costs. FRAMEWORK FOR TAXING INDIVIDUALS’ INCOME Income tax is charged on a person’s annual taxable income. Generally, a person’s taxable income is the sum of the gross income received, minus any deductions for expenditure or losses to the extent to which they are incurred in deriving that income, or incurred in carrying on a business. Income tax is calculated on the person’s total taxable income for the year at the applicable tax rates.¹ There are two basic approaches used to administer income tax: • Payers of certain types of income, such as salary or wages, are required to withhold tax from the income they pay to individuals, remit the tax withheld, and report the income and tax information to Inland Revenue (a withholding tax system). • Individuals are required to report the taxable income they have earned to Inland Revenue, calculate any tax payable and pay ¹Certain types of income are treated as schedular income and taxed in their own right. These are not included in a person’s total taxable income, such as certain kinds of non-resident passive income. There are two basic approaches used to administer income tax: • Payers of certain types of income, such as salary or wages, are required to withhold tax from the income they pay to individuals, remit the tax withheld and report the income and tax information to Inland Revenue (a withholding tax system). • Individuals are required to report the taxable income they have earned to Inland Revenue, calculate any tax payable and pay the tax due either during the tax period or after the end of the tax period (a tax period disclosure system). CHAPTER 2 FRAMEWORK AND OPPORTUNITY FOR CHANGE 9 the tax due either during the tax period or after the end of the tax period (a tax-period disclosure system). These two approaches are supplemented with additional third- party reporting to increase overall compliance. Regardless of which approach is used, the underlying requirement to comply with income tax obligations ultimately lies with, and will continue to lie with, the individual. This is because they fully understand what income they have earned and expenses they have incurred. In other words, income tax will continue to be based on a self- assessment model. The Government intends to continue using these two approaches to administer income tax. Depending on the sources of their income, a person may be covered by one of these approaches or both. The Government will look to increase the use of withholding tax systems where appropriate in order to reduce compliance costs on individuals and ensure tax is paid accurately during the year. The Government recently extended the schedular payments withholding tax system to labour hire firms.2 Inland Revenue will continue to supplement these approaches with third party reporting under existing rules. The Government is also considering a more transparent framework for large third-party dataset collection, where the dataset is to be collected regularly, as discussed in Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for Modernising the Tax Administration Act.3 The Government recognises that withholding tax systems impose compliance costs on the payers of income subject to these rules. However, such systems reduce compliance costs for the recipients of the income, reduce administrative costs and increase overall compliance. These benefits usually outweigh the compliance costs imposed on payers. The key is getting the balance right. Withholding tax systems are generally considered to be the foundation of an effective tax administration for the reasons outlined above. They ensure that an appropriate amount of tax is withheld from the income earned and are most efficient in getting it about right if the gross income and taxable income are the same. That is, if the recipient of the income has not incurred any deductible expenditure or losses in earning that income. One important caveat to the general ability to claim deductions is that employees cannot deduct costs incurred in deriving income from employment. The Government has no intention to change that policy setting. Individuals can claim for income protection insurance, and the costs associated with preparing an income tax return. Tax credits can also be claimed for qualifying donations made to donee organisations by individuals if they earned taxable income in the period they are claiming for. For individuals who only earn income that has tax withheld from it and paid to Inland Revenue, the amount of tax paid during the year is generally close ... income tax will continue to be based on a self-assessment model. 2Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 3Released for public consultation on 8 December 2016. 10 to being right. However, withholding tax systems do not ensure perfect accuracy as they are still based on expected income. Any difference between the income that was actually earned, compared with what was anticipated, will mean that the withheld amount will vary from the ultimate tax liability. This can occur when there are multiple sources of income and/or when tax on income is not withheld or withheld at a rate that is too high or low. For example, when someone receives a bonus or promotion, or takes leave without pay, the withholding rate can be incorrect. A key component of a withholding tax system is the reporting of the underlying income information and tax withheld. The more frequently this information is received, the greater the ability for Inland Revenue to monitor whether tax is being withheld at the appropriate rate and, if not, to take corrective action. This will ensure that the right amount, or close to the right amount, of tax is withheld during the year and reduce the number of individuals who should need to file income tax returns at the end of the year. IMPLICATION FOR INCOME TAX RETURNS This framework allows for the income tax system to be administered as follows: • An individual who earns income that is not subject to withholding (such as business income or foreign income) is required to report the taxable income earned to Inland Revenue, calculate the tax payable and pay the tax due either during or after the tax period. • An individual who earns income subject to withholding as well as income not subject to withholding is required to report all the income earned to Inland Revenue, calculate the tax payable and pay the tax due either during or after the tax period. Income information Inland Revenue holds is provided to the individual to assist them in meeting their tax obligations. • For an individual who earns only income subject to withholding, the Government can either: Ĕrequire the individual to report (or confirm) the taxable income earned to Inland Revenue, which would then result in a tax refund or further tax to pay; or Ĕtreat the amount withheld as the final tax liability for the year, which means the individual’s tax obligations will be totally managed via the withholding tax system. The proposals in this discussion document primarily focus on the end-of-year obligations for individuals who earn only income that is subject to withholding. It is recognised that an individual may move between these categories over their lifetime as their income sources change. The proposals in this discussion document primarily focus on the end- of-year obligations for individuals who earn only income that is subject to withholding. A key component of a withholding tax system is the reporting of the underlying income information and tax withheld. The more frequently this information is received, the greater the ability for Inland Revenue to monitor whether tax is being withheld at the appropriate rate and, if not, to take corrective action. This will ensure that the right amount, or close to the right amount, of tax is withheld during the year and reduce the number of individuals who should need to file income tax returns at the end of the year. 11 As noted in chapter 1, the Government is not proposing that all individuals should have to provide information to Inland Revenue on an annual basis in a process similar to the current obligations on individuals who are required to file income tax returns. Throughout this document that is referred to as “providing information to Inland Revenue”. OTHER APPROACHES USED TO REDUCE END-OF-YEAR FILING OBLIGATIONS Cumulative withholding New Zealand requires withholders to deduct tax according to tax codes that are based on an individual’s expected annual income, and requires individuals to undertake an annual process to ‘square up’ their tax position each year if necessary. Some countries use a cumulative model of withholding tax instead. A cumulative model means the withholding tax rates are adjusted throughout the year. Such a system endeavours to attain accuracy of tax withheld throughout the year. The rationale behind a cumulative system is that if the correct amount of tax is deducted during the year, the total amount of tax collected will equal the individual’s overall liability. This theoretically eliminates the need for most employees to file a tax return. Under the cumulative withholding system, an individual’s tax liability is not calculated on the payment they receive for a period in isolation. Instead, the actual amount of tax deducted in a pay period depends on the income already received in the tax year, as well as the income received in the current period. The tax, which must be deducted in each pay period, is the cumulative tax due from the beginning of the year to that date, reduced by the amount of tax already deducted in other pay periods. Consequently, this type of system can be complex for those who are required to withhold the tax, such as employers. The cumulative model does not always achieve the accuracy it is designed to achieve. When an individual works more than one job, it is complex to administer as each withholder needs to understand the total amount of tax already deducted. This document does not propose changing to a cumulative withholding model in New Zealand. "Full and final" taxation in a period A discussion document called Making tax easier was released for public consultation in June 2010. One item which was considered in that document was an option to treat PAYE as a “final tax”, so the amount of tax actually deducted from PAYE would be treated as the individual’s final tax liability (even if it was over-or under- deducted). Inland Revenue would not collect some amounts of tax to pay, and would not pay out some refunds. This option was not supported by submitters and was not pursued. This document does not propose changing to a final tax approach. 12 BACKGROUND – GREEN PAPER AND FEEDBACK The Green Paper outlined an initial option for consultation that could require all individuals to interact at some level with Inland Revenue, albeit in a much easier way than currently.⁴ It suggested an electronic filing system pre-populated by information from timely and accurate withholding systems. The majority of individuals would then only be required to check and confirm the information held by Inland Revenue and include any income that had not been pre- populated. One of the premises underpinning this option was that it would allow individuals to understand their own tax obligations and how the wider tax system works, which would support compliance over time. The current filing obligations for individuals vary, based on historical and sometimes arbitrary distinctions. This results in some individuals being unaware of their filing obligations. As discussed in the Green Paper, the key to modernising and simplifying tax administration is the use of digital services and channels, the pre-population of information held by Inland Revenue and the use of analytics to achieve the above outcomes. Feedback about the initial option to require all individuals to interact with Inland Revenue via pre-populated digital tax statements was divided.⁵ Some submitters were concerned about whether people without easy access to internet or who were not proficient technologically could effectively manage this interaction. Others saw any increase in interaction with Inland Revenue as undesirable. A few also queried Inland Revenue’s ability to pre-populate information such as donations. Other saw the proposals as positive, particularly those who currently file returns, believing it would make the return filing process easier. Finally, some submitters also noted that some interaction with Inland Revenue might encourage people to better understand their tax circumstances and obligations. The following chapters discuss approaches and options to make tax obligations more simple, open and certain for individuals. The chapters outline what interactions could happen during the tax year to assist with getting the withholding more accurate and what interactions could occur at year-end. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CHANGE As noted earlier, the Government has recently introduced legislation into Parliament that once passed, will give effect to the proposals outlined in the Better administration of PAYE and GST and the Investment Income Information discussion documents. These proposals will require income payers to provide more information more often about the individuals to whom they pay income. This better and timelier information allows the Government to re-think tax administration for individuals, particularly those who only receive ...better and timelier information allows the Government to re-think tax administration for individuals, particularly those who only receive employment and/or investment income. ⁴See Appendix 5 page 61 to 63 and in particular paragraphs 5.15 to 5.20 of the Green Paper. ⁵See Making Tax Simpler - Green Paper & Better Digital Services: Summary of Feedback and in particular, pages 22 to 24. 13 employment and/or investment income. Furthermore, the current tax rules for individuals who earn most of their income from employment and/or investment sources that are subject to tax at source are complex to understand and administer.⁶ For example, based on the information it holds, Inland Revenue will issue personal tax summaries to some people at year-end. If a personal tax summary is not issued, individuals need to determine whether they need to request a personal tax summary. If they do not need to, they may still do so in order to receive any tax refund they are entitled to. This better and timelier information allows the Government to re- think whether the current rules for the administration of income tax for individuals can be improved to simplify the rules and reduce compliance and administration costs. This can be achieved by re-thinking how Inland Revenue can: • deliver better in-year services to assist individuals in ensuring they are using the correct tax code, or a tax code (such as a special tax code) that will meet the needs of their circumstances; and • simplify the end-of-year obligations by reducing the complexity of the current rules for people who only earn employment income and/or investment income that is subject to withholding at source. ⁶Section 33AA of the Tax Administration Act allows a person to earn up to $200 of income that is not subject to withholding tax and still not be required to request a personal tax summary. 14 A large number of individuals do not need to do anything once they have provided the correct tax code to their employer or bank (and this will continue). In earlier Making Tax Simpler consultation documents, the Government proposed that more complete information from third parties should be provided to Inland Revenue throughout the year. Inland Revenue will check information when it is received and fix errors whenever possible, which will mean fewer over or under-payments for individuals during the year. This information will be displayed in digital accounts. Increasingly, individuals will not have to do anything at the end of the year as more information is passed to Inland Revenue on their behalf. As the quality and frequency of information available to Inland Revenue improves, payments made by and to individuals during the year will be more accurate. In turn, this will reduce the number of individuals who have large refunds or tax to pay at the end of the year. INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUALS IS PROVIDED TO INLAND REVENUE BY OTHERS Inland Revenue receives a range of information about individuals from other people and/or organisations who are required to report it. A lot of this information is provided under specific information reporting requirements set out in tax legislation. Inland Revenue also receives other information, for example, about income, entitlements, relationships and transactions on an as-required or one-off basis. Payers of some types of income are required to inform Inland Revenue about the income paid, the tax withheld and the recipient. In some cases this information is reported to Inland Revenue during the year, and in other cases it is required after the end of the year. Not all types of income carry the requirement for the payer to report the amount and the recipients to Inland Revenue. Reporting information about an individual imposes costs on the CHAPTER 3 DURING THE TA X YE AR 15 provider and this must be weighed against the benefit to Inland Revenue and the individual. Over time, the Government may require information about more types of income to be reported regularly, but that is not proposed in this discussion document. Inland Revenue does not generally receive information about income that does not have tax deducted from it as part of regular information reporting systems. This document does not propose to alter this position at this time. SOME INDIVIDUALS PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES TO INLAND REVENUE DURING THE YEAR Outside of the return filing process, under current settings some individuals are required to provide some information during the year. For example, if they are required to make provisional tax payments. When an individual starts a new job they must choose a tax code and their employer then withholds tax at a rate based on their expected annual income. It is currently the individual’s obligation to update Inland Revenue if a change in their circumstances means they should change to a different code. The onus is on the individual to be aware of circumstances that would require a change in code. Individuals can also claim tax credits for gifts of $5 or more made to donee organisations such as charities.⁷ These can currently be claimed by filling in a claim form and submitting this to Inland Revenue with receipts. Individuals can also claim for the cost of income protection insurance. Rather than waiting until the end of the year and posting copies of their donations receipts or their income protection insurance to Inland Revenue, the Government proposes that individuals would be able to scan or photograph and upload copies of their receipts directly into myIR either during the year or at the end of the year.⁸ This information would then be available to be used by Inland Revenue in determining an individual's tax position. WHAT INLAND REVENUE DOES WITH THE INFORMATION IT RECEIVES Receiving information, whether directly from individuals or from third parties, allows Inland Revenue to ensure that individuals pay the right amount of tax and receive the correct social policy payments. It also helps other government agencies to accurately assess a range of entitlements and can be used for statistical analysis by the Government and community. After the information is received, Inland Revenue: • checks its accuracy; • proposes adjustments to future withholding or past periods if necessary; • includes it in an individual’s account to: ⁷The amount of this credit is 33 1/3% of the total qualifying gifts made in the year, with the limitation that the total donations claimed for cannot be more than the person’s taxable income for the year. ⁸myIR is Inland Revenue’s web based digital service channel. Rather than waiting until the end of the year and posting copies of their donations receipts or their income protection insurance to Inland Revenue, the Government proposes that individuals would be able to scan or photograph and upload copies of their receipts directly into myIR either during the year or at the end of the year. 16 Ĕprovide a picture of their income position; Ĕassist them with any return filing obligation; Ĕprompt them to take any steps they need to; and • compares the information to other information it already holds about an individual. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill contains proposed changes about the frequency with which information about income must be provided to Inland Revenue. These changes relate to PAYE, interest income, New Zealand-sourced dividends and Māori authority distributions. Getting more detailed income information more frequently will enable Inland Revenue to help individuals get their tax and social policy payments right. Inland Revenue will be able to act sooner to correct mistakes during the year, which should reduce the number and size of year-end issues. Inland Revenue will also be able to provide a greater number of taxpayers with a complete and accurate picture of their income position at the end of the tax year. That is why the Government has proposed that more information be provided to Inland Revenue during the year. Inland Revenue will process the information and let the individuals or third parties know if any errors or omissions need to be fixed. Giving individuals visibility of their income and payments All the information Inland Revenue receives about an individual will be held in their tax account, which an individual can view through myIR. As information is received, it will be added to an individual's myIR account. This can save the individual time if they choose to or need to file a return at the end of the year, as information received before the person files would already be shown. Information received later cannot be used to help an individual complete a return, but can be used by Inland Revenue to check whether all the necessary information was provided by the individual in their return. As at 1 December 2016 there were almost two million customers with active myIR accounts. The myIR account will show income earned, obligations, entitlements, liabilities and personal details. Inland Revenue would progressively add information to the account as it is received. The individual and anyone else they have authorised to see it are the only ones who can access their myIR account. At any point in time a myIR account will give an individual a personalised and complete view of their income position and social policy entitlements that Inland Revenue has received information about. As at 1 December 2016 there were almost two million customers with active myIR accounts. At any point in time a myIR account will give an individual a personalised and complete view of their income position and social policy entitlements that Inland Revenue has received information about. 17 If an individual receives income that is not shown on their myIR account, this means that either it is not required to be reported to Inland Revenue by a third party, or it is required but has either not been reported or cannot be linked with the individual. If it was not able to be linked with the individual, it is likely the income is being taxed at the higher non-declaration rate. Income information will generally be shown as totals, however further details will also be available to be viewed. For example, total income for the year-to-date would be shown and an individual could view this by employer or time period if they wanted to. The individual would not be able to directly alter any income information in myIR during the year, but would be able to at the end of the year. Third parties can update Inland Revenue at any time about information they have provided, and as the displayed information is based on information received from third parties, any corrections the third party makes to that information will flow through the system and be updated in the appropriate myIR accounts. HOW INLAND REVENUE WILL HELP TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS GET THEIR TAX AND SOCIAL POLICY PAYMENTS RIGHT As Inland Revenue analyses information about an individual, it may become apparent that the individual is not using the best tax code for their personal circumstances. Inland Revenue will automatically calculate whether the tax that is being remitted by the withholder is likely to match their end-of-year tax liability. The nature of the withholding tax system (the use of tax codes based on expected annual income), means that mistakes made in selecting codes, or unexpected changes in income can lead to refunds or tax to pay at the end of the year. Actions that Inland Revenue can take to stop errors will mean fewer people end up with tax to pay or refunds at the end of the year, and therefore fewer people will need to interact with Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue monitors information provided by employers about income they have paid and tax they have withheld. When an individual is using the wrong tax code (such as using the main job "M" tax code for two jobs) Inland Revenue contacts the employer asking them to change the tax code. If the employer does not correct the tax code in their next monthly schedule, Inland Revenue follows up with them. Individuals are contacted by phone or in writing, advising them of the possible discrepancy and what action they can take to remedy the situation. At the same time Inland Revenue advises them what actions will be taken if there is no response to the correspondence. Inland Revenue can also identify situations when a systemic error seems to be occurring on the part of the withholder, for example, they are inadvertently using an outdated PAYE code table. Inland Revenue can intervene to ensure the information provider corrects this error. Actions that Inland Revenue can take to stop errors will mean fewer people end up with tax to pay or refunds at the end of the year, and therefore that fewer people will need to interact with Inland Revenue. 18 In some cases individuals use a withholding tax rate that is not incorrect per se, but will not match their end-of-year tax liability. Inland Revenue could do more in these circumstances to help the individuals during the year so that they do not have to wait until the end of the year for a refund, or receive a tax bill at the end of the year. The benefit of changing to a different tax rate sooner is that it should better approximate the person’s ultimate tax liability, and therefore reduce the size of a debt or refund position the person would otherwise be in at the end of the year. Similarly, an individual might have selected a withholding tax rate at their bank that is higher or lower than their marginal tax rate. If Inland Revenue thinks a resident withholding tax rate being used is not consistent with a person’s marginal tax rate, it already has the ability to provide a new rate for the payer to use.⁹ Inland Revenue will notify an individual if the tax rate or code they are using does not reflect their marginal tax rate and suggest they change it to ensure they do not significantly over-or under-pay their tax during the year. The proposed process in these cases is that Inland Revenue would notify the individual that the tax rate does not match their likely end-of-year tax liability. If no response is received, Inland Revenue would instruct the payer to change the tax rate being used. Inland Revenue would notify the individual that the payer had been instructed to change the rate. The ability for Inland Revenue to help people get things right is dependent on it receiving quality information in a timely manner rather than receiving it when it is too late to help. This is a major reason behind the Government’s recommended changes to the timing of information about PAYE and investment income. It will still be the individual’s responsibility to let Inland Revenue know if their circumstances change materially, but if Inland Revenue has more regular and timely income information it will be better placed to help individuals. Inland Revenue will proactively contact more individuals during the year to ensure the tax withheld during the year more closely matches their likely end-of-year liability. Special tax codes Over-and under-payments can still happen even when an individual is using the correct tax code. Some individuals, for example, those who have multiple jobs, might be better off using a special tax code tailored to their personal circumstances instead. For some people the standard tax codes do not result in the right amount of tax being deducted during the year. In this case individuals can apply for a special tax code. Special tax codes can be applied to: • salary/wage income; • NZ Superannuation; and • schedular income sources. A special tax code cannot be applied QUESTION FOR READERS 3.1 Do you agree that Inland Revenue should instruct a payer to change a withholding tax rate if the individual does not respond to Inland Revenue? If not, why not? ⁹Section 25A of the Tax Administration Act. 19 to an income-tested benefit payment, such as Jobseeker Support. Individuals can apply to Inland Revenue for a special tax code. They currently have to fill out a special tax code application and post it to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue calculates an appropriate tax rate to be used and issues a special tax code certificate to the individual. The individual then has to advise their employer that they want the special tax code applied to their income. A special tax code is only valid until the end of the tax year. Each individual who receives a special tax code certificate also receives a personal tax summary to complete, or is required to file an IR3 at the end of the year. The disadvantages of the current rules about special tax codes are that an individual first needs to know about special tax codes, secondly needs to realise that using one would benefit them, and thirdly needs to be able to estimate their likely annual income. For the 2015 tax year, only 7,975 individuals used a special tax code. This process will be modernised so an individual who wants a special tax code can request one online rather than by completing a paper form. Inland Revenue will also send a message to the employer or other payer at the same time containing the details of the special tax code, so if the individual chose to change to the code, they would not have to show a copy of the certificate to their employer. If Inland Revenue identifies that an individual would be better off using a special tax code, it would contact them, explain why, and suggest a special tax code. It would still be up to the individual to decide to change their tax code. This is because the individual will be in the best position to evaluate how their circumstances might change over time. A special tax code is still based on expected annual income. While it takes the progressivity of the income tax scales into account, it can still result in a refund or tax to pay if income is variable or does not remain at the level the individual predicted. For this reason, the Government is not proposing to mandate the use of a special tax code. Special tax codes are particularly useful for individuals who are receiving a benefit and working. Staff from the Ministry of Social Development will be able to advise clients of the simple online application process. An example of when a special tax code is useful is when secondary income results in an income tax threshold being crossed. In this case, an individual will have more tax withheld than they need to during the year. This is explained in the diagram on page 23. Secondary tax codes are an integral part of the PAYE system. They aim to ensure that a person earning a given amount of PAYE income from multiple sources pays the same amount of tax as a person earning the same amount For the 2015 tax year, only 7,975 individuals used a special tax code. This process will be modernised so an individual who wants a special tax code can request one online rather than by completing a paper form. If Inland Revenue identifies that an individual would be better off using a special tax code, it would contact them, explain why, and suggest a special tax code. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 3.2 Do you support the proposal that Inland Revenue should only suggest special tax codes, rather than insist that an individual should use one? If not, why? 3.3 Do you agree that if an individual applies for a special tax code Inland Revenue should tell their employer what the code is? 3.4 If Inland Revenue thinks an individual would benefit from using a special tax code, should Inland Revenue just tell the individual or their employer too? 3.5 Can you think of other areas where Inland Revenue should work during the year with other agencies that pay income to individuals to help individuals get their tax right? If so, what are the areas and agencies? 20 New Zealand has a progressive rate system for individuals’ income tax. The rate of tax increases as income increases. The part of a person’s taxable income that falls into a band is taxed at the rate for that band. 10.5% – $0 – $14,0001⁰ 17.5% – $14,001 – $48,000 30% – $48,001 – $70,000 33% – $70,000+ This example shows a person with one job and a salary of $53,000. Total tax paid is $8,920. It would be unfair if a second job was taxed at the rate for the first band, because part of the person’s first job was already taxed at that lower rate. If this happened, a person earning income from two jobs would pay less tax than a person earning the same amount of income from one job. Total tax paid is $7,945. This example shows a person with two jobs, earning $48,000 from their first job and $5,000 from their second job ($53,000 total). A secondary tax code means that they pay the same amount of tax as a person who earns the same amount of money from one job. Total tax paid is $8,920. $1,470 $5,950 $1,500 $1,470 $5,950 $1,500 $525 $1,470 $5,950 Tax paid When income from a second job takes a person’s total income over a tax threshold however, the person will have more tax withheld during the year than is necessary. This example shows a person with two jobs, earning $35,000 from their first job and $18,000 from their second job ($53,000 total). Total tax paid is $10,545. $1,470 $3,675 $5,400 Tax paid A special tax code can be used to ensure that no more tax is withheld than is necessary. The person in the previous example would be better off using a special tax code. Total tax paid is $8,920. $1,470 $3,675 $3,775 at approximately 21% Tax paid 30% – $48,001 – $70,00017.5% – $14,001 – $48,000 10.5% – $14,000 Special tax code Secondary tax code 33% – $70,001 + Tax paid Tax paid Tax rates and secondary tax codes 1⁰Changes to the tax thresholds were announced in Budget 2017 and are due to come info effect from 1 April 2018. 1 2 3 4 56 21 of PAYE income from a single source. Secondary tax codes ensure tax is withheld from secondary incomes at the person’s marginal tax rate. This is usually higher than their average tax rate, which is applied to their main job. The progressive nature of the personal income tax scale means that this is appropriate. By applying the person’s marginal tax rate, secondary tax codes prevent inappropriate multiple claims of the lowest (or lower) tax rates for people with concurrent sources of PAYE income, which would result in tax owing at the end of the tax year. If secondary income results in an income tax threshold being crossed, Inland Revenue would suggest the individual uses a special tax code instead of their secondary tax code in order to ensure the individual is not over-taxed during the year. From the information held about the individual’s income, Inland Revenue would suggest an appropriate rate. Hayley works 20 hours a week at a clothes store earning $16 an hour, and is also receiving the Jobseeker Support benefit. The Ministry of Social Development always uses a primary tax code for anyone receiving a benefit, even when the benefit is not the person’s largest source of income. This means Hayley uses a secondary tax code for the income from her job. This results in her being overtaxed during the year. Hayley’s income per week after tax using a secondary tax code for her job: Benefit = $42.13 Work = $2641¹ using the S tax code Hayley’s income per week after tax if she used a special tax code: Benefit = $42.13 Work = $279.55 Using a special tax code Hayley would receive an extra $15.55 per week, or $808.60 extra during the year rather than having to wait until the end of the year to get this refunded. HAY L E Y 1¹These numbers do not take the ACC earner levy into account. 22 SARAH Sarah has two jobs, giving her a total annual income of $55,000 ($35,000 from her main employer, and $20,000 from her second employer). The combination of these two sources of income means that her total income will cross the income tax threshold at $48,000. Sarah’s tax codes are: • M for her main job • SH for her secondary income The secondary tax code taxes the total $20,000 from Sarah’s second job at her marginal rate of 30%, even though income between $24,000 and $48,000 is usually taxed at 17.5%. This means $13,000 of her income from her second job is being taxed at 30% rather than 17.5%, so she is being overtaxed by 12.5% on that portion of her income. Sarah’s second employer would withhold $1,625¹² more tax during the year than was necessary to meet Sarah’s ultimate tax liability (which could be refunded to Sarah at the end of the year). If Sarah used a special tax code instead of the SH secondary tax code she would have an extra $31.25 per week in her take home pay, rather than having too much tax withheld and having to wait for a refund. Sarah would be better off using a special tax code than a secondary tax code. Future possibilities: • Sarah will be able to apply for a special tax code online. Inland Revenue would notify her second employer to use the special tax code rather than the secondary tax code. • If Sarah does not apply for a special tax code but Inland Revenue notices that the income from her second job is likely to take her income over a tax threshold it would notify Sarah and suggest she might like to use a special tax code. It would explain the difference that it would make for Sarah. 1²These numbers do not take the ACC earner levy into account. 23 Some individuals are required to provide information by filing income tax returns so Inland Revenue can ensure that they are paying the right amount of tax on the income they have earned. If an individual files an income tax return that results in a refund or tax to pay, an obligation is created for payment of this amount. However, individuals who are not required to file returns do not have their tax position squared up, so there is no payment obligation. As discussed in the Green Paper, the Government wants it to be simpler for taxpayers to work out what, if anything, they need to do to pay and receive the right amounts. This involves the Government reviewing which individuals should be required to provide information to Inland Revenue and those who should not. Similarly, it needs to be quicker and require less effort for individuals to do what they need to do. CURRENT RULES Only some individuals are required to report income to Inland Revenue at the end of the tax year. The rules were changed in the 1990s as part of a package of reforms intended to reduce compliance costs and simplify tax administration by reducing the number of people required to file returns. Section 33 of the Tax Administration Act imposes a general obligation on all individuals to file annually for the purposes of disclosing their taxable income. That section then excludes from its scope anyone who meets the requirements of section 33AA(1), or is issued an income statement or is required to be issued an income statement. Individuals are responsible for determining whether they are required to file a return, or request a personal tax summary (or correct one that Inland Revenue has issued to them), or whether they do not need to take any action to finalise their tax position. They are required to do this by considering their income position and deciding whether they meet the requirements of section 33AA based on: • their tax residency status; • whether they have any tax credits or losses; ...the Government wants it to be simpler for taxpayers to work out what, if anything, they need to do to pay and receive the right amounts. CHAPTER 4 AT THE END OF THE TAX YEAR 24 • the amounts of income they have derived from particular sources; and • the amounts of certain types of income from which tax has been withheld at an incorrect rate. These rules are quite complex and can be difficult for individuals to understand. In order to know if any income has been taxed at an incorrect rate, and whether it is necessary to file a return as a result, an individual must consider all of their income sources and the tax rates that were applied to them. Some individuals are unaware that they need to provide any information to Inland Revenue. Section 33AA(1) of the Tax Administration Act sets a monetary threshold which relates to when an individual must file a return. A person is not required to file a return if they (in addition to satisfying a number of other criteria) derive $200 or less of certain types of income from which tax has not been withheld or not withheld correctly. These types of income include employment income, interest and dividends. This $200 of income will translate to different amounts of tax depending on a person’s marginal tax rate. This means a person who is required to file an income tax return must square up any over-or under- payments, whereas a person who is not required to file a return is not. A central tenet of New Zealand’s tax system is that everyone should pay their fair share of tax. People who earn the same amount of taxable income should pay the same amount of tax, regardless of how they earn that income. An example of the equity concerns this can raise occurs in years in which there is an extra pay-day. For example, some tax years can have 53 weekly or 27 fortnightly pay-days. When this happens, not enough tax is deducted because typical PAYE withholding calculations are based on standard years of 52 weekly or 26 fortnightly pay-days.¹³ People who are required to file returns will typically end up with an unexpected tax liability, whereas those who are not required to file returns will not have to pay this extra amount. If a person is not required to file a return (“a non-filer”), it does not necessarily mean they do not file. A lot of “non-filers” are due refunds and they may still choose to file if they wish to claim these refunds. In addition, the revenue system now supports a range of social policy entitlements and obligations1⁴ that require individuals to provide information to Inland Revenue, such as information about family circumstances, and confirm their income through a tax return. When the changes to the filing rules were made in the late 1990s, it was expected that only 400,000 people would need to receive a personal tax summary each year. Filing to claim refunds and for social policy reasons, however, means that in the 2015 tax year approximately 1,100,000 people submitted a personal tax summary and an additional 1,100,000 filed an IR3 tax return form.1⁵ 1³ The amount of extra tax to be paid will depend on the individual’s salary, and how frequently they are paid. In a year when they are paid 53 times, rather than 52, the extra tax will be $0 if their marginal tax rate is in the lowest tax band, $19 if in the second tax band, $134 if in the third, and $175 if in the top band. In a year in which they are paid 27 times rather than 26, the extra tax will be $0 if their marginal tax rate is in the lowest tax band, $38 if in the second tax band, $268 if in the third, and $350 if in the top band. ¹⁴In various forms, Inland Revenue has been involved in Working for Families tax credits since 1986/1987, Child Support since 1991/1992, and the Student Loan scheme since 1991/1992. 1⁵An IR3 must be filed if an individual earns income which has not been taxed during the year. When the changes to the filing rules were made in the late 1990s, it was expected that only 400,000 people would need to receive a personal tax summary each year. Filing to claim refunds and for social policy reasons, however, means that in the 2015 tax year approximately 1,100,000 people submitted a personal tax summary and an additional 1,100,000 filed an IR3 tax return form. 25 TWO OPTIONS FOR END-OF-YEAR FILING OBLIGATIONS The discussion document sets out two options for which individuals should have to provide information to Inland Revenue at the end of a tax year. The “improved status quo” simply builds on earlier legislative changes in the Making Tax Simpler series, namely improved PAYE and investment income information. Under the improved status quo, Inland Revenue would issue more personal tax summaries to individuals for them to confirm or complete. The “alternative approach” further simplifies the rules about filing annual tax returns. Individuals whose only income came through withholding tax systems would not have to provide any information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would calculate the difference between the tax that was paid during the year and the individual’s tax liability. If the individual does not interact by a set time, Inland Revenue would issue refunds or request payments of amounts over thresholds. THE IMPROVED STATUS QUO As a result of the proposed changes to the reporting of investment income information in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill, Inland Revenue will be able to more accurately determine who should be issued a personal tax summary. By receiving information about interest, New Zealand-sourced dividends and Māori authority distributions during the year, Inland Revenue will be able to determine if tax was withheld at a rate that would require the individual to complete a personal tax summary. Under the improved status quo, Inland Revenue would issue personal tax summaries when appropriate, requiring the individuals who received them to square up their tax position. If a personal tax summary is not issued, individuals will still need to determine whether they need to request a personal tax summary. THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH As noted earlier, when individuals file an income tax return, the consequence is that if the return results in a refund or tax to pay, an obligation is created for payment of this amount (subject to rules around very small balances). Under the current law individuals who are not required to file returns do not have their tax position squared up. The alternative approach would separate the requirement to provide information to Inland Revenue from the question of whether an individual’s tax position should be squared up. Ultimately, the purpose of requiring individuals to interact with Inland Revenue is to ensure the right amount of tax – or close to the right amount – is paid at the right time. To reduce compliance costs, individuals should need to interact only when it is necessary for that purpose. Under the alternative approach, individuals would only be required to provide information to Inland Revenue if that is necessary to ensure that the right amount of tax is paid. The alternative approach would separate the requirement to provide information to Inland Revenue from the question of whether an individual’s tax position should be squared up. Under the improved status quo, Inland Revenue would issue personal tax summaries when appropriate, requiring the individuals who received them to square up their tax position. If a personal tax summary is not issued, individuals will still need to determine whether they need to request a personal tax summary. 26 Under the alternative approach individuals would only be required to provide information to Inland Revenue if that is necessary to ensure that the right amount of tax is paid. Individuals who earn only income that is reported to Inland Revenue by a third party during the year (or shortly after the end of the year) have no additional income information to provide Inland Revenue. Their interaction is unnecessary to determine the “correctness” of their tax. Inland Revenue holds enough information to calculate if the tax that has been remitted during the year matches the person’s tax liability. Under this approach, they would not be required to provide income information to Inland Revenue. Requiring these people to file would impose costs on them but would not increase the accuracy of their final tax position. The Government considers that these extra compliance costs would outweigh any benefits and has decided that not all individuals should be required to provide income information to Inland Revenue. “Reportable income” “Reportable income” is intended to cover all the sources of income in respect of which Inland Revenue receives third party reporting during the year, or very shortly after the end of the year. Employment income is already reported to Inland Revenue during the year. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill includes a proposal that this information should be reported to Inland Revenue on a pay-period basis. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill includes a proposal to change the due date to 15 May for payers of interest income to provide yearly information to Inland Revenue. This would allow Inland Revenue to include this information on an individual’s account by the time the individual might be required to file a personal tax summary and become "reportable income". Further changes in that bill would add dividend income and Māori authority income to the list of reportable income sources. From the time these changes take effect, these would all be included in the definition of “reportable income”. From 1 April 2017, employers will be required to report the taxable value of employee share scheme income through the employer monthly schedule.1⁶ This will also be included in the definition of “reportable income”. Other forms of income are reported by third parties to Inland Revenue, for example, income arising from partnership and look-through company interests, and trust income. These are examples of income information that is not provided in time to be included in a tax return. These types of income are not included in the definition of “reportable income”. Inland Revenue will use the information when it is received to ensure that individuals have met their tax obligations. Since 2015 financial institutions have been required to send information about some of their clients to Inland Revenue under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requirements. Following the adoption Individuals who earn only income that is reported to Inland Revenue by a third party during the year (or shortly after the end of the year) have no additional information to provide Inland Revenue. ...they would not be required to provide income information to Inland Revenue. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 4.1 Which do you prefer, the “improved status quo” or the “alternative approach”? Why? 4.2 Do you agree with the proposal that people who earn only “reportable income” should not have to provide information about it to Inland Revenue? 4.3 Can you think of any other types of income that would fit the definition of “reportable income”? If so, what are these? 1⁶Employers may withhold PAYE from the employee share scheme income. 27 of the Common Reporting Standard as part of the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (AEOI), Inland Revenue will receive information about overseas investment income of New Zealand tax residents. Again, this information is not received in time to be included in a tax return process, and so is not included in the definition of “reportable income”. The individual would be responsible for considering whether: • they have received non- reportable income; and • they are not a New Zealand tax resident;¹⁷ and • they have any tax credits they wish to carry forward, a tax loss balance or a tax loss component; and • they are not a “cash basis” person for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules; and • they pay provisional tax. If the individual meets any of these conditions they will be required to provide information to Inland Revenue. Analysis of an individual’s account and history may indicate that it is likely that a particular individual has earned non-reportable sources of income. In this case, Inland Revenue will prompt that individual to include information about the income. HOW THE “ALTERNATIVE APPROACH” WOULD BE DIFFERENT TO THE “IMPROVED STATUS QUO” New Zealand’s tax system operates using a model of self-assessment. This means it is the responsibility of each person to determine the amount of tax payable in relation to their income. That responsibility would remain. Individuals are currently required to consider the correctness of the withholding on their income. Under this proposal they would no longer be required to do so. Inland Revenue would determine whether there was a difference between the amount of tax remitted through withholding tax, and an individual’s tax liability on this income. It would follow up if any action should be taken. Currently, if an individual or their spouse is receiving Working for Families tax credits they are sent a personal tax summary or are required to file a tax return at the end of the year. This is to confirm their income for the year to enable a square-up of their entitlement. If a person has to make child support payments, they are required to complete a personal tax summary if they earn more than $200 of interest, dividends or taxable Māori authority distributions. For individuals who only earn reportable income there would be no need to provide income information as Inland Revenue would hold information on all of their income already. The Government proposes that individuals in this situation would no longer be required to file tax The individual would be responsible for considering whether: • they have received non- reportable income; and • they are not a New Zealand tax resident; and • they have any tax credits they wish to carry forward, a tax loss balance or a tax loss component; and • they are not a “cash basis” person for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules; and • they pay provisional tax. If the individual meets any of these conditions they will be required to provide information to Inland Revenue. QUESTION FOR READERS 4.4 Do you agree with the proposal about which people should still have to provide information to Inland Revenue? ¹⁷Alternatively, whether they are a non-resident deriving no income with a source in New Zealand other than non-resident passive income referred to in section RF 2(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 28 Would you need to provide information to Inland Revenue at the end of the tax year? Are you a New Zealand resident? Do you earn any non-reportable income? Are you on a “cash basis” for financial arrangements? Do you pay provisional tax? Do you have a tax credit or a tax loss component to carry foward? Do not need to provide income information NO YES YES YES YES NO YES NO NO NO Need to provide information 29 NO YES CAN CHOOSE IF THEY WANT TO SQUARE UP STATUS QUO YES MORE THAN $200 OF INCOME TAXED INCORRECTLY?

INFORMATION FROM MORE SOURCES 30 returns solely because they receive Working for Families tax credits or child support or have a student loan. They will still be required to confirm their family circumstances information and non-taxable income information, although it is expected this would be separate to the income tax return. While people who use special tax codes are currently required to file a personal tax summary or IR3 return, this would not be necessary under the alternative approach. Inland Revenue would know which individuals were issued special tax codes, and if that special tax code was being applied to their income. The individual would not need to notify Inland Revenue that they had used a special tax code. Individuals who use a special tax code currently have to reapply for a new one each year. Under the alternative approach, this would no longer be necessary. If a special tax code continued to be used after it was no longer providing the correct outcome for an individual, this would be picked up by Inland Revenue monitoring the individual’s income and withholding rates during the year. Inland Revenue would contact the individual about changing the code. Individuals who earn salary or wages from employment as either an election day worker, or a casual agricultural employee currently have to file income tax returns if they earn more than $200 of that type of income. This would not be necessary under the alternative approach. The flowchart on page 29 sets out which individuals would have to provide information to Inland Revenue. Individuals are unlikely to need to work their way through the flowchart, as they will generally know whether they are required to provide information or not. The advantages of this proposal, compared with the improved status quo are that it would: • be easier for individuals to understand; • offer a better balance between compliance costs and accuracy; • take advantage of the increased information available to Inland Revenue from third parties; • require fewer individuals to provide information to Inland Revenue; and • remove the inequity whereby people who are not currently required to file do not have their tax positions squared up. Will individuals be in the same position every year? Whether someone is required to provide information to Inland Revenue at the end of a tax year will depend on their personal circumstances in that year. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 4.5 Do you agree that a person should not be required to provide income information simply because they receive Working for Families tax credits or child support or have a student loan? 4.6 Can you think of other people who are required to file returns now that should not have to under the “alternative approach”? If so, who are these people, and why do you think they should not have to? In 2015, 3,334,000 people • earned income with PAYE deducted (including benefits and New Zealand Superannuation), or • declared earning interest or dividends, \* and did not appear to receive any: • shareholder employee salary; • overseas income; • trust income; • other income; • partnership income; • business income; or • rental income. These people would not need to provide information to Inland Revenue if the alternative approach is adopted. \*This is only about income that is declared, not about income that is earned. 31 Some individuals will find that they never have to provide information to Inland Revenue. If, for example, someone receives only reportable income such as a salary and some interest they would not need to provide any information to Inland Revenue. Conversely, some individuals will find that they have to provide information to Inland Revenue in most years, or every year. This will be the case if they earn non-reportable income or want to claim a deduction for tax purposes. These individuals are already required to file income tax returns under the current law. Other individuals will find that whether they are required to provide information will vary between years. If, for example, a person had always worked for an employer who deducted PAYE from their wages, but then started earning non-reportable income, they would need to start providing information to Inland Revenue. If, in a later year, they stopped earning that extra income and reverted to earning only reportable income, they would no longer be required to provide information to Inland Revenue. If other sources of income are added to the list of those required to be reported to Inland Revenue by third parties during the year, or shortly after the end of the year, individuals will not need to provide information to Inland Revenue about that source of income. WHAT INLAND REVENUE WILL DO UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH Inland Revenue will remind individuals generally about their obligations every year, such as through advertising and awareness campaigns. The Government proposes that Inland Revenue will take different approaches to individuals depending on what information it holds about them. The flow chart on page 35 sets these out. Inland Revenue will consider the individual’s situation Inland Revenue will consider what it knows about an individual, their income sources, their tax history and their circumstances. If Inland Revenue has no reason to believe that the individual needs to provide information, it will move to the calculate stage. Individuals who only earn reportable income will know that they do not need to provide information to Inland Revenue, and that Inland Revenue will let them know if there happens to be a refund or amount of tax to pay. If Inland Revenue needs more information from the individual it will not move to the calculate stage. Inland Revenue may have reason to believe that the individual has received non-reportable income (for example, the individual has earned rental income in a previous year), or has to provide information because of one of the other requirements on page 28, or Inland Revenue may have WHAT INLAND REVENUE WILL DO • Inland Revenue will consider the individual's situation • Inland Revenue will calculate if there is a refund or tax to pay • The assessment will crystallise • Inland Revenue will complete the process. 32 questions about some information it holds, and needs the individual to clarify. If Inland Revenue considers that the individual will need to provide more information, it will remind them of their obligation to provide the information, to confirm that they earned no income, or only earned reportable income. If this is not provided by their filing date, non- filing penalties could be applied, and a default assessment may be issued. A default assessment is an estimation of tax liability made by Inland Revenue that remains in place until the individual files a return. This could be made based on the amount of income previously returned by the taxpayer. If an individual ceases to earn income from a non-reportable source, they should advise Inland Revenue that they no longer earn that income. If an individual begins to earn non-reportable income but Inland Revenue is not aware of this and deems the individual to have accepted the position shown on their statement if they do not interact, it is still the individual’s responsibility to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid. Inland Revenue will calculate if there is a refund or tax to pay As discussed in chapter 2, certain types of income are subject to a withholding tax system, which means the payer of income withholds tax from the income the individual has earned, and pays this money to Inland Revenue. Although withholding systems are generally accurate, there can sometimes be a difference between the individual’s ultimate tax liability and the amount of tax that was remitted to Inland Revenue. Individuals are currently required, for each source of income, to calculate the amount of tax that should have been paid and compare this to what was paid. Under the alternative approach Inland Revenue would compare the tax credits and payments it has received with the person’s income tax liability for that year, and calculate the difference (if any). This difference calculation will be displayed on myIR for the individual to see. All relevant income information that Inland Revenue holds about an individual will be used in this calculation. If Inland Revenue has only linked income to one individual, but the income actually belongs to more than one individual, it would be included in its entirety in that one individual’s account, and therefore their calculation. An example of when this could happen would be a joint investment if the payer does not hold details about all of the owners of the investment. The individuals would be able to tell Inland Revenue that the income should be shared between all the joint owners. If this calculation shows no difference, or only a small difference, nothing will happen. The thresholds defining small differences are discussed later in this chapter. QUESTION FOR READERS 4.7 If an amount is smaller than the threshold, do you agree that an assessment should not crystallise? 33 The assessment will crystallise The information will be shown on myIR, and individuals can log on and confirm the information if they wish. If Inland Revenue has calculated an amount above the threshold, the individual will have a prescribed period to respond. If they do not respond, Inland Revenue will consider that they have accepted the information as shown. It will become their assessment at this time. The reason for leaving a prescribed period before Inland Revenue deems the individual to have accepted the information is to allow for the individual to make any necessary changes, for example, to add any non-reportable income or claim a tax deductible expense. If the difference is less than the threshold, the amount of tax withheld and paid to Inland Revenue will be treated as the individual’s liability, as happens now for non-filing taxpayers. Inland Revenue will complete the process If Inland Revenue has moved through all three previous steps it will act to complete the process. It will do this by: • issuing a refund; • requesting payment; or • carrying foward a loss balance. QUESTION FOR READERS 4.8 Do you agree with the proposal about deemed acceptance, default assessment, and not creating an assessment? 34 NO YES NO YES Does Inland Revenue believe information should be provided? A default assessment might be issued Is the difference between the payments received and your tax liability larger than the specified thresholds? There will be no assessment You will be deemed to have accepted the information. Refund or payment issued What happens if the Individual does not provide information to Inland Revenue? QUESTION FOR READERS 4.8 If an amount is smaller than the threshold, do you agree that an assessment should not crystallise? THE SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS Inland Revenue can refrain from collecting small amounts of tax owed or issuing small refunds. This reflects the disproportionate costs small amounts can impose on Inland Revenue and individuals. This should continue. Where the amount of tax to pay or refund is less than the "specified threshold", the amount of tax withheld and remitted to Inland Revenue will be treated as the taxpayer's liability, as happens now for non-filing taxpayers. Feedback is sought on the thresholds. Depending on the levels, there is a trade-off between accuracy, fairness, revenue, compliance and administration costs. The two existing thresholds are: • $20 for tax owed; and • $5 for refunds. The threshold for refunds Individuals will still be able to claim a refund below the threshold if they wish. This means individuals have to expend effort to obtain the smallest of refunds, whereas they automatically receive larger refunds. This seems counter-intuitive. Historically, there has been a small refund threshold to take into account the administrative cost of issuing a refund (usually the cost of posting a cheque), and the costs individuals incur to bank the cheque. As at 1 December 2016, 94.5% of refunds that Inland Revenue paid were made electronically. The very high percentage of refunds paid through digital channels brings into question the need to retain a small refund threshold, or perhaps to only retain one for payments requested by cheque. As at 1 December 2016, 94.5% of refunds that Inland Revenue paid were made electronically. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 4.9 Should there be a threshold for small refunds, or should all refunds, no matter how small, be automatically paid out? 4.10 Should there be a threshold for small refunds if they are paid by cheque? 35 Number of people with refunds above monetary thresholds Filed an IR3Filed a PTSDid not file $0346,000909,000778,000 $5332,000810,000456,000 The cost to Inland Revenue of issuing a refund digitally, regardless of the size, is negligible, so all refunds could be crystallised and paid. Some individuals might find it odd to receive a refund of a few cents or dollars, but there would be no compliance cost to them if it was received digitally. Most banks charge a nominal fee for depositing cheques, so this option would work best for digital refunds. A small threshold could be retained for cheques. For the 2015 tax year there were 778,000 people with refunds who did not file or request a personal tax summary.¹⁸ If the alternative approach had applied in that year, with the current refund threshold of $5, Inland Revenue would have issued refunds to an additional 456,000 people. The following table sets out the numbers of people potentially affected at other monetary levels. ¹⁸In the 2015 tax year 3,246,000 individuals were reported as receiving PAYE income. If those people submitted an IR3 or a personal tax summary the following data includes the other income they declared, but if they did not file, then the data is based only on their employment income. 1,851,000 of these people filed a return, while 1,395,000 did not. People who filed returns but were not reported as earning any PAYE income are not included in the following data. Accordingly, the data in the tables will not show the exact number of people who would be affected by the alternative approach at any specified threshold level. For example, a person who did not file might have had interest withheld at a rate that would mean they would also be due a refund or have an amount of tax to pay, but will not show up in this data. 36 QUESTIONS FOR READERS 4.11 Should there be a threshold for small amounts owed, or should all amounts to pay, no matter how small, be payable? If so, what should this level be? 4.12 What factors should be taken into account in setting a threshold for small amounts of tax owed? law, an individual is not required to interact with Inland Revenue if they (in addition to satisfying a number of other criteria) derive $200 or less of certain types of income from which tax has not been withheld, or withhheld correctly. Depending on an individual’s marginal tax rate, this $200 of income could equate to up to $66 of tax. For the 2015 tax year, 617,000 people with tax to pay did not file or request a personal tax summary.¹⁹ If the alternative approach had applied in that year, with the current threshold of $20, Inland Revenue would have required 179,000 of these people to pay, but the 36,000 people who filed a personal tax summary with tax to pay under $20 would not have had to file. If the specified threshold for debts was $66, Inland Revenue would have required 136,000 of these people to pay, but the 58,000 people who filed a PTS with an amount of tax to pay less than $66 would not have had to file. Filed an IR3Filed a PTSDid not file $20433,000114,000179,000 $66423,00092,000136,000 Number of people with amounts of tax to pay above monetary thresholds The threshold for tax to pay Having a threshold under which small amounts of tax are not payable is a trade-off between accuracy, fairness, revenue, and compliance and administration costs. Individuals will incur a compliance cost in paying small amounts. The Government is interested in the factors submitters think should be taken into account when setting a threshold for amounts of tax to pay. Under the alternative approach, amounts of tax to pay that are smaller than the specified threshold would not be crystallised, unless the individual chose to pay the amount. It is unlikely that individuals will choose to pay amounts that they are not required to, so the level of the specified threshold for amounts of tax to pay will, in effect, determine the number of individuals who have their tax position "squared up". As noted earlier, under the current ¹⁹As at footnote #18. 37 Sarah has two jobs and uses a special tax code. Under the current rules, Sarah is required to complete a personal tax summary because she used a special tax code. Under the improved status quo, Sarah would be required to complete a personal tax summary because she used a special tax code. Under the alternative approach, Sarah would not have to provide any income information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would consider what is known about Sarah. It would have no reason to believe that Sarah needs to provide any information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would calculate the total amount of PAYE it received during the year from Sarah’s two jobs and compare this to Sarah’s income tax liability for the year based on these two sources of income. Because Sarah used the special tax code, there would be no difference. Her assessment would not crystallise (i.e. nothing would happen). Maura is retired. She receives New Zealand Superannuation, and interest income from money she has in a bank. She uses the correct withholding rate for her interest. Under the current rules, Maura is not required to request a personal tax summary. She can complete one if she would like to. Under the improved status quo, Maura would not be required to request a personal tax summary. She could complete one if she would like to. Under the alternative approach, Maura would not have to provide any income information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would consider what is known about Maura. It would have no reason to believe that Maura needs to provide any information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would calculate the total amount of PAYE and RWT received during the year from Maura’s superannuation and interest income and compare this to Maura’s income tax liability for the year based on these two sources of income. There would be no difference. Maura’s assessment would not crystallise (i.e. nothing would happen). MAURASARAH 38 Nico is an employee earning only wage income, from which his employer deducts PAYE every fortnight. Last year, Nico only ended up working for nine months of the year before quitting his job to travel. His annual salary was $60,000 and he was paid monthly. Because the PAYE calculations assume a person will work for the entire year, each pay period is annualised and taxed at the rate that would apply if they had worked the entire year. Each month Nico earned $5,000. Nico’s employer withheld tax at a rate that would apply to an annual income of $60,000. This totalled $8,265 tax on the income Nico earned until the end of December. Because his total income for the year was only $45,000 rather than $60,000 his final tax liability is only $6,895. Nico is due a refund of $1,370. Under the current rules, Nico is not required to file a personal tax summary. He will need to complete one if he would like to claim his $1,370 refund. Under the improved status quo, Nico would not be required to file a personal tax summary. He would need to request one if he would like to claim his $1,370 refund. Under the alternative approach, Nico would not have to provide NICO any income information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would consider what is known about Nico. It would have no reason to believe that he needs to provide any information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would calculate the total amount of PAYE it received from Nico’s employer was more than his tax liability. Nico’s assessment would crystallise and Inland Revenue would complete the process by issuing Nico a refund of $1,370. 39 Liam is an employee earning wage income. His employer deducts PAYE every week when Liam is paid. Liam also gets dividends from a utility company each year on which the company pays tax on behalf of Liam. Liam’s employer reports Liam’s wage income to Inland Revenue. The utility company provides information about the dividends they pay to Liam and the related tax. Last year Liam earned $46,000 wage income from which his employer withheld $7,070 of tax (for income up to $14000 at 10.5% and for the income over $14000 at 17.5%). Liam also received dividends of $1,500 from a utility company which include $495 tax ($420 paid by the company at the corporate tax rate of 28% and $75 of RWT withheld by the company so that the total tax equates to the top tax rate of 33%). Because Liam’s marginal tax rate is only 17.5%, he is entitled to a refund of $232.50 of the tax that was paid on his dividends. Under the current rules, Liam is not required to file a personal tax summary. He will need to complete one if he would like to claim his $232.50 refund. Under the improved status quo, LIAM Liam would not be required to file a personal tax summary. Inland Revenue would observe that Liam was due a refund because of the additional tax paid on his dividends. It would issue him a personal tax summary. Under the alternative approach, Liam would not have to provide any income information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would consider what it knows about Liam. It would have no reason to believe that Liam needs to provide any information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would calculate the total amount of PAYE and tax received during the year from Liam's wages and the dividends and compare this with Liam's income tax liability for the year based on these two sources of income. Inland Revenue would calculate the total amount of tax it received was more than Liam's tax liability. Liam's assessment would crystallise and Inland Revenue would complete the process by issuing Liam a refund of $232.50. 40 Sam is an employee earning salary income from which his employer deducts PAYE every week when he pays Sam. Last year Sam’s annual salary was $78,000. Each week Sam earned $1,500 from which Sam’s employer withheld $320 PAYE (excluding ACC earners’ levy) each pay-day. Because of the day on which his salary is paid, last tax year Sam received 53 weekly salary pays in the tax year (a standard tax year has 52 pay-days). Because the PAYE system and PAYE tables are based on 52 weekly pay days occurring in a tax year, Sam has a tax shortfall of $175. (He received $79,500 salary income in the tax year, but his weekly PAYE was based on $78,000). Under the current rules, Sam is not required to complete a personal tax summary. Under the improved status quo, Sam would not be required to complete a personal tax summary. Under the alternative approach, Sam would not be required to provide any income information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would consider what it knows about Sam. It would have no reason to believe that he needs to provide any information SAM to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would calculate the total amount of PAYE it received during the year from Sam’s job and compare this to his income tax liability for the year based on that sources of income. Inland Revenue would calculate the total amount of tax it received was less than Sam’s tax liability. Sam’s assessment would crystallise and Inland Revenue would complete the process by requesting a payment of $175 from Sam. 41 Lexie has been self-employed for five years. She buys run-down vintage cars, restores them and then sells them online. After receiving a large inheritance payment a few years ago she invested some money overseas and now earns a substantial amount of overseas interest income. In addition to owning her own home, Lexie owns two apartments that she rents out. None of Lexie’s income is reported to Inland Revenue by a third party during the year. Under the current rules, Lexie is required to file an income tax return. Under the improved status quo, Lexie would be required to file an income tax return. Under the alternative approach, Lexie would be required to provide information because she earned non-reportable income. Inland Revenue would consider what is known about Lexie. Since Lexie has been declaring self- employed income, overseas income and rental income in previous years, Inland Revenue would consider that Lexie is likely to have non-reportable income this year too. LEXIE Inland Revenue would issue a request for Lexie to provide the necessary information. If Lexie does not do that, Inland Revenue would issue a default assessment for Lexie. 42 INTERACTING WITH INLAND REVENUE As shown in the flowchart on page 29, while only some individuals will have an obligation to provide information to Inland Revenue at the end of the year, all individuals can choose to interact with Inland Revenue. This interaction could simply be viewing their online statement, adding or amending any information if they do not think the statement is accurate, claiming a refund or paying an amount of tax that is less than the specified threshold. Using intermediaries Many taxpayers choose to engage a tax professional to help them to comply with their tax obligations and others nominate a friend or relative to act on their behalf. It is expected that tax intermediaries, whether paid or not, will continue to play a vital role in supporting taxpayers with their interactions with Inland Revenue. A key driver of the proposals in this document is to simplify the rules so that more individuals can understand their obligations and meet those obligations with minimal effort. DIGITAL INTERACTION There is already significant use of Inland Revenue’s digital services, including use of myIR and payments being made digitally. Less than five percent of the nine million returns that Inland Revenue receives each year are submitted on paper now. Online forms allow Inland Revenue to present only the questions that are relevant, with later questions not appearing if an answer to a previous question makes them irrelevant. Prompts tailored to the individual can be presented online based on information from previous years, or other information Inland Revenue holds about an individual. That same level of service cannot be provided through paper channels. While tax returns will still be available through non-digital channels, the experience will not be as simple or as adaptive as through myIR. As is currently the case, income information would still be pre-populated on paper returns for individuals who choose not to interact through myIR. Less than five percent of the nine million returns that Inland Revenue receives each year are submitted on paper now. CHAPTER 5 AT THE END OF THE TAX YEAR – OTHER INFORMATION 43 USING myIR Inland Revenue’s records of an individual’s reportable income will be displayed in the individual’s myIR account. If they have uploaded copies of donations receipts during the year, these will be shown on their myIR account. The myIR account would also include questions or prompting statements that are tailored to what Inland Revenue knows of the individual’s circumstances. These could be related to income that the individual had declared in previous years (for example, “You had rental income last year, do you still rent out a property?"). Or they could be based on information Inland Revenue received from the person during the year (for example, “You’ve already filled in some foreign-sourced income details, do you have more to add?”). They may also be based on information Inland Revenue has received from other sources. If an individual has received non- reportable income (for example, rental income), that income will not be displayed. In these circumstances, the individual will need to provide information about this income to Inland Revenue. In addition, while the information Inland Revenue presents in an individual’s information statement will generally be accurate, errors may still occur. If their information statement does contain errors, the individual will be responsible for amending these before confirming their information statement. As well as adding information that is not already shown, individuals will be able to amend the information that Inland Revenue has displayed, or confirm it as correct and complete. Some individuals with more complex tax affairs will find that the information that Inland Revenue makes available is not useful to them when completing their return filing obligations. For example, an individual on an accruals basis would probably not find interest information useful. They could amend or delete the amounts shown to reflect their circumstances. Any obligations or entitlements will be clearly stated. If the account shows that the individual has tax to pay, the payment options will be given. There will be a simple “pay-now” functionality. If the individual has a refund, they will be able to request that it be paid. DUE DATES FOR INFORMATION No changes are proposed to the due dates for filing annual returns. For the majority of people who are required to provide information, they must do this by 7 July, subject to extension of time arrangements. RESULTS OF INTERACTION If the individual interacts before 7 July (or other relevant date) and confirms their statement, it will become an assessment on the day they confirm the statement. The effect of the Inland Revenue's records of an individual's reportable income will be displayed in the individual's myIR account. The myIR account would also include questions or prompting statements that are tailored to what Inland Revenue knows of the individual’s circumstances. 44 amount calculated crystallising into an assessment is that the customer is liable to pay the amount to Inland Revenue, is entitled to receive the amount as a refund, or is entitled to carry the amount forward as a net loss. DONATIONS TAX CREDITS Credits for donations can be claimed at the end of a tax year by filling in a Tax Credit claim form (IR526), or during the year through a system called Payroll Giving, where the credits are received immediately. An individual who claims a tax credit for a donation does not also need to file an income tax return (unless they are required to for other reasons). Donations tax credits can be claimed for a previous tax year (1 April to 31 March) from the following April each year. This can be weeks or months before an individual files a personal tax summary or IR3. If the individual is also required to file an IR3, the credits are not released until the IR3 has been filed. Approximately 80percent of individuals filing an IR526 are also filing a personal tax summary or IR3 form. The Government seeks feedback on whether donations tax credits should be partially reincorporated into the income tax process. Individuals who still wanted to fill in a separate IR526 form could do so, while others could input information about the donations they wish to claim on myIR as they file. DIRECT CREDITING REFUNDS People who are entitled to an income tax refund currently receive it either by direct credit or a posted cheque. Direct crediting is a much faster process with lower compliance costs for the recipient and lower administrative costs for Inland Revenue. The Government seeks feedback on whether income tax refunds should be made only through direct credit into the taxpayer’s nominated bank account, with exemptions being available in limited circumstances. The majority of Inland Revenue’s customers prefer direct crediting as a safe, secure and convenient way of receiving refunds. In 2014/15, about 85percent of the nearly two million individuals’ income tax refunds were made by direct credit. A larger percentage of non-individuals received their income tax refund through cheques in the same income year – about 56percent of the nearly 170,000 refunds. The proposal would benefit taxpayers by eliminating time delays associated with the postal system as well as the costs and effort of banking a cheque. Direct crediting also has the benefit of reduced administration costs for Inland Revenue. A direct credit refund is generally available to the taxpayer in two working days. The proposal would be implemented by Order in Council through an existing legislative framework²⁰ which provides for the progressive implementation of compulsory direct Approximately 80percent of individuals filing an IR526 are also filing a personal tax summary or IR3 form. In 2014/15, about 85percent of the nearly two million individuals' income tax refunds were made by direct credit. A larger percentage of non-individuals received their income tax refund through cheques in the same income year - about 56% of the nearly 170,000 refunds. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 5.1 Do you support the proposal to allow people to claim donations credits without having to fill in a separate form? 5.2 Do you support the proposal that income tax refunds should be made only by direct credit, with limited exemptions being available? ²⁰Sections 184A and 184B of the Tax Administration Act. 45 crediting of refunds for the various types of tax administered by Inland Revenue. In this context the tax type income tax would cover individual, as well as non-individual, income tax and include tax on individual, employment (PAYE), investment and business income, as well as special categories of income tax such as fringe benefit tax. An exemption is available under the framework for customers who would experience undue hardship or for circumstances where it is impracticable to refund through direct credit. Compulsory direct crediting already applies to donations tax credits for charitable gifts and GST refunds.²¹ COLLECTING TAX TO PAY When an income tax assessment shows tax to pay, this amount is due by 7 February of the following year. If the individual has a tax agent, they have until 7 April to pay. In the future, amounts to pay will be able to be paid directly through myIR, as well the current payment mechanisms, which include: • transferring money to Inland Revenue through internet banking; and • paying by debit or credit card on Inland Revenue’s website. Inland Revenue issues reminders in the lead up to the payment dates, as well as communicating with people who have not paid by the due date. Inland Revenue has a range of debt collection powers which can be used as appropriate. Determining the appropriate action involves balancing the obligation to maximise recovery of tax with Inland Revenue’s resources and the financial position of the customer.²² Options currently available for debts include: • exercising a discretion to write off the tax if it is under the $20 threshold);²³ • issuing a “notice to deduct” to a third party payer (such as the customer’s employer or bank) requiring them to deduct the debit amount from payments to the customer;²⁴ • setting up an instalment arrangement for the customer to pay the amount owing;²⁵ and • if the amount cannot be recovered or in cases of serious hardship, writing it off.²⁶ ²¹Tax Administration (Direct Credit of GST Refunds) Order 2016, date of enactment 5 December 2016. ²²Tax Administration Act, section 176. ²³Tax Administration Act, section 174AA. ²⁴Tax Administration Act, section 157. ²⁵Tax Administration Act, section 177B. ²⁶Tax Administration Act, section 177C. 46 As noted in Making Tax Simpler – Proposals for Modernising the Tax Administration Act, there are inevitably going to be situations when either the individual or Inland Revenue will seek to amend or correct the initial assessment. Correcting tax positions is an integral part of tax administration, and will continue to be so under the modernised tax administration system. That discussion document outlined the assessment and amended assessment rules and how they apply generally. Those rules will apply in relation to the proposals in this discussion document. Under current law, Inland Revenue is able to issue an electronic default assessment when a person has not filed a return. The assessment should be based on the information Inland Revenue holds and reflect what Inland Revenue thinks the person’s liability is. When an electronic default assessment is issued, the liability is subject to use-of-money interest and late payment penalties from the original due date. When the person files a return in response, seeking to amend the electronic default assessment, the current practice is to accept the request for amendment, and make an amended assessment based on the return filed. The person is given a new due date for the payment of the tax assessed under section 142A of the Tax Administration Act before late payment penalties are imposed.²⁷ The Government proposes to clarify that a return filed following the issue of an electronic default assessment will be treated as a request for Inland Revenue to use the discretion to amend the assessment to ensure that the assessment is correct. If a person wishes to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) in response to an electronic default assessment, they will continue to be able to do so but not simply through filing a return. The Government proposes to clarify that a return filed following the issue of an electronic default assessment will be treated as a request for Inland Revenue to use the discretion to amend the assessment to ensure that the assessment is correct. ²⁷The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes a change to the setting of a new due date for amendments to electronic default assessments. The change proposes that the due date for all default assessments and any amendments to a default assessment will be the original due date for the tax that is subject to the default assessment. CHAPTER 6 AFTER THE END OF THE TAX YEAR 47
Do you receive income from only salary and wages or interest and dividends? The Government would like your views on changes it is proposing to make your income tax simpler, and more certain. Most individuals would not have to provide information. More proposals would make the administration of income tax fairer, simpler and more efficient for individuals. The Making Tax Simpler discussion document continues the Government’s focus on modernising our tax system and making tax easier and simpler. The proposals build on the benefits that individuals will already receive through earlier changes the Government is planning for the administration of employment and investment income. The Better administration of Individuals’ income tax discussion document focuses on proposals that would make individuals’ income tax obligations simpler and more certain. The Government wants to improve the way Inland Revenue uses the information it collects to help individuals get their tax obligations right both during and at the end of the tax year. It also wants to make it easier for individuals to access information and know where they stand. The main proposal is that individuals who receive only income, like salary and wages, or interest and dividends, that is reported and has tax withheld by third parties would no longer have to provide year-end income information to Inland Revenue or file tax returns. For these individuals Inland Revenue would use the information it receives from third parties like employers and banks and automatically calculate and issue refunds or amounts of tax to pay. It would also be easier for people to correct information Inland Revenue holds about them or to provide additional information. Other proposals in the discussion document the Government would like your views on include: • setting the threshold level above which debts are issued and refunds are made automatically (currently there is a threshold of $5 for refunds and $20 for tax to pay) • helping individuals to use the most appropriate tax codes during the year • improving administration of special tax codes and secondary tax codes • allowing individuals to provide details during the year about donations they have made • claiming donations tax credits through the income tax return process and • requiring Inland Revenue to make all income tax refunds through direct credit. This is your opportunity to tell the Government what you think of these proposals. Please consider the proposals set out here and go online to give us your feedback. By helping the Government to shape the future of the tax system you can make a difference. makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz BETTER ADMINISTRATION OF INDIVIDUALS’ INCOME TAX MAKING TAX SIMPLER Have your say at: individuals.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz You can have your say until Friday 28 July 2017 Liam gets wages from his job and dividends from a utility company Sarah has a main and a part-time job Liam is an employee earning wages. His employer deducts PAYE every week when Liam is paid. Liam also gets dividends from a utility company each year on which the company pays tax. According to his level of income Liam is taxed on his wages at a rate below the top tax rate. The utility company, however, has to pay tax on any dividends at the top tax rate. Because of this too much tax has been withheld on Liam’s behalf. To claim a tax refund, Liam has to file an income tax return at the end of the tax year. He needs to include information about the dividends received during the year. What if at the end of the income year a tax refund went into his bank account without Liam having to do anything? Liam’s employer would tell Inland Revenue about what they pay Liam and the PAYE they deduct whenever they pay him. The company would provide Inland Revenue with information about the dividends they pay and the related tax during the tax year. At the end of the tax year Inland Revenue would consider all this information it already holds about Liam’s income from his wages and dividends. It has no reason to believe that Liam needs to provide any information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue calculates Liam’s tax liability and it would issue a refund to Liam’s bank account. Sarah has two jobs. She is using the M tax code for her main job and the secondary tax code SH for her secondary job. Because of her particular situation (the income from her second job takes her total income over a tax threshold) she is being overtaxed on a portion of her income during the year. That means she has less money during the year and has to wait for the end of the tax year before she can claim a refund of the overpaid tax. If Sarah knows she is being overtaxed, she could currently fill in a paper form and apply for a special tax code so she is taxed more accurately during the year. If she does this Inland Revenue sends her a certificate that Sarah needs to give her employer. What if Inland Revenue noticed (because it receives more detailed and timely information from Sarah’s employers) that Sarah is likely to be better off using a special tax code than a secondary tax code? What if Inland Revenue contacts Sarah and suggests she could use a special tax code and explains the difference that would make for Sarah? What if Sarah could apply for a special tax code online if she wanted to? Inland Revenue would notify her second employer directly to use the special tax code rather than the secondary tax code. Go to individuals.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz to have your say. These proposals would require changes to the law. If the proposals are passed by Parliament, Inland Revenue will provide information about the changes in plenty of time before they happen. Consultation is open until Friday 28 July 2017. HAVE YOUR SAY The examples on this page show how the Government’s proposals could make income tax simpler and more certain for individuals.
