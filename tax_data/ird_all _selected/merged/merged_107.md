CRYPTOASSETS Issue: Create a token classification framework Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We believe there should be a framework that deems cryptoassets to be taxed in accordance with current tax rules depending on their characteristics. Accordingly, coins in the nature of equity should be treated as equity, while those in the nature of debt should be treated as debt instruments. The changes proposed in this Bill will allow the law to take a step in that direction. Comment Officials note that they have worked closely with the submitter throughout development of these proposals, and we are aware their ultimate preference would be for a token classification framework such as they have described. Officials consider that adopting a comprehensive framework, such as the token classification framework suggested by the submitter, would be too complex and instead prefer the approach taken by the proposals in this Bill. This approach is to identify the most obvious areas that create unintended policy outcomes or uncertainty for taxpayers in the taxation of cryptoassets (GST and the financial arrangements rules) and provide clarity in those areas. Officials consider the token classification framework approach to be too complex for the following reasons: • Compliance costs: There are over 15,000 cryptoassets and for taxpayers to work out which category applied to each individual asset and treat it accordingly would result in considerable compliance costs. The investor profile of a typical cryptoasset holder is a taxpayer who is often less sophisticated in tax matters and operates on a small scale with holdings that are usually quite small. It follows that working out the classification for each individual cryptoasset would impose undue and significant compliance costs on such taxpayers. • Nature of cryptoassets: Cryptoassets do not fit neatly into existing categories of law. For example, a cryptoasset may be deemed to be a share. However, if, unlike a typical share, it does not provide an interest in a foreign company, it would be taxed very differently to other foreign equity investments (which would often be subject to the foreign investment fund rules). Cryptoassets can also change categories over time, or a cryptoasset could be a hybrid between multiple categories. These things would make it harder to apply a classification approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 Issue: Introduce simplified method for returning taxable income Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We also recommend that the Government introduce an optional simplified method for returning taxable income. Many find it difficult to track trades over time. One solution would be to allow taxpayers to pay tax on an unrealised basis year on year. One of the simplified methods in the foreign investment fund rules (such as the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods) could be used as a template for this. Comment Officials agree it is important to simplify income tax compliance and record keeping for cryptoassets. Officials note that cryptoassets are traded much more frequently, and by a larger number of retail investors, than typical investment products (such as shares or property). We recognise that taxing cryptoassets on disposal is complex. Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission. However, any further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for retrospective application Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We do not generally believe that legislation should be backdated. However, in this case the amendments are either to clarify the law or to bring it in line with existing practice. We agree that in this situation it is appropriate the amendments are backdated. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 21 DEFINITION OF CRYPTOASSET Clause 5(2) and 127(2) Issue: Support for wide definition Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the inclusion of a wide definition of cryptoasset that will encompass almost all cryptoassets except non -fungible tokens. We agree that this is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Cryptoassets should be defined as currency Submission (Deloitte) Cryptoassets should be defined as currency, rather than being excluded from the definitions of “goods” and “service” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). The submitter’s view is that the approach proposed in the Bill brings into doubt the GST treatment of “wraparound services” supplied in connection with cryptoassets (such as brokering and commission). Comment Under current law, the types of services referred to by the submitter (such as brokering and commission) are exempt financial services. The problem raised by the submitter is that it is not clear whether brokerage services that apply specifically to cryptoassets are also exempt financial services. This is because the definition of “financial services” in the GST Act includes “currency”, and the definition of “currency” does not include a cryptoasset. This means that brokerage services provided for cryptoassets are currently subject to GST, and this treatment is not consistent with share or currency brokering services, which would be exempt financial services. Officials agree with the submitter that brokerage services provided for cryptoassets should not be subject to GST, but we do not agree that defining cryptoassets as currency is the best way to achieve this objective. This is because cryptoassets are much more like property than they are a currency and including cryptoassets in the definition of “currency” could result in taxpayers confusing cryptoassets with legal tender – which they are not. Point of difference Officials propose that a separate amendment is made to provide that brokering, commission and related services provided in relation to cryptoassets are not subject to GST. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 22 Issue: Fungibility component of the definition of cryptoasset Submission (New Zealand Law Society) In the definition of “cryptoasset”, the wording “is designed to be fungible” in the second limb of the definition could be improved. “Designed” implies intent, which is difficult to measure and limited to a point in time. Further, fungibility is not an absolute term. This wording leaves the GST treatment uncertain for cryptoassets that are semi-fungible, change in nature over different points of their lifecycle, or differ in practice from the initial intent at the point of “design”. It is expected that these issues will be exacerbated as cryptoassets continue to evolve and the boundaries of fungibility become increasingly blurred. Comment The purpose of including a fungibility requirement in the cryptoasset definition was to carve non-fungible tokens out of the definition so they would remain subject to GST. Officials agree with the submitter’s proposal that a fungibility requirement can potentially be problematic and ambiguous. Point of difference However, officials recommend the fungibility requirement be removed from the cryptoasset definition and a definition of “non-fungible tokens” be inserted instead. Non-fungible tokens will be explicitly excluded from the definition of “cryptoasset”. This approach avoids the complexities of having to define fungibility, particularly as cryptoassets are an emerging industry and constantly evolving. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Fungibility requirement too simplistic Submission (PwC) The proposal that tokens are inside or outside of the GST net based on whether they were designed to have the characteristic of “fungibility” may be too simplistic. This is because the assumption underlying this distinction is that tokens designed to be fungible are designed to function primarily as a store of value and/or as a medium of exchange (that is, like money). The submitter stated that fungible tokens exist that allow holders to obtain goods and services without having to spend them. The submitter also cited examples of instances where fungible tokens are issued for accessing products or benefits. In such situations, the tokens are designed to be fungible, but also function in a manner analogous to a club membership. Therefore, to the extent the supply of these tokens is for consideration, such tokens should be subject to GST (adopting a broad base/minimal exemptions approach). Comment The policy intent behind these changes is that cryptoassets should not be subject to GST. However, where goods and services are purchased with cryptoassets, they should generally be subject to GST. There are some exceptions to this, such as with financial services, which are an exempt supply. 23 Officials acknowledge the submitter’s concern that tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services without redeeming the token are a threat to the GST base as they may avoid the application of GST on the purchase of goods and services. On the face of it, these tokens should be made subject to GST on purchase. However, a complicating factor is that the primary purpose of the token may be to act as a store of value. For example, if a token similar to Bitcoin also provided access to a good or service by virtue of holding it, making that token subject to GST on purchase would also tax the ‘store of value’ component and result in significant GST compliance costs if it was traded regularly. Officials consider cryptoasset tokens that provide users with goods or services with no requirement to redeem the token are currently edge cases. Therefore, officials do not recommend legislating for this issue at this stage. Officials will continue to monitor these situations as they arise and as the cryptoasset market continues to develop, and we will issue guidance or recommend legislative change when it becomes necessary. Existing case law can be relied on to determine the nature of a supply for GST purposes, and this will protect the GST base if users try to defeat the application of GST through such means. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 EXCLUDING CRYPTOASSETS FROM GST Clauses 5(2) and (3) Issue: Support for proposals Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society) We support the proposals to exclude cryptoassets from GST. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 25 INPUT CREDITS FOR CAPITAL RAISING Clause 22 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the proposed amendment to allow GST-registered businesses that raise funds by issuing cryptoassets with features similar to debt or equity securities to claim input tax credits on their capital-raising costs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 26 EXCLUDING CRYPTOASSETS FROM THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS RULES Clause 79 Issue: Support for proposals Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Russell McVeagh) We welcome the proposed clarification to exclude cryptoassets from the financial arrangements rules. We support the proposal that cryptoassets that are economically equivalent to debt arrangements should remain subject to these rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Impact on PIEs of excluding cryptoassets from financial arrangements rules Submission (EY) Although we support the proposals to exclude cryptoassets from the financial arrangements rules, officials should consider the impact that this proposal has on the ability of portfolio investment entities (PIEs) to invest into cryptoassets. Specifically, whether PIEs should be able to invest in cryptoassets in an unrestricted manner and whether that should be the case for all types of cryptoassets, including those that more closely resemble “money”. Currently, most sophisticated cryptoassets fall outside the scope of the financial arrangements rules as they do not represent an arrangement where money is received for money provided. While some cryptoassets do possess functionality that could be construed as a debt arrangement, the generally accepted position is that an individual cryptoasset is not itself a financial arrangement and is more akin to property. We understand the proposed amendment is meant to formalise this industry understanding. However, this conclusion has flow on impacts for the PIE rules. Under section HM 11, a PIE must have 90% of the value of its assets in land interests, financial arrangements, excepted financial arrangements, or a right or option for any of these interests. As such, a PIE is not eligible to invest in cryptoassets as they are not considered a financial arrangement or an excepted financial arrangement. With the inclusion of cryptoassets as excepted financial arrangements under the proposed amendment, PIEs would be eligible to invest in these forms of assets on an unrestricted basis. In effect, it would be possible for a PIE that held exclusively Bitcoin to be established, with the investors gaining the benefit of the prescribed investor rates (PIR). With the current difference between PIR and top personal tax rates, this could create a strong incentive to establish a cryptoasset PIE. 27 Comment As part of the changes introduced in the Bill, it is intended that cryptoassets should have a similar tax treatment to other investment products or asset classes that are close substitutes for the cryptoasset. It is not intended that cryptoassets would receive a concessionary tax treatment or be disadvantaged in any way compared to other investment products. Officials are therefore comfortable with the outcome that a PIE can invest in a cryptoasset on an unrestricted basis. This will ensure the law does not bias investment decisions away from cryptoassets when compared to other investment products, such as shares. Further, officials note there are already foreign exchange traded funds that hold Bitcoin or other cryptoassets that New Zealand investors can invest into (although these are subject to tax under the foreign investment fund rules rather than the PIE rules). Officials will ensure this consequence of the proposed changes is included in the Tax Information Bulletin released following enactment of the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Derivatives over cryptoassets Submission (EY) We submit that it would be prudent for the rules to clarify the tax treatment of derivatives applicable to cryptoassets. Specifically, whether derivatives over cryptoassets should also be treated as excepted financial arrangements. Comment Officials agree with the submitter that the tax treatment of derivatives applicable to cryptoassets should be made explicit in the legislation. To not bias investment decisions across investment products, officials consider that derivatives over cryptoassets should receive the same treatment as derivatives over shares, which are a broadly equivalent asset. This means that futures over cryptoassets would be subject to the financial arrangements rules, whereas options over cryptoassets would be excepted financial arrangements. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should also be amended to clarify that the provision of futures and other financial options over cryptoassets is a financial service. Additionally, officials consider that the application of the financial arrangements rules over derivatives generally is worth further consideration. However, further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 28 Issue: Drafting issue Submission (PwC) The language in proposed section EW 5(3BAB) is ambiguous and should be clarified. The current language would lead to inappropriate outcomes in the following situations: • A cryptoasset that functions in a similar manner to a share could fall within the scope of section EW 5(3BAB) because the return to a holder is calculated by reference to the number of tokens held and on a basis that is known in advance (that is, the profitability of the underlying business). • A token that functions in an economically equivalent manner to debt would fall outside the scope of section EW 5(3BAB) (and therefore be treated as an excepted financial arrangement) if it was disposed of before any return being received by a holder. Proposed section EW 5(3BAB) should be amended to read: “A cryptoasset is not an excepted financial arrangement if a consequence of ownership of the cryptoasset is that the owner receives or is entitled to receive, during the period of ownership, amounts that are determined by reference to the quantity or value of the cryptoasset and on a basis that is known by the owner in advance (other than amounts determined by reference to the profitability of a business).” Comment Officials agree and will refer the matter to the drafter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 29 GST – ABILITY TO AGREE APPORTIONMENT METHOD WITH INLAND REVENUE Clauses 21(5) and 23(2) Issue: General support for proposed amendments Submission (Bruce Lay, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, The Retirement Villages Association of New Zealand Inc) Submitters support the proposal to remove the $24 million turnover threshold for agreeing an apportionment method with the Commissioner. It is a sensible measure that will help reduce compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 30 GST – DISPOSAL OF ASSET WITH TAXABLE AND NON-TAXABLE USE Clauses 7(4) and 25 Issue: Support for proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We fully support the proposals to remove the cap that limits the final adjustment to the GST paid on acquisition and to retain a cap on persons whose taxable activity is supplying land (that is, property developers). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Proposed cap should better target property developers Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section 21F(6) should be redrafted to clarify that the cap on input tax deductions applies to property developers who are not using the land to conduct another type of taxable activity. Registered persons who are not ordinarily considered property developers will be caught under proposed section 21F(6), and this contradicts the stated policy intent of the provision. The cap could be targeted by simply referring to a registered person who carries on a business of developing land. Language, such as that used in section CB 10(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007, could be used to ensure the provision is drafted to achieve the stated purpose. Comment Officials agree the drafting of the proposed amendment could be better targeted at property developers and will refer this to the drafters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of section 21F to depreciating assets Submission (Bruce Lay) Where proposed new section 21F(6) does not apply, section 21F will apply to an asset that has depreciated rather than appreciated in value. Presumably that was not the intended result. 31 Comment Both the current section 21F and the proposed section, as amended by the Bill, would not limit the final adjustment available to a registered person on disposal of an asset if the asset has depreciated in value. For depreciating assets, the adjustment provided under section 21F achieves an appropriate policy result as the net GST returned on disposal of the asset will be equal to the taxable proportion of the asset’s use. For example, a GST-registered business purchases a vehicle for $57,500. Ninety percent of its use is taxable, and ten percent is private use by the business owner. After two years, the business sells the car for $46,000. The business is required to return $6,000 as output tax, but it can claim an adjustment of $600 under section 21F. As such, the net GST the business returns on disposal of the car is $5,400 (90 percent of the $6,000 of output tax). This recognises that ten percent of the use of the car was non-taxable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Repeal of section 5(18) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Jim Gordon Tax Limited) We do not support the proposal to repeal section 5(18). Given the use of the provision is still widespread, we do not believe that the provision should be repealed without full public consultation. If it is to be repealed it should be done as part of an overall review of the GST apportionment rules. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The repeal of section 5(18) should be deferred so that it can be considered together with a tax policy response to the issue of the disposal of a dwelling. (Jim Gordon Tax Limited) We support the proposal of clause 7(4) to repeal section 5(18). However, such a change should have been discussed in the Commentary to the Bill, so that it was clear why the change is being made. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment Officials note both the support and the opposition to the repeal of section 5(18). It is also acknowledged that all submitters considered there should have been more consultation or explanation provided on the reason for the change. Officials note the proposed repeal of section 5(18) was publicly consulted on in the apportionment chapter of the February 2020 GST policy issues officials’ issues paper. Currently under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act), both section 5(18) and section 21F can apply when a registered person sells a dwelling that they have partly used to make taxable supplies (such as for business premises or supplying commercial accommodation to guests) and partly used privately (such as for owner-occupation) or to make exempt supplies (such as for a residential tenancy). Section 5(18) operates by limiting the output tax liability to the extent that the dwelling is used to make taxable supplies. Section 21F operates by allowing an additional input tax deduction (final adjustment) that reflects the non-taxable use of the dwelling. 32 The proposed amendment to section 21F removes the cap that limits the final adjustment to the GST paid on acquisition (other than for property developers who have a taxable activity that includes developing the land being sold). As a result, a registered person who applied section 21F would return the same net GST on sale as they would from applying section 5(18). The proposed amendment does this by allowing a larger input tax deduction for the vendor (rather than limiting the output tax charged). Officials consider that this is a better mechanism than limiting the output tax charged, as it only affects the GST position of the vendor and not the purchaser. Furthermore, section 5(18) is a targeted rule that has much more limited application than the general rule in section 21F, which applies to all goods and services (including but not limited to dwellings) that have some taxable and non-taxable use. Section 5(18) only applies to certain dwellings for which a person claimed a partial input tax deduction at the time the dwelling was acquired (as opposed to a taxable use that began after the dwelling was acquired). Also, the definition of “dwelling” in the GST Act requires the dwelling be a principal place of residence for which the person has quiet enjoyment and not a commercial dwelling – this excludes some houses, such as holiday homes. Consequently, a further proposed amendment repeals section 5(18), as the provision would become redundant following the proposed change to section 21F. Retaining both provisions would create an overlap that could increase complexity and result in unintended consequences. Officials consider it is best to repeal the specific rule in section 5(18) to remove the overlap with the more general rule in section 21F. The above explanation will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment to ensure it is clear why the consequential amendment was made. We acknowledge submitters’ concerns regarding how GST should apply to the disposal of dwellings that are used by registered persons for both taxable and non-taxable use. However, a policy response to this issue would require further public consultation to ensure any resulting options adequately address the issue and do not create unintended consequences. Further work on this issue would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Wider review of apportionment rules required Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, PwC) We consider a more general review of the apportionment rules is needed. The review should improve coherence and readability and consider the output tax position of assets used partly for taxable and non-taxable purposes. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised by submitters. Subject to other Government priorities, officials intend to consult on some policy options for reforming and simplifying the GST apportionment rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 33 DOMESTIC TRANSPORT SERVICES SUPPLIED AS PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT OF GOODS Clause 11 Issue: Support for the proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Federation of New Zealand Inc, Deloitte, EY, PwC, Russell McVeagh) Submitters supported the proposed amendment that seeks to expand the existing GST treatment of domestic transport services to consider subcontracting arrangements, simplifying GST compliance for domestic transport suppliers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarify when domestic transport services have been supplied Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should include a prescriptive definition of when domestic transport services have been supplied as part of the international transport of goods. Comment Officials acknowledge that further certainty would be beneficial to ensure the provision is easily understood and correctly applied by taxpayers. Officials have reservations about including a prescriptive definition in primary legislation, as an overly prescriptive definition may result in otherwise legitimate transport services being excluded from the proposed zero-rated treatment. As well, it would be undesirable for a definition to impact on industry terms or methodologies, or new delivery technology. Point of difference Consequently, officials propose to provide guidance and examples in the Tax Information Bulletin. In addition, it is anticipated that the response to “Issue: Clarify that a separate supply of domestic transport services should be zero-rated” below will provide further certainty to the rules and assist taxpayers in correctly identifying when a given transport service should be zero-rated. The policy intent of the proposed amendments is to ensure the zero-rated treatment will apply to the transport of goods from their place of origin in New Zealand to their last place in New Zealand before export, and likewise for imported goods, from the first place in New Zealand after importation to their ultimate destination in New Zealand. The existing documentation that contains the ultimate destination of the goods (such as the Bill of lading 34 or Airway bills) can be used to identify when the goods are in transport, and therefore the underlying transport service can be zero-rated. Officials intend to monitor the effectiveness of the proposed amendments to ensure they are delivering on the policy intent, including regular consultation with affected stakeholders. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Clarify that a separate supply of domestic transport services should be zero-rated Submission (PwC) The drafting should clarify that the separate supply of domestic transport services by a subcontractor to a main supplier (who has contracted to deliver international transport including a domestic leg) should be zero-rated. Comment As noted in “Issue: Clarify when domestic transport services have been supplied” above, officials acknowledge that further certainty on the proposed amendments would be of benefit to submitters. Officials recommend the proposed amendment is modified to make it clear that domestic transport services for goods, where those transport services involve moving the goods along their pre-arranged journey from point A in New Zealand to point B outside New Zealand (or vice versa), also includes transport services provided by way of a subcontract arrangement (either from the main transport provider or a subcontractor). Therefore, these subcontracted transport services should also be zero-rated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ancillary transport services Submission (Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Federation of New Zealand Inc, EY) The guidance for ancillary transport services should be updated and include other freight- associated ancillary services (such as port service charges and de-hire fees). Comment Currently, operational guidance to establish which services are “ancillary transport services” was last prepared by Inland Revenue in 2008 and issued to industry representatives at that time. 35 Officials acknowledge the time since the operational guidance was last prepared and that certain fees and charges may not be clearly subject to the zero-rated treatment. It is important the guidance reflects modern commercial practices and emerging technology in the freight industry. Officials will seek to update the 2008 operational guidance, subject to the prioritisation and resourcing of Inland Revenue’s operational guidance work programme. Given the nature of this work, cooperation with both the New Zealand Customs Service and industry representatives will be important in ensuring that any updated guidance reflects the full extent of the fees and charges applied. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 37 Other policy items 39 COVID-19 INFORMATION SHARING – REMOVAL OF TIME LIMIT Clause 173(1) Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Submitter supports the proposed amendment Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Sunset clause time limit should be retained Submission (Russell McVeagh) The sunset clause in clause 23B of schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be retained. As clause 23B is a large discretion allowing the sharing of sensitive revenue information collected by Inland Revenue under its extremely wide information-gathering powers, the sunset clause is an effective and necessary mechanism to keep users of public power accountable. A sunset clause on this power to disclose sensitive revenue information is appropriate where, given the breadth of the power, regular review is essential. Comment Officials disagree. The sunset clause in the COVID-19 sharing provision provides that the sharing of information can only occur within two years of enactment of the provision (17 March 2020), but that this time limit can be extended by Order in Council. It has now become clear that COVID-19 will be with us for longer than 2 years (past 17 March 2022), and that some forms of government assistance will also need to be administered for longer than two years. For example, applications are now due to close on 31 December 2023 for the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme, and the loans are repayable over five years. Officials have reviewed the COVID-19 sunset period and consider that the two-year period does not add any additional protection beyond that provided by the requirement for sharing to occur only for COVID-19-related measures. The two-year period for the sharing of information was the result of balancing the need for information with the considerations of proportionality and best practice, as promoted by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. This was agreed at the start of the outbreak when quick decisions were needed. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has been consulted and do not take issue with the proposal to remove the two-year period. Having an open-ended time limit on this provision will not remove the limitations on information sharing. They will continue to be tied specifically to the delivery and administration of the relevant COVID-19-related initiatives. The provisions are therefore inherently self-limiting in the powers they provide. 40 The submitter suggested an agency requiring information to administer a COVID-19-related measure should request that information itself. Officials disagree. Requesting information from an individual or business that is available from another agency would impose compliance and administration costs at a time of restrictions or lockdowns when information may be harder for an individual or business to obtain. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: COVID-19 information-sharing provision should not be retained in perpetuity Submission (Deloitte) The information-sharing provision should not apply in perpetuity. While generally supportive of the measures introduced by the Government to assist departments in sharing information when operating COVID-19-related initiatives, the submitter considers an open-ended power provides no incentive to Government departments to complete COVID-19-related work in a timely fashion and means businesses have no certainty as to when reviews will be completed. If the information-sharing ability is extended in perpetuity, the submitter considers Inland Revenue should publish further guidance confirming when the information-sharing abilities can be used and clarifying what “in relation to COVID-19” means. Comment Officials disagree that the removal of the two-year time limit will mean the information- sharing power will go on in perpetuity. Information sharing under this provision will only occur for as long as the administration of the COVID-19-related assistance continues. Regarding certainty of when reviews of the COVID-19 assistance will be completed, the provision of government assistance is ongoing, and the review process is part of each initiative, rather than the information-sharing provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 41 OFFENCES RELATING TO ELECTRONIC SALES SUPPRESSION Clauses 135(3), 160–162 and 165 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the proposal to penalise electronic sales suppression tools. We also support the proposed definition of an electronic sales suppression tool. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Civil penalties not an offence Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The use of the word “offence” in proposed section 141EE(4), which provides for a civil penalty for acquiring or possessing electronic sales suppression tools, is inappropriate. This section deals with civil penalties, not criminal penalties. Comment Officials agree that the word offence should be removed from the proposed section. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Penalty period for possession penalties Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The intended effect of proposed sections 141EE(4) and 143BC(4) is that one penalty is imposable for each period of possession or control of, or right to use, the suppression tool. If there is one or more new periods of possession or control of, or right to use, the suppression tool after the period to which the penalty relates, then fresh penalties may be imposed for those later periods. The present wording of the proposed sections does not achieve this, and they should be reworded. Comment Officials agree with the submitter’s premise that a single penalty is imposable for all tax types and periods but consider that the current wording already achieves this. Further guidance will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin after the legislation is enacted. 42 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Wording of denial of penalty reduction Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It should be clarified that proposed new section 141FB(6), which denies a reduction of penalties for previous behaviour, applies to the penalty under section 141E(1). Comment Officials consider the proposed wording is sufficiently clear and that further changes are not required. Proposed new section 141FB(6) references section 141FB(1), which only applies to penalties imposed under section 141E(1). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Criminal penalty for manufacture or supply of tools Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The criminal penalty for manufacture or supply of electronic sales suppression tools in proposed new section 143BB should include a prison sentence. The offence is essentially supplying devices to enable tax evasion, which is itself a serious offence carrying a penalty of up to five years imprisonment. Criminal law generally regards offences that facilitate an underlying offence as being of equivalent seriousness – for example, money laundering offences typically receive sentences equivalent to the offence for which the proceeds are laundered (for example, drug dealing). By analogy, one would expect a prison sentence for supplying the means to evade taxes. Additionally, it may be expected that many suppliers of sales suppression software would be based overseas. Without a provision for a sentence of imprisonment, the proposed section would have no effective sanction against such overseas suppliers, as a fine levied by a New Zealand court is not generally enforceable in a foreign court. Such a supplier would also not be able to be extradited to New Zealand to face trial, as the offence would not be an “extradition offence” as defined in section 4 of the Extradition Act 1999. Comment Officials do not consider a prison sentence is required. Although the evasion penalty in section 143B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 carries a prison sentence, the penalty in proposed section 143BB carries a higher potential fine (up to $250,000, rather than $50,000) and therefore should not be considered less serious than evasion. No prison sentence is also consistent with the penalties applied in most other comparable countries with sales suppression penalties, though there are exceptions. 43 Officials acknowledge the potential difficulty in applying this penalty to a non-resident. This has also been acknowledged by revenue authorities in comparable countries applying their own sales suppression penalties. In practice, officials consider a jail sentence that would require extradition would be unlikely to be imposed for manufacture or supply even if it were available. Much of the value in the proposed penalty is likely to come from the deterrent factor, which applies equally well with a significant fine rather than a prison sentence. Officials also consider that, in general, a prison sentence should not be introduced solely to allow for extradition. Doing so could create a potential prison sentence for New Zealand residents that may be disproportionate to the offence. Inland Revenue officials have consulted with officials from the Ministry of Justice. They agree with the above assessment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Education campaign on electronic sales suppression Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We recommend that a public education campaign be developed to raise awareness about the criminal nature of sales suppression tools. Comment Inland Revenue periodically runs information campaigns on areas of potential risk. An education campaign on sales suppression tools could be considered as part of Inland Revenue’s normal prioritisation process. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Reconsider regulation if penalties prove ineffective Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We recommend that the use of regulation be reconsidered if it subsequently becomes apparent there is widespread use of these tools, and the penalty regime is not effective in combating the problem. Regulation, including mandated software or EPOS systems, cloud-based software, and mandatory fiscal tills, has been used effectively overseas to combat the spread of electronic sales suppression tools. 44 Comment The intent of the penalty regime is to provide a deterrent to the adoption of electronic sales suppression tools. As there is no evidence of sales suppression being widespread in the New Zealand tax base, officials believe the high compliance costs associated with regulation are unwarranted when a preventative approach is expected to achieve a similar result at a lower cost. Inland Revenue’s operational areas will monitor the success of the regime and the spread (or otherwise) of suppression tools in the tax base as part of their normal work. If the evidence suggests the penalty regime is not effective and the software is spreading in the tax base, officials agree that further work could then be considered. In such a scenario, it may be that a regulatory regime would be the most appropriate response, but officials would consider all the available options. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Definition of electronic sales suppression tool Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed definition of “electronic sales suppression tool” should be amended to include tools that hide or conceal the creation of a record. The Bill, as introduced, defines an “electronic sales suppression tool” as “a \[device or thing\] that can modify, falsify, destroy, or prevent the creation of a record that a person is required under a tax law to make or keep...” (clause 135(3)). This definition is intended to mirror legislative definitions used overseas, particularly in Australia and the United Kingdom. However, these jurisdictions also include devices or things that can hide or conceal the creation of a record required under tax legislation. The lack of explicit language dealing with hiding or concealing a record in the proposed definition means that devices or things that suppress sales records in this way could arguably not be subject to sales suppression penalties, contrary to the policy intent. To correct this, the proposed definition should be amended to include tools that hide or conceal a record. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 45 Issue: Due date for civil penalty Submission (Matter raised by officials) The due date for a payment of a civil penalty for acquisition or possession of an electronic sales suppression tool should be not less than 30 days after the date on which a notice of assessment is issued for the penalty. The due date for shortfall penalty payments is set out in section 142B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 142B(1)(a) provides that the due date for payment of a shortfall penalty where the tax shortfall is an amount of unpaid tax shall be not less than 30 days after the date on which a notice of assessment is issued for the penalty (unless a new due date has been set). Payments of all other shortfall penalties are covered by section 142B(1)(b), which provides that the payment is due on the date the Commissioner notifies the taxpayer is the due date for payment of the penalty. The civil penalty for acquisition or possession of an electronic sales suppression tool is intended to function similarly to other shortfall penalties. This includes the due date for payment of the penalty. However, as the penalty is not calculated with reference to an amount of unpaid tax, the due date for the penalty would currently be determined under section 142(1)(b), rather than section 142(1)(a). An amendment should be introduced clarifying that the due date for payment of the civil penalty for acquisition or possession of an electronic sales suppression tool should be determined according to section 142(1)(a), in line with the policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: No incremental late payment penalty Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be clarified that non-payment of a civil penalty for acquisition or possession of an electronic sales suppression tool does not incur incremental late payment penalties. In the Bill, as introduced, non-payment of the civil penalty for acquisition or possession of an electronic sales suppression tool in proposed new section 141EE would accrue incremental late payment penalties under section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 139B imposes an initial late payment penalty on the day after the due date and the seventh day after the due date where a taxpayer has not paid an amount of tax by the due date. Further incremental late payment penalties are then imposed at monthly intervals on any amount sti ll unpaid. However, section 139B(2B) prevents incremental late payment penalties for specified tax types and periods, including GST, income tax, and civil penalties for the specified tax types and periods. The civil penalty for acquisition or possession of an electronic sales suppression tool is intended to function similarly to other shortfall penalties. However, as the penalty has no relation with a specific tax type or period, it is not currently covered by the exception from incremental late payment penalties for civil penalties in section 139B(2B)(e). This is counter to the policy intent. An amendment should be introduced to ensure that the civil penalty in 46 proposed new section 141EE is covered by the incremental late payment penalty exception in section 139B(2B). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Electronic sales suppression penalty is a shortfall penalty Submission (Matter raised by officials) The electronic sales suppression penalty in proposed section 141EE should operate as a shortfall penalty even though it is not necessarily linked to a tax shortfall. The sales suppression penalty in proposed section 141EE will be a shortfall penalty as defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This was an intentional feature and reflects the close relationship between the evasion penalty and the electronic sales suppression penalty. However, several provisions within the shortfall penalty rules rely on the existence of a tax shortfall. For example, section 141(2) requires the calculation of a tax shortfall each time a taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty. As liability for an electronic sales suppression penalty does not require the suppression tool to be used to reduce tax payable, it is not linked to a specific tax shortfall. Therefore, officials recommend a number of consequential amendments to ensure that the electronic sales suppression shortfall penalty operates as intended despite not being linked to a specific tax shortfall. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 47 LOCAL AUTHORITY TAXATION – DIVIDENDS AND DEDUCTIONS Clauses 54, 55, 58–60, 62, 63, 83, 91, 108, 109 and 116 Issue: Scope and timing of proposals Submissions (Auckland Council, Bay of Plenty Regional Council, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Christchurch City Council, Deloitte, EY, Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd, PwC, Taituarā) Submitters raised concerns that the scope of the proposed changes do not go far enough to create a coherent framework for the taxation of local authorities, and that instead they only address some issues with the current tax rules. An overarching policy project should be undertaken to explore the core principles of how and why the local government sector should be taxed (if at all), as well as the current role of council-controlled organisations (CCOs). Submitters noted that the local government sector is in the midst of a period of considerable disruption due to the Three Waters Reform, the Review into the Future for Local Government, the Resource Management Act reform, and the impact of COVID-19. The Government should avoid piecemeal changes and should undertake a broader review of the policy settings for local government. A broader review could occur either in conjunction with the Review into the Future of Local Government or after the outcome and impact of these wider reforms are known. A multi-staged approach to changes to tax settings for local authorities, rather than a comprehensive review, would add extra burdens and additional compliance costs, and would result in less optimal outcomes and increase the risk of incoherent outcomes in the long term. Comment The proposed measures in the Bill are intended to address specific integrity concerns, a nd officials’ view is that they should not be deferred until a comprehensive review of local authority taxation can be undertaken. Exempting dividends derived by local authorities will improve the simplicity and coherence of local government taxation, and the imputation and corporate gift deduction proposals address existing integrity issues. Both these proposals do not hinge on the wider local government reforms underway. As noted below, officials are recommending that the financing deduction proposals be deferred (see “Issue: Opposition to financing deductions proposals” ). These proposals hinge on the CCO and council-controlled trading organisation (CCTO) definitions in local government legislation. Deferring these proposals will allow officials to consider the CCO definitions and the financing deduction integrity issues after the impact of the wider local government sector reforms is known. This will remove the risk of introducing measures now that would require further amendments in the short term. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 48 Issue: Impact of proposals Submission (Auckland Council, Christchurch City Council, Deloitte, PwC, Taituarā) Submitters raised concerns that the proposals seem to address concerns relating to a small number of councils but will have significant compliance and economic impacts on all councils. The material impact of the proposed changes on the local government sector would benefit from more in-depth policy consultation. Comment As stated in “Issue: Scope and timing of proposals” above, officials consider that the current proposals are necessary to address several integrity concerns and it is not necessary to wait for a comprehensive review to be undertaken before proceeding with the proposals. However, as noted in the Issue above, we are proposing the deferral of the financing deductions proposals. Withdrawing the financing deductions proposals will significantly reduce the impact of the proposals on the local government sector. The financial impact of preventing local authorities from accessing the corporate gift deduction will also be significantly reduced by the proposal to exempt dividends derived by local authorities (see “Issue: Dividend exemption should be extended” below). Currently, a local authority can only claim a deduction for donations to donee organisations up to their net income. The proposal to exempt dividends will significantly reduce local authorities’ net income, thereby reducing the maximum amount of corporate gift deductions (see “Issue: Opposition to corporate gift deduction proposal” below). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for dividends proposal Submission (Auckland Council, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Christchurch City Council, Christchurch City Holdings Limited, Deloitte, EY, Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd, KPMG, Taituarā) Submitters support the proposal to treat dividends derived by local authorities from wholly- owned CCOs, port companies or energy companies as exempt income. Submitters noted that the proposal will lower compliance costs and should simplify and reduce the cost of undertaking a local government group restructure. One submitter supported this proposal if a complete review of the tax policy settings for local authorities was not being undertaken (see “Issue: Scope and timing of proposals” above). (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Recommendation That the submission be noted. 49 Issue: Dividend exemption should be extended Submission (Auckland Council, Christchurch City Council, Christchurch City Holdings Limited, Deloitte, KPMG, Taituarā) a. Submitters noted that it is not uncommon for council-controlled organisations (CCOs), port companies or energy companies to be owned by multiple local authorities, and that the proposed tax exemption for dividends should be extended to dividends derived by local authorities from partly-owned CCOs, port companies and energy companies. (Auckland Council, Christchurch City Council, Christchurch City Holdings Limited, Deloitte, KPMG, Taituarā) b. Two submitters also argued that the proposed dividend exemption should be further extended to include dividends derived by a local authority-owned CCO from another CCO, port company or energy company. (Christchurch City Holdings Limited, KPMG) Comment a. Officials agree. Under current law, the income derived by a local authority is exempt from income tax except for income derived from a CCO, a port company or an energy company. The purpose of taxing income derived by a local authority from these types of entities is to prevent profit shifting from these taxable entities to exempt local authorities. Without this provision, income from a CCO could be extracted tax-free, for example, by the local authority charging the CCO above-market rental or management fees that would be deductible to the CCO but not taxable to the local authority, due to its tax-exempt status. As a dividend is not a deductible expense of a CCO, there are no profit-shifting concerns with treating dividends from both wholly- and partly-owned CCOs as exempt income of the local authority. Officials recommend that both the current proposal in the Bill and this proposed extension apply to dividends derived by local authorities in the 2022–23 and later income years. b. Officials acknowledge that the proposed extension of the dividend exemption to all dividends derived by local authorities could disadvantage local authorities that choose to use a CCO as a holding company. Under current law, a dividend derived by a holding company CCO from a wholly-owned CCO would be exempt income of the holding company CCO (because of the inter- corporate dividend exemption in section CW 10). However, dividends derived by a holding company CCO from a partly-owned CCO would be taxable to the holding company CCO. 50 Current tax law – dividends derived by CCOs Point of difference Officials agree with the submitter’s proposal to extend the dividend exemption to dividends derived by CCOs with the following adjustment. Dividends derived by a holding company CCO (a CCO wholly-owned by a local authority) from a CCO, port company or energy company with 100% public ownership (that is, local authority and public authority ownership) should be exempt from tax. This would apply to dividends received by a holding company CCO in the 2022–23 and later income years. Dividends derived by a holding company CCO from a CCO with some non-public ownership should remain subject to tax. Exempting these dividends would be an integrity risk and could result in taxable income being streamed to the exempt local authority part-owner and capital gains to the taxable non-public part-owner. That is, this structure could be used to shelter profits from tax. This situation could also result in the streaming of imputation credits to the non-public part-owner. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Opposition to corporate gift deduction proposal Submission (Auckland Council, Bay of Plenty Regional Council, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Christchurch City Council, Deloitte, Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd, PwC, Taituarā) Submitters raised a range of concerns with the proposal to prevent local authorities from accessing the corporate gift deduction. Submitters argued that local authorities should be encouraged as much as any organisation or company to make gifts (outside of their statutory responsibilities) for the betterment of society and that the availability of the corporate gift deduction for local authorities falls within the intent of the law. 51 Local authorities are not wholly tax-exempt and continue to be taxable on income derived from commercial activities from group entities. A local authority should be able to claim a corporate gift deduction up to their level of taxable income, in the same way as any other corporate entity. The corporate gift deduction allows local authorities to direct more funding into the charitable sector than perhaps they would otherwise be able to give. The proposal to exempt dividends from wholly-owned CCOs, port companies and energy companies will effectively remove much of the benefit of the corporate gift deduction for local authorities, without the need to remove it entirely. The exemption of dividends will significantly reduce the assessable income of local authorities and therefore the level of corporate gift deduction they can claim. Comment The corporate gift deduction is an integrity risk for local government taxation. The legislated purpose of local authorities is to promote the social, economic, environmental, and cultural wellbeing of communities. The corporate gift deduction falls within this legislated purpose. Officials consider it is neither intended nor appropriate that the tax system provide a tax subsidy for these statutory purposes. These activities are primarily funded from local authorities’ rating bases – this is exempt income and should not give rise to tax deductions. The corporate gift deduction rule can distort the spending decisions of local authorities by providing a deduction for some donations made by local authorities as part of their ordinary community support function. The tax system should not incentivise a local authority to outsource its community support function to a third party to obtain the corporate gift deduction instead of directly conducting that activity itself (which would not give rise to a deduction). Currently, a local authority can only claim a corporate gift deduction up to its level of net income. Although the proposal to exempt dividends derived by local authorities (see “Issue: Dividend exemption should be extended” above) will reduce local authorities’ assessable income, the corporate gift deduction remains an integrity risk. Continued access to the corporate gift deduction could incentivise local authorities to increase their net income by, for example, charging above-market management fees (which are taxable to the local authority). This would increase the local authority’s net income and, therefore, the amount a local authority could claim for a corporate gift deduction. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Corporate gift deduction and consolidated tax groups Submission (Auckland Council, PwC) Submitters seek confirmation of how the proposed change to the corporate gift deduction will apply when a local authority is part of a consolidated tax group. The proposals do not limit corporate gift deductions for CCOs. If a local authority is a part of a consolidated tax group, it will not impact on the availability of a deduction for the consolidated group if a CCO makes a charitable donation. 52 Comment Officials are not proposing to prevent CCOs within a consolidated group from accessing the corporate gift deduction. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: CCO definition Submission (Auckland Council, Deloitte, EY, PwC, Taituarā) Submitters noted that the definition of a “council-controlled organisation” (CCO) is different in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and the Local Government Act 2002 (LGA). In the ITA, the definition of a CCO includes the LGA definitions of a CCO and a council-controlled trading organisation (CCTO), as well as other specific entities. All these entities are taxable under the ITA. Therefore, by only including CCTOs within the financing deductions proposals, funding for other taxable CCOs is excluded. Submitters consider the definition of a CCO should be carefully reviewed to ensure the draft legislation applies as intended. References to CCOs and CCTOs in the proposals are driven from the definitions in section 6 of the LGA and are not tax concepts. An assumption that all CCTOs are commercial and profit-driven, while CCOs are something less than a CCTO, is too simplistic and incorrectly narrows the deductibility of interest expenditure. Comment Officials agree with submitters that there are outstanding issues with the ITA definition of a CCO, and that the definition should be reviewed carefully. Officials note that wider local government reforms currently underway may also impact on these definitions. As the financing deductions proposals in the Bill hinge on these definitions, officials have recommended withdrawing these proposals (see “Issue: Opposition to financing deductions proposals” below). This will allow officials to undertake further work on the CCO and CCTO definitions once the outcome and impact of these wider reforms are known. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Opposition to financing deductions proposals Submission (Auckland Council, Bay of Plenty Regional Council, Christchurch City Council, Deloitte, EY, PwC, Quayside Holdings Ltd, Taituarā) Submitters raised a range of concerns with the proposals to limit deductions for financing deductions, including that the proposals will increase the taxable income of councils, increase compliance costs, add unfairness and ambiguity to the tax system, result in inappropriate outcomes, and complicate the tax legislation. 53 Comment The financing deductions proposals in the Bill propose to limit a local authority’s deductions for finance costs (including finance costs relating to financial derivatives, such as interest rate hedges) to finance costs incurred: • on loans made to a council-controlled trading organisation (CCTO) • on borrowings to acquire shares in a group company that is a CCTO, and • on base price adjustments for financial arrangements involving CCTOs. The financing deductions proposals hinge on the council-controlled organisation (CCO) and CCTO definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007. There are existing issues with these definitions (see “Issue: CCO definition” above). Wider local government reforms are also currently underway that may impact these definitions. Due to the reliance of these proposals on the CCO and CCTO definitions, officials recommend withdrawing the financing deductions proposals from the Bill. Deferring these proposals will allow officials to consider both the CCO and CCTO definitions and the integrity issues after the impact of the wider local government sector reforms is known. This will remove the risk of introducing measures now that would require further amendments in the short term. Subject to prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme, this will also provide an opportunity to review and consider broader matters in local government taxation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for imputation proposals Submission (Auckland Council, Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd, PwC, Taituarā) There is general support from submitters for the proposed changes to the imputation regime. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Preventing local authorities from converting unused imputation credits to a tax loss Submission (Christchurch City Council, Deloitte, PwC, Taituarā) Some submitters oppose the proposal to prevent local authorities from converting unused imputation credits to a tax loss. Removing the ability to convert unused imputation credits to a tax loss in respect of assessable dividends received by local authorities from non-wholly- 54 owned CCOs would prejudice local authorities compared to all other taxpayers who are able to carry forward a benefit from unused imputation credits. Submitters suggest that extending the dividend exemption to non-wholly-owned CCOs, port companies and energy companies would remove the need for the separate proposal to prevent a local authority from converting unused imputation credits to a tax loss. This would be a simpler approach, and it would achieve the same effect as the proposal and provide more straightforward compliance. (Christchurch City Council, Deloitte) Some submitters consider that this proposal should be limited to imputation credits received from entities within the same group. Losses can only be offset where the group loss offset rules are met. Imputation credits received from non-group council-controlled organisations should be able to be converted to a loss as there is no risk that the resulting loss can be offset against the income of the entity paying the dividend. (PwC, Taituarā) Comment Officials agree that exempting all dividends derived by local authorities would make this imputation proposal unnecessary. Officials have recommended that the exemption should be extended to all dividends derived by local authorities (see “Issue: Dividend exemption should be extended” above). Based on officials’ recommendation to exempt all dividends derived by local authorities, a local authority will only be able to derive exempt dividends. Under current law, any imputation credits attached to an exempt dividend will not give rise to a tax credit for the recipient. The proposal in the Bill was intended to address an integrity risk relating to local authorities’ unused imputation credits being converted to a tax loss. Exempting all dividends derived by local authorities will resolve this integrity risk. Officials recommend withdrawing the proposal to prevent a local authority from converting an imputation credit to a tax loss. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Support for consolidated group ICA proposals Submission (Christchurch City Council, Deloitte) a. Submitters support this proposal and note that the proposed change should simplify compliance for local authorities. b. Submitters note that if all dividends derived by local authorities were tax exempt, then an amendment to prevent a credit arising to a consolidated group imputation credit account (ICA) for imputation credits received by local authorities would not be required. Comment b. Under current law, when a company in a consolidated group receives an imputation credit, a credit arises to the consolidated group’s ICA. The credit arises to the group’s account regardless of whether the dividend was exempt income. 55 As noted in “Issue: Preventing local authorities from converting unused imputation credits to a tax loss” above, if all dividends derived by local authorities are exempt, then a local authority will not receive a tax credit for any imputation credits received. However, this is not the case for consolidated group ICAs. The proposal to prevent a credit arising to a consolidated group’s ICA for any imputation credits received by local authorities maintains the existing policy setting of local authorities not being allowed to maintain their own ICA. Recommendation a. That the submission be noted. b. That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of consolidation group ICA proposals Submission (Christchurch City Council, Deloitte) The proposal to ensure that a credit would not arise to a consolidated group’s imputation credit account (ICA) for imputation credits attached to a dividend derived by a local authority will apply from the 2022–23 income year onwards. Submitters note that, for clarity and ease of tracking in a group’s ICA, it may be warranted to consider making this change have retrospective effect, with a savings provision to the extent a debit ICA balance would otherwise arise from the change so as not to prejudice any groups that had previously relied on this section in good faith when declaring dividends. Comment Officials consider that applying this proposal retrospectively could create unnecessary compliance costs for some local authorities. This proposal is intended to address an integrity measure on a prospective basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Attaching imputation credits to exempt dividends Submission (Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd, PwC, Taituarā) Submitters seek confirmation that there will not be a requirement to attach imputation credits when paying a dividend to a local authority to achieve exempt dividend status. Comment Officials are not proposing a statutory requirement for council-controlled organisations (CCOs) to attach imputation credits to dividends paid to local authorities. However, CCOs may choose to attach imputation credits to dividends they pay to local authorities. 56 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Loss grouping Submission (PwC) Submitter seeks confirmation that officials do not intend to prevent local authorities from offsetting losses against the income of group companies and that a local authority’s historic tax losses will still be able to be carried forward. Comment Officials earlier considered a proposal to prevent local authorities from grouping losses to address integrity issues relating to deductions available to local authorities. Officials do not intend to progress such a proposal. Local authorities can incur genuinely deductible expenditure, and this can give rise to tax losses. Local authorities should be allowed to offset these losses against the income of group companies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 57 FAIR DIVIDEND RATE FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES Clauses 71-78 Issue: General support for proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Superannuation Fund) The submitters broadly support the proposals to amend the rules for hedging of foreign currency movements in Australian non-attributing shares and attributing FDR method interests (FDR FX hedges rules) and agree that the changes should improve the functionality of the rules from a practical perspective. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for new portfolio method Submission (Financial Services Council, KPMG, New Zealand Superannuation Fund) The submitters support the introduction of the new portfolio method for calculating fair dividend rate hedge portions. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Portfolio method should be available to non-daily unit valuers Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, PwC) The submitters consider that the proposed limitation on use of the new portfolio method for calculating FDR hedge portions to daily unit valuers should be removed. Non -daily unit valuers can also have a significant hedging activity and access to the portfolio method would reduce their compliance costs. Instead, the portfolio method should be available to all taxpayers: • with a unit pricing frequency of a month or less (KPMG) • eligible to apply the rules . (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) 58 Comment Officials agree that non-daily unit valuers should have access to the portfolio method as this will reduce their compliance costs. Point of difference Officials consider this should be limited to taxpayers with a unit pricing frequency of a month or less, aligning with the frequency requirement for calculating FDR hedge portions, to ensure that no more than one FDR hedge portion calculation is required per unit pricing period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Portfolio method - period should be aligned to hedging policy period Submission (Financial Services Council, KPMG) The period for calculating FDR hedge portions under the proposed portfolio method will be limited to a maximum of one month. While most hedges will mature monthly this will not always be the case and some taxpayers will have a hedging policy of entering hedges with a period greater than a month. To provide more flexibility, the submitters consider that the rules should allow the period chosen under the portfolio method to match the actual hedging strategy of the fund. Otherwise, where a hedging policy is greater than one month, taxpayers will have different tax outcomes from applying the portfolio method compared with the hedge-by -hedge methods. If a time limit on the portfolio period is required, it could be capped at a quarter. (KPMG) Comment When designing the portfolio method, it was officials’ expectation that there will be hedges that have different FDR hedge portions applying to them over their life. This is due to the FDR hedge portions being reset on a periodic basis, rather than being set at the time the hedge is first entered into. Officials also expect that taxpayers will have different tax outcomes by applying the portfolio method compared to the hedge-by -hedge methods, regardless of how regularly FDR hedge portions are reset. This is because the FDR hedge portion applied to a hedge will be determined on a whole-of -portfolio basis rather than on a hedge-by -hedge basis. Officials’ primary reason for limiting the maximum portfolio period to one month is to balance lowering compliance costs for taxpayers (that is, by having to perform FDR hedge portion cal culations less frequently) with some degree of accuracy in the FDR hedge portions. Officials consider a maximum portfolio period of one month strikes the right balance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 59 Issue: Portfolio method – election to apply the method binding for four years Submission (KPMG) The submitter considers that the requirement to ensure consistency by applying the new portfolio method for a minimum of four years after election is too onerous. To provide flexibility, this requirement should be shortened to 12 months. Comment Officials consider that a consistency requirement is needed to maintain the integrity of the rules and prevent taxpayers from changing between different methods for calculating income from foreign currency hedges to gain a tax advantage. The four-year period was chosen to align with the approach set out in section EX 52A in relation to changing between the annual and periodic methods for calculating FDR income. However, officials agree that this period could be shortened. Points of difference Officials consider that reducing the period to 24 months (rather than 12 months as submitted) will provide adequate balance between flexibility for taxpayers and integrity in the rules. Further, there should be a corresponding restriction on re-electing to apply the portfolio method for 12 months to prevent taxpayers changing between methods for calculating income to gain a tax advantage. To help make the system more flexible, officials consider that the Commissioner should also be allowed to agree to a reduced election and re-election period prospectively when there are genuine commercial reasons that require a change in method for calculating FDR hedge portions. Where the Commissioner agreed, taxpayers would then be able to cease an election to apply the portfolio method within 24 months or re-elect within 12 months. Genuine commercial reasons that warrant a change in method could include where a taxpayer changes service provider and the new service provider only supports one of the methods for calculating FDR hedge portions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments above. Issue: Portfolio method – election of calculation period binding for four years Submission (KPMG) The submitter considers that the four-year consistency requirement for the periodic basis used to calculate the FDR hedge portion under the portfolio method is unduly restrictive. This is because hedging strategies can and will change over time. The periodic consistency requirement should be limited to 12 months. 60 Comment Officials agree. The consistency requirement should apply for an income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification of portfolio method opening values Submission (New Zealand Superannuation Fund) In proposed section EM 5B, the FDR hedge portion is to be calculated at the start of the period, based on closing values for the last day of the previous period. However, the example in the Commentary to the Bill refers to values for the first day of the period. The submitter considers that the appropriate treatment should be clarified. Comment Officials consider that the FDR hedge portion under the portfolio method is intended to be calculated using the opening values for the period. In practice, the opening values are the closing values of the previous period. The example in the Commentary to the Bill is meant to reflect this treatment. Clarification will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin issued by Inland Revenue after the Bill’s enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Introduce a determination-making power Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Financial Services Council, KPMG) The submitters consider that the FDR FX hedges rules are very technical and taxpayers can strike difficulties ensuring they meet the specific requirements. To provide for greater flexibility in the rules, a determination-making power should be introduced to allow taxpayers to come to an agreed application with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This would allow taxpayers’ unique circumstances to be taken into account while also ensuring any proposed methodology is consistent with the policy intent of the rules. Comment Officials disagree that a determination-making power should be introduced. Officials consider that the current proposals, particularly the new portfolio method, will address the issue of taxpayers not being able to apply the rules from a practical perspective. This position is strengthened by the above recommendations to improve the portfolio method (see “Issue: Portfolio method should be available to non-daily unit valuers”, “Issue: Portfolio method – election to apply the method binding for four years”, “Issue: Portfolio method – 61 election of calculation period binding for four years” above). Further, it would be preferable to determine if the current proposals adequately address taxpayers’ concerns before consideration is given to introducing a determination-making power. In addition, determination-making powers can be difficult to apply in practice and require ongoing Inland Revenue resources to administer. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Multiple methodologies/formulas in section EM 5 Submission (KPMG) The submitter considers that, while the modification to the second hedge-by -hedge formula for calculating fair dividend rate (FDR) hedge portions is required, it adds further complexity to an already complex and technical set of rules. Additionally, the inclusion of both hedge- by -hedge methods for calculating FDR hedge portions in section EM 5 can lead to confusion. Therefore, section EM 5 should be modified to clearly separate the two hedge-by -hedge methods. At a minimum, there needs to be clear signposting of the different methods. Comment The proposed amendments to section EM 5 are required to ensure that the second hedge- by -hedge formula for calculating FDR hedge portions works as intended when a taxpayer’s non-eligible assets are fully hedged. However, officials acknowledge that the layout of section EM 5 following the proposed changes could make it difficult to follow. Points of difference Officials consider this issue could be best addressed by changing the legislative wording in section EM 5 from “formula” to “method” and including appropriate signposting in the legislation of the two different hedge-by -hedge methods for calculating FDR hedge portions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments above. Issue: Support for de minimis threshold for non-eligible assets Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Financial Services Council, KPMG) The submitters support the principle of introducing a de minimis threshold for non-eligible assets to ensure that immaterial foreign cash balances do not reduce FDR hedge portions. 62 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: De minimis threshold should be 5% of the market value of the fund Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Financial Services Council) The submitters consider that the de minimis threshold for non-eligible assets should be set at 5% of the market value of the fund, rather than the value of the fund’s eligible assets. This is because foreign cash holdings can fluctuate due to large applications or redemptions with negative implications for FDR hedge portions. Comment The purpose of the de minimis threshold for non-el igible assets is to provide a concession where foreign cash is held for liquidity purposes by a fund that invests in eligible assets, or due to outstanding settlements of eligible assets or dividends derived from eligible assets. Therefore, in officials’ view, it is appropriate to calculate the de minimis threshold based on the value of eligible assets. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Temporary breaches of de minimis threshold should be allowed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Financial Services Council, KPMG) Submitters consider the rules should include an allowance for a temporary breach of the de minimis threshold for non-eligible assets. This is because taxpayers will often temporarily exceed the 5% threshold due to large investor redemptions, significant applications or investment rebalancing. The increase in non-eligible assets held resulting from these events will often only last a few days and will cause taxpayers to breach the de minimis threshold when they occur on or near valuation dates. To address this issue: • The de minimis threshold should be extended to account for circumstances where a taxpayer does not hedge the cash assets and may exceed the 5% threshold for only a short period of time. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • The de minimis threshold should include an allowance for a temporary breach for 2-3 days at any point. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 63 • The de minimis threshold should allow for large investor redemptions where the increase in non-eligible assets (that is, foreign cash) is solely due to an investor redemption across the quarter end. (Financial Services Council) • Breaches that result from an unexpected sudden fall in market values should be allowed to be corrected within a period from where the event has occurred at quarter end. (Financial Services Council) • The de minimis threshold should allow limited breaches for defined events. Alternatively, the de minimis threshold should be applied on a weighted average assets basis over the relevant calculation period. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree that foreign cash held due to investor redemptions, applications, investment rebalancing or dividend payments should be excluded from non-eligible assets to the extent they relate to investment in eligible assets. The de minimis threshold is intended to provide a low compliance cost solution to this problem by allowing foreign cash, with a maximum value of less than 5% of eligible assets, to be excluded from non-eligible assets. Officials note this exclusion applies even if the actual foreign cash balances held equal or exceed 5% of the value of eligible assets, that is, breaches of the threshold do not have a cliff edge effect. Officials consider the 5% threshold strikes the right balance between compliance cost savings and the need for accuracy in non-eligible asset value calculations. Point of difference However, to provide further flexibility, officials recommend introducing an alternative to the 5% de minimis threshold that would allow taxpayers to exclude actual foreign cash balances from non-eligible assets to the extent they relate to eligible assets and FDR hedge portions – for example, foreign cash held due to dividend payments, redemptions, applications and investment rebalancing in connection with eligible assets and foreign cash held for the purpose of settling margin calls in connection with FDR hedge portions. Under this approach, where a taxpayer breached the 5% threshold, they would then have the alternative option of determining the actual value of foreign cash held in connection with eligible assets that should be removed from the quantum of non-eligible assets. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments above. Issue: Support for optional look-through rule Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Financial Services Council, KPMG) The submitters support the proposal to introduce an optional look-through rule to allow funds to include their indirectly held eligible assets in their calculation of eligible assets. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 64 Issue: Optional look-through rule should be extended beyond single inter-funding level structure Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Financial Services Council) The proposed new optional look-through rule allows taxpayers to look through an investment in a multi-rate PIE for the purposes of determining the value of eligible assets. Submitters consider this rule should be broadened to allow taxpayers to look through multiple layers of multi-rate PIEs. Comment Officials agree that broadening the rule in this way is appropriate and consider this will align with the policy intention of the proposal in the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Hedges entered and settled within a valuation period Submission (KPMG) The submitter acknowledges that there is a concern that hedges entered into and settled within a valuation period might avoid a tax liability under both the FDR FX hedges rules and the financial arrangements rules. However, the submitter is concerned it may add further complexity to an already very complex regime. Comment Officials’ view is that the proposed change to the treatment of hedges entered into and settled within a valuation period should proceed. Taxpayers who are non-daily unit valuers can enter into hedges with a term less than their valuation period. While an FDR hedge portion is required to be calculated for these hedges under the current rules, no income or loss is determined because the hedges have no opening value. The relevant hedge portions are also outside the scope of the financial arrangements rules and therefore outside the tax base. The proposed change will ensure that an amount of income (or loss) is calculated for these hedges. Officials consider that this is an appropriate outcome, and any added complexity is appropriate to maintain the integrity of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 Issue: Timing of quarterly FDR hedging ratio test Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Financial Services Council) Under section EM 7, a taxpayer must calculate a quarterly FDR hedging ratio to ensure that their FDR hedge portions for eligible hedges remain appropriate. Submitters consider that requiring this calculation to be performed on the last day of each quarter can increase the chance of the ratio being breached. This is because taxpayers will often rebalance their hedging activity early in the month. Further, performing the calculation on the last day of each quarter is difficult from a practical point of view due to the timing delays for unit pricing and New Zealand time differences with global exchanges. This requirement should be amended so that taxpayers can elect their own date within a quarterly period. This suggested change could be subject to a consistency requirement, so that taxpayers undertake the quarterly testing at the same time in every quarter. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) As an alternative solution, the requirement to reset FDR hedge portions should not apply where the ratio is brought back within the acceptable level within a defined short period, for example, three working days. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment Officials agree. Taxpayers should be allowed to elect their own date within a quarter for performing the quarterly FDR hedging ratio calculation. Point of difference However, this election should be subject to a consistency requirement whereby taxpayers are required to perform the calculation on the same day of each quarter for an income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments above. Issue: Support for amendment of eligible hedge requirements Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Superannuation Fund) Submitters support the amendment to remove the requirement that an eligible hedge must have one leg in New Zealand dollars, provided these hedges are entered into to adjust the hedging position of existing hedges on hand that have one leg in NZD. 66 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (KPMG) Submitter supports the proposal to allow for the transfer of eligible hedges by amending the definition of “eligible hedge”. Submitter supports the amendment to the rules to ensure they work as intended when applied to a hedge of a hedge. Submitter supports the proposal to exclude New Zealand securities listed on foreign exchanges from the definition of non-eligible assets. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Proposals should apply retrospectively Submission (New Zealand Superannuation Fund) The application date for the proposed amendments is currently income years beginning on or after 1 April 2022. Given the rules have been in place for several years, and the amendments largely allow for the rules to work in practice, the submitter considers taxpayers should be allowed to apply the amendments retrospectively for any period not yet finalised at the date of enactment. Comment The FDR FX hedges rules only apply to eligible hedges prospectively once an election to apply the regime to those hedges has been made. This is to ensure taxpayers cannot gain a tax advantage by choosing to apply the rules to historic foreign currency gains or losses on hedges. Officials do not support a retrospective application of the rules for this reason. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 67 Issue: Examples should be removed Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Financial Services Council) The submitters consider that the examples in proposed sections EM 5(10B) and EM 8(b)(i) should be removed and instead be incorporated into appropriate guidance. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting error Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 73 of the Bill contains a minor drafting error. The word “to” should be inserted before “income or expenditure” in the last sentence of the proposed new section EM 4(1). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 68 USE OF TAX POOLING TO SATISFY A BACKDATED TAX LIABILITY Clause 125 Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) Submitters support the proposal to allow taxpayers to satisfy a tax liability arising from a voluntary disclosure where there is no existing assessment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Guidance on “reasonable time” Submission (PwC) Inland Revenue should issue clear guidance as to what the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will set as a “reasonable time”. Comment Further guidance will be published as to what will be considered a “reasonable time” in a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application where no shortfall penalties Submission (PwC) The proposed amendment should be amended so that the use of tax pooling to satisfy a liability arising from a voluntary disclosure where there is no existing assessment is available to taxpayers where no shortfall penalties have been imposed following a voluntary disclosure. Comment Although the imposition of shortfall penalties is a good measure of the taxpayer failing to take reasonable care, officials note that it may be a different measure than failing to take reasonable care for the purposes of this clause. In addition, the Commissioner could use her discretion not to impose shortfall penalties for failure to take reasonable care in certain situations, but the Commissioner exercising this discretion should not automatically allow taxpayers to make use of the proposed amendment. 69 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 70 OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS Issue: Update of charity name Submission (Matter raised by officials) Schedule 32 should refer to Child Rescue Charitable Aid Trust (emphasis added) from 11 August 2017, the date the trustees changed the charity’s name. Destiny Rescue Charitable Aid Trust (the Trust) was granted overseas donee status with effect from 1 April 2016. In 2017, the trustees changed the charity’s name to Child Rescue Charitable Aid Trust. Schedule 32 was updated to reflect the change as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018. However, the word “Aid” was omitted from the relevant amendment. The trustees have asked officials to correct the reference to the Trust’s name. Officials have not identified any administrative or compliance concerns with backdating the reference to the Trust to that date. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 71 Interest limitation 73 GENERAL ISSUES Clause 64E Issue: Support for interest limitation rules Submission (Christopher Buddenhagen, Deborah Pickstone, Jonathan Braniff, Michael Nieuwoudt, Sam Gribben, Sarah Russell, Susie Brown) Submitters support the proposed interest limitation rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Opposition to interest limitation rules Submission (Carol Jopson, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deborah Lomax, Deloitte, EY, Findex, Kiwi Property Group LImited, KPMG, Magan Lal, Michael Fox, nsaTax Limited, Olivershaw Limited, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, Richard Jordan, Sarah Meikle, Simeon Clarke, Terence Denton, The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) Submitters expressed opposition to the proposed interest limitation rules. Many submitters considered the proposed rules to be unfair: • Tax is generally levied on net, rather than gross, income, and interest is a legitimate business expense for landlords, as for other businesses. (Carol Jopson, Deborah Lomax, Michael Fox, Sarah Meikle, Simeon Clarke, Terence Denton) • The proposed rules negatively impact smaller taxpayers but will not significantly affect larger taxpayers. (Simeon Clarke, The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) Submitters also considered the proposed rules were inefficient, and some doubted whether they would have the desired impact of reducing house prices: • The proposed rules will create distortions and inefficiencies. (EY, Findex, KPMG) • The proposed rules discourage saving for retirement. (Terence Denton) • The proposed rules increase the tax risk of investing into New Zealand and send a negative signal to investors. (Magan Lal, Olivershaw Limited) • High house prices were driven by factors other than tax, such as supply. (KPMG, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, Terence Denton) • The proposed rules will not discourage investment into residential property but will merely alter the mix of investors in the sector. Investors will use debt to fund their purchases of new builds and use their equity to buy existing properties. (EY) • High house prices are driven by speculators and the proposed rules target long-term investors rather than speculators. (Magan Lal) 74 • The proposed rules discourage developers from building new houses. (Magan Lal) Comment Officials note the points raised by submitters in opposition to the interest limitation rules. Officials consider that additional taxes on rental housing are unlikely to be an effective way of boosting overall housing affordability. While they would put downward pressure on house prices, they would put upward pressure on rents and may reduce the supply of new housing developments in the longer term. However, officials note that the proposed interest limitation rules are part of a wider package of Government reforms on housing. While the interest limitation rules are focused on the Government’s demand-side housing objectives, the Government has also progressed other measures aimed at increasing the supply of housing in the longer term. Those supply-side measures may offset the impact of the interest limitation rules on housing supply. Overall, officials consider the benefit of increased housing affordability for first-home buyers is outweighed by negative impacts on rents and housing supply, high compliance and administration costs for an estimated 250,000 taxpayers, and the erosion of the coherence of the tax system. Officials’ views are set out in more detail in the Regulatory Impact Statement: Limiting interest deductibility on residential investment property (8 September 2021). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Complexity of the rules Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, Findex, Jim Gordon Tax Limited, KPMG, nsaTax Limited, Olivershaw Limited, Terence Denton) The proposed interest limitation rules are very complex and should be simplified where possible. The complexity of the rules will increase compliance costs. In particular, many taxpayers who will have to apply the rules will not be sophisticated taxpayers and may not use tax advisors. (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, Findex, Olivershaw Limited) The complexity of the rules is going to be difficult to administer for Inland Revenue. (Findex) Some of the complexity in the rules is unnecessary. An example is the overlap with existing provisions such as the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG) The drafting could also be made easier to read and more user-friendly. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, nsaTax Limited) Comment Officials agree the proposed rules are complex and complexity tends to increase compliance costs. However, most taxpayers will not need to deal with most of the complexity. 75 Based on recent return data, around 80 percent of landlords use a tax agent. Taxpayers who do not use a tax agent are likely to be smaller taxpayers with relatively straightforward affairs. Such taxpayers are unlikely to need to understand all the rules. For example, some of the proposed rules apply only to companies, but around 90 percent of the landlords that are companies have a tax agent. The reasons for complexity are: • Some complexity is inevitable and inherent in the proposed rules themselves. For example, the rules apply only to residential properties, but some properties are used for both commercial and residential purposes. • Some complexity is due to the various exemptions and concessions in the rules. For example, rollover relief allows taxpayers to change how property is held without triggering a ‘disposal’ under the bright-line test or losing grandparenting treatment of interest deductions. • Some complexity arises because the rules need to apply to existing loans. For example, taxpayers who had previously used their borrowings for both residential rental and other business purposes will need to work out how much of their borrowings are allocated to residential rental purposes, and this may be complex. • Lastly, some complexity is needed for integrity reasons. For example, interposed entity rules ensure that taxpayers cannot get around the rules by borrowing to acquire residential property indirectly, but most taxpayers will not need to apply these necessarily complex rules. In designing the rules, officials have endeavoured to keep the rules and the drafting simple where possible. Officials are very conscious that the rules will apply to some smaller taxpayers that have limited interaction with the tax system and do not use tax advisors. The drafting of legislation often involves a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. Where submitters have given specific examples of complexity, the point is dealt with separately (for example, the interaction with the existing residential rental loss ring-fencing rules is addressed in “Issue: Repeal of residential rental loss ring-fencing rules” below). Inland Revenue is investing in data and analytics to assist with the administration of the rules and support their integrity. While initially the focus is on providing taxpayers and third parties with clear information and assistance, automated analytic and intervention capabilities will be deployed, with follow-up activity for cases of obvious deliberate non-compliance. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Impact on renters Submission (Carol Jopson, Jonathan Braniff, Kiwi Property Group Limited, Magan Lal, Michael Fox, nsaTax Limited, Olivershaw Limited, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, Richard Jordan, Sarah Meikle, Terence Denton) Submitters considered that the proposed interest limitation rules would negatively impact renters. Several reasons were given: 76 • Some landlords will exit the rental market, which will reduce the supply of rentals and lead to increased rents. (Carol Jopson, Olivershaw Limited, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) • Landlords that remain in the market will pass on their increased costs by increasing rents. (Jonathan Braniff, Kiwi Property Group Limited, Magan Lal, Michael Fox, nsaTax Limited, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, Sarah Meikle, Terence Denton) • Landlords will prefer new builds, which will come with significantly higher rental. Renters who are not in the position, or do not want, to buy a home will generally not be able to afford the higher rental. (Olivershaw Limited) • The proposed rules would discourage landlords from upgrading and renovating their properties. (Magan Lal) Comment As noted in “Issue: Opposition to interest limitation rules” above, officials agree that the interest limitation rules will put upward pressure on rents. Officials consider that, in the long run, affordability for renters will not be promoted by taxing the provision of rental properties by landlords more heavily. In the immediate term, property investors are constrained in their ability to increase rents in response to the interest limitation changes. This is because rents can only be increased once every 12 months. After that initial 12-month period, in the short term, it is unlikely that landlords will be able to pass on any significant share of the additional tax costs, but this may not hold in specific circumstances where tenants have limited choice. In the medium to long term, rents may rise in line with any impact on the supply of new build housing. The reduction of interest deductions may lead to fewer investors purchasing property as rental accommodation and may tend to reduce new house building and housing supply in the long run. This decrease of rental accommodation being added to the rental market may lead to increased rent. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Impacts for low- to middle-income landlords Submission (Anglican Financial Care, Terence Denton) Limiting interest deductions would increase a person’s taxable income above what their actual (net) income is, which can have flow-on impacts for taxpayers. For example, it could push them into a higher marginal tax bracket, affect the prescribed investor rate (PIR) used for their KiwiSaver and other investments, and affect their benefit entitlements. These flow-on impacts affect lower income earners more than higher income earners, which makes the proposed rules regressive. (Terence Denton) The rules should be revised to be consistent in terms of their treatment of KiwiSaver taxation for all taxpayers irrespective of property ownership. One option is for net rent to be taxed as 77 a separate income stream, similar to the way portfolio investment entities (PIEs) are currently taxed, with new builds qualifying for a lower PIR. (Terence Denton) Comment Officials agree that limiting interest deductions can have flow-on impacts for a person’s marginal tax rate, PIR, Working for Families (WFF) and other means-tested entitlements. It is also true that these flow-on impacts are likely to be felt more by low- and middle- income landlords than high-income landlords. High-income landlords will typically already be on the highest marginal tax rate and PIR and are less likely to receive means-tested entitlements. Marginal tax rates and PIRs are both determined according to a person’s “taxable income”, as calculated under the Income Tax Act 2007. Officials consider that the flow-on impact on marginal tax rates and PIRs is an inherent and unavoidable consequence of limiting interest deductions. Taking interest expenses into account when determining marginal tax rates and PIRs, even if those expenses were not deductible in calculating a person’s taxable income, would increase the complexity of the rules and be extremely confusing for most taxpayers. Similarly, the limiting of interest deductions has a consequential impact on the amount of WFF entitlements a landlord may be entitled to. WFF entitlements are calculated based on “family scheme income”. Family scheme income is based on a person’s (and their partner’s) “net income”. 1 If a landlord earns rental income or derives a taxable gain on the sale of land (for example, under the bright-line test), that income or gain would be included in their net income and therefore their family scheme income. Limiting interest deductions would therefore increase a landlord’s family scheme income and, consequently, reduce any WFF entitlements they may receive. For the following reasons, officials do not recommend any changes to the proposed interest limitation rules to still allow interest deductions when determining a landlord’s marginal tax rate, PIR or WFF entitlements (family scheme income): • The flow-through impact of the interest limitation rules is inherent in the design of the rules. If interest deductions were still allowed when calculating family scheme income for WFF purposes, it would effectively mean landlords receiving WFF (and other means-tested entitlements) would be compensated for the removal of interest deductibility at the expense of non-landlords receiving WFF (and other means-tested entitlements). This result was not intended. • For WFF entitlements in particular, the number of landlords affected is very small. We estimate approximately 5,600 WFF recipients could potentially be affected by the interest limitation rules once they are fully phased in by 2025. 2 This figure represents around 1.6 percent of all WFF recipients. • It would increase the complexity of the rules and be extremely confusing for taxpayers. In particular, under the interest limitation rules, previously limited interest deductions would be allowed on sale if a landlord’s property is sold for a taxable gain. In such a case, the landlord’s taxable income/family scheme income would be reduced by those interest deductions in the year of sale. However, if those interest deductions had already been taken into account in earlier income years in determining, for example, the person’s WFF entitlements, it would not be appropriate for those deductions to be taken into account again in the year of sale. “Backing out” those deductions in the year of sale would create further complexity. 1 Net income, unlike taxable income, does not take into account any tax losses a person may have. For the purposes of calculating a person’s family scheme income, there may be certain adjustments made to net income. For example, some income that is exempt from tax is nevertheless taken into account in calculating family scheme income. 2 This is a conservative upper estimate based on 2020 tax year data. 78 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (Kiwi Property Group Limited, KPMG, Terence Denton) Several submitters considered the application date should be deferred. A later application date would mean that taxpayers do not have to take tax positions based on rules that have not yet been enacted and are still pending. (Kiwi Property Group Limited, KPMG) A later application date would: • give more time for Inland Revenue, taxpayers and other stakeholders to ready their systems for a smooth transition • al low affected parties to better understand and prepare for the changes to avoid confusion and non-compliance, and • allow tax practitioners to provide timely and accurate advice to their clients. In contrast, a rushed application could lead to unintended consequences. (Kiwi Property Group Limited) Submissions differed in how the application date could be deferred. a. Two submitters suggested deferring the date from 1 October 2021 to 1 April 2022. (Kiwi Property Group Limited, KPMG) b. Alternatively, the application date could be split so that the rules for existing properties acquired before 27 March 2021 would only apply from 1 April 2022, while the rules for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 would still apply from 1 October 2021. (KPMG) Comment Officials note that by the time taxpayers have to take a tax position (that is, by the time they have to file income tax returns or make a provisional tax payment), the rules will have been enacted. For almost all affected taxpayers, the changed rules will affect their income tax year ended 31 March 2022. Taxpayers with a standard balance date will not have to file their income tax return until July 2022. Taxpayers with a tax agent and an extension of time will have until March 2023 to file their return. Taxpayers who pay provisional tax may have an increased residual income tax liability resulting from the proposed changes that they may not have taken into account in their provisional tax calculation. Most of those taxpayers will be able to avoid incurring use of money interest (UOMI) following enactment of the new rules by including the difference in either their third provisional tax payment (due by 7 May 2022) or in their terminal tax date payment due in February or April 2023 (whichever applies to the particular taxpayer). However, officials note that taxpayers who choose to estimate their provisional tax liability, 79 instead of applying the standard uplift, may incur UOMI if they do not factor in the proposed changes and thereby underestimate their increased residual income tax. a. Officials consider there is some merit in the suggestion to defer the application date to 1 April 2022. A later application date would give taxpayers and their advisors more time to familiarise themselves with the new rules. However, the Government has already announced and committed to an application date of 1 October 2021. Inland Revenue has been working towards that application date, so a later application date would make the transition more difficult (rather than easier) for Inland Revenue. There are also other stakeholders, such as software providers and third parties, who have prepared themselves for an application date of 1 October 2021 and may have to rearrange things if the application date were changed. Inland Revenue also plans to run a targeted communication campaign. Initially this will be to raise awareness and ensure taxpayers can access relevant information easily following enactment. Closer to the filing due dates, it will be to educate customers about what they need to do differently when they file their income tax return. Deferring the application date to 1 April 2022 is estimated to have a fiscal cost of around $80m. b. Officials do not consider a split application date for properties acquired before and after 27 March 2021 is justified. There is no reason why taxpayers with properties acquired before 27 March 2021 need more time to become familiar with the rules than taxpayers acquiring property on or after 27 March 2021. A split application date would also add unnecessary complexity. Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be declined. Issue: Permanent grandparenting Submission (Magan Lal, Terence Denton) Interest deductions on all loans drawn before 27 March 2021 for existing residential property investments should be excluded from the proposed interest limitation rules. Excluding all loans drawn down before 27 March 2021 will reduce the unforeseen impact of the proposed rules on retirement planning. (Terence Denton) Comment Officials disagree. The purpose of the proposed interest limitation rules is to reduce investor demand for existing residential properties and increase housing affordability. Permanent grandparenting (that is, excluding loans drawn down before 27 March 2021) will significantly lessen the impact of the proposed rules. It could also be seen as unfair for new property investors, as they would face a higher tax cost than existing investors even if they had the same level of debt and owned the same value of residential property. Permanent grandparenting is also likely to create a “lock-in” effect. Existing investors would have a strong incentive to retain properties acquired using grandparented loans (and not to 80 pay down that debt), 3 which may frustrate the objective of the proposed rules. Permanent grandparenting also tends to create complexity as taxpayers try to maintain grandparenting status for as long as possible. Temporary grandparenting is already proposed for loans drawn down before 27 March 2021. The proposed rules progressively deny interest deductions for grandparented loans from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025, with interest deductions fully limited from 1 April 2025. This will mitigate cash flow concerns for existing investors without creating a strong lock-in effect. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemptions for small investors Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Deborah Lomax, Findex, Kathryn Law, Kelly Moore, Sarah Meikle, Simeon Clarke, Terence Denton) The rules should not apply to taxpayers with gross rental income of less than $30,000. Smaller investors will be hit hardest by additional costs, but they are not the cause of high house prices as they cannot leverage up significantly and outbid first home buyers. They may also not have access to the level of advice necessary to comply with the rules. (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited) The rules should not apply to small “mum and dad” investors generating income for retirement. (Deborah Lomax) The rules should not apply to taxpayers with only one rental property, as they are generating income for retirement. This may mitigate the impact of the rules on renters. Taxpayers with only one rental property may have to either increase their rents to cover the cost of denied interest deductions or sell their properties (which will impact tenants). (Findex, Kathryn Law, Sarah Meikle) The rules should not apply to taxpayers with fewer than three rentals. (Kelly Moore, Simeon Clarke) Comment Officials disagree. The various exemptions suggested by submitters could significantly reduce the effectiveness of the proposed interest limitation rules on housing affordability. The proposed exemptions would also make the rules significantly harder for Inland Revenue to administer and enforce. In addition, officials consider the suggested exemptions would create integrity issues and increase overall complexity, rather than reduce it. As noted above under “Issue: Complexity of the rules”, most small investors would have relatively straightforward affairs and would not need to incur significant compliance costs in applying the rules. It is generally better to 3 Although table loans, under which the loan principal is repaid over time, are most common in New Zealand, there are other loans (for example, interest-only, revolving credit) where the loan principal does not have to be repaid. If permanent grandparenting were allowed, taxpayers would have an incentive to refinance into these other types of loans. 81 lower compliance costs by simplifying rules where possible rather than by providing exemptions that create new boundary issues. If, for example, the rules did not apply to taxpayers with only one rental property, a family with multiple properties could restructure so that properties were owned by different individuals. Issues would also arise with properties held in family trusts or companies. Addressing situations where a taxpayer bought another property or changed their “exempt” property could also be complex. A taxpayer would be incentivised to elect for a more expensive property, or a property they intended to sell outside the bright-line period, to be exempt from the interest limitation rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Total loan cap per taxpayer Submission (Terence Denton) There should be a total loan cap per taxpayer under which interest remains fully deductible. For example, taxpayers with total loans less than $500,000 would not have to apply the proposed interest limitation rules. This would reduce compliance costs for smaller investors. Comment A loan cap would significantly reduce the effectiveness of the interest limitation rules on housing affordability, particularly if it were set at $500,000. A loan cap would also raise many of the same integrity and complexity issues outlined above under “Issue: Exemptions for small investors”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Taxpayers required to live in accommodation connected to their employment Submission (Anglican Financial Care) Persons required to live in accommodation connected to their employment (for example, clergy living in a vicarage) will often acquire a property intending to live in it when they retire and rent the property out in the interim. These persons should not be subject to the interest limitation rules. Comment Officials disagree. A person renting out a residential property is a landlord. Officials do not consider it relevant what type of accommodation that landlord lives in. Landlords living in accommodation connected to their employment are not in a different situation from landlords living in ordinary rental accommodation. Landlords may live in rental accommodation for 82 various reasons (for example, they may be on a secondment for work, or they may not be able to afford a property in the city in which they live). Landlords living in owner-occupied housing are arguably in a different position, but the fact a person is not using one tax exemption (the main home exemption) does not mean they should be allowed another tax exemption. It is also irrelevant whether that person intends to live in that rental property in the future. A person buying a property they intend to live in in the future does not currently get interest deductions under the law unless there is a nexus with assessable income (for example, they rent it out). An exemption based on intention is also very difficult to administer. Officials also note there may be integrity risks if persons who do not live in owner-occupied housing are more generally excluded from the rules. For example, a person may buy a property, rent it out in their child’s name and say that their child intends to live in it in the future. 4 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Partial interest deductions Submissions (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Christopher Buddenhagen, Kathryn Law, Terence Denton) Submitters suggested that only 50 percent of interest deductions should be limited, rather than 100 percent: a. This would better reflect the current position that capital gains on sales are untaxed. (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited) b. This would offset some of the negative impacts of the rules. (Terence Denton) c. This should apply for a taxpayer’s first or only investment property. (Christopher Buddenhagen, Kathryn Law) Comment The proposed interest limitation rules are aimed at reducing investor demand for residential properties and increasing housing affordability. Partially limiting interest deductions would lessen the impact of the proposed rules without reducing any of the complexity or compliance costs. a. Although one reason for limiting deductions is because the interest expense is incurred partly to derive a non-taxable capital gain, the primary reason for the rules is to help achieve the Government’s housing objectives. Officials note that other expenses relating to a residential rental property (for example, holding costs) are fully deductible, even if they are also arguably incurred in part to derive a capital gain. b. Limiting 50 percent of interest deductions would reduce the positive impacts of the rules as well as some of the negative impacts. 4 While the exclusion could be restricted so that it does not apply to minors, the issue can also arise with adult children. 83 c. Limiting 50 percent of interest deductions for a taxpayer’s first or only investment property would give rise to integrity issues and increase the complexity of the rules. The reasons for officials’ views on this are largely the same as those outlined above (see “Issue: Exemptions for small investors” ). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Guidance Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG) Submitters recommended that clear and comprehensive guidance be provided by Inland Revenue to help taxpayers comply with the interest limitation rules. The guidance should illustrate the interaction between the bright-line rules and interest limitation rules. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) There should be clear guidance on how the specific anti-avoidance rules in sections GB 53B and GB 53C may be applied in practice. (KPMG) Comment Inland Revenue will provide guidance and tools, such as guided help, online calculators and ‘how-to’ videos, to help customers work out if the new rules apply to them, whether any exemptions apply, and how to calculate the amounts of interest deductions. The guides and tools will be available online by April 2022 to align with taxpayers beginning to file their tax returns. Inland Revenue will work with tax professionals to get their feedback and input into the tools, products, and services for tax agents and their customers. A targeted education campaign is planned if, and once, the proposed rules are enacted. This will raise awareness of the new rules and educate taxpayers about the changes and what they will need to do differently when they file their income tax return. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Sunset provision Submission (Jim Gordon Tax Limited) The interest limitation rules were originally proposed as an extraordinary response to the unprecedented increases in house prices. If house price increases slow or stop, the rules should be “turned off”, perhaps via an Order in Council or a sunset clause. 84 Comment Officials do not consider a sunset provision would be suitable. Tax law is more complex than situations where sunset provisions have previously been used. It would not be as simple as merely repealing the relevant sections of the Income Tax Act, as transitional issues would need to be addressed. Including a mechanism in the legislation to ‘turn off’ these rules would also create uncertainty for the taxpayers who must apply them. Officials therefore see no benefit in including a sunset provision. If it were later decided the rules were no longer needed, they could be repealed then and legislation enacted to deal with transitional issues. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Review Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Magan Lal) Submitters suggested the effectiveness of the proposed interest limitation rules on increasing housing supply should be reviewed. Submissions differed as to when this review should take place: • Within one year of enactment. (Magan Lal) • Completed before 1 April 2024. By this time, 75 percent of interest will be non-deductible, so it should be evident whether the rules are meeting the intention of enabling more home ownership. (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited) Comment One of the reasons given by submitters for why a full review is warranted was because these rules have been developed outside of the usual generic tax policy process (GTTP), and that this has limited full consideration of the proposals and could result in rules that do not meet their stated objectives and have unintended consequences on both housing affordability and housing supply. Officials disagree. While the GTTP has not been followed in full, there has been considerable consultation with multiple opportunities for the public to make submissions on the rules. The discussion document Design of the interest limitation rule and additional bright-line rules was released on 10 June 2021 and open for public consultation for almost five weeks. While slightly shorter than the standard six-week consultation period, late submissions were also accepted. Almost 500 submissions were received. There has also been targeted stakeholder consultation throughout this process, both before and after the release of the discussion document. There is currently no commitment to a formal review of the rules. However, Inland Revenue will be committing resources to reviewing remedial changes that may be required once the rules are implemented. It should be noted that the objective of the proposed interest limitation rules is to reduce investor demand for existing houses, not increase housing supply. Certain areas of the rules, such as the new build exemption, aim to ensure investment in new builds is not disincentivised, but the rules overall do not aim to increase supply. Further, Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for the monitoring of New Zealand’s housing and urban development system. As 85 part of this role HUD collects and analyses data and research on New Zealand’s housing and urban development system, including measures of housing and rental affordability. Monitoring the precise impact of the proposed interest limitation rules on the housing and urban development system is likely to prove difficult owing to the many varied factors impacting upon that system. In particular, the interest limitation rules will be introduced at a time when there will also be interest rate rises, the reinstatement of the Reserve Bank’s loan-to-value ratio restrictions and the proposed introduction of debt-to-income ratio restrictions. This will make it difficult to specifically attribute any housing market impacts to the interest limitation rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Alternative tax measures for residential property Submissions (Christopher Buddenhagen, Deborah Pickstone, Findex, Jim Gordon Tax Limited, Robyn Dainty, Terence Denton) Submitters considered that in addition to, or instead of, denying interest deductions on residential rental properties, other taxes should be adopted. They suggested a range of taxes and approaches. • A comprehensive capital gains tax. (Christopher Buddenhagen, Deborah Pickstone, Robyn Dainty) • A deemed rate of return, with a ten-year capital gains tax wash-up when a property is sold. (Jim Gordon Tax Limited) • An asset classification regime for non-main home properties requiring taxpayers to declare whether such properties are on capital or revenue account. Capital and revenue account rental properties would both be subject to the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules and tax on sale would only apply to revenue account rental properties. (Findex) • Rental property income should be treated as a separate income stream and taxed at a higher rate, with rental income from new builds taxed at a lower rate. (Terence Denton) Comment Officials acknowledge the matters raised in these submissions but note that they are outside the scope of this Bill. If further work were to be done on these matters, it would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 86 Issue: Non-tax measures for housing Submission (Jonathan Braniff, Robyn Dainty, Sarah Russell) Submitters suggested housing-related measures that should be introduced in addition to, or instead of, the proposed interest limitation rules: • Rent controls to prevent landlords passing on to tenants the cost of interest limitation by increasing rents. (Jonathan Braniff, Robyn Dainty, Sarah Russell) • Minimum occupancy requirements to prevent landlords from renting properties to tenants who do not maximise the occupancy of the properties. For example, a three-bedroom property should only be rented to at least four occupants. (Robyn Dainty) • Banks should be prevented from us ing interest rates that are higher than actual rates to assess mortgage serviceability of borrowers. (Sarah Russell) Comment Officials acknowledge the matters raised in these submissions but note that they are not tax measures and are outside the scope of this Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Purpose statement Submission (EY) There should be a clear purpose statement outlining the intended scope of the proposals to assist courts and advisors in interpreting the rules. Comment Officials disagree. Proposed subpart DH contains a purpose provision – section DH 1. It explains that the purpose of subpart DH is to deny a deduction for certain interest, notwithstanding any other provision in Part D. The details concerning the nature and scope of interest that is subject to denial are specified in the detailed rules in subpart DH. A purpose provision is a general statement, or summary, of the purpose of an Act or part or subpart of an Act. A purpose provision for a subpart is necessarily limited in the extent to which it can provide interpretative guidance on the meaning of the provisions in the subpart. Officials consider that the best interpretative guidance as to the purpose and intended scope of the specific provisions in proposed subpart DH is the detailed wording of the actual provisions themselves. To assist taxpayers and advisers in applying the rules in subpart DH, the Commissioner will publish comprehensive guidance setting out her view on the interpretation and application of the rules (see also “Issue: Guidance” above). If taxpayers are uncertain as to how the rules apply to their specific arrangements, they can apply to the Commissioner for a binding ruling on how the rules apply to their arrangements. 87 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Revenue should be set aside for related housing programmes Submission (Findex) The revenue raised by the interest limitation rules should be set aside (hypothecated) for related Government policy spending, such as Kāinga Ora — Homes and Communities. Applying the revenue to the Government’s general consolidated fund implies that the policy is not wholly directed at housing but is partially a revenue-raising policy. Comment It is not proposed that revenue from limiting interest deductions will be set aside for any specific government spending. Officials recommend against setting aside revenue from the proposed interest limitation rules to fund specific housing programmes for two reasons. First, the taxation measure of limiting interest deductions on money borrowed for residential properties should not be conflated or joined with non-taxation measures to spend on housing programmes. The amounts required for housing programmes may be more or less than the amounts raised by interest limitation. Decisions to spend on specific housing programmes require scrutiny and evaluation against other government priorities (as is the case with any government spending programme). Setting aside revenue from interest limitation to spending on housing programmes may result in reduced scrutiny, evaluation and focus on that spending. Secondly, the revenue from the proposed interest limitation rules will be uncertain, which would make it administratively difficult to set aside the revenue for specific spending programmes. Because previously limited interest deductions will be allowed when the relevant property is sold for a taxable gain (for example, if it is sold within the bright-line period), it cannot be known how much of the revenue generated by the interest limitation policy in a current year will have to be “refunded” in future years when properties are sold. Although attempts could be made to estimate how many debt-funded properties will be sold within the bright-line period, these estimates are unlikely to be accurate. This is because of uncertainty in relation to various factors, including behavioural changes by investors in response to the bright-line extension, changes in house prices and changes in interest rates and inflation. All this uncertainty makes it impracticable to set aside revenue from interest limitation for housing programmes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 88 Issue: Location of definitions Submission (nsaTax Limited) All definitions should be in section YA 1, not subpart DH The 1994 rewrite moved away from self-contained definitions within separate parts and subparts. Proposed subpart DH includes its own set of definitions in section DH 5, which reverts to the pre-rewrite structure of the Income Tax Act. For example, “new build land” is defined in section DH 5. The definition, however, is relevant for both the interest limitation rules (in proposed subpart DH) and for the bright-line rule (in proposed section CB 6A). Comment As a general approach, definitions are placed in section YA 1. However, this approach is not an inflexible rule. For example, sections EE 61 to EE 67 contain definitions of terms used in subpart EE (Depreciation), and section LY 2 contains definitions of key terms used in subpart LY (Research and development credits). The location in section DH 5 of the definitions used in proposed subpart DH is intended to improve the readability of the subpart. In relation to the submitter’s specific concern regarding the location of the definition of “new build land”, officials note that the Bill proposes that this term be inserted into section YA 1, with that definition cross-referring to the detailed definition of the term in section DH 5. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Specific definition of “property” Submission (EY) A specific definition for “property” should be added to improve clarity and provide greater certainty. Comment The term “property” is already widely used in the Income Tax Act 2007 and officials are not aware of concerns with its use more generally. A specific definition for “property” would impact other areas of tax and any proposed definition would need to be consulted on widely. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 89 Issue: Using START to support administrative practices Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The increased functionality and capacity of the START system should be used to support administrative practices and record-keeping requirements imposed by the proposed interest limitation rules to ensure efficiency and streamline the process. Comment Records enable taxpayers to work out their income and expenses and self-assess their tax. Taxpayers are required to keep and retain records of income and expenses for at least seven years after the end of the income year in which they earned the income and claimed a deduction. This is also the case for records on interest expenses. Inland Revenue may check records in an audit. Taxpayers currently provide income and expense information on their income tax return. To allow for the administration of the proposed interest limitation rules, additional key points for total interest on residential rental property, interest expense claimed and any exemption reason, will be added to the income tax returns. Taxpayers can see a record of information they provided, and the income tax returns they filed, in their MyIR account for previous income tax years. START functionality will be used to pre-populate the form taxpayers need to complete for property sales that fall within the bright-line rules with relevant property information Inland Revenue holds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 90 PROPERTY SUBJECT TO INTEREST LIMITATION The aim of the proposed interest limitation rules is to reduce investor demand for residential property in New Zealand by making residential property investment less attractive for investors. Taking this into account, the intent is that the rules should apply to property that is, or could foreseeably be, used for long-term residential accommodation. The proposed rules focus on the functional structure of a building or place and not whether it is actually used to provide long-term accommodation (either as owner-occupied or rental accommodation). The emphasis is on whether the property is of a type that is generally available to the public for residential accommodation. For example, a house or apartment that is let out for short-stay accommodation would be subject to interest limitation. This ensures there is no advantage under the rules for an investor to use their property for short-term, rather than long-term, accommodation. A difference in treatment depending on the type of accommodation provided within a property would create an incentive to convert the property to the advantaged accommodation type. This would impact overall housing supply by reducing the number of properties available for long-term rent or owner-occupation. Broadly speaking, the proposed interest limitation rules provide that land that is, is planned to be, or could be, used for residential accommodation will be subject to interest limitation. Several exceptions from the rules are also proposed, including but not limited to: • business premises • commercial-scale accommodation (such as hotels, motels, and hostels) • accommodation in medical or care facilities, and • certain employee and student accommodation. Several considerations are relevant when determining whether an exception would be appropriate: • Incentives for conversion – Would an exception create incentives for converting existing pr operties to this type? • Barriers to conversion – Can properties be converted to an excepted property type without significant effort and/or expenditure? • Structural configuration – Does the structure of the property support use as a private residence (whether owner-occupied or as residential rental accommodation)? • Regulatory framework and population – Is the property subject to a specific regulatory framework? Are there well-defined rules around who can reside in the property? • Unconditional occupation – Is it possible for a person to occupy the property as a residence indefinitely, or is their occupation conditional on external factors (such as being a student or holding a particular employment position)? The scope of property proposed in the interest limitation rules – both the definition of disallowed residential property and the various exceptions – represents a balance of these factors. In many respects, it follows the scope of property covered by existing regimes in the Income Tax Act 2007 relating to land and residential property, such as the bright-line test and the residential loss ring-fencing rules. However, as the intent of the interest limitation rules differs from these regimes, the scope of property affected by interest limitation also differs in places. 91 DISALLOWED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY DEFINITION Clauses 64E (proposed section DH 5(2)), 127(4B) and (7B), 131B, and schedule 1A Issue: Focus of definition Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We agree the definition of “disallowed residential property” used by the interest limitation rules should focus on property structure or configuration, not use. However, functionally, we believe the definition will lead to boundary issues and should be simplified. Comment Officials welcome the support for the focus of the definition. The complexity of property means that boundary issues are inevitable. The various exceptions proposed in the interest limitation rules are intended to clarify some of these issues and provide taxpayers with certainty around whether their properties are in or out of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Narrow test for bare land Submission (EY) The test for “bare land” should be narrowed. For various reasons, not all land that “may be used” for erecting residences under the relevant operative district plans will be able to be built on. For example, some land lacks accessibility, or is in an inconvenient or under- populated location, which means it is uneconomic to build on even if the council would allow it. We suggest the inclusion of a self-assessment test that looks at whether land was reasonably capable of being built on at the time of acquisition, rather than relying on council district plans as a proxy for development potential. Comment The proposed treatment of bare land in the definition of “disallowed residential property” is consistent with other land rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. It is defined as bare land that may be used for constructing a place of residence or abode under the rules in the relevant operative district plan. Officials consider this definition to be reasonably clear and robust. Other tests would create uncertainty and ambiguity, making it difficult for taxpayers to be confident that they are complying with the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 92 Issue: Support for exclusion of land outside New Zealand Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) We support the proposed exclusion of land and property outside New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Overseas land exclusion will drive investment offshore Submission (Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) We are concerned the exemption for property outside New Zealand will drive property investment offshore, which will reduce the number of properties available for rent in New Zealand. Comment Officials acknowledge the submitter’s concern. However, the aim of the proposed interest limitation rules is to reduce investor demand for residential property in New Zealand by making the tax rules for residential investment property less attractive. The proposed interest limitation rules would not apply to properties outside New Zealand on the basis that investments in such properties have no direct impact on housing in New Zealand. It is expected that some residential property investors will exit the market and invest in other assets or abroad. However, others may continue to hold on to their residential property portfolios or invest in new build properties. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Exceptions will distort investment Submission (Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) The proposed exceptions from the scope of disallowed residential property will distort investment in favour of those asset classes while reducing investment in disallowed residential property. Comment As noted in “Issue: Overseas land exclusion will drive investment offshore” above, the aim of the proposed interest limitation rules is to reduce investor demand for residential property in New Zealand by making the tax rules for residential investment property less attractive. It is expected that some residential property investors will exit the market and invest in other 93 assets or abroad. However, others may continue to hold onto their residential property portfolios or invest in new build properties. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 94 SOCIAL, EMERGENCY, TRANSITIONAL, AND COUNCIL HOUSING EXEMPTIONS Clause 64E (proposed sections DH 4(4), (5) and (6)) Issue: Support for social housing proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Pukeroa Oruawhata Trust and Ngati Whakaue Tribal Lands Inc, The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) We support the proposed exemption for social, emergency, and transitional housing. We support the proposal to restrict the exemption to registered community housing providers. (The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Scope of social housing proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) The Government should consider whether tying the proposed social housing exemption to the definition of a community housing provider in the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 is broad enough. If there are other non-charity community housing providers, they should also be covered. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed social housing exemption is too narrow. It should be expanded to include all properties used to provide social housing regardless of the person doing the providing. (PwC) Comment Social housing plays an important role in providing accommodation for low-income people in New Zealand, and the purpose of the proposed social housing exemption is to ensure that the supply of social housing is not disrupted. To qualify for the social housing exemption, two conditions must be satisfied. If these are satisfied, interest incurred on the property would not be subject to interest limitation, even if the owner of the property is a private landlord who has no relationship with the individual tenants. First, the property must be rented or owned by one of the following: a registered community housing provider, Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities or a wholly owned subsidiary of Kāinga Ora, or a government department listed in schedule 2, part 1 of the Public Services Act 2020. Second, the property must also be used for social housing, or temporary accommodation for people in need seeking more permanent accommodation. Social housing is defined in section 2 of the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 as housing provided by a community housing provider or Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities. 95 The community housing provider regime is administered by the Community Housing Regulatory Authority, an arm of Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga–Ministry of Housing and Urban Development. There are currently 64 registered community housing providers with more than 15,000 properties. Officials consider that, overall, the proposed ex emption applies broadly enough to cover social housing in New Zealand in its various forms while still being straightforward to apply. Because it links into the community housing provider regime and the public register of community housing providers, it provides certainty to taxpayers that they qualify for the proposed exemption while ensuring that the integrity of the rules is maintained. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application to Oranga Tamariki and other agencies Submission (New Ground Capital) Proposed section DH 4(4)(a), which lists the ways in which a property must be used to qualify for the social housing exemption, should either be expanded to include housing leased by Oranga Tamariki or repealed. As currently worded, the exemption for social housing does not include housing leased to Oranga Tamariki—Ministry for Children. This means Oranga Tamariki housing is not on an equal footing with other social housing. Comment As noted above in “Issue: Scope of social housing proposal”, the social housing exemption has two limbs - the first looks at who owns or leases the property, and the second looks at the nature of the housing provided. Because of the way in which “social housing” is defined in the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992, the exemption as currently drafted would only be available for interest incurred on housing leased by Oranga Tamariki that is used for emergency or transitional housing. Officials understand that housing and wraparound services provided by Oranga Tamariki to tamariki and rangatahi would not necessarily meet this requirement. Officials note that this concern also arises for other government departments listed in schedule 2, part 1 of the Public Services Act 2020, for example, the Ministry of Health and housing it leases to provide accommodation alongside addiction/rehabilitation services. This is not the policy intent. Officials agree that the drafting of the exemption should be clarified to ensure that interest incurred on other housing leased by government departments that is used to provide accommodation for the public on a non-transitional or non-emergency basis should qualify for the exemption. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 96 Issue: Scope of council housing proposal Submission (PwC) If the social housing exemption is not expanded to all social housing regardless of the person doing the providing (see “Issue: Scope of social housing proposals” above), the council housing exemption should be expanded to cover properties rented by local authorities and council-controlled organisations from private landlords to provide social housing in a manner consistent with the social housing exemption. Comment The social housing exemption provides that interest incurred on housing that is owned or rented by a social housing provider to provide social housing or temporary accommodation is exempt from interest limitation. However, as currently drafted, the council housing ex emption applies only to housing owned by a council-controlled organisation and used by that organisation or a local authority to provide housing. It does not apply to housing rented from private landlords by a council-controlled organisation for the same purpose. Officials agree with the submission and consider that the council housing exemption should be expanded to include housing leased by a local authority or council-controlled organisation and used to provide council housing. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: “Sole purpose” wording too narrow Submission (Deloitte, PwC) The use of the words “sole purpose” in the exemptions is potentially too narrow. It may exclude wraparound services provided in the same building. (Deloitte) It may exclude buildings used for other (non-social housing) purposes. This approach is contrary to the “to the extent” approach used elsewhere in the rules. The definition of social housing should be amended to ensure that interest incurred in relation to mixed-use (social and non-social housing) can be apportioned. (PwC) Comment The policy intent is that the social housing exemption should operate on a unit-by -unit basis, such that the whole residential unit or building must be leased by the social housing provider to qualify for the exemption. If there are multiple residential units or buildings on a single piece of land, each unit or building would be considered separately. For example, the ex emption should not be available if one bedroom in a five-bedroom boardinghouse is used to provide emergency or transitional housing and the others are rented out to the public. The “sole purpose” wording is intended to restrict the application of the exemption in this situation. Officials note that this differs slightly from the apportionment approach proposed elsewhere in the interest limitation rules. This difference was intended, as a “to the extent” approach 97 would mean that the exemption would be available for the one bedroom in the example outlined above. The purpose of the social housing exemption is to ensure that the supply of social housing is not negatively impacted by the proposed interest limitation rules in situations where a property may otherwise be withdrawn from the market. This concern does not arise in the situation where a house is rented out on a room-by -room basis with only some of those rooms being used for social housing and other rooms being rented out to the public. Officials note that the “sole purpose” wording was not intended to exclude situations where wraparound or connected services are also provided, either in the same building or another building on the same land. Officials agree that the current wording may not achieve the intent stated and recommend the drafting be revisited to ensure it operates as intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Rebate programme for community housing providers Submission (The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) In addition to the proposed social housing exemption, a rebate programme of up to one-third of their interest costs should be introduced for property owners leasing to registered community housing providers. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised in the submission. However, as noted in “Issue: ‘Sole purpose’ wording too narrow” above, the purpose of the social housing exemption is to ensure that the supply of social housing is not negatively impacted by the proposed interest limitation rules in situations where a property may otherwise be withdrawn from the market. Therefore, the intent of the proposed exemption is to preserve the existing treatment of interest deductions. Officials consider the submission would go beyond the status quo and provide additional financial assistance for owners of properties used for social housing. This is a broader issue and goes beyond the scope of the proposed interest limitation rules. Any further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 98 APPLICATION TO COMPANIES Clause 64E (proposed sections DH 3, DH 5 and DH 12) Issue: Use of tax book values and financial account values Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Further consideration should be given to whether the use of tax book values or financial accounts values will skew the threshold calculations used to determine if a company is a “residential land company” or a “residential land wholly-owned group member”. Comment The 50 percent threshold is intended to reduce compliance costs for companies whose core business does not involve disallowed residential property. The threshold is set at a level that provides a reasonable buffer if tax book values or financial accounts values for non-disallowed residential property assets are too low. This is because companies whose core business does not involve disallowed residential property would usually be well under the 50 percent threshold. While it would be most accurate to require taxpayers to use market values for all assets, this would be very costly for taxpayers. Allowing tax book values and financial accounts values is much simpler for taxpayers and will reduce compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Valuation of assets that are not disallowed residential property Submission (Deloitte) The rules do not clarify how shares and other assets that are not land are to be valued. Comment Officials agree it is unclear. The policy intent for assets other than land (except land subject to one of the development exemptions) is that tax book values or financial accounts values would be used. Officials recommend changes to the proposed new section DH 12 to achieve this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 99 Issue: Residential land companies Submission (KPMG) Taxpayers should be allowed to apply the 50 percent calculation in the “residential land company” and “residential land wholly-owned group member” definitions on an averaged quarterly basis, instead of a daily basis. Comment Officials do not agree. The fact that the definitions are met if the 50 percent threshold is exceeded at any point in an income year is offset by the threshold being reasonably high. As mentioned in “Issue: Use of tax book values and financial accounts values” ab ove, companies whose core business does not involve disallowed residential property would usually be well under the 50 percent threshold so will not need to test daily. The tests to determine if a company is a residential land company or residential land wholly- owned group member have been designed to be simple to reduce compliance costs. Requiring taxpayers to apply an averaged quarterly test is likely to increase compliance costs. If the averaged quarterly test were allowed as an option (instead of a requirement), officials recommend lowering the threshold (for example, to 25 percent) to ensure that companies whose core business involves disallowed residential property remain properly subject to the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Close companies Submission (Olivershaw Limited) Close companies should be subject to the same rules as non-close companies. That is, close companies should only have to apply the proposed interest limitation rules if more than 50 percent of their total assets consist of disallowed residential property. Like other companies, most close companies below the 50 percent threshold will be able to restructure their affairs to ensure their interest deductions are not affected. Comment Officials do not agree. A close company is a company where control is held by five or fewer natural persons or trustees. Many close companies are wholly-owned by a single person or family. With such concentrated control, the risk of avoidance and distortionary behaviour is greater. Officials are concerned that if close companies could also apply the 50 percent threshold, taxpayers may be incentivised to set up a company to hold their disallowed residential property and put other assets into that company (for example, shares, cash, vehicles) to fall below the 50 percent threshold and avoid the interest limitation rules. 100 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: References to “property” instead of “assets” Submission (Deloitte, nsaTax Limited) Submitters have suggested that the term “property” may be confusing when used to refer to property other than real property (land) and that the term “assets” may be more appropriate. Some resource consents may not be considered “property” for tax purposes (except for depreciation, in some cases). 5 It is unclear why these have been excluded from the definition of “total assets”. (nsaTax Limited) Comment The term “property” is not limited to real property. It also includes personal property and intangible property. It is not clear how a resource consent that is not legally “property” can nevertheless be an “asset” as the submitter suggests. Officials do not consider a specific definition to include resource consents is necessary. It is expected that there will be very few, if any, companies that hold a significant amount of residential property and resource consents. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Existing “residential land-rich entity” definition Submission (EY) The new term “residential land company” is substantially similar to the existing term “residential land-rich entity” used in the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules in subpart EL. This term could have been replicated and modified as necessary. Adding a new, but similar, term is confusing. Comment Officials do not agree. The types of property covered by the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules are substantially different to those covered by the proposed interest limitation rules. For example, for properties that are used as business premises as well as for residential purposes, the interest limitation rules apply an apportionment approach, while the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules apply a “predominant” test (the property is residential land unless it is used predominantly as business premises). The interest limitation rules also 5 See section 122 of the Resource Management Act 1991 and section 72 of the Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects) Act 2012. 101 specifically exclude overseas property, excepted Māori land and student accommodation, whereas the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules do not. In addition, there are significant differences between the types of entities covered by the two terms. The term “residential land company” only includes companies (whether close companies or not), while “residential land-rich entity” includes partnerships, trusts and close companies (but not non-close companies). Officials consider it would have been more confusing to use the existing term “residential land-rich entity”, with the very substantial modifications that would have been required for the interest limitation rules, than to introduce a new term. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 102 EXCEPTED RESIDENTIAL LAND – COMMERCIAL ACCOMMODATION Schedule 1A Issue: Exception for commercial boardinghouses Submission (CEG Limited, PwC, Shared Living Limited) That the treatment between boardinghouses and other kinds of commercial accommodation is inconsistent, because boardinghouses are not explicitly carved out of the interest limitation rules. Many boardinghouses are of a scale and configuration that make them clearly commercial and unviable for purchase as an owner-occupier. Submitters made the following suggestions for ways to remove the inconsistency: • an exception for boardinghouses as per other tax rules • an exception for boardinghouses with 10 or more rooms • an exception for certain boardinghouses with defined features that reflect a commercial nature, or • if none of the above are possible, the definition of “new build land” should be altered so that rest homes converted into boardinghouses are exempt. Comment The proposed interest limitation rules are intended to apply to a property that is, or could foreseeably be, used for long-term accommodation, with an emphasis on whether the property is of a type that is generally available or suitable for owner-occupation. This means the rules should apply regardless of whether the whole house is rented out on a standard residential tenancy contract, each room is rented out individually, or the property is used to provide short-stay holiday accommodation. Officials agree with the submission that large-scale commercial boardinghouses should not be subject to interest limitation on the basis they are not configured in a way that is suitable for owner-occupation. These properties have no impact on regular housing prices and including them in the proposed interest limitation rules would not further the intent of the rules. However, officials do not consider it appropriate to simply include an exception for “boardinghouses”. Officials note that in developing the interest limitation rules, it became apparent that “boardinghouse” could be misinterpreted by taxpayers as being the same as the term “boarding house”, as used in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (the RTA). “Boarding house” as used in the RTA means residential premises containing one or more boarding rooms occupied, or intended by the landlord to be occupied, by at least six tenants at any time. “Boardinghouses” are excluded from the definition of “dwelling” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), which is used for the bright-line test and certain other provisions. A “boardinghouse” in the ITA is undefined and ultimately depends on the facts and circumstances, but it generally requires a higher level of servicing, management, and oversight than a “boarding house” as used in the RTA. There is also a sense of scale with a “boardinghouse” that is not necessarily present with an RTA “boarding house”. 103 While large-scale commercial operators would be aware that the two terms are not the same, the interest limitation rules will be applied by landlords around New Zealand, some of whom may only be familiar with the term in a residential tenancy context. An exception for “boardinghouses” could therefore create confusion for many taxpayers and could negatively impact compliance with the rules. Point of difference Officials therefore recommend introducing a targeted exception using a new defined term, such as “commercial lodging establishment”, as the most effective approach Incorporating a requirement for a minimum number of rooms, along with other commercial factors, would provide certainty to large-scale commercial operators, while minimising the risk that people could structure into the exception. It would also minimise any potential confusion for landlords who happen to rent their properties out on a room-by -room basis. Relevant factors that could be included in such a definition include: • A minimum of 10 boarding rooms that are not self-contained. • Communal living facilities, including shared kitchens and living areas available to all residents. • Servicing and management by the business. Given officials’ comments above, a change to the definition of “new build land” to account for rest homes converted into boardinghouses is not necessary. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Inconsistent treatment of boardinghouses Submission (Deloitte) That the proposed inclusion of boardinghouses under the interest limitation rules is inconsistent with the exclusion of boardinghouses from the bright-line test. The different tax treatments will lead to confusion for taxpayers. Comment Officials note the recommendation in “Issue: Exception for commercial boardinghouses” above to introduce a targeted exception from the interest limitation rules for certain boardinghouses using a new defined term, such as “commercial lodging establishments”. A boardinghouse is currently excluded from the definition of “dwelling”, which is used in other provisions, such as the bright-line test and the residential rental ring-fencing rules. “Boardinghouse” differs from the term “boarding house”, which is used in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, but the terms could easily be confused. In response to the potential confusion that could arise, officials recommended a new defined term, such as “commercial lodging establishment”, be introduced for the proposed interest limitation rules. Officials acknowledge that this could create inconsistency or confusion between the interest limitation rules and other income tax provisions where a boardinghouse is excluded. This includes the bright-line test and the residential rental ring-fencing rules, as well as non- residential building depreciation. 104 Point of difference Officials propose that the definition of “dwelling” in section YA 1 be amended to refer to this proposed new defined term, “commercial lodging establishment”, instead of “boardinghouse”. This would ensure there was no inconsistency between the treatment of such boardinghouses between the interest limitation rules and the bright-line test, and it would also provide certainty to taxpayers across the various income tax provisions that apply to residential property. Officials propose that the change should apply for the 2022-23 and later income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Serviced apartments Submission (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council New Zealand) There should be an exception for serviced apartments, based on the requirements in paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of “dwelling” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. These properties are distinct from rental accommodation in that a resident of a serviced apartment does not have “quiet enjoyment” as considered in the Residential Tenancies Act 1989, while a tenant in a regular rental apartment does. This reflects a commercial purpose more akin to a hotel room than a regular apartment. We do not believe this poses any conversion risk. The owners of residential rental apartments gain more benefit from keeping their apartments as residential rentals and are therefore unlikely to convert their apartments to serviced apartments to circumvent interest limitation. Comment Serviced apartments were originally excluded from the definition of dwelling because of the rules on the depreciation of commercial fit-out. However, they are specifically brought back into the definition for the bright-line test and residential ring-fencing rules. Officials consider that the inclusion of serviced apartments in the proposed interest limitation rules is appropriate. The proposed rules focus on the functional structure of a building or place and not whether it is actually used to provide long-term rental accommodation. For example, a house or apartment that is let out on a digital platform for short-stay accommodation would be subject to interest limitation. This is to ensure there is no income tax advantage to providing short-term accommodation over long-term accommodation, because otherwise there would be an incentive to change the type of accommodation provided to qualify for interest deductions. This would impact the availability of housing available for people to live in – either as a rental property or for owner-occupation. Additionally, the structural and regulatory barriers preventing conversion of a regular rental apartment into a serviced apartment are minimal, and the potential benefits of doing so if serviced apartments are excluded are enough that some investors may choose to do so to circumvent interest limitation. Officials therefore believe that excluding serviced apartments could undermine the integrity of the regime and have a negative impact on housing supply, especially in urban centres. 105 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Short-stay accommodation Submission (Olivershaw Limited, Rebekah Walton) a. It is inequitable to subject short-stay accommodation to interest limitation but exempt hotels and other forms of commercial accommodation, as they serve a similar purpose. (Olivershaw Limited) b. There should be an exception for property used as visitor accommodation where the property has a specific resource consent under an operative district plan that permits and requires its use as such. These properties reflect a legitimate commercial use, and as they require a specific consent from the relevant local authority, the risk of conversion is low. (Rebekah Walton) Comment a. As noted in “Issue: Serviced apartments” above, the proposed interest limitation rules focus on the functional structure of a building or place and not whether it is actually used to provide long-term rental accommodation. For example, a house or apartment that is let out for short-stay accommodation should be subject to interest limitation in the same way as if it were rented out as a long-term residential tenancy. This is to ensure that investors are not incentivised to provide one type of accommodation over another. Short-stay accommodation typically involves properties that are structurally identical to regular residential property, and the barriers to conversion between the two types of property are low. An exception could incentivise investors to convert their properties to short-stay accommodation to avoid interest limitation, thereby undermining the integrity of the rules. This could have a negative impact on housing supply available to renters or owner occupiers. b. A small number of local authorities across New Zealand designate visitor accommodation as a controlled activity requiring a resource consent under the Resource Management Act 1991. However, there is inconsistent treatment of such accommodation across local authorities. Many local authorities do not operate such a consented visitor accommodation regime, and those that do have differing requirements for when a resource consent is necessary or what is required to obtain such a consent. Officials understand this consent regime is not necessarily restricted to large-scale purpose-built commercial accommodation. It includes standard residential properties that are used to provide short-stay accommodation. For example, in some locations, consent could be required if a property is intended to be used to provide accommodation for six or more people at a time – this could include a three-bedroom house with a queen bed in each room. At this stage, officials do not consider it appropriate to tie an exception from the interest limitation rules to this regime. It would create substantial complexity given the application of the visitor consent regime differs from region to region. In addition, it would not resolve concerns about the use of residential properties for short-stay accommodation versus long-term accommodation. 106 Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be declined. 107 EXCEPTED RESIDENTIAL LAND – MAIN HOME EXCEPTION Schedule 1A Issue: Pre-existing definition of “main home” Submission (Deloitte) The proposed main home exception in the interest limitation rules duplicates the “main home” definition used elsewhere in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). The exception’s intended meaning (that is, that it is designed to cover flatmate, home office, and bed & breakfast situations) would be clearer if that “main home” definition were used in the proposed exception. Comment While the concept of a main home is used in both the bright-line test and the proposed interest limitation rules, using the definition of “main home” provided in section YA 1 of the ITA would not be appropriate for the interest limitation rules. This is because the section YA 1 main home definition is centred on the concept of a “dwelling”, also defined in section YA 1. The “dwelling” definition is used for most of the tax regimes in the ITA that deal with residential property. However, it is not used in the interest limitation rules. The interest limitation rules are primarily based on property structure or configuration, while the pre- existing property tax regimes and their associated definitions are based on other factors, such as time and use. To reflect this different scope and to avoid confusion between the concepts of property used by the different regimes, it was decided to draft the proposed interest limitation rules as a standalone set of rules. The duplication of the “main home” definition is a consequence of this drafting decision. To provide additional clarity, further information will be provided in guidance material. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Main home exception for trusts Submission (Matter raised by officials) The main home exception in the interest limitation rules should be clarified to ensure that a trustee of a trust may only qualify for the exception for a beneficiary or settlor of that trust if a principal settlor of the trust does not have a separate main home. The intent of the main home exception in the proposed interest limitation rules is to ensure that where there is an income-earning use of a person’s main home, the status quo is maintained. This means that a portion of a person’s interest expense should continue to be deductible for the main home, to the extent that the main home is used in earning assessable income. An example of this is where a person rents out a spare bedroom to a flatmate or runs a business from a home office. 108 The exception will also be available to trusts in certain circumstances, given the common use of trusts to hold residential property in New Zealand. The intent is that the main home exception for trusts should follow that used in the bright-line test, that is, it should only be available for a property held on trust where the property is a beneficiary’s main home, but only if a principal settlor does not have another main home. This is meant to ensure that, if a parent settles a house on trust and the child (a beneficiary) lives in the house, the main home exception will only apply if the parents do not live elsewhere, or if the original settlor of the land is deceased. The current drafting does not achieve this policy intent as the reference to the settlor not having a different main home was inadvertently omitted. This means that a trustee could claim the main home exception for situations where a beneficiary of the trust lives in a property even when the settlor lives somewhere else, creating an unintended loophole in the rules. It also means a property investor could circumvent the interest limitation rules by transferring the property into a discretionary trust and listing one of the tenants as a beneficiary. They could remove and add new tenants as beneficiaries when one lease ends and another begins. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 109 EXCEPTED RESIDENTIAL LAND – STUDENT ACCOMMODATION Clause 127(17B), schedule 1A Issue: Support for student accommodation proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the proposed exception for student accommodation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Student accommodation subject to GST Submission (Olivershaw Limited) The scope of the student accommodation exception should be expanded to cover all student accommodation subject to GST. Comment Officials understand that the submitter is primarily concerned with the situation where a property owner leases a building to a university and the university operates a hall of residence, rather than the property owner operating the student accommodation themselves. The submitter was also concerned with the situation where the accommodation is rented to non-students over the summer break and whether this would continue to be covered by the exception. The student accommodation exception is intended to apply to a property that meets the requirements of section 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, regardless of whether it is the property owner or the tertiary institution that operates the hall of residence. This means that the student accommodation exception would be available to the underlying property owner in the situation described above. Officials have revisited the drafting in light of the submitter’s concerns and are satisfied that no further changes are required to address this. Regarding the use of halls of residence over semester breaks by non-students, the policy intent is that the exception would be available for the full year. The proposed provisions contemplate this by using the words “even if they are used mainly for the accommodation of students, and not exclusively for the accommodation of students”. Provided the building is used as a hall of residence for most of the year, the drafting ensures that the exception would apply for the full year. Officials consider that no further changes are required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 110 EXCEPTED RESIDENTIAL LAND – MĀORI EXCEPTED LAND Clauses 64E (proposed sections DH 3 and DH 5(4)), 127(7D) and (10C), and schedule 1A Issue: Wholly-owned subsidiaries of a Māori entity Submission (Chapman Tripp, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei Trust) An amendment should be made to the proposed definition of “Māori excepted land” to ensure land held by a subsidiary of a Māori authority (or entity eligible to be one) is covered by the proposed exceptions. Comment Māori excepted land is included within the list of excepted residential land in proposed schedule 15. “Excepted residential land” is excluded from being “disallowed residential property” and is therefore not subject to interest limitation. The proposed Māori excepted land definition includes housing on land owned by a Māori authority or an entity eligible to be one (Māori entity) where the housing is provided to a beneficiary or shareholder of the Māori entity. As currently drafted, the definition accounts for situations where land is owned by a Māori entity and housing is managed by a subsidiary company, so long as the tenant is a beneficiary or shareholder of the Māori entity. However, in cases where a subsidiary of the entity owns the property, rather than the entity itself, the land is not covered by the definition and the interest limitation rules will apply. This leads to inconsistent outcomes among different land-owning structures, which is not intended. To resolve this, the definition should be expanded to cover housing provided to a shareholder or beneficiary of a Māori entity on land owned by either that entity or other entities within its “qualifying Māori group”. Entities within this group would include any wholly-owned company, trust, or charitable arm. This would allow for a nested structure – for example, where the top-level Māori authority is a trust, and the land is held in a company that is wholly owned by the trustee. Additionally, it is not clear whether land acquired through a Treaty of Waitangi settlement would satisfy the definition if the land were subsequently transferred around the group. The intent is that the land should continue to be Māori excepted land, as the land is still owned by the Māori entity, albeit indirectly. To allow for this, the definition of Māori excepted land should be amended to incorporate this new “qualifying Māori group” term to allow for movement within the group. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Collective housing approaches Submission (Hāpai Housing Limited Partnership and Ka Uruora Housing Trust) In general, we support the proposed exclusions for certain kinds of Māori land and community housing. However, we believe the proposed wording inadvertently disadvantages collective 111 housing projects, as it is only designed to apply to situations where a single Māori entity owns land, and the land is used to house its members. It does not adequately account for situations where multiple Māori entities own or manage land. We recommend the exception be expanded to include situations where: • land (any land, not just designated Māori title land) is owned by a partnership, and • all partners in the partnership or other arrangement are Māori authorities or entities eligible to be one (or wholly-owned subsidiaries of such entities), and • the land is used to provide housing that is made available to Māori as a priority, and only where there is a lack of demand can it then be made available to the wider public. Comment Land that satisfies the proposed definition of “Māori excepted land” is not subject to the interest limitation rules. This includes where the land is owned by a Māori authority or an entity eligible to be one (Māori entity), and it is used to provide housing to shareholders or beneficiaries of that entity. This is intended to ensure that papakāinga and kaumātua housing are not negatively impacted by the proposed new rules. Under the current drafting, the definition successfully accounts for situations where a single Māori entity owns land, and the land is used to house its members. However, the current drafting would not work where multiple iwi or hapū work together to provide papakāinga housing on land through a limited partnership. In this situation, each Māori entity is a limited partner in the partnership, with the partnership developing homes on the land for use by members of the Māori entities. Under the current wording of the definition, the entities in these limited partnerships may only be able to claim a fraction of their interest relating to the properties in question. This inadvertently disadvantages collective housing projects relative to housing projects run by a single Māori entity. This is not the policy intent and officials agree that this should be resolved. Points of difference Officials recommend the definition should be expanded to include land held through the partnership to the extent housing is provided to a member or shareholder of one of the partners or the “qualifying Māori group” of each of those partners (see “Issue: Wholly-owned subsidiaries of a Māori entity” above). This would allow land to be Māori excepted land for a partner in a collective housing group to the extent it is used to provide a residence to a member of an iwi or hapū that is a partner in said collective housing group. Officials do not recommend that the definition be expanded to cover situations where the housing is rented to the wider public. In these situations, the Māori entity or partnership is acting as a regular residential landlord. Officials consider that an exclusion from the interest limitation rules in this case would be inappropriate (see “Issue: Exclusion for Māori authority trusts” below). Note that apportionment rules would apply, so that if some housing on the land is provided to the wider community, interest limitation would only apply to that portion. 112 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Exclusion for Māori authority trusts Submission (Pukeroa Oruawhata Trust and Ngati Whakaue Tribal Lands Inc) A blanket ex clusion, like the exempt Māori company one, should also apply to trusts that are Māori authorities to exclude them from the interest limitation rules for all land held. Currently, general title land owned by trustees that is residential property (and not transferred as part of a Treaty settlement) is only proposed to be excluded where it is being used to provide housing to iwi or hapū. Comment Two separate exclusions are proposed for Māori excepted land (which applies to the land itself, regardless of who owns it) and exempt Māori companies (which applies to companies that meet certain requirements). The submission refers to both. Māori excepted land Land that satisfies the definition of “Māori excepted land” is not subject to the interest limitation rules. The definition includes land owned by a Māori authority or an entity eligible to become a Māori authority if it is provided as a residence to a shareholder or beneficiary of that Māori authority or entity. The purpose of this is to provide an exception for Māori community housing on general title land, not for all residential properties owned by Māori authorities. Despite being on general title land, Māori community housing forms such as papakāinga or kaumātua housing are not available for purchase by the general public, and they serve a specific purpose of community development rather than property speculation. As such, it is appropriate to exclude these properties from the interest limitation rules, as they do not affect the general property market and their inclusion would add complexity and cost to Māori communal housing projects to no purpose. Where housing owned by a Māori authority on general title land is available for rent on the general market, the housing is not covered by the definition and is therefore still subject to interest limitation. Officials consider it would be inconsistent with the policy intent to expand the definition to cover situations where a Māori authority is simply acting as a regular residential landlord. Exempt Māori companies The proposed exclusion for exempt Māori companies only applies if the company is not a residential land company or a residential land wholly-owned group member. A company will meet this test if disallowed property makes up less than 50 percent of the company or group’s total assets. The proposed exclusion for companies is intended to reduce compliance costs. Unlike trusts, companies generally do not have to trace their borrowings to obtain interest deductions. Trusts, whether they are Māori authorities or not, have always been required to trace their borrowings to obtain interest deductions. An exclusion to reduce compliance costs is therefore 113 not necessary and officials do not consider any trusts with less than 50 percent disallowed property should be excluded from the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ground lessee exception too broad Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to the Māori excepted land definition to ensure that ground lessees can only satisfy the definition for Treaty settlement land if they are owned by the same entity that owns the land. Excepted residential land, which includes Māori excepted land, is not subject to the interest limitation rules. For land acquired through a Treaty of Waitangi settlement, the proposed definition of Māori excepted land is satisfied to the extent the land is owned by a Māori authority or an entity eligible to become a Māori authority. In some situations, the landowner will enter into a lease to enable the land to be developed or used productively. The intent is that the definition of Māori excepted land should generally not apply to the lessee, only to the lessor (the landowner), unless the lessee is effectively a subsidiary of the entity that owns the land. This generally arises when the land-holding entity is restricted in the activities it may undertake in relation to the land, but the iwi or hapū would still like to develop the land. The definition should still be satisfied in this situation, so that the land is not subject to the interest limitation rules. Under the current drafting, the definition would be satisfied for ground leases relating to land transferred under a Treaty of Waitangi settlement the lessee is owned by any Māori authority or entity eligible to be one. This is broader than the policy intent, as the definition would be satisfied where the lessee is a completely separate Māori entity. The definition should be clarified to ensure it is only satisfied where the lessee is owned, directly or indirectly, by the same Māori entity that holds the Treaty settlement land or an entity in the same “qualifying Māori group” (see “Issue: Wholly-owned subsidiaries of a Māori entity” above). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 114 OTHER SCOPE OF PROPERTY SUBMISSIONS Issue: Ground leases Submission (Bell Gully, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Heimsath Alexander, PwC) Ground leases in large-scale commercial ground lease residential arrangements should be excluded from the interest limitation rules. The legal estate of a ground leaseholder does not include any improvements on the land and is not equivalent to that of a freehold owner or a lessee of land and buildings. A ground leaseholder does not own, have exclusive possession of , or control over, any residential dwellings on the land. Neither does a ground leaseholder control whether a residential dwelling on the land is owner-occupied or an investment property. Submitters made the following suggestions of features that could be required for ground leases to enable an exclusion to apply: • a minimum number of residential leasehold dwellings on the land • a minimum term of the ground lease • the rent payable must be based on a percentage of the unimproved land value • the ground lease must be subject to a residential leasehold sublease under which the sub- lessee has a right of exclusive possession, the sub-lease has a term of 35 or more years, and the sub-lessor has the right to charge ground rent based on a percentage of the unimproved land value • the Commissioner must approve the exclusion applies to a taxpayer, and • the exclusion should not apply to the extent the ground leaseholder, or an associated person, holds a residential leasehold sub-lease. Comment Officials do not consider an exemption for large-scale commercial ground lease residential arrangements to be appropriate. In some ground lease situations, there may be a chain of ground leases. The freehold owner of the land enters into a ground lease with a developer or other party (the ground leasholder) to develop the land. The ground leaseholder then enters into a chain of subleases, with the ultimate apartment owners holding one of the subleases in the chain. Ultimately, a ground leaseholder holds an investment in land that is used for residential purposes. Officials consider they should be treated the same as someone who owns and leases out land with residential buildings on it. Providing an exemption for ground leases would create an integrity concern, as it would provide a more favourable treatment for leasehold interests than freehold interests. This might encourage the use of lease structures to effectively separate out the land from the building to circumvent the interest limitation rules, and this could impact the legal structuring of land interests in New Zealand for many years to come. For example, cross leases were originally used to circumvent subdivision restrictions. A targeted exemption, as suggested by submitters, would create arbitrary outcomes and would not mitigate integrity risk. For example, while an exemption would need to specify a 115 minimum number of dwellings to limit distortionary behaviour, any minimum number would essentially be arbitrary and would create inequities between ground leaseholders that fall on either side of the line. However, it would also encourage residential developments on leasehold land to contain this prescribed number of dwellings. A similar issue arises with a prescribed minimum term length (for example, 35 years). Note that the proposed interest limitation rules do contain a limited exclusion for ground leases for land transferred as part of a settlement under the Treaty of Waitangi (for further information, see “Issue: Ground lessee exception too broad” above). However, this applies in limited circumstances and does not raise the same integrity issues. Submitters suggest that if no exemption is provided ground leaseholders may be incentivised to convert existing residential leasehold arrangements to non-residential uses. Given the legal complexity of large-scale ground lease residential leasehold arrangements and the large number of residential leasehold interests commonly involved in such arrangements, officials consider there are likely to be significant legal and commercial impediments to such conversions becoming commonplace. Submitters also suggest that if no exemption is provided for ground leaseholders, prime land available for future large-scale high-density residential development may be redirected to commercial developments. Officials note that the proposed new build land and development exemptions for certain land businesses will apply to ground leaseholders. Officials consider these proposed exemptions will diminish the incentives for such land to be directed to commercial developments. While the 20-year period for the new build exemption would not necessarily align with the term of the ground lease (which in some cases can be for up to 150 years), providing a separate exemption for the ground leaseholder would provide them with a more favourable treatment than other taxpayers with new build land. Submitters suggest that, due to the large scale of commercial ground lease arrangements, the acquisition and on-going funding of ground leases can only be funded by long-term debt. Officials consider scale is not a reason for an exemption. Scale of cost is relative to each taxpayer. The purchase of residential land frequently requires long-term debt because of the significant scale of the purchase for the purchaser. If ground leaseholders were exempted from the interest limitation rules based on scale, this would treat ground leaseholders more favourably than other taxpayers and would be inequitable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Safe harbour for dual-purpose buildings Submission (Olivershaw Limited) There should be a safe harbour provision for business premises to exclude properties from interest limitation if 33% or more of the premises is used for commercial purposes. Comment Officials consider that a safe harbour for dual-purpose premises would be counter to the “to the extent” approach applied in the rest of the proposed interest limitation rules. It would also introduce additional complexity and provide undesirable concessionary tax treatment in certain situations. Commercial premises are already outside the scope of the interest limitation rules. 116 Properties are also already not subject to the rules to the extent to which they are business premises. A complete exclusion for properties above a certain threshold of business use would create a concessionary treatment for mixed-use business and residential assets when compared to other excepted residential land classes, and this may push investment towards dual-purpose buildings, which is not the policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Order-in-Council mechanism for schedule 15 Submission (Deloitte) A legislative mechanism should be developed to allow the addition of new types of property to proposed new schedule 15 (which lists excluded asset classes) by Order in Council. Comment Officials do not consider an Order-in-Council mechanism to be necessary. If the proposed interest limitation rules are enacted and the exclusions do not operate as intended, additions to, or removals from, schedule 15 should be considered by Parliament. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Apportionment approach Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The use of land area as the basis for apportionment under the proposed interest limitation rules will confuse taxpayers as this is different to the bright-line test, which uses predominant use and time. Comment The bright-line test was designed for simplicity of application and can produce a binary result, that is, a property is generally either fully captured by the bright-line test or fully excluded. Given that the disposal of a property is only taxed under the bright-line test if it is disposed of within a certain timeframe, predominant use is appropriate for most aspects of the bright- line test. This “all or nothing” approach was not considered to be appropriate in the context of the proposed interest limitation rules, as a few square metres or a few days could make the difference between all interest deductions being denied or not. The current drafting does not state what the basis for apportionment should be. It uses standard “to the extent” wording, which is used elsewhere in the Income Tax Act 2007. 117 Depending on the circumstances, this could include both elements of time and area. For example, a property may only be used as employee accommodation for part of a year; if it is then rented out to a member of the public, it would no longer qualify for the employee accommodation exclusion for the remainder of the year. Officials recognise that for some taxpayers who are familiar with the application of the bright- line test, it may take some getting used to the apportionment rules in the interest limitation rules. However, Inland Revenue will provide guidance to ensure that taxpayers are able to understand the rules and ascertain what interest they are still able to deduct. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Multiple units on one title Submission (CEG Limited, John Cuttance, New Zealand Law Society, Taranaki Property Investors’ Association Inc) There should be an exception for buildings with multiple residential units held on a single title. They are an asset class that is solely available to investors, and as such are outside the scope of the interest limitation regime. Comment The proposed interest limitation rules are intended to apply, broadly speaking, to land with a house on it. If a property is physically suitable for use as a residence, it should be subject to the proposed interest limitation rules. It should not matter whether, on a given legal title, there is one house or multiple houses, as may be the case with a “home and income” property or a villa that has been split into three flats. An exclusion for multiple residential units on a single title from the interest limitation rules could incentivise this type of structure from a tax perspective and change New Zealand’s housing landscape in unintended or undesirable ways. For example, cross leases became popular in New Zealand in the second half of the 20 th century to circumvent subdivision restrictions before the introduction of the Resource Management Act 1991. Regarding existing properties, officials understand that, while there are costs to individually unit-titling the units in a block of flats built on a single title, it is feasible to do so and does occur. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 118 Issue: Employee accommodation Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed exclusion from the interest limitation rules for employee accommodation should be clarified to ensure it is available in situations where the employer owns the property themselves, or where it is owned by another company in the same wholly-owned group. Excepted residential land would not be subject to the proposed interest limitation rules. This includes property if it is used as employee accommodation. Under the proposed definition of “employee accommodation”, if the employee is associated with the employer, the definition would only be satisfied if the accommodation is due to the remoteness or nature of the business carried on. The proposed definition is intended to ensure that businesses are not impacted by the interest limitation rules where they own housing used to accommodate their employees. However, officials consider the current drafting should be clarified to ensure that the definition would not be satisfied where a standard property investor rents their property to a business that happens to use the property for employee accommodation. In that case, the property should be subject to the interest limitation rules. There is a risk that otherwise investors would be better off renting their property to a business rather than an individual. In addition, officials understand that, in corporate group scenarios, it is not uncommon for property to be held in a separate company to the company that is the employer. Officials therefore propose that the legislation be amended to ensure that the employee accommodation definition would be satisfied where the company incurring the interest expense is part of the same wholly-owned group as the employer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Terminology Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) already contains several terms with significant overlap with the new terms introduced by the proposed interest limitation rules, including “residential land” and “dwelling.” To reduce complexity, the rules should use these existing terms, rather than defining new ones. In addition, several new terms in the proposed interest limitation rules, including “disallowed residential property”, have little meaning on their face or are confusing. To aid comprehension, we suggest the terms used in the rules be redrafted in accordance with the plain English philosophy employed elsewhere in the ITA. Comment While the proposed interest limitation rules may be similar to other regimes in the ITA (for example, the bright-line test and the residential rental loss ring-fencing provisions) because they relate to land, the rules serve a different purpose. 119 It is for this reason that the interest limitation rules have been drafted as a set of standalone rules, separate to other land-related regimes. Officials consider that using pre-existing terms or creating nested definitions in the ITA that support a different purpose would lead to inconsistencies within the interest limitation rules and reduce its effectiveness. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Technical drafting issues Submission (Deloitte) • In the main home exception, in the phrase “used predominantly for place...”, the word “for” should be replaced with “as a”. • The phrase “if that place was the main home for 1 or more of the following people...” should be written in present tense as “if that place is the main home for 1 or more of the following people...”. • The term “dwelling” should be removed from the proposed social and council housing exemptions, consistent with the language used elsewhere in the proposed interest limitation rules. Comment Officials will refer the submissions to the drafters for their consideration. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Use of tohutō in the word “Māori” Submission (EY) The proposed amendments use the word “Māori” in several places (proposed sections DH 5(4)(a) and (b), and the amendments to section YA 1) without the appropriate macron or tohutō. This should be corrected. Comment Officials raised this submission with Inland Revenue drafters and the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO). Inland Revenue drafters follow the PCO style guide when using te reo Māori terms in legislation. That style guide provides that the current orthographic convention is to use tohutō. However, several defined legislative terms predate the introduction of this convention. This means that pre-existing terms in the Income Tax Act 2007, such as “Māori authority”, do not use tohutō. 120 Proposed new terms do include tohutō (for example, “exempt Māori company” and “Māori excepted land”). While this means there is some inconsistency in the use of tohutō in the Income Tax Act 2007, PCO have confirmed that this approach is in line with their style guide. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 121 LAND BUSINESS EXEMPTION Clause 64E (proposed section DH 4(2)) Issue: General support Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) Submitters support an exemption from interest limitation for land acquired for a land-related business described in section CB 7. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Extend to all revenue account taxpayers Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Olivershaw Limited) The land business exemption should be extended to cover all taxpayers holding property on revenue account. Distinguishing between section CB 7 taxpayers and other revenue account taxpayers subject to tax on disposal creates unnecessary complexity. Comment The land business exemption applies to residential property held on revenue account under section CB 7. Section CB 7 applies to taxpayers carrying on a business of developing, building on, subdividing, and/or dealing in land. Full-time professional property developers generally hold land on revenue account under section CB 7 and so qualify for this exemption. There are other revenue account property provisions that may apply to occasional or one-off property development activities that do not otherwise meet the requirements of section CB 7 (see sections CB 9 to CB 13). The submitters suggest the land business exemption should also apply to interest incurred by taxpayers subject to these other sections. However, some revenue account property provisions contain criteria that are not relevant to the land business exemption, such as applying only if the development begins within 10 years of acquisition. Including such sections would have been unduly complex as they would require many modifications to apply. Having a general development exemption, rather than ex tending the land business exemption, allows the rules to remain simple from both an administrative and compliance perspective. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 122 EXEMPTION FOR PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT Clause 64E (proposed sections DH 4(3) and DH 5(7)) Issue: General support Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council New Zealand, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) Submitters support an exemption from interest limitation for property development. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Simple and broad exemption Submission (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council New Zealand) The exemption should be simple and broad. If a development is increasing housing supply, it should qualify. The exemption should also apply to one-off developments. Comment The proposed development exemption has been designed to be as simple as possible and to apply to a broad range of activities that contribute to increasing housing supply. It would apply to any taxpayer with an undertaking or scheme that involves building on, subdividing, or developing land to create new build land. The proposed development exemption, as drafted, could apply to taxpayers who undertake one-off developments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consequences for first home buyers and owner- occupiers Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited) The development exemption may have unintended consequences by accentuating the existing ability of developers and investors to leverage their property portfolios and outbid first home buyers and other owner-occupiers. Comment Officials acknowledge the concern raised by submitters. However, while new build prices may increase (or not be dampened by interest limitation), more investor demand is expected to 123 shift away from older housing stock. This would make older housing stock more affordable for first home buyers and owner-occupiers, while still ensuring that continued investment in new builds is not disincentivised. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application after land disposed of Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The development exemption should apply after land is disposed of. If a taxpayer sells a property at a loss after developing it, the proposed development exemption would not allow interest to be deducted after the property is disposed of. This could discourage people from taking risks and would not help with housing supply. Comment Officials agree that allowing the development exemption to continue to apply after property is disposed of at a loss would help ensure the interest limitation proposals do not negatively impact on new housing supply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Subdivision should be sufficient Submission (nsaTax Limited) A person who just subdivides land with a view to selling the lots as bare land may not qualify for the development exemption, even if they are taxed under section CB 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The development exemption should apply where a person subdivides land to create residential sections for sale. It should not matter whether they have built, or entered into an agreement to construct, a new build on the sections. Comment The proposed development exemption is intended to ensure investment in new housing supply is not negatively impacted by the proposed new interest limitation rules. Therefore, any undertaking or scheme involving subdivision must occur for the purpose of creating new build land. The same requirement applies to other land activity that is not subdivision but may lead to increased housing supply (that is, development and building). Where development or building activities are occurring on land, a taxpayer must also show an intention to add new builds to the land to obtain the development exemption. Development or building activity on its own is insufficient. Subdivision on its own, with no purpose of adding new builds to the land, would also fail to meet the threshold required to qualify for the exemption. However, if the land is taxed under section CB 12 when it is sold, then the interest 124 incurred for the property would be deductible on disposal (provided it would be deductible under existing tax rules). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Eligibility of interest incurred for existing dwellings Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Findex, Kiwi Property Group Limited, KPMG, Magan Lal, Olivershaw Limited, Property Council New Zealand, Real Estate Institute New Zealand) Various submissions were made regarding the eligibility of interest incurred in relation to expenditure on existing dwellings. a. Improving, renovating, repairing, and maintaining existing dwellings: Interest on borrowing relating to renovations, repairs and maintenance should be deductible. Denying deductions for improvements to a property conflicts with the Government’s approach of encouraging warm, dry rentals. Property owners who make repairs and upgrades to their properties to satisfy existing requirements, such as the healthy homes standards, should not have to absorb the cost. (Findex, Magan Lal, Olivershaw Limited) b. Remediation of existing dwellings: Interest on remediation expenditure should qu alify. (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Olivershaw Limited, Property Council New Zealand, Real Estate Institute New Zealand) Submitters suggested ways the exemption could be designed: • Taxpayers could make a statutory declaration when they claim the exemption. (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council New Zealand) • Interest on borrowing related to any new capital expenditure should continue to be deductible. (Olivershaw Limited) • Alternatively, interest on any ‘significant’ expenditure required for a dwelling to meet the requirements to be rented out should qualify. (Olivershaw Limited) c. Extensive remediation of uninhabitable dwellings: The definition of new build land should be expanded to include the extensive remediation of a residential property that was previously uninhabitable (such as a property damaged by a natural disaster). (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Comment These submissions are relevant to both the development exemption and the new build ex emption. To the extent remediation results in a “new build”, it would qualify for the development exemption while the remediation is taking place. However, to the extent it does not, it would not. See “Issue: Eligibility of interest incurred for existing dwellings” below for a full discussion of these submissions and the extent to which remediation should be deemed to result in a new build. 125 Recommendation See “Issue: Eligibility of interest incurred for existing dwellings” below. 126 NEW BUILD DEFINITION Clause 64E (proposed section DH 5(7)) Issue: Support for inclusion of commercial to residential conversions Submission (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council New Zealand) Submitters support commercial to residential conversions qualifying for the new build exemption. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Date of code compliance certificate Submission (Magan Lal, New Ground Capital, Scott Farrand, The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) The definition of a new build should: • Include properties that have been continuously owned by the same investor since completion, regardless of when the code compliance certificate (CCC) was issued. (Magan Lal) • Include properties that have been continuously owned by the same or related entities since completion if the CCC was issued up to ten years before 27 March 2020. (New Ground Capital) • Include all dwellings that have had their CCC issued in the last five years. This would allow investors who can no longer afford to hold their investment properties to sell without being impacted by the bright-line test. (Scott Farrand) • Only apply to dwellings that have their CCC issued on or after 27 March 2021 and should not be backdated to 27 March 2020. (The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) Comment “New build land” is generally defined to mean residential land to which a self-contained dwelling has been added, provided the dwelling receives its CCC on or after 27 March 2020. This definition is used for the new build exemption and the new build bright-line test, both of which are aimed at ensuring the proposed property tax changes do not negatively impact upon new housing supply. The following factors were considered when the 27 March 2020 date was selected: • Tilting the playing field away from investors and towards first home buyers: The date selected cannot undermine the objective of the interest limitation rules, which is to tilt the playing field for residential property away from investors and towards first home buyers/owner-occupiers. The further back the date is, the more existing properties would qualify for the new build exemption and therefore be unaffected by interest limitation. 127 Selecting a date that is too far in the past increases the likelihood of the special rules for new builds undermining the interest limitation rules. • Objective of not disincentivising investment in new builds: The date selected must ensure investment in new housing supply is not disincentivised. Therefore, the ideal date would be after the announcement of the proposals, which would mean that only land to which a dwelling was added on or after 27 March 2021 would qualify as new build land. Dwellings that were added to residential land before this date have already become part of existing housing stock, so need no further incentive. The further back the CCC date is, the less likely the special rules for new builds are to have a positive impact on new housing supply. This is because there would be less of an incentive to invest in a “new” new build (as there would be a greater number of “old” new builds that would also qualify for concessionary treatment). • March 2021 announcement: When the interest limitation proposals were announced, the Government indicated that a “new build” would include properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 and within 12 months of the new build dwelling receiving its CCC. This meant that a dwelling that received its CCC after 27 March 2020, but before 27 March 2021, could qualify as a new build, depending on when it was acquired. To ensure taxpayers who relied on the Government announcement are not disadvantaged, the definition of “new build land” needs to include residential land with dwellings that received their CCCs on or after 27 March 2020. The rules announced in March were complex, both for taxpayers to apply and for Inland Revenue to administer, because the eligibility of some new build properties hinged upon when they were acquired and when they received their CCCs. To make the rules simpler, while ensuring any taxpayers who acted in reliance on information provided by the Government in March 2021 are not disadvantaged, officials recommend that land with a dwelling on it that receives its CCC on or after 27 March 2020 will qualify as “new build land”, regardless of when the land was acquired. This date is also consistent with the objectives of the special rules for new builds and the interest limitation proposals. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Conversions not requiring a code compliance certificate Submission (Deloitte, EY) Like hotel or motel conversions, other conversions of commercial buildings (such as inns and boarding houses) to residential dwellings that do not require a code compliance certificate (CCC) to be issued should qualify as new build land. The definition of “new build” is too narrow. All newly available residential properties should be included, regardless of what the building was previously used for. Comment It is proposed that a dwelling that was formerly a hotel or motel can qualify as “new build land” if territorial or building consent authority records show that the conversion from a hotel/motel to a dwelling took place on or after 27 March 2020. This is an exception from the general requirement that a dwelling must receive a CCC to qualify as a new build. 128 The exception to the CCC requirement is proposed to apply only to the conversion of hotels/motels into dwellings because these are the only conversions officials are aware of that may occur without requiring a CCC on completion. In the absence of clear examples of situations where the CCC requirement could pose a barrier to commercial to residential conversions taking place, officials consider having only a narrow category of exceptions to the CCC requirement is preferable, given extending it further could result in unintended consequences. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Statement of principle Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The definition of new build land should contain a broad statement of principle, so the legislation is able to easily respond to changes in building trends and practices. Comment Officials do not believe a broad statement of principle is necessary because the proposed definition of new build land is already quite broad. If either a change to the definition of new build land or the inclusion of a statement of principle is later considered necessary, these could be made in a future tax Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarify meaning of “added to the land” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It should be clarified whether an existing house that is shifted to a different location on the same piece of land/title and has its code compliance certificate (CCC) issued on or after 27 March 2020 would meet the definition of new build land. Comment The property described by the submitter would qualify as new build land. It is expected that, in most instances, a dwelling would generally only be moved to a different position on the same site to allow for additional dwellings to be added to the land. The difficulty and cost of shifting a house, and obtaining a CCC, is expected to be significant enough that taxpayers are unlikely to engage in this sort of behaviour just so their land qualifies as “new build land”. Officials note that if a taxpayer shifted a house to a different position on the same piece of land/title solely to gain the new build exemption, this would be considered tax avoidance. Officials note that Inland Revenue will provide guidance on the intended meaning of “added to the land”. 129 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarify definition of “self-contained residence or abode” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The meaning of “self-contained residence or abode” is unclear and needs to be better defined in guidance issued by Inland Revenue. Specifically, it is unclear whether a dwelling would qualify if it: • shares a roof with another dwelling, • shares an entranceway with another dwelling, • has an internal door through which the main home can be accessed, or • shares power or utilities with another dwelling. Relying only on a dwelling having a separate kitchen or bathroom could result in unintended behavioural outcomes. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment “New build land” is generally defined to mean residential land to which a self-contained dwelling has been added, provided the dwelling receives its code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2020. “Self-contained” is intended to mean the dwelling has its own kitchen, bathroom, and entranceway. It is intended that if a dwelling: • Shares a roof with another dwelling: provided it is self-contained (with its own kitchen and bathroom), the dwelling would qualify. • Shares an entranceway with another dwelling: provided it has a separate “front door”, the dwelling would qualify, even if it shares with another dwelling an entrance way or such other communal area or areas as are necessary to enable access to the front door of the dwelling. (This part of officials’ comments incorporates changes made following a discussion with the Committee’s advisor.) • Has an internal door that can be used to access another dwelling: if the internal access door can be locked and the dwelling is otherwise self-contained (that is, has its own kitchen, bathroom, and front door), the dwelling would qualify. • Shares a power or utilities connection with another dwelling: provided it is self- contained, the dwelling would qualify (it should not matter whether the dwelling shares a power or utilities connection with another dwelling). Officials will ensure that guidance is released explaining the intended meaning of “self- contained”. 130 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments, as discussed with the Committee’s advisor. Issue: Guidance on “reasonable proportion of shared areas of land” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) Inland Revenue should publish guidance setting out the meaning of “reasonable” in proposed section DH 5(7)(b) and how it would be satisfied Comment The proposed definition of new build land includes land used exclusively by a new build and a reasonable proportion of shared areas attributable to the new build, such as a shared driveway. Guidance will be published explaining the intended meaning of “reasonable proportion of shared areas of land”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Off-the-plans acquisitions Submission (Deloitte) Proposed new section DH 5(7)(c) is unnecessary because proposed new section DH 4(2)(3) applies to bare land. Comment The Bill proposes that new build land includes land for which there is an agreement to add a self-contained dwelling, provided the dwelling will receive its code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2020. The proposed development exemption would apply where a taxpayer is developing, subdividing or building to create new build land. Proposed new section DH 5(7)(c) is necessary because it is intended to work in conjunction with the new build exemption in proposed section DH 4(1) to enable a taxpayer who acquires a new build off the plans to qualify for the new build exemption before the new build is complete (for example, to enable interest to be deducted where there is a nexus with income and a taxpayer has put a deposit down to purchase a new build off the plans). Proposed new section DH 4(3) applies to the developer who is adding the new build to the land, not the taxpayer who acquires the new build off the plans. The development and new build exemptions are intended to apply concurrently to the acquirer and the developer where a new build is acquired off the plans. 131 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting issues Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, KPMG) a. Commercial to residential conversions: it is not clear from the legislation that commercial to residential conversions (other than hotel or motel conversions) can qualify as new build land. The legislation should be clarified (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, KPMG) b. Single dwelling converted into multiple dwellings: it should be clarified that where an existing dwelling on residential land is converted into two or more self-contained dwellings, this will meet the definition of new build land. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment a. It is intended that commercial to residential conversions would qualify as new build land provided they receive a code compliance certificate (except where the exception for hotels/motels applies). Officials recommend the legislation be amended so that conversions explicitly qualify as new build land. b. Ex isting dwellings that are converted into two or more self-contained dwellings are also intended to meet the definition of new build land, and officials consider the draft legislation already satisfies the policy intent in this regard. However, officials will refer this submission to the drafter for their consideration. We will also publish further guidance on the eligibility of conversions. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be noted. 132 EXEMPTION FOR NEW BUILD LAND Clause 64E (proposed sections DH 4(1), DH 5(1), (7)), 127(1E) and 127(10D) Issue: General support Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Kiwi Property Group Limited, Magan Lal, Property Council New Zealand, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) The submitters support applying an exemption from interest limitation to new builds. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Encourage increasing supply Submission (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council New Zealand) The regulatory settings should encourage increasing supply as much as possible. Comment The proposed exemption has been designed to capture a broad range of scenarios where new housing supply has increased. However, its design must also consider the need to ensure the exemption does not undermine the objective of the interest limitation rules, which is to tilt the playing field for residential property away from investors and towards first home buyers and owner occupiers. If the exemption was designed too broadly, it would undermine that objective because a greater proportion of existing housing stock would qualify for an exemption from interest limitation. Officials consider the design of the proposed exemption strikes an appropriate balance between these objectives. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Opposition Submission (Terrence Denton) New builds should be incentivised by means other than tax. The proposed new build exemption is extremely generous and will create a severe distortion of the rental and housing markets. Income tax should be based on actual income, not “phantom income” that will not be realised. Taxing capital gains of non-new builds at a higher tax rate and having a capital gains tax concession for new builds would be better because it does not affect cash flow. 133 Comment The Government has decided to introduce the current proposals to tilt the playing field for residential property away from investors and towards first home buyers and owner-occupiers. The purpose of the exemption is to ensure interest limitation would not negatively impact on the supply of new housing. Implementing a capital gains tax is not within the scope of the proposed measures. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consequences for first home buyers and owner- occupiers Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited) The exemption may have unintended consequences by accentuating the existing ability of investors to leverage their property portfolios and outbid first home buyers and other owner- occupiers. Comment Officials acknowledge the concern raised by submitters. However, while new build prices may increase (or not be dampened by interest limitation), more investor demand is expected to shift away from older housing stock. This would make older housing stock more affordable for owner-occupiers, while still ensuring that continued investment in new builds is not disincentivised. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Arbitrage possibilities Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited) The new build exemption, combined with allowing deferred interest deductions to become deductible on revenue account, could create unforeseen arbitrage possibilities. Comment Officials acknowledge the concern raised by submitters. Creating new definitions and boundaries may create the opportunity for arbitrage. However, we have endeavoured to design the rules so that such boundaries are robust, clear, and easy to comply with. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 134 Issue: Impacts on investors Submission (EY, Simeon Clarke) The proposals will simply alter the mix of investors in the sector. (EY) The measures should focus on the larger players, not the smaller ones.(Simeon Clarke) Comment It is unclear what impact the proposals would have on different types of residential property investors, but it is possible that the proposals may have the consequences suggested by the submitters. The Government considers the proposals necessary to ensure that new housing supply is not negatively impacted by the proposed interest limitation rules, while still tilting the playing field for residential property away from investors and towards owner- occupiers/first home buyers. They are not targeted towards any particular investor, but rather are intended to apply broadly to investors with residential property. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Negative impact on tenants Submission (Olivershaw Limited) Landlords will prefer new builds over existing builds, and new builds will cost more to rent. This will impact tenants who cannot afford the rent for a new build. Affected tenants could include: • tertiary students • taxpayers who have left the family home but do not have capital to fund acquisition of a new home • taxpayers planning an OE or a move to another city in the short-to-medium term • new migrants to New Zealand and people who have come to New Zealand for an OE or work experience • taxpayers who experience a change in family circumstances, such as a relationship break up, and • taxpayers who are retired or have low wages and cannot afford to own their own home. Comment The concerns raised by the submitter may be relevant to the overall policy of interest limitation, as the Government has decided to introduce the interest limitation rules to tilt the playing field for residential property away from investors and towards first home buyers/owner-occupiers. However, we do not agree that the new build exemption will increase rents. Without it, costs to investors in new builds would be higher, their investment in all property would be less, and rents would probably be higher than they will be with the 135 exemption. The Government has also introduced a suite of other non-tax measures that are aimed at addressing current housing issues in New Zealand to increase supply and minimise upward pressure on rents. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Review of effectiveness Submission (Magan Lal) The effectiveness of the new build exemption at increasing new housing supply should be reviewed after it has been in place for a year. Comment Reviewing the effectiveness of the rules after they have only been in place for one year is unlikely to provide enough information to assess whether the exemption has achieved its objective. There is currently no commitment to a formal review of the rules. However, Inland Revenue will be committing resources to reviewing remedial changes that may be required once the rules are implemented. Further, Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for the monitoring of New Zealand’s housing and urban development system. As part of this role, HUD collects and analyses data and research on this system, including measures of housing and rental affordability. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Eligibility of interest incurred for existing dwellings Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Findex, Kiwi Property Group Limited, KPMG, Magan Lal, Olivershaw Limited, Property Council New Zealand, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) Various submissions were made regarding the eligibility of interest incurred in relation to expenditure on existing dwellings. a. Improving, renovating, repairing, and maintaining existing dwellings: Interest on borrowing relating to renovations, repairs and maintenance should be deductible. Denying deductions for improvements to a property conflicts with the Government’s approach of encouraging warm, dry rentals. Property owners who make repairs and upgrades to their properties to satisfy existing requirements, such as the healthy homes standards, should not have to absorb the cost. (Findex, Magan Lal, Olivershaw Limited) 136 b. Remediation of existing dwellings: Interest on remediation expenditure should qualify. (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Olivershaw Limited, Property Council New Zealand, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) Submitters suggested ways the exemption could be designed: • Taxpayers could make a statutory declaration when they claim the exemption. (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council New Zealand) • Interest on borrowing related to any new capital expenditure should continue to be deductible. (Olivershaw Limited) • Alternatively, interest on any “significant” expenditure required for a dwelling to meet the requirements to be rented out should qualify. (Olivershaw Limited) c. Extensive remediation of uninhabitable dwellings: The definition of new build land should be expanded to include the extensive remediation of a residential property that was previously uninhabitable (such as a property damaged by a natural disaster). (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Comment The purpose of the exemptions from interest limitation is to ensure that investment in new housing supply is not negatively impacted by the interest limitation rules. Officials agree that in principle, interest incurred in relation to expenditure on existing dwellings should qualify for an exemption if the expenditure helps prevents a dwelling falling out of existing housing stock. Furthermore, ideally tax settings would not influence decisions to remediate or demolish and replace a property. Officials recommend expanding the definition of “new build land” 6 so that it includes: • dwellings previously on the earthquake-prone buildings register that have been remediated and removed from the register on or after 27 March 2020 7 , and • pr eviously leaky buildings that have been reclad, provided at least 75% 8 of the dwelling is reclad and a code compliance certificate (CCC) for the recladding work is issued on or after 27 March 2020. Whether existing dwellings have been on the earthquake-prone buildings register, or have been leaky but substantially reclad, can be verified through external records. This means whether such a property is eligible for the new build exemption is objectively verifiable by both Inland Revenue and potential subsequent purchasers of these dwellings. Given the significant cost of such remediation work, and because the eligibility of these properties would be objectively verifiable, we consider it appropriate for them to qualify for the new build exemption once the remediation work is complete. 6 Land that becomes “new build land” because an existing dwelling on it is remediated may also qualify for the 5-year new build bright-line test, because the term “new build land” is also used by that test. 7 Provided a CCC has also been issued on or after 27 March 2020 evidencing the building work to remediate the dwelling is complete. Alternatively, if no CCC is issued, then the work must be recorded as having been completed on or after 27 March 2020 in local authority or building consent authority records, and the records must show that a suitably qualified engineer has verified the work is complete. 8 Officials do not consider it appropriate to allow the 20-year new build exemption to apply to leaky buildings that have been less than 75% reclad. The new build exemption applies to all interest incurred for a new build property for 20 years and can be passed on to subsequent purchasers during this period. Officials consider the amount of work undertaken must be significant for a property to qualify as a new build. Therefore, we do not recommend extending the exemption to apply to leaky buildings that are less than 75% reclad. 137 a. Improving, renovating, repairing, and maintaining existing dwellings: Officials disagree with this submission and do not recommend expanding the exemption to cover interest on such expenditure for the following reasons: • Landlords are already required to maintain their properties to a reasonable state of repair. Providing an exemption should not impact upon behaviour if it is already required under existing law. • The amount of interest on expenditure incurred to bring a property up to the healthy homes standards (such as to install a heat pump) is unlikely to be significant. Incurring such expenditure is already required for a property to be rented out, so providing an exemption for interest on the expenditure should not make any difference to whether the expenditure is incurred. This sort of work also does not stop a dwelling dropping out of existing housing stock - dwellings that do not meet the healthy homes standards may still be occupied by first home buyers/owner-occupiers, even though they cannot be rented out to tenants. • The addition of a room, or an upgrade to the kitchen or bathroom of a home, is not required to stop a house from falling out of the existing stock. While an extra room may be used as a bedroom, it may instead be put to another use (for example, it could be used as a home office). Therefore, adding another room may not necessarily increase the number of people that live in a property. Upgrading a kitchen or bathroom may make a property nicer to live in, but it does not otherwise directly impact upon housing stock/supply. Points of difference b. Remediation of existing dwellings: Officials agree that some remediation should qualify but do not recommend expanding the exemption beyond the two categories recommended above (which would expand the exemption to remediated properties that were on the earthquake-prone buildings register or were leaky and have been more than 75% reclad). Officials disagree with the design suggestions put forward by the submitters for the following reasons: • Requiring statutory declarations when the exemption is claimed would increase administration and compliance costs. What is considered “remediation”, and whether a property satisfies whatever threshold is set, would not be objectively verifiable from a statutory declaration alone. Some remediation work may not result in a CCC, so subsequent purchasers of the property may find it difficult to verify whether a property qualifies for the exemption. • Expanding the exemption to all capital account expenditure on existing dwellings would significantly expand the number of taxpayers that qualify for the exemption. Instead of applying to a small subset of investors, the exemption would potentially apply to all residential property investors. This would make it challenging for Inland Revenue to monitor and enforce compliance with the proposed new rules. The same arguments made for not expanding the exemption in the discussion of submission a. above would also apply to expanding the exemption to interest on capital account expenditure. • Introducing a rule that allows interest on “significant” expenditure to qualify would increase the complexity and uncertainty of the rules, especially if the definition of “significant” was left for the courts to decide (as suggested by the submitter). As the rules need to be clear and easy to apply, we do not recommend adopting the submitter’s suggested rule. c. Extensive remediation of uninhabitable dwellings: There is an argument that these properties should qualify because remediating them brings them back into New Zealand’s housing stock. However, apart from the two categories mentioned above, officials do not 138 recommend expanding the new build exemption to cover other remediated (formerly) uninhabitable dwellings for the following reasons: • It is difficult to define “habitable” and “uninhabitable”. Dangerous and insanitary building notices are infrequently used, so tying the definition of “uninhabitable” to the issue of such notices would be impractical. • There may not be any objective record that taxpayers and Inland Revenue could use to confirm that a property was uninhabitable, or that the property has since become habitable again. This could pose difficulties for subsequent purchasers, in particular, as they would need to be able to check the eligibility of these properties for the exemption over a 20-year period. • Properties damaged in a natural disaster or fire should have insurance cover if they are debt funded, so the owners of these properties should receive an insurance pay- out should damage be caused by such an event. • Some properties may become uninhabitable because of deferred maintenance and repairs (that is, they have ended up uninhabitable through neglect and would have continued to be habitable if they had been regularly maintained and repaired). Providing an exemption for remediating such properties could create perverse incentives. Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. c. That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Application period Submissions (Kiwi Property Group Limited, New Ground Capital, Ockham Residential, Property Council New Zealand) The exemption should apply: • To all taxpayers for 25 years. (Ockham Residential) • To all taxpayers in perpetuity. (New Ground Capital) • To initial owners in perpetuity and to subsequent owners either in perpetuity or for 50 years. (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council New Zealand) Comment Allowing the exemption to apply for more than 20 years could undermine the objectives of the proposed interest limitation rules and the new build exemption. The longer the exemption applies for, the less impact it is likely to have on the following: • Tilting the playing field for residential property away from investors and towards first home buyers/owner-occupiers over time. A longer exemption period would likely result in a greater portion of existing properties eventually becoming exempt from the interest 139 limitation rules. That is, a longer exemption is more likely to undermine the interest limitation rules as a whole. • Investment in new housing supply over time. There would be less of an incentive for investors to invest in “new” new builds if there were a greater number of “old” new builds that still qualified for an exemption. Twenty years was seen as the period most likely to strike an appropriate balance between these two objectives, given the Government’s commitment to both the proposed interest limitation rules and introducing an exemption for new builds. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application period for conversions Submission (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council New Zealand) The exemption should apply for 50 years from the date of completion for dwellings converted from commercial buildings. Comment It is intended that commercial buildings converted to dwellings will qualify for the new build exemption, provided they receive a code compliance certificate (CCC) on or after 27 March 2020 confirming the conversion is complete (unless the dwelling was previously a hotel or motel, in which case it is proposed that an exception to the CCC requirement would apply). However, allowing the exemption to apply for 50 years for these properties would undermine the objectives of the proposed interest limitation rules and the new build exemption. For these reasons, officials do not recommend the exemption be extended to 50 years for these properties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Start of 20-year period Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) For a property that has a code compliance certificate (CCC) issued between 27 March 2020 and 30 September 2021 (inclusive), the 20-year exemption period should begin on 1 October 2021. The exemption is not relevant before this date because interest limitation does not apply until 1 October 2021. 140 Comment While it is correct that the exemption is not relevant until 1 October 2021 (because that is when the interest limitation rules apply from), if the 20-year exemption period started from this date for these properties, this would increase the complexity of the rules. Under current proposals, for most new builds, the 20-year exemption period is counted from the date a new build’s CCC is issued. If the exemption applied from a different date for a small subset of properties, despite those properties having CCCs confirming that they are new builds, this would increase complexity for both Inland Revenue and taxpayers looking to apply the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for existing apportionment methods Submission (Property Council New Zealand) We agree that existing apportionment principles should apply where a new build and existing build are on the same title. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Drafting issues Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, PwC) a. The references to section DH 5(5) in section DH 4(1) should be to section DH 5(7). (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, PwC) b. The legislation should confirm the start date of the exemption for off-the-plans purchases. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials will refer these submissions to the drafters for their consideration. Some comments on the points raised: a. Officials agree. b. Officials consider the legislation already satisfies the policy intent. The new build exemption commences when residential land becomes new build land. In the case of an off -the-plans purchase, this date is when an agreement to add a new build to the land is entered into (proposed new section DH 5(7)(c)). For off-the-plans new builds, even though the exemption applies from the date the agreement was entered into, the 20-year period is counted from the date the new build receives its code compliance certificate. 141 This means the exemption applies for more than 20 years for new builds purchased off the plans. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be noted. Issue: Extended exemption for build-to-rent developments Submission (Kiwi Property Group Limited, New Ground Capital, Property Council New Zealand, PwC, Russell McVeagh) The exemption should apply for more than 20 years for build-to-rent (BTR) developments. A transitional rule for existing BTR dwellings (BTRs) should be considered. (PwC) Comment The extent to which the interest limitation rules will impact upon the BTR sector is unclear, as the sector is still new to New Zealand. Self-contained dwellings in new BTR developments would qualify for the development exemption while they are being added to land, and they would qualify for the new build exemption for 20 years after they receive their code compliance certificates. Officials do not recommend extending the new build exemption so that it applies for more than 20 years. We also do not recommend amending the exemption so that it applies to existing BTRs. Doing as submitters suggest would run the risk of the new build exemption undermining the overall policy objective of the proposed interest limitation rules. The Government is considering whether special rules for BTRs should be introduced and, if so, how these rules should be designed. Further information on whether the Government intends to introduce special rules for BTRs, and how those rules might be designed, will become available in 2022. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 142 TREATMENT OF BUILD-TO-RENT (BTR) PROPERTIES Issue: BTR exclusion from interest limitation is required Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council New Zealand, Ockham Residential, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, Russell McVeagh) BTR dwellings (BTRs) should have a specific exclusion from interest limitation because BTRs: • do not compete with first home buyers • are more comparable with commercial assets, such as student accommodation and retirement villages • will not grow in New Zealand without an exemption that applies in perpetuity, and • provide benefits, such as security of tenure and prompt maintenance for tenants. Comment The Government is currently considering whether there should be an exclusion for large-scale BTR developments and, if so, how the exclusion should be designed. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Design of BTR exclusion Submission (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Magan Lal, Property Council New Zealand, Russell McVeagh,) Various suggestions for how a BTR exclusion could be designed were put forward by submitters. In addition to applying to new build BTR dwellings (BTRs), design features suggested by submitters included: • Application to existing (that is, non-new build) BTRs - the exclusion should apply to: • all existing BTRs, or • only to existing BTRs that received their code compliance certificates (CCCs) in the ten years before 27 March 2021, provided they have always been owned by a legitimate BTR developer/investor since being constructed • Scale - the exclusion should apply to: • any BTR dwelling, regardless of scale, or • BTR developments of a sufficient scale (for example, comprised of a portfolio of at least 50 self-contained dwellings) 143 • Unified ownership - the BTRs should be let separately but held in unified ownership • Exemption period - the exemption should apply in perpetuity • Designed for long-term tenancy - the exemption should apply to assets specifically designed, constructed, or adapted for long-term residential tenancies • Required to have shared amenities - some form of shared amenity should be required • Minimum period of use as long-term tenancy - the BTRs should be dedicated to residential tenancies for at least eight years • Management standards - the BTR developments should be run by professional and qualified management, with oversight under a single entity • Always used as a rental - the BTRs should be required to have been continually configured as dwellings used as residential premises for the purposes of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 since the CCCs were issued for the dwellings • Always owned by the same person - the ownership of the BTRs must not have been transferred since the time they received their CCCs, and • GST requirements - the rental income from the BTRs must be GST exempt, and GST on inputs must not have been deducted by the owners. Some submitters put forward specific wording for use in the legislation, and it was suggested that the definition of a BTR could be added to section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment The Government is currently considering whether there should be special rules for BTRs and, if so, how those rules should be designed. The design suggestions put forward by submitters will be considered if the Government decides to put special rules for BTRs in place. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 144 ROLLOVER RELIEF – INTEREST LIMITATION Clauses 80B, 80C and 80D Issue: Drafting issues Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The drafting of the proposed rollover relief provisions for interest limitation purposes is unclear. a. The legislation needs to clearly state that a loan drawn down by, or transferred to, the recipient of disallowed residential property will be treated as meeting the requirements of proposed section DH 5(5) if a loan held by the transferor was a grandparented transitional loan. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) b. There are no specific provisions dealing with the transfer of financial arrangements under a relationship property agreement (except where the financial arrangement is one existing before the introduction of the financial arrangements rules). (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) c. Proposed section FC 9(4) should be amended to make clear the amount the executor, administrator or beneficiary of an estate can claim as a deduction if they derive income from the disposal of disallowed residential property. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) d. The language used in proposed section FC 9(4) is confusing and should be clarified. A plain English substitution for the existing wording would be preferable. Section FC 9(5) also refers to “disallowed residential property land”, which is a term not used elsewhere in the proposals. (EY) Comment a. Officials acknowledge that the proposed interest limitation rollover relief provisions need to be clarified so that they reflect the loan drawdown date, rather than being based on the transferor’s acquisition date (which is the case for bright-line rollover relief). An amendment should also be made to provide that a loan drawn down by, or transferred to, the recipient of disallowed residential property is treated as meeting the requirements for interest deductibility if the loan held by the previous owner was a grandparented transitional loan. This will only be the case to the extent that the transferee’s loan balance does not exceed the loan balance of the previous owner at the time, or immediately before, the property was transferred. b. Officials acknowledge the matter raised in the submission. However, further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme Officials note there may be issues arising from the enactment of the proposals that require future remedial legislation, and we are committing resources towards addressing these issues. c. The intention is to provide rollover relief on a transitional basis, so the amount of any interest deductions will be determined by the rules for grandparented transitional loans. The references in proposed section FC 9(4) to the cost of disallowed residential property were made in error. As noted in a. above, the language of section FC 9(4) should be replaced with a statement that a loan drawn down by, or transferred to, the recipient of 145 disallowed residential property will be treated as meeting the requirements for interest deductibility if a loan held by the transferor was a grandparented transitional loan (to the extent the transferee’s loan balance does not exceed the transferor’s loan balance at the time of, or immediately before, the transfer). d. As per the comment at a. above, officials agree the proposed rollover relief provisions should be clarified. Officials consider that, rather than adopting the submitter’s suggestions, the recommendation for a. above will sufficiently address the problems raised with the interest limitation rollover relief proposals. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be declined. c. That the submission be declined. d. That the submission be declined. Issue: Company amalgamations Submission (Matter raised by officials) Consistent with existing rollover relief provided for the bright-line test, rollover relief should apply for interest limitation purposes to a transfer of property as part of a company amalgamation in certain circumstances. Officials recommend that rollover relief apply when disallowed residential property passes from an amalgamating company to an amalgamated company on a resident’s restricted amalgamation on or after 27 March 2021, provided the amalgamating company had a grandparented transitional loan immediately before the transfer. This rollover relief would only be available if the amalgamating and amalgamated companies are New Zealand tax residents and are not treated as non-resident under a tax treaty. This would ensure that, consistent with the rules for bright-line rollover relief, rollover relief for interest limitation purposes would only be provided on the condition that the property remains within the New Zealand tax base. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 146 GRANDPARENTED TRANSITIONAL LOANS THAT CANNOT BE TRACED Clause 64E (proposed sections DH 7 and DH 8) Issue: Stacking should not be limited to loans that cannot be traced Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG, PwC) The stacking approach proposed for grandparented transitional loans that cannot be traced should not be limited to loans where tracing is impossible. In theory, all loans can be traced with enough time and effort. a. The stacking approach should also be allowed for loans where tracing is not easy or is difficult. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG) b. The stacking approach should be allowed for all loans drawn down before 27 March 2021, as the discussion document suggested that tracing would be optional. Alternatively, guidance should be provided on what efforts are required to trace loans. (PwC) Comment Officials agree that the stacking approach should not be limited to loans where tracing is impossible, but we disagree with the suggestion that, in theory, all loans can be traced with enough time and effort. Some taxpayers will genuinely be unable to trace their grandparented transitional loans if the records required to trace them no longer exist or cannot be legally accessed by the taxpayer. Requiring taxpayers to trace grandparented transitional loans wherever possible could impose excessive and unnecessary compliance costs in some cases. Some taxpayers may be able to trace grandparented transitional loans only with enormous amounts of time and effort, disproportionate to the value of the loan. a. Officials agree that the stacking approach should also be allowed in some cases where tracing is not easy or difficult. Officials consider, however, that the stacking approach should not apply to loans that can be traced with reasonable efforts. b. Officials note that the discussion document did not say tracing would be optional. Rather, it said that the transition approach — that is, stacking (or apportionment, which was still being considered at the time) — would be optional, so that taxpayers could still trace if they wanted to. Allowing stacking for all grandparented transitional loans is not appropriate as many loans can be easily traced, and taxpayers should not be allowed to treat loans clearly used to acquire disallowed rental property as being used to acquire other assets, such as shares or KiwiSaver interests. Point of difference a. To mitigate unnecessary compliance costs, officials consider that the stacking approach should be extended to loans that cannot reasonably be traced. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 147 b. That the submission be declined. Issue: Repayments for taxpayers that have applied the stacking approach Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed section DH 7(4) should be amended so that a repayment sourced from the disposal of allowed property repays the loan allocated to that allowed property first. When a taxpayer applies the proposed stacking approach to a grandparented transitional loan, their actual loan can effectively be split, for tax purposes, into two “notional” loans — one is treated as being used for disallowed residential property, and one is treated as being used for allowed property. Rules are needed to determine which notional loan a repayment is treated as reducing. Proposed section DH 7(4) contains both a general rule and an exception to it: • The general rule provides that a repayment is applied against the notional loan principal first (that is, the repayment first reduces the notional loan treated as being used for disallowed residential property). • However, the exception to that general rule provides that if the repayment is sourced from the disposal of allowed property described in section DH 7(3)(b), the notional loan principal is not reduced by the repayment. Thus, under proposed section DH 7(4), if a taxpayer has applied the stacking approach to a grandparented transitional loan, repayments of that loan will not reduce the notional loan principal if the repayment is sourced from the disposal of allowed property. If a repayment is greater than the 26 March 2021 value of the allowed property that was disposed (for example, if the allowed property has since increased in value), this exception can cause the notional loan principal under proposed section DH 7 to be greater than the actual balance of the grandparented transitional loan. This is unintended. For example, assume a taxpayer has a $500,000 grandparented transitional loan used for both disallowed residential property and allowed property. The value of the taxpayer’s allowed property on 26 March 2021 is $300,000, so the notional loan principal under proposed section DH 7(4) is $200,000. The taxpayer then sells the allowed property for $350,000 and uses the proceeds to make a $350,000 repayment. The balance of the grandparented transitional loan is reduced to $150,000. However, as the repayment is sourced from the disposal of allowed property, the exception in proposed section DH 7(4) provides that the notional loan principal is not reduced and remains $200,000. Accordingly, proposed section DH 7(4) should be amended so that if a repayment is sourced from the disposal of allowed property, it should first repay the loan allocated to the allowed property disposed of, with any remainder being allocated to the notional loan principal. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 148 HIGH WATER MARK Clause 64E (proposed section DH 10) Issue: Drafting of high water mark Submission (EY, KPMG) The drafting of proposed section DH 10 could be simplified and improved. Comment Officials agree that the drafting of section DH 10 can be improved to ensure its intended purpose, consistent with the Commentary to the Bill, is clearer. These recommended improvements have been influenced by the submissions provided and have been discussed with submitters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Variable balance loans Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The high water mark proposal should be limited to apply only to variable balance loans (such as a revolving credit facility or overdraft). The fact that a loan that may be drawn down in several tranches does not mean it is a variable balance loan. Comment Officials disagree. Proposed section DH 10(1) provides that the high water mark will apply only to a person who chooses to rely on that method. While a taxpayer who has a loan drawn down in several tranches may not benefit from the high water mark proposal (for example, because a subsequent draw down takes them over the initial loan balance), it will still be optional whether they apply it. Even if they choose to apply it, they will not be impacted beyond the additional compliance costs of considering the section, as it is not intended to reduce the interest deductions that would otherwise be available. Rather than risk excluding a taxpayer who could benefit from the provision, officials consider it is better to have the provision apply more widely, even if it is of no benefit to many of the taxpayers who could be eligible. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 149 Issue: Variable balance loans used for multiple purposes Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Where a variable balance loan has been used for multiple purposes, section DH 10 should clarify that a person must first establish what part of the variable balance loan applies to disallowed residential property before the section applies. Comment Officials agree this calculation must be made before calculating the initial loan balance and subsequent amounts. The initial loan balance would be equal to the loan balance attributed to disallowed residential property if section DH 10 was not applied. While this was always intended, officials agree this could be clarified in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Deposits before 27 March 2021 and the high water mark Submission (Terence Denton) The high water mark needs to take account of deposits made into revolving credit type facilities before 27 March 2021. Given these deposits are likely to be sporadic and typically of many small amounts, the task of tracking these back over the life of the facility will be insurmountable in most cases. Comment Officials disagree. The high water mark proposal minimises compliance costs by determining the initial loan balance on 27 March 2021. It will still be necessary to trace (or stack, when tracing is not possible) funding to disallowed residential property, but this is not specific to the high water mark. A deposit made shortly before 27 March will not provide the same high water mark benefit as one made shortly after 27 March. However, this is an unavoidable consequence of a rule that applies from a specified date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Compound interest Submission (Terence Denton) Compound interest should not be captured under the high water mark and grandparenting provisions as new lending when it is associated with the original loan. 150 Comment Officials disagree. Compound interest arises when interest charged on a loan is added to the outstanding loan balance and interest is then charged on the new higher loan balance. As the loan balance increases by the amount of interest charged, this is new lending in the same way that increasing the loan balance to pay costs of holding a disallowed residential property is also new lending. This new lending was not made before 27 March 2021 and so would not be eligible to be treated as grandparented residential interest. Therefore, it should not be added to the initial loan balance for calculating the high water mark. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 151 REFINANCING Issue: Support for refinancing Submission (Capital Accounting Associates Limited, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Submitters support the inclusion of a provision allowing a second loan taken out to repay a grandparented transitional loan to follow the treatment of that grandparented transitional loan. Comment The proposed legislation, as released, did not include this provision, but officials will recommend the committee agree to include one. Note that provisions for refinancing will have application beyond the transitional period to 31 March 2025 to ensure that refinanced loans have the same use as the original loan (for example, a loan to acquire shares in an interposed residential property holder). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Refinancing with a foreign currency loan Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The refinancing provision should also apply when a taxpayer refinances with a loan denominated in a foreign currency. Comment This submission relates to the submitter’s separate submission that a foreign currency loan should be eligible for deductions as grandparented residential interest (see “Issue: Deduction for foreign currency loans” below). As officials recommend that interest from foreign currency loans for disallowed residential property should not be deductible from the start of the rules, there is no need for interest on a loan refinanced into a foreign currency to be treated as grandparented residential interest. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 152 LOANS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY Clauses 55B and 64E (proposed section DH 9) Issue: Support for excluding income from foreign currency loans Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG) If interest on a foreign currency loan is not deductible, the submitters support exempting the income arising from a foreign currency loan. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Deduction for foreign currency loans Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, nsaTax Limited, Russell McVeagh) Taxpayers should not be denied interest deductions during the transitional phase for a foreign currency loan. To overcome complexity, the transitional phasing rule for these types of loans could allow taxpayers to convert the interest payments (excluding any foreign exchange gain or loss) into NZD using the appropriate exchange rate. Comment Officials agree that, conceptually, interest on a foreign currency loan should be treated consistently with interest on a New Zealand dollar loan. However, we continue to consider that the complexity of the rules required to give effect to the proposal outweighs this. Under the financial arrangements rules, there is no distinction between interest incurred and foreign exchange gains and losses, with the net of these amounts being treated as interest. Interest rates can vary significantly across different currencies. However, under covered interest parity, exchange rate movements would be expected to more closely align the expected total cost to a borrower. Allowing a deduction for the New Zealand dollar equivalent of a foreign currency interest expense could result in a deduction that was larger (and potentially sometimes much larger) than the amount actually incurred by the borrower. Furthermore, this treatment would require the transitional period to be carved out of the treatment as a single financial arrangement. This is because any foreign exchange movements would need to be excluded from the base price adjustment when the arrangement matured. While these issues are not insurmountable, they would add significant complexity to both the housing proposals and the financial arrangements rules. The treatment itself would benefit very few taxpayers and only during the transitional period until 31 March 2025. While we expect that not all affected taxpayers would be willing or able to refinance into a New Zealand Dollar loan to retain partial interest deductibility, the taxpayers that do will further reduce 153 the pool of affected taxpayers. On balance, we continue to consider that denying all interest deductions on foreign currency loans for disallowed residential property from the start date of the rules is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Base price adjustment for previously taxed foreign currency loans Submission (EY) There should be a base price adjustment (BPA) triggered for any loans that have been previously taxed under the financial arrangements rules. This mechanism would allow a wash-up on exit to ensure there is no over- or under-taxation. Comment Officials agree that a BPA should be required when a foreign currency loan is no longer deductible to ensure that any foreign currency gains and losses are brought within the tax base and no over- or under-taxation occurs. However, this is an existing issue with the financial arrangements rules, and no provision to deal with these circumstances currently exists. For example, if a person’s variable principal debt instruments (for example, credit cards) drop below $50,000 for all days of a year, they become excepted financial arrangements and cease to be financial arrangements, and yet there is no explicit provision to trigger a BPA. Officials agree that the legislation in this area could be clearer. However, in our opinion this should be considered more generally as part of a wider financial arrangements project, rather than just for disallowed residential property. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interest rate swaps Submission (PwC) Gains or losses on interest rate swaps for affected loans should be non-assessable or non- deductible as applicable. Comment As with “Issue: Base price adjustment for previously taxed foreign currency loans” above, this is an existing issue within the financial arrangements rules. For example, under the financial arrangements rules, there is no carve out for an interest rate swap that effectively converts a New Zealand dollar loan used for private purposes into a foreign currency loan. In 154 our opinion, it would be more appropriate to consider this as part of a future wider review of the financial arrangements rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 155 MIXED-USE ASSETS Clauses 64B to 64D Issue: Mixed-use asset rules should be reviewed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Findex) The mixed-use asset (MUA) rules are overly complex and do not always work as intended. In addition, there is overlap with the proposed interest limitation rules – both limit interest deductions where there is a business purpose, but the Government considers there is a private benefit. The MUA rules should be reviewed to determine whether they are still needed, and whether they are fit for purpose. If they are needed and fit for purpose, they should be simplified. Comment It is not correct that the proposed interest limitation rules reflect a government view that interest deductions give rise to a private benefit. The rationale for the proposed rules is quite different from the rationale for the MUA rules. Though they can both apply to the same subject matter (for example, a holiday home that is rented out), the MUA rules also apply to new build holiday homes, and to boats and aircraft. The MUA rules are complex only in relation to allocation of interest to mixed-use assets held in close companies. Officials understand it is relatively uncommon for assets to be held in this way. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interest allocation rules for MUAs should be aligned to tracing approach for residential property Submission (Olivershaw Limited) Having two different interest allocation rules relating to mixed use residential rental property held by close companies results in extreme complexity. The mixed use asset interest allocation rule should be aligned to the tracing rules. This would ensure consistency and simpler rules. Comment Officials agree it would have been simpler to have one set of interest allocation rules. However, we also understand that the effect of the existing mixed-use asset (MUA) interest allocation rules is that MUAs are very rarely held by closely-held companies. Accordingly, the practical impact of the complexity created by two sets of rules is likely to be limited. We note also that it would be unfortunate if the more rigorous interest allocation rules for MUAs that are not residential rental properties were abandoned as a consequence of the residential rental property interest limitation. 156 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Further amendments required to clarify interest allocation Submission (Matters raised by officials) Further amendments are required to clarify that interest incurred by a close company or certain related parties is intended to be allocated under section DG 9 as well as section DG 10. The proposed introduction of subpart DH has made it desirable to re-organise the method of allocating interest incurred by a close company in relation to a mixed-use asset (MUA) that is also subject to interest limitation under proposed new subpart DH. Because subpart DH applies a tracing approach to the allocation of interest, when interest is allocated to a MUA that is subject to subpart DH: • That interest should also be allocated to the MUA for the purposes of subpart DG. This requires applying section DG 9 (which uses a tracing approach), rather than section DG 10 and section DG 11 (which use a stacking approach). • The stacking allocation in sections DG 10 to DG 13 needs to take account of the prior tracing allocation. Clause 64D contains some amendments to achieve this. However, further amendments are required to section DG 10 and section DG 11 to ensure this result. For example, section DG 10(1) should not apply to interest relating to residential land that is subject to subpart DH. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Amendments required to reduce scope of sections DG 12 and DG 13 Submission (Matter raised by officials) New clauses are needed to reduce the scope of existing sections DG 12 and DG 13 to exclude interest that relates to disallowed residential property or an interest in an interposed residential property holder. Section DG 12 applies when a company (Company B) is a member of a group of companies with a close company or qualifying company (Company A) that holds a mixed-use asset (MUA) where Company A’s debt is less than the value of the MUA. In this case, a portion of Company B’s interest is allocated (using a stacking approach) to Company A’s MUA and subject to deduction denial on the basis that it has a private purpose. This should not apply to the extent that interest on Company B’s debt is already denied a deduction because it 157 relates to disallowed residential property or an interest in an interposed residential property holder. Section DG 13 similarly denies deductions in certain circumstances for interest expenditure incurred by a company that is a direct or indirect shareholder in a company that holds a MUA or is in the same group as such a company. It applies only if the amount of debt on which deductions have been denied under sections DG 8, DG 11 and DG 12 is less than the value of the MUA. As with section DG 12, section DG 13 needs to be amended so it does not apply to the extent that the shareholder company’s debt is already denied a deduction because it relates to disallowed residential property or an interest in an interposed residential property holder. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Amendment required to section DG 14 to apply section DH 8(1)(c) first Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is required to section DG 14 to ensure it does not deny a deduction for interest where a deduction is already denied under section DH 8(1)(c). If section DG 14 applies to shares in a company that are also an interest in an interposed residential property holder, then there are two different rules that deny a deduction for interest on debt relating to those shares. A rule is needed to co-ordinate the application of these two rules. Officials consider the best approach is to apply section DH 8(1) first. This will deny a deduction completely for a portion of the interest equal to the residential property percentage. This percentage is calculated on the basis that mixed-use assets are not disallowed assets. Section DG 14 can then apply to the portion of the debt/interest expense for which a deduction has not been denied. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Residential property percentage formula in proposed section DH 6 needs correction Submission (Matter raised by officials) In the Bill as it currently exists, the residential property percentage formula compares the value of disallowed residential property excluding mixed-use assets (MUAs) with the value of all property excluding MUAs. The second exclusion is not appropriate. The purpose of the formula is to determine the percentage of the company’s assets that is represented by disallowed residential property. Because disallowed residential property that is also a MUA is subject to an entirely different regime for dealing with interposed entities, such assets are excluded from the numerator of the formula. There is no basis, however, for excluding those assets from the denominator. 158 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 159 DISPOSAL OF DISALLOWED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY SUBJECT TO INTEREST LIMITATION Issue: Treatment of disposals of disallowed residential property Submissions (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Kiwi Property Group Limited, KPMG, Olivershaw Limited, Property Council of New Zealand) Submitters were generally supportive of the proposal to allow the disallowed interest that would otherwise be deductible to be deducted when the property was sold on revenue account, but they also asked that the circumstances where the deduction was available be expanded and that restrictions on allowing the deductions be reduced or removed. They submitted that: a. Interest should be deductible when the sale is on revenue account under the bright-line test. (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand) b. Limitations on deducting the interest under the bright-line test anti-arbitrage rule and the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules should not apply. (Kiwi Property Group Limited, Property Council of New Zealand) c. To the extent interest exceeds any non-taxable capital gain, it should be deductible when property is sold on capital account. (KPMG, Olivershaw Limited) Comment a. Inland Revenue is proposing to consult on its views on the deductibility of holding costs for residential investment property, including interest. This will include the situation of a property being sold and taxable under the bright-line test. The outcome of that process should determine how previously denied interest would be treated in a bright-line sale. b. Officials consider that the bright-line test anti-arbitrage rule and residential rental loss ring-fencing rules should continue to apply as they currently do. The residential rental loss ring-fencing rules are discussed further below (see “Issue: Repeal of residential rental loss ring-fencing rules”). c. Officials consulted on the possibility of extending the proposal to allow deductions for interest on capital account sales in the discussion document Design of the interest limitation rule and additional bright-line rules (Option F in Chapter 5). However, it was decided that this would increase complexity of the rules and reduce the effectiveness of the interest limitation policy by reducing demand from investors for residential investment property. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 160 INTERPOSED ENTITY RULES Clause 64E (proposed sections DH 5, DH 6 and DH 8) Issue: Interposed entity rules necessary Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter agrees in principle that interposed entity rules are necessary. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Interposed entity rules require simplification Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The rules are complex and confusing, will be difficult for most taxpayers to apply and should be simplified. Comment Officials have tried to keep the interposed entity rules as simple as possible. Some minor drafting changes are proposed with a view to improving readability. Given the complex nature of interposed entity arrangements and the need for rules to prevent taxpayers from using such arrangements to obtain deductions for interest on loans that indirectly fund residential investment property, some complexity in the rules is inevitable. Most taxpayers will not be required to apply the interposed entity rules. The rules will not apply simply because a disallowed residential property is held in a trust or company. The rules will only apply if a taxpayer borrows to acquire a share in the company or to become a beneficiary of the trust and the value, as a percentage, of disallowed residential property held by the company or trust exceeds a proportion of the company’s or trust’s total assets. The proportion of disallowed residential properties held by companies is very small. 9 While the proportion of disallowed residential properties held by trusts is slightly greater, 10 it is highly unusual for people to borrow money to become a beneficiary of a trust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 Around 4% of taxpayers reporting rental income in 2019. 10 Around 8% of taxpayers reporting rental income in 2019. 161 Issue: The effect of the proposed rules overreach Submission (Deloitte) The proposed interposed entity rules overreach because they deny all interest incurred for an interposed company, even if 49% to 89% of the company’s assets are not disallowed property. Comment Close companies The submitter appears to misinterpret the draft legislation. When the interposed residential property holder is a close company, the amount of interest that will be denied is in proportion to the disallowed assets held by the company. For example, if a close company’s disallowed assets comprise 75% of its total assets, 75% of the person’s interest expenditure will be denied. For the rule to apply, at least 10% of the close company’s total assets must be disallowed assets. Non-close companies When the interposed residential property holder is a non-close company, all interest incurred by a person to acquire shares in the company will be denied if the value of the company’s disallowed assets is more than 50% of its total assets at any time in the income year. This approach is less accurate than the proposed approach for interposed close companies but is simpler, although harsher in effect. The apportionment approach that will apply to interposed close companies would be difficult and impractical to apply to a company that is widely held. Accordingly, all interest deductions will be denied if the interposed non-close company holds more than 50% disallowed assets. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: No grandparenting for interposed entities Submission (Deloitte) The submitter has queried whether it is intended that grandparenting of interest will not apply to interposed entities. Comment The proposed interest limitation rules provide for the grandparenting of interest incurred on loans drawn down before 27 March 2021 for disallowed residential property. Interest on such loans will be progressively denied from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025. It is proposed that interest incurred to acquire shares in, or become a beneficiary of, an interposed entity will not qualify for grandparenting. 162 Officials note that the number of existing interposed entities is likely to be very small. 11 To extend grandparenting to interest incurred to acquire shares in, or become a beneficiary of, an interposed entity would require complex rules to deal with any changes in the mix of disallowed residential property and other assets held by the interposed entity after 27 March 2021. For example, assume a person borrowed $1m to acquire shares in an interposed close company before 27 March 2021, and the interposed close company has $500,000 disallowed assets and $1m total assets on 27 March 2021. On 27 March 2021, the interposed close company’s residential property percentage would be 50% and, if grandparenting were allowed, 50% of the person’s interest deductions would be limited but grandparented. After 27 March 2021, the interposed close company acquires more disallowed assets so that its residential property percentage increases to 80%. The percentage of the person’s interest deductions that should be limited accordingly increases to 80% but, as some of the close company’s disallowed assets were acquired after 27 March 2021, not all the limited interest deductions should be grandparented. The rules required to determine the correct amount of grandparenting in such a situation would be very complex, especially as situations in practice are likely to involve many more fluctuations in the close company’s residential property percentage over the transitional period. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Restructuring to fall outside rules should not be tax avoidance Submission (Deloitte) It should be made clear that taxpayers who choose to restructure commercial arrangements to fall outside of the interposed close company rules are not committing "tax avoidance". Comment The application of section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the general anti-avoidance provision) is an intensely fact-based inquiry. Whether section BG 1 applies to a restructuring arrangement that has a purpose or effect of falling outside of the interposed entity rules will depend on the specific facts of the arrangement. An exemption from section BG 1 for restructuring arrangements is not appropriate because, depending on the facts, such arrangements might be tax avoidance arrangements. Taxpayers contemplating undertaking restructuring arrangements can apply for a binding ruling to obtain certainty on whether section BG 1 applies to their arrangement. 11 Based on 2019 tax returns, around 4% of taxpayers returning rental income are companies and around 8% are trusts. Of these, only a very small proportion are likely to be interposed entities (which would require the borrowing to occur at the shareholder or beneficiary level rather than at the company or trust level). 163 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Specific rules for LTCs and partnerships not necessary Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It is not necessary to have specific interposed entity rules for look-through companies (LTCs) and partnerships because they are already look-through entities. Comment Officials agree that specific interposed entity rules are not generally needed for LTCs and partnerships. Point of difference However, one instance where a specific rule for LTCs is needed is when a close company elects to become an LTC. This is covered below (see “Issue: Interposed close company elects to become an LTC”). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Interposed close company elects to become an LTC Submission (Matter raised by officials) A provision is required to specify the treatment that applies to a person who incurs interest to acquire shares in an interposed residential property holder that is a close company that becomes a look-through company (LTC). Under the proposed interest limitation rules, interest incurred by a person to own shares in an interposed close company will be denied according to the value of disallowed residential property held by the close company in proportion to its total assets. The Income Tax Act allows close companies to elect to become LTCs, which are treated as transparent for tax purposes. Under the LTC rules, a person with a look-through interest (a shareholder) is treated as holding the property the LTC holds, in proportion to the person’s look-through interest (shareholding) in the LTC, and the LTC is treated as not holding the property. If an LTC holds disallowed residential property, a person with a look-through interest will be treated as holding the disallowed residential property in proportion to their look-through interest. The proposed interest limitation rules do not presently contain a rule that specifies what happens if a close company that is an interposed residential property holder makes an election to become an LTC. Such a rule is required to provide certainty. A rule providing for a transition from the interposed entity apportionment approach (pre-LTC status) to the 164 transparent approach (post-LTC status) would be very complex, both in its drafting and application. As a simplicity measure, officials recommend that a person applying the interposed entity apportionment approach to a close company that makes an LTC election should continue applying that apportionment approach after the effective date of the LTC election until the existing borrowings are repaid. This proposed rule will not affect a person with new borrowings to acquire shares in the LTC after the effective date of the LTC election, which will be subject to the transparent approach (rather than the apportionment approach). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 165 RESIDENTIAL RENTAL LOSS RING-FENCING RULES Issue: Repeal of residential rental loss ring-fencing rules Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, EY, KPMG, Olivershaw Limited) The residential rental loss ring-fencing regime should be repealed. It is no longer necessary and repealing it would reduce complexity. Comment Officials disagree. The residential rental loss ring-fencing regime was enacted in 2019 to reduce the tax benefits from investing in housing. The proposed interest limitation rules will reduce the frequency that the regime applies to restrict deductions. However, it is not redundant. There are many exemptions to the interest limitation rules, such as the 20-year new build exemption, that mean the loss ring-fencing rules could still apply. Repealing the loss ring-fencing rules would mean that some investors would get a better tax result than they do currently, even with the addition of interest limitation. This is contrary to the intent of interest limitation rules, which is to reduce the tax benefits for investors to reduce their demand relative to owner-occupiers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exclusion for Māori authority companies Submission (Pukeroa Oruawhata Trust and Ngati Whakaue Tribal Lands Inc) The residential rental loss ring-fencing rules do not apply to companies other than close companies. Close companies that are Māori authorities, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by a Māori authority or entity eligible to be a Māori authority should also be excluded from the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission but note that it proposes a change to the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules that is not a necessary result of the proposed interest limitation changes. This would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 166 SPECIFIC ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES Clause 85D Issue: On-lending specific anti-avoidance rule not required Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The specific anti-avoidance provision in proposed section GB 53C is not required. This is because transactions falling within the scope of the proposed rule are likely to be very limited and extreme, and therefore section BG 1 (the general anti-avoidance rule) will apply to such contrived transactions. The submitter also suggests that a person who on-lends at a discounted rate to an associated party will have their deductions limited based on an existing Australian case in any event (Ure v FC of T 81 ATC 4100). Comment Officials agree that on-lending arrangements falling within the scope of proposed section GB 53C will likely be outside of Parliament’s contemplation and fall within the scope of section BG 1 (the general anti-avoidance provision). However, as the proposed section GB 53C is a specific anti-avoidance provision, it will provide certainty for taxpayers with on-lending at discount arrangements. Officials also consider that a specific anti-avoidance rule will provide greater certainty for both taxpayers and the Commissioner than relying on Australian case law. Officials are not aware of any New Zealand case law directly on point. The case referred to by the submitter is an Australian decision that has not been applied in New Zealand and has only been mentioned in passing in two New Zealand decisions of the Taxation Review Authority. It is also likely that many taxpayers are unaware of the Australian decision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 167 Bright-line test changes 169 5-YEAR NEW BUILD BRIGHT-LINE TEST Clauses 48, 49, 64E (proposed section DH 5(7)), and 127(1B) and (1C) Issue: General support Submission (KPMG, Ockham Residential) Submitters support a 5-year bright-line period for new builds. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Opposition Submission (Baucher Consulting Limited) The submitter do es not support the proposed 5-year period for the purposes of the bright- line provisions. The shorter bright-line test period may have unintended consequences and encourage churn in such properties. Comment The Government decided to introduce a 5-year bright-line test for new builds to ensure the supply of new builds is not disincentivised by the 10-year bright-line test. Officials acknowledge that a 5-year bright-line test may result in a person selling a new build earlier than they otherwise would have had a 10-year test applied instead. However, this is not inconsistent with the policy objective of the new build bright-line test, as it may result in ‘newish’ builds being available sooner for purchase by first home buyers. The key point is to ensure that the supply of new builds is not disincentivised, which this policy should achieve. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification needed Submission (Deborah Lomax) If there needs to be a bright-line test, the identification of a new build needs further clarification. If delays outside the taxpayer’s control result in a new build’s construction being delayed, it is not equitable for a more stringent bright-line test to apply than would have been the case had construction proceeded as planned. 170 Comment A definition of “new build land” is proposed in the Bill, which officials intend to provide further guidance on. Officials recognise that delays in constructing a new build may be out of a taxpayer’s control. However, such delays should not impact a taxpayer’s ability to benefit from the new build bright-line test. Provided a completed new build is on the land at the time of disposal, the 5-year bright-line period would apply and be counted from the date the land is acquired, not the date the new build is completed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for apportionment Submission (Kiwi Property Group Limited) We agree that apportionment should apply where a new build and an existing build are on the same title. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Valuation apportionment approach Submission (PwC) Taxpayers should be permitted to apportion based on actual valuation, as apportionment ba sed on land area may not provide the most appropriate outcome. Comment The proposed amendments provide that, where a new build and an existing build are on the same title, only the portion of the land that is attributable to the new build is subject to the 5-year new build bright-line test. A land area test is used to determine the new build portion. This means that where land is sold more than 5 years after acquisition, but before 10 years have passed, only the portion of the land relating to the existing build will be taxed. Officials recognise that applying only a land area approach may not necessarily result in the most technically accurate outcome in all cases (when compared with an actual valuation approach), but it is simple and robust. 12 It should therefore be easier for both taxpayers to apply and for Inland Revenue to administer. 12 For example, by comparison, taxpayers using an actual valuation method could choose higher valuations for the new build portion of the land so less of their income is taxed when the property is 171 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: “On the land when disposed of” requirement Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The requirement that a new build must be on the land when disposed of is unfair where a house is destroyed due to natural disaster or fire. Comment Proposed new section CB 6A(2)(b)(iii) requires that land must be new build land at the time of its disposal for the new build bright-line test to apply. This rule was put in place to prevent a person moving a dwelling (for example, a tiny house) on and off the land at the time of sale to enable the new build bright-line test to apply. However, officials agree with the submitter that it is not appropriate for this to apply where a new build has been destroyed due to a natural disaster or fire. Therefore, officials recommend amending the new build bright-line test to provide that residential land does not need to be new build land at the time of disposal where a new build on the land has been destroyed due to a natural disaster or fire that occurred while the taxpayer owned the land. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application to subsequent purchasers Submission (Kiwi Property Group Limited, KPMG, Property Council New Zealand) The new build bright-line test should apply to subsequent purchasers of a new build, so that it is available for the same period as the new build exemption from interest limitation. Comment Proposed new section CB 6A(2) provides that a person must acquire new build land no later than 12 months after the land first meets the definition of new build land for the new build bright-line test to apply. This ensures the new build bright-line test only applies to early owners of a new build, so that the first genuine investor can benefit from the new build bright-line test. A new build may change hands several times after it is first completed before it is finally acquired by a person as a long-term residential investment property. For example, it may be transferred between different companies in the same group (such as from a subsidiary that holds properties during development to another subsidiary company that holds properties ready for sale) before it is finally sold at arm’s length to an investor. disposed of after 5 years of ownership. Unlike a land area test, an actual valuation approach would potentially allow taxpayers to choose from a range of valuations. 172 Officials disagree with submitters that the new build bright-line test should apply to subsequent purchasers. This would not be consistent with the test’s objective, which is to ensure the supply of new housing is not negatively impacted by the extended bright-line test. Allowing the new build bright-line test to apply to subsequent purchasers would potentially incentivise investors to invest in “newish” builds, rather than in “new” new builds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: “New” new build added to existing new build land Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed new section CB 6A(2)(b)(i) should be amended so that the 5-year new build bright- line test may apply where a person acquires land that has previously been new build land, but a “new” new build has been added to the land within the last 12 months. Proposed new section CB 6A(2)(b)(i) provides that a person must acquire new build land no later than 12 months after the land first meets the definition of new build land for the 5-year new build bright-line test to apply. “New build land” is generally defined to mean residential land to which a self-contained dwelling has been added, provided the dwelling receives its code compliance certificate (CCC) on or after 27 March 2020. This creates an issue where land is existing new build land but, some years later, another new build (a “new” new build) is added to it, and the land is then sold within 12 months of the “new” new build being added to the land. For example, assume someone has a new build on a large piece of land (“original new build”) and then adds a “new” new build to the land six years later. If they sell the land within 12 months of the “new” new build being added to it and receiving its CCC, then the policy intent is for the subsequent purchaser to qualify for the new build bright-line test for the “new” new build portion of the land. The portion of the land attributable to the original new build would not qualify for the new build bright-line test for the subsequent purchaser, because the subsequent purchaser is acquiring that part of the property more than 12 months after the original new build received its CCC. However, under the legislation as currently drafted, the subsequent purchaser would not be able to access the new build bright-line test for any part of the land, including the “new” new build portion. This is because the land first met the definition of “new build land” when the original new build was added to it, which was six years before it was acquired by the subsequent purchaser. Officials recommend that section CB 6A(2)(b)(i) is amended to resolve this issue, so that the subsequent purchaser in the example above can access the new build bright-line test for the “new” new build portion of the land. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 173 Issue: Agreement to add new build to land insufficient Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed new section CB 6A(2)(b)(iii) should be amended to provide that the land must meet the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (d) of the definition of new build land at the time of its disposal. Proposed new section CB 6A(2)(b)(iii) provides that land must be “new build land” at the time of its disposal for the new build bright-line test to apply. Paragraph (c) of the definition of new build land includes land for which there is an agreement that a new build will be added to the land (that is, an off-the-plans purchase). This means that the new build bright-line test would apply where, at the time of disposal, there was an agreement in place to construct a new build on the land. This was not intended. The new build bright-line test should only apply where a new build is on the land at the time of its disposal. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application to subdivided bare land Submission (nsaTax Limited) The new build bright-line test should also apply to a taxpayer who only subdivides land (regardless of whether they also add a new build to it), otherwise taxpayers will be discouraged from subdividing land to sell as bare lots. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter. The objective of the new build bright-line test is to ensure the supply of new housing is not discouraged. It is inconsistent with this objective to allow bare land to qualify for concessionary treatment. Bare land by itself does not increase housing supply. The new build bright-line test is only intended to apply to land that has a new build added to it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Guidance on land area test Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) Guidance should be published clearly explaining the meaning of “land area test”. 174 Comment Inland Revenue will publish guidance on the meaning of “land area test”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarify acquisition “no later than 12 months” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The “no later than 12 months rule” is unclear where land is purchased but a new build is not added until years later. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Guidance should confirm that the 5-year new build bright-line test applies to bare land that is converted into “new build land”. Section CB 6A(2)(b)(i) as currently drafted could suggest the land needs to be new build land when it is acquired. (Deloitte) Comment For the new build bright-line test to apply to residential land, proposed new section CB 6A(2) provides that the person must acquire the land no later than 12 months after it first meets the definition of new build land. Officials consider the legislation already satisfies the policy intent, which is for residential land to qualify for the new build bright-line test if it becomes new build land after it is acquired by the taxpayer. For example, this could include a situation where a taxpayer adds a new build dwelling to a bare section after they acquired the section. The land will only satisfy the new build land definition when the new build is added to the land. Therefore, the taxpayer would satisfy the requirement of section CB 6A(2) because they acquired the land before it became new build land, that is, before 12 months passed since the land first met the definition of new build land. Inland Revenue will publish guidance clarifying the eligibility of land for the new build bright- line test where the land becomes new build land after its original acquisition. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting suggestions Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) “New build land” and “bright-line acquisition dates” should be included in the list of defined terms and in section YA 1. It is unnecessary for section CB 6A(1) to refer to “land area test” since section CB 6A(2) does. (Deloitte) 175 The items in the formula in section DB 23C should be defined in one single subsection (similar to proposed new section DH 6(2)), rather than in separate subsections. (Deloitte) Comment Officials have referred these suggestions to the drafter. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 176 MAIN HOME EXCLUSION FROM THE BRIGHT-LINE TEST Clauses 48 and 49 Issue: Support for main home changes Submission (Ockham Residential) We support the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for amendment for main home that takes longer than 12 months to construct Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Submitters support the main home exclusion still applying where construction of a main home takes longer than 12 months. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Test for main home that takes longer than 12 months to construct unclear Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, Olivershaw Limited) It is unclear: • when “reasonable efforts” to construct commence • whether a reasonable period between the owner acquiring the land and starting to engage in the building process is covered, and • what is captured by the term “to construct” – it needs to include all aspects of the build process, for example, resource consenting. The main home exclusion should cover the entire build process within a reasonable timeframe. Inland Revenue should not set a fixed period – it should be fact specific. Follow- up should only be required where Inland Revenue considers the period excessive. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 177 Comment The main home exclusion from the bright-line test applies where a property is the owner’s main home for the entire period it is owned. Adjacent periods of 12 months or less where the property is not used as a main home (for example, where the new owner of a property does not move in until six months after it was purchased) are ignored. This rule was not intended to tax a person who purchased bare land to construct their main home if the construction period took longer than 12 months. To address this, the Bill (as introduced) proposes to allow the period when a person is making reasonable efforts to construct their main home to be counted as “main home days” and not be subject to the bright-line test. Officials agree with submitters that a “reasonable time” test would be more appropriate. This means that for a period during which a person constructs a dwelling that they then use as their main home, the entire period would be counted as main home days and outside the bright-line test, provided the period was reasonable. In most, if not all, cases, the person is likely to be making reasonable efforts to construct the dwelling as there is no benefit to delaying construction due to: • the cost over-runs, and • the fact that the main home is outside the bright-line test. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: 12-month buffer rule insufficient Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Mayne Wetherell, New Zealand Law Society, Olivershaw Limited) The 12-month buffer rule should extend to other situations that exceed 12 months. Some taxpayers caught by the main home changes would not normally file tax returns. The unexpected tax liability the rule will impose on these taxpayers will raise complexity, compliance costs, and stress. It should be extended to include the following situations: • hospitalisation • work secondment • transition to retirement villages • renovations, seismic strengthening, remediation of leaky homes, etc • displacement due to natural disasters, and • unforeseen circumstances requiring the owner to move elsewhere for more than 12 months. Taxpayers who have not rented their family home should not be subject to the bright-line test. (Olivershaw Limited) 178 Comment Officials do not agree with the submission that the 12-month buffer rule is insufficient. In general, a property must be a person’s main home for “all of the days” in the bright-line period for the main home exclusion to apply. However, this is subject to the 12-month buffer. Under this buffer, any period (or periods) of up to 12 months where the property is not used as the person’s main home may be counted as a main home period provided it precedes or follows a period of main home use. If the 12-month buffer applies, that period will therefore not be subject to the bright-line test. Where the main home exclusion does not apply, periods of main home use or periods subject to the 12-month buffer will still not be taxed under the bright-line test. These settings were introduced by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 and apply to property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. Under the previous rules, a property had to be mainly used as the taxpayer’s main home for it to be excluded from the bright-line test. This meant that a property would be taxed where less than half the land was used as the main home (for example, because there was a rental property or business on the same title), or where the land was not used for a main home for more than 50% of the time it was owned. This was a simple “all or nothing” test that applied under the previous 2-year and 5-year bright-line tests but that could lead to disproportionate results under a 10-year bright-line test. For example, consider a property that is owned for seven years before it is sold and is prima facie subject to the bright-line test. Under the previous settings, if the property was used as a main home for three years and as a rental property for four years, all the gain on sale would be taxed under the bright-line test. Conversely, if the property was used as the main home for four years and then as a rental property for three years, none of the gain on sale would be taxed under the bright-line test. The amendments made in March 2021 and the changes proposed in this Bill provide a more consistent treatment for similar situations. They ensure that the main home is only taxed where it stops being a main home for a period (or periods) of more than 12 months. In the example above, where the property is used as the main home for four of the seven years, three-sevenths of the gain would be taxed. Where the property is used as the main home for three of the seven years, four-sevenths of the gain would be taxed. The 12-month buffer rule is relevant where the property is no longer the taxpayer’s main home. There is a difference between having an absence from the main home and a property that is no longer the taxpayer’s main home. For example, if a taxpayer goes on holiday for a month, the property is still their main home, despite not being used as their main home for that period. This is because the concept of a main home looks at the property where the taxpayer usually lives and with which the taxpayer has the greatest connection if they have more than one home. There will be clear cases where the property is no longer the taxpayer’s main home – such as where they rent out their home under a residential tenancy or where they have another home with which they have a greater connection. However, the property may also stop being the taxpayer’s main home where the property is vacant. The Inland Revenue Tax Counsel Office’s public guidance work programme includes a project to provide guidance on what constitutes a main home. Consequently, officials do not consider further exemptions are necessary. 179 The 12-month buffer is designed to keep the rules as simple as possible while also catering for many life events where a person may be away from their main home for a reasonable period. Officials consider this will be sufficient in most situations. As noted at “Issue: Test for main home that takes longer than 12 months to construct unclear” above, the Bill proposes to extend the 12-month buffer where a taxpayer is constructing their main home. Submitters have already noted the complexity of the rules and officials consider that multiple, highly prescriptive exceptions would add additional complexity, particularly where a given specific exception would only impact a small number of people. In relation to the specific scenarios raised by submitters: • Hospitalisation – A taxpayer’s residence would still be their main home while they are in hospital, and therefore, the 12-month buffer would not be relevant. • Work secondment – Where a taxpayer moves to another city for a work secondment and rents out or leaves their main home vacant, it is appropriate that they pay tax on gains attributable to the period they were away. This is because the property is not their main home during that time, especially where the property is rented. It would be inappropriate to have an uncapped exemption from the bright-line test simply because the property was once the main home. • Transition to a retirement village – The 12-month buffer is designed to deal with this kind of scenario. Officials consider that the 12-month buffer is sufficient to enable the taxpayer to sell their property. It is appropriate that any vacancy beyond that may be taxed under the bright-line test • Renovation – The 12-month buffer is designed to deal with this kind of scenario. Officials consider it unlikely many taxpayers will be displaced from their home for more than 12 months because of renovations. • Displacement due to natural disaster – Specific relief could be considered in the event of a natural disaster that displaces people from their homes for an extended period. However, a natural disaster would likely impact other aspects of the tax system, and off icials consider it would be more appropriate to look at the whole tax system when providing disaster relief. • Unforeseen circumstances – The 12-month buffer is also designed to deal with this scenario. It would be inappropriate to allow a property to remain outside the bright-line test indefinitely just because it was once used as a main home. Officials consider that 12 months continues to be an appropriate period. Officials disagree with the submission that taxpayers should only be subject to the bright- line test where they have rented out their family home. This would encourage taxpayers to leave their house empty (when they may have otherwise rented it out) to avoid tax under the bright-line test. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 180 Issue: Electing a main home Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) A taxpayer should be able to elect a main home: • Provided it was their main home at some point. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) • Regardless of whether they are living in it. (The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) Comment Officials disagree. The key consideration in determining if a property is the taxpayer’s main home is whether it is the place they usually live. If it is not the place they usually live, then it is not their main home. It is not appropriate for a taxpayer to be able to claim the main home exemption if their property is rented out or vacant for extended periods of time. The property is clearly not their main home for such periods. The 12-month buffer is intended to offer a reasonable period to account for life’s complexities without worrying about the resulting tax implications. A rental property should not be exempt from the bright-line test just because it was once a main home. Other rental properties are subject to income tax if sold within the relevant bright-line period. The tax rules should not encourage a person to leave a property vacant for an extended period. Officials do not agree with the submission that every taxpayer should be able to elect a main home regardless of whether they are living in it. This would create an integrity risk and could result in a significant number of rental properties never being subject to the bright-line test. For example, consider a couple who have a main home and a rental property. One person elects the family home as their main home, and the other elects the rental as their main home. Under this submission, if the couple sold the investment property within the bright- line period, it would not be subject to tax because it was elected as a “main home”, despite never being used as one. Electing a main home would also impose additional compliance costs as taxpayers would need to update their election with Inland Revenue on a regular basis (for example, annually or whenever they move to a new house). Electing a main home would allow a person to claim the main home exclusion for periods where the property was not in fact their main home. For most taxpayers this would be unnecessary as the property would always be used as their main home or they would own it for longer than the bright-line period. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of 12-month buffer rule not required Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It is unnecessary to clarify that a person can have multiple 12-month buffer periods provided they are not consecutive. 181 Comment Officials agree with the submitter that the amendment is not strictly required, but it is being proposed to make this point clearer in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of 12-month buffer rule supported Submission (KPMG) Submitter supports clarifying the application of the 12-month buffer rule to ensure multiple non-consecutive periods of non-main home use of less than 12 months each are not a disqualifying event. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Period of main home use between two buffer periods Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Guidance is required on what would be considered an appropriate period for a property to be used a main home between two periods of non-main home use. Comment Officials disagree. There is no minimum period. The question is whether the property is the taxpayer’s main home. This will be a fact specific inquiry. However, the longer the period the more likely a property is to be considered the taxpayer’s main home. For example, it is highly unlikely Inland Revenue would agree with a taxpayer who said the property was their main home for one day. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 182 Issue: Repeal the rules – too complex Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Mayne Wetherell) Repeal the main home changes made in March 2021 and the ones in the current Bill as they are complex, and they will require taxpayers who might not otherwise need to file a return to file one and likely need to obtain expert tax advice. Comment Officials disagree that the rules should be repealed. As noted at “Issue: 12-month buffer rule insufficient” above, the changes to the main home exclusion were enacted in March 2021 to ensure a property is never taxed while it is used as the main home. The previous settings would lead to disproportionate results under the 10- year bright-line test, with a few months making the difference between the profit on a sale being fully taxed or not taxed at all. The rules may be more complicated in certain scenarios when compared with the previous settings, but this is unlikely to impact many taxpayers, and it ensures consistent and fair results across different situations. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Main home percentage – apportionment based on land area Submission (Deloitte) Using the percentage area of land may inappropriately skew the quantification formula as the value of the land with the main home on it may be much higher than any bare land. Comment Officials disagree. The current main home exclusion from the bright-line test in section CB 16A applies where more than half the land is used for a main home. This means that a main home can fall outside the existing main home exclusion, and be subject to tax, if less than half the land is used as a main home. For example, if two rental properties were built on the same title as a main home and those rental properties took up more than half the land, the existing main home exclusion would not apply. All the gain on the sale of the property would be taxed if the land was sold within the applicable bright-line period, not just the gain attributable to the rental properties. The Bill proposes to introduce an apportionment rule so that, where the main home exclusion does not apply because less than half the land has been used for a main home, gains attributable to the main home portion of the land will not be taxed. This is achieved through the quantification formula in proposed new section CB 6A. The “main home percentage” in the quantification formula determines the amount of income attributable to the use of the property as a main home and subtracts that from the income on disposal of the property. It 183 generally only applies where there is more than one dwelling on the same title – such as a main home and a rental property. If there was just a main home on the land, then the remaining land would typically be part of the main home. Whether all the land is to be included in the main home percentage will be a question of fact to be determined by considering whether all the land is used for or in connection with the main home. Land that has been used for a dwelling is not limited to the land on which the dwelling is situated or to the surrounding curtilage (like a yard or garden) and can, depending on the facts, include other areas used in connection with or for the benefit of the dwelling. Officials consider that a land-area-only approach is simple and not able to be manipulated (for example, by persons choosing higher valuations for the main home portion of the land so less of their income is taxed). It is most likely to apply where a person has built some rental properties on the same title as their main home. In this case, a land area apportionment rule is likely to give a more taxpayer-friendly outcome than a value apportionment approach. This is because the main home would likely take up more of the land than any new builds added to the land, and the building itself would potentially be worth less, given it would be older. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Quantification provision should be in section CB 16A Submission (Deloitte) The quantification provision in proposed new section CB 6A(8) should be in section CB 16A instead as it is an adjustment to the main home exclusion and the provision contains numerous cross references to section CB 16A. Comment Officials do not agree. Section CB 16A is concerned with whether the bright-line test applies at all. Section CB 6A quantifies income. It does not make sense for the quantification provision (which ensures periods where a property is a main home are excluded from the calculation of income under the bright-line test) to be in section CB 16A (which is not an income quantification provision). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Naming of “unadjusted amount” Submission (Deloitte) “Unadjusted amount” in section CB 6A should be “income”. 184 Comment The quantification formula in section CB 6A(8) refers to an “unadjusted amount”, which is the amount the person receives from selling the land before applying the formula. Officials consider it inappropriate to refer to this as “income” given it may be subject to adjustment. However, a more intuitive term could be used, and the matter has been referred to the drafter. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definitions of terms used in quantification formula unclear Submission (Deloitte) The definition of “main home days” is hard to follow and should be defined as the number of days the property qualified as a main home. “Adjustment days” should be renamed as “main home days” to be more intuitive. Comment Officials disagree. “Main home days” cannot be defined as the number of days the property qualified as a main home as the land does not satisfy the “predominantly” criterion in section CB 16A(2). In summary, the term “main home days” is defined as the number of days the land has been used for a main home where the main home takes up less than half the land (for example, because a rental property is also on the same title). “Adjustment days” cannot be renamed to “main home days” as the Bill already contains the term “main home days”. Officials acknowledge that the terms used in the formula could better describe what they are trying to achieve. We have suggested to the drafter that “main home days” be renamed “non-predominant main home days” and “adjustment days” be renamed “predominant main home days”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: “Excluded main home” should be a defined term Submission (Deloitte) “Excluded main home” should be a defined term. 185 Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Incorrect cross-reference Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section CB 16A(6) should refer to “main home days” as defined in section CB 6A(11), not section CB 6A(10)(b). Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 186 ROLLOVER RELIEF – BRIGHT-LINE TEST Clauses 48(1), 80B, 80C and 80D Overview Rollover relief is not an exemption from income tax. Rollover relief in the context of the bright-line test defers the taxing point until a subsequent disposal of the land occurs that does not qualify for rollover relief. To achieve this, rollover relief disregards an intervening disposal by treating the transfer as a disposal and acquisition for an amount that equals the total cost of the residential land to the transferor at the date of the transfer. For the bright- line test, the recipient is deemed to take on the transferor’s original date of acquisition along with the transferor’s cost base. As the bright-line test was originally introduced as a two-year test, extensive rules providing for rollover relief were not designed. Consequently, the rollover relief currently available under the bright-line test is very limited. With the recent extension of the test to ten years, there is cause for extending the relief available to cover the most common scenarios where taxpayers change how they hold residential land. The proposed rollover relief provisions are only intended to apply in some relatively simple and common scenarios where the economic ownership of the residential land has not changed and no gain on the transfer of the land has been realised. Officials do not consider it appropriate to provide rollover relief for all associated persons transactions (as this would go further than providing relief only in cases where economic ownership has not changed), or to ignore a gain if one has been realised (which is effectively what rollover relief would do). It is for these reasons the proposed provisions include the requirement that a transfer be made for cost or less to qualify for bright-line rollover relief. The above principles are broadly consistent with rollover rules internationally. Other jurisdictions, such as Australia and the United States, do not provide rollover relief for transfers between associated persons. The exception is specific relief provided in some jurisdictions for transfers between spouses, such as under relationship property settlements, which New Zealand’s existing bright-line rollover rules already apply to. We also understand that the rules in the United Kingdom for transfers to spouses, civil partners, children or charities are generally limited to situations where the property is gifted with no mortgage secured over the property. Issue: Application date Submission (Baker Tilly Staples Rodway Wellington, PwC) The application date for clause 80D should be clarified. The information sheet stated an application date of 1 April 2022, but as drafted it is the date of enactment. Submitters support a 27 March 2021 application date, as this would align with the application date of most of the proposed housing-related amendments. Comment Officials agree that the application date of the provisions should be clarified but recommend an application date of 1 April 2022. The proposed bright-line rollover relief provisions were intended to apply from 1 April 2022, but an application clause specifying this date was inadvertently omitted. This means the application date currently proposed is the date of enactment. 187 Point of difference Officials consider a prospective, rather than retrospective, application date is appropriate. With a 1 April 2022 application date, the proposed rollover relief would apply to a qualifying disposal occurring on or after 1 April 2022. Rollover relief would be available even if the original acquisition pre-dates the introduction of the bright-line test. Officials recommend prospective application because the current law is clear, and taxpayers have been paying income tax on that basis. A retrospective application date, even 27 March 2021, could encourage taxpayers to restructure to fit within the proposals. If the conditions for rollover relief change, or the proposals are not enacted, this could leave taxpayers in an unfortunate position if they do not end up qualifying for relief. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments above. Issue: Consideration requirement Submission (KPMG) The amount of consideration for the disposal should not need to be less than or equal to the total cost of the land to the transferor for rollover relief to apply. Comment The proposed bright-line rollover relief provisions are designed to account for scenarios where two main principles are satisfied: there is no (or little) change in the economic ownership of the residential land and no gain has been realised. Even when economic ownership does not change, there will usually be some consideration for the transfer of the land, for example, a mortgage is discharged. If the original owner has realised a gain on the transfer (because the consideration for the transfer exceeds their original acquisition price), this gain should be subject to income tax at that time if the transfer occurs within the bright-line period. Officials do not consider it is appropriate to ignore a gain if one has been realised, which is effectively what rollover relief would do. Rollover relief provided in other jurisdictions is typically subject to a reinvestment condition (that is, a requirement that the sale proceeds are used to buy a similar asset). It would therefore be unusual to provide rollover relief, or an exclusion, from the bright-line test for a transaction where a person has sold property for a realised profit they do not (or are not required to) reinvest. The reinvestment condition in other jurisdictions is normally in the context of a comprehensive capital gains tax. Officials do not support a reinvestment condition in the context of the bright-line test as this could create an incentive to invest in residential property over other types of assets. This is because residential property investors generally do not fully exit the property market but rather use the sale proceeds to invest in more property. Point of difference However, officials consider that some relief could be provided. 188 Officials note there is an existing rule in section GC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 that deems disposals to be made at market value. This is an anti-avoidance rule that, in most circumstances, operates as intended, but it can sometimes exacerbate cashflow issues. To provide some relief for taxpayers in situations where residential land is sold or transferred to their family trust, partnership or look-through company (LTC) for more than the acquisition cost, officials recommend switching off the market value rule in section GC 1. This would mean that instead of having to pay tax on the difference between the market value of the land and the transferor’s acquisition cost, the transfer would be treated as having been made for the greater of that acquisition cost or the actual sale price. In addition, to ensure the bright-line period is not reset by virtue of the land being transferred into the taxpayer’s family trust, partnership or LTC, the receiving entity could be treated as having acquired the property on the same date that it was acquired by the first owner. Officials recommend that this apply even if that first owner makes a gain on sale. Example 1 Carla acquired a residential property in April 2018 for $500,000 and is subject to the five-year bright- line test. In May 2022, Carla transfers the property to her family trust (which meets the requirements set out in proposed section FC 9B) for $750,000, even though the market value of the property at this time is $1 million. The family trust then disposes of the residential property in August 2024 for $1.5 million. Under the existing proposals, Carla’s transfer would not qualify for bright-line rollover relief, and she would be taxed on a gain of $500,000 (being $1 million less $500,000), even though her realised gain is only $250,000. The bright-line clock for the family trust would restart and, when the trust disposes of the property, it would be taxed on a gain of $500,000 (being $1.5 million less $1 million). Adopting officials’ suggestions above, Carla would only be taxed on her realised gain of $250,000. The trust would take on Carla’s acquisition date of April 2018. This would mean that when the trust ultimately disposes of the property in August 2024, there are no further bright-line tax implications. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Family and associated persons transactions Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, Gilligan Rowe & Associates LP , KPMG, PwC) Rollover relief should apply to all land transfers between associated persons. Alternatively, rollover relief should apply to all land transfers occurring in the ordinary course of family life or business succession that are not profit-motivated sales. (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, EY, Gilligan Rowe & Associates LP , PwC) Consideration should be given to whether transfers between natural persons for reasons of “natural love and affection” should be excluded from the bright-line test. Alternatively, all land transfers that do not result in a material change in economic ownership should be disregarded for the bright-line test. (EY) 189 Consideration should be given to a carve-out from the bright-line test for family-related transactions. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Comment As noted in “Overview” above, the bright-line rollover relief proposals only apply in limited circumstances, namely where there is no (or only a very minor) change in economic ownership of the land and the vendor has not realised a gain on sale. Officials do not recommend providing rollover relief or a full exclusion from the bright-line test in the types of circumstances suggested by submitters. The associated persons rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 are anti-avoidance provisions designed to ensure the integrity of the tax system. Hence, the existing associated persons definitions are deliberately broad so that they capture a wide range of transactions. Allowing rollover relief for all land transfers between associated persons or for family transactions would be a significant policy change. This change would go beyond the policy intention of allowing rollover relief in some common situations where taxpayers change how they hold residential land with no resulting change in economic ownership. This could result in rollover relief applying in instances where there has been a change in economic ownership and would introduce integrity risks. For example, the risk that taxpayers on the highest personal income tax rates would transfer residential land to their spouse or an adult child on a lower personal tax rate. To provide specific relief to individuals who can purchase residential property to on -sell to family members would be a substantial shift in policy. Other aspects of the land sale provisions may also need to be considered (for example, the so-called intention test, where a gain on the sale of a property acquired with the intention of disposal is taxed). Given the broader implications of such a policy change, further work on this issue would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Individuals can provide financial support to family members in other ways without becoming a legal owner of the relevant residential property. This could include, for example, providing a monetary gift to help with a deposit or acting as a guarantor for a loan. In most circumstances, acting as a guarantor should not bring someone within the scope of the bright- line test. We understand that in very limited circumstances financial institutions may request that guarantors be on the legal title of the property where there are other concerns regarding equity and/or income. Taxpayers should seek professional advice when contemplating property transactions to ensure all legal implications are understood. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Changes in co-ownership of property Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, KPMG) The bright-line period should not be reset every time there is a change in the co-ownership of a property. 190 Comment This issue often arises when parents become co-owners of residential property with their adult children and partly dispose of their share over time, so that eventually the children are the sole owners of the property. When a part share in residential land is disposed of, that share could be subject to tax under the bright-line test. Inland Revenue recently released a draft interpretation statement to clarify the treatment of such arrangements (see PUB00411: Income tax – application of the land sale rules to changes to co-ownership, subdivisions, and changes of trustees). The draft interpretation statement noted that the bright-line test hinges on changes to the legal title and, as currently drafted, the bright-line period for the portion of land not disposed of would be reset on each disposal of a part share. This resetting of the bright-line clock is not the policy intention, and officials agree the legislation should be amended to clarify this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transactions involving LTCs Submission (Gilligan Rowe & Associates LP , KPMG, nsaTax Limited) a. Transfers between look-through companies (LTCs) where the shareholding in each LTC is identical should be entitled to rollover relief. (nsaTax Limited) b. Transfers between LTCs and trusts should be entitled to rollover relief if the requirements of sections FC 9B and FC 9E are met by the relevant individuals. (nsaTax Limited) c. The proposed rule relating to LTCs should be extended to explicitly apply to a deemed disposal and acquisition due to a cessation of LTC status. (KPMG) d. Rollover relief should apply to a transfer of residential land from an individual to an LTC where the shares in the LTC are owned by a trust that meets the criteria set out in proposed section FC 9B(2). (Gilligan Rowe & Associates LP ) e. Rollover relief should apply to a transfer of shares in a residential land-rich LTC to the trustees of a family trust. (Gilligan Rowe & Associates LP ) Comment Officials note that the issues raised in these submissions are also relevant for the rollover rel ief provisions in the proposed interest limitation rules. Officials’ comments and recommendations below apply for both the proposed interest limitation rules and the bright- line test. a. Officials agree with the submission. We note that an LTC wanting to transfer residential land to another LTC with identical shareholding could get rollover relief under the existing proposals. However, the LTC would have to transfer the land to the shareholders, who would then transfer it to the other LTC. It makes more sense to allow taxpayers to do this in just one transaction, rather than requiring two separate transactions to qualify for rollover relief. b. Officials agree with the submission, provided: 191 • the relief is limited to situations where the principal settlor of the trust is also a beneficiary of the trust • the requirements set out in proposed section FC 9B for the other beneficiaries of the trust (such as the requirement that they are a relative of the principal settlor) are met, and • the principal settlor of the trust is the owner of the LTC. As outlined in a. above, taxpayers in this situation could get rollover relief under the existing proposals by carrying out two separate transactions, rather than transferring the land from the LTC to the trustees directly (or vice versa). As above, it makes sense to allow taxpayers to transfer the land in one step, rather than requiring a two-step process. This should also apply to partnerships (that is, when residential land is transferred between a partnership and a family trust, provided the requirements set out in proposed section FC 9B for the beneficiaries of the trust are met, and the principal settlors of the trust are also the partners in the partnership). c. Officials do not consider that rollover relief should apply when a company’s LTC status is revoked. When a company ceases to be an LTC, the owners of the company are treated as having disposed of the underlying property of the company (including, but not limited to, any residential land holdings of the company) at market value. This triggers a tax obligation for the owners, while the company is treated as having immediately acquired the property again at the same market value. This is in recognition of the differentials between the company and personal tax rates and the fact that flow-through treatment no longer applies to the taxable income derived by the company (meaning that income is taxed at the owner’s personal tax rates, rather than at the company level). Officials see no compelling reason to provide rollover relief specifically for deemed disposals of residential land upon revocation of LTC status and note that to do so would be at odds with the scheme of the LTC regime. d. Officials agree with the submission. As in a. and b. above, taxpayers in this situation could get rollover relief under the existing proposals by carrying out two separate transactions rather than transferring the land directly to the LTC. In addition, officials also recommend that rollover relief be provided going in the other direction (that is, when the LTC transfers the land to an individual who is both a principal settlor and beneficiary of the trust and all the requirements in proposed section FC 9B(2) for beneficiaries of the trust are met). This should also apply to partnerships. e. Officials are concerned that providing rollover relief in the scenario described by the submitter would go beyond what the proposed amendments are trying to do, which is to limit relief to just those scenarios that are both common and relatively straightforward. Officials caution against going broader with rollover relief as doing so may give rise to undue complexity and potentially result in some unexpected and unintended outcomes. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be accepted. c. That the submission be declined. d. That the submission be accepted. e. That the submission be declined. 192 Issue: Certain corporate transactions Submission (KPMG, PwC) a. Transfers between co-owners of land who are partners in a joint venture should be entitled to rollover relief. (PwC) b. There should be rollover relief for transfers within wholly-owned corporate groups. (KPMG) Comment Officials note that the issues raised in these submissions are also relevant for the rollover relief provisions in the proposed interest limitation rules. Officials’ comments and recommendations below apply for both the proposed interest limitation rules and the bright- line test. a. As noted in “Overview” and discussed in “Issue: Family and associated persons transactions” above, the intent of the proposed rollover relief provisions is deliberately limited to common situations where taxpayers change how they hold residential land with no resulting change in economic ownership (or, in the specific case of a transfer to a family trust, only a very minor change in economic ownership). A transfer of an ownership interest in land between co-owners of that land would amount to a change in the economic ownership of the part-share of the land that was transferred, and on that basis, officials do not consider allowing rollover relief in this scenario is appropriate. b. Officials agree that when residential land is transferred within a wholly-owned group of companies, there may be little change in economic substance to the ownership of the land. We therefore agree that rollover relief should be available. Point of difference However, to mitigate integrity risks, officials consider this relief should only be available for transfers within a wholly-owned tax consolidated group, meaning it would only be available to New Zealand-resident companies. In addition, the consolidation regime provides specific crystallisation rules when a member leaves the group. Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Trusts Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, BDO, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, nsaTax Limited, PwC) a. Rollover relief should apply when land is transferred from the trustees back to the settlors of the land. (EY, New Zealand Law Society) 193 b. The drafting of the provisions around transfers from a trust back to a settlor is unclear and should be revisited. (PwC) c. Rollover relief should apply when land is transferred from the trustees to a beneficiary of the trust. (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, BDO, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG, nsaTax Limited) Such rollover relief could be overlaid with an anti-avoidance rule to limit it to valid trust transactions that do not have the purpose or effect of defeating the bright-line rules. (KPMG) d. Resettlements of trusts should qualify for rollover relief in some circumstances, such as where the beneficiaries of each trust are identical, or at least one of the principal settlors resettling the property is also a principal settlor of the recipient trust and each beneficiary of the recipient trust has the prescribed relationship with the principal settlor. (New Zealand Law Society, nsaTax Limited, PwC) e. Relief should apply to transfers to trusts generally, not just family trusts. (PwC) Comment Officials note that the issues raised in these submissions are also relevant for the rollover relief provisions in the proposed interest limitation rules. Officials’ comments and recommendations below apply for both the proposed interest limitation rules and the bright- line test. a. The proposed rollover relief provisions would apply to a transfer of residential land to a family trust in certain circumstances. Submitters have correctly noted that the current proposed provisions do not apply when residential land is transferred from the trustees of the trust back to the settlors. Officials agree that the proposed rollover relief provisions should apply in both directions and not just when land is settled on a trust. We further recommend that rollover relief also apply when residential land subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 is transferred back to the settlors of the land by a trustee that is, or is eligible to be, a Māori authority. b. As noted in a. above, officials agree with submitters that rollover relief should apply when residential land is transferred from the trustees of a family trust back to the settlors of the land. Officials recommend this be clarified in the legislative drafting. c. As noted in “Overview” and discussed in “Issue: Family and associated persons transactions” above, it is only appropriate to allow rollover relief in instances where the economic ownership of the land has not changed. This includes situations where economic ownership has changed to a limited degree because the property is settled onto a family trust. However, if the trustees then disposed of the property by way of sale or transfer to the beneficiaries, substantive ownership would change, and transfers of this nature should continue to be taxed under the bright-line test. This is the same result as would occur if the settlor had sold or transferred the property to the beneficiary directly without using a trust as an intermediary. d. Officials agree that rollover relief should apply to resettlements of trusts when at least one of the principal settlors resettling the property is also a principal settlor of the recipient trust and each beneficiary of the recipient trust has the prescribed relationship with the principal settlor as set out in proposed section FC 9B(2). We note that our recommendation to accept the submission in a. above means that taxpayers would be able to achieve this result anyway. However, in the interests of clarity, officials recommend that the legislation explicitly provide for resettlements of trusts. As the Māori trust proposal is intended to apply in similar familial situations, this recommendation should also apply in that context. 194 e. As discussed in c. above, the application of the proposed rollover relief provisions is deliberately limited to common situations where taxpayers change how they hold residential land with no resulting change in economic ownership (or, in the specific case of a transfer to a family trust, only a minor change in economic ownership). The family trusts provisions are limited to the scenario where residential land is gifted or transferred at cost to a “typical” family trust. A broader rollover relief rule for trusts in general would be novel and may introduce integrity risks. Further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be accepted. c. That the submission be declined. d. That the submission be accepted. e. That the submission be declined. Issue: Cost basis of Treaty settlement property Submission (Matter raised by officials) The wording of the proposed rollover relief provision for the transfer of Treaty settlement property should be clarified. The proposed rollover relief provision provides that if a settlement entity transfers residential land received as part of a settlement under te Tiriti o Waitangi to a member of the claimant group, rollover relief should be provided. This means that the receiving member should “step into the shoes” of the settlement entity for the acquisition date and acquisition cost of the land. The wording of the proposed provision should be clarified to provide that the settlement entity’s acquisition cost is the market value at the time the land is transferred to them from the Crown to ensure that the bright-line test operates on a net, and not gross, basis. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application to other land sale provisions Submission (Gilligan Rowe & Associates LP) The proposed rollover relief provisions should be extended to also apply for the other land provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment Officials do not recommend extending the proposed rollover relief provisions to apply for the other land provisions at this time. The current proposals were developed for the bright-line 195 test, and it would be necessary to ensure they are fit for purpose for other aspects of the land sale rules before they could be extended. Further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Specific review process for further rollover relief Submission (EY) The Commissioner should commit to reviewing the rules periodically to assess whether further rollover relief is warranted. Comment Officials acknowledge the submitter’s point that it would be helpful if there was an ongoing process for taxpayers and advisors to raise examples of transactions that should fall outside the scope of the bright-line rules or qualify for rollover relief. However, a specific review process for the rollover relief rules would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Officials note there may be issues arising from the enactment of the proposals that require future remedial legislation, and we are committing resources towards addressing these issues. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Technical errors Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Mayne Wetherell, New Zealand Law Society) a. Section CB 6A(11F) contains a cross-reference to section CB 6AB which does not exist. The cross-reference should be to new sections FC 9B to FC 9E. (New Zealand Law Society) b. The term “test trust” used in some of the provisions should be replaced with a more meaningful term, as the term “test trust” has no relevance. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) c. Proposed new sections CB 6A(5B) and (5C) respectively refer to the date on which a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common is “granted”, which is incorrect. “Granted” should instead read “acquired”. (Mayne Wetherell) Comment a. Officials agree there is a cross-referencing error and recommend that it be rectified. 196 b. Officials have referred this to the drafter. c. Officials agree that “granted” is not the correct term and that the wording should be corrected. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be noted. c. That the submission be accepted. 197 OTHER ISSUES Clause 48 Issue: Bright-line period Submission (Michael Fox, The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) Submitters suggested that the bright-line period be: • Returned to two years, because a 10-year period penalises people whose circumstances change over time. (Michael Fox) • Increased to 20 years, because genuine property investors frequently retain rental properties for 20 years and speculators will abuse a 10-year period. (The Bluekiwi Property Consulting Trust) Comment The matters raised in these submissions are outside of the scope of this Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Grace period from bright-line test for investors affected by interest limitation Submission (Scott Farrand) A grace period of five years should be introduced for current investors that cannot afford to hold their investment property due to the interest limitation rules. Investors in this position who decide to sell should not be taxed under the bright-line test. Comment Officials disagree. A grace period for investors who cannot afford to hold residential properties would give rise to potential abuse and complex compliance issues because it would be difficult to determine whether unaffordability was, in fact, the reason for sale. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 199 GST remedials 201 MODERNISING INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR GST Clauses 5(1), 9, 12, 19, 21(1)─(3), (9) and (10), 24, 26─34, 36, 38─40, 42─44 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Accounting & Tax Agents Institute New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) That the proposals to modernise information requirements for GST to better reflect current business record-keeping practices are supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Modernising invoicing requirements Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell) a. That the term “invoice” should be retained. In the alternative, we agree that the use of the term “information” is appropriate . (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) b. That the proposal to allow the collection of particular “information”, which may be held in any way, is supported. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) c. That the proposals to modernise the invoicing and information aspects of the GST legislation falls short in several instances and may impose a greater administrative burden on some taxpayers. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Mayne Wetherell) d. That the drafting of the proposals be simplified to improve readability and lower the risk of errors arising. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG) e. That Inland Revenue should provide taxpayers with guidance on the rules before they are enacted, and that Inland Revenue should run an awareness campaign about these changes to ensure taxpayers are made aware of what is changing and when. (EY) Comment a. Officials support the alternative submission to use the term “information” and note that the term “invoice” is not proposed to be repealed. See also “Issue: Preserving the use of the terms ‘tax invoice’, ‘credit note’, and ‘debit note’” below. c. Officials note this submission and that many aspects of the proposals are addressed in more detail in the following items: “Issue: Preserving the use of the terms ‘tax invoice’, ‘credit note’, and ‘debit note’”; “Issue: Supplier’s taxable supply information requirements”; “Issue: Different taxable supply information requirements for supplier and recipient”; “Issue: Date of taxable supply information”; “Issue: Taxable supply information requirements for a registered recipient”; and “Issue: Information requirements to support a deduction of input tax”. 202 d. Officials note this submission and will work with the drafter to improve the readability of the proposals. e. Officials note the submission and consider it has merit. We also note that Inland Revenue is considering an operational response to provide guidance on several proposed changes in the Bill. A Tax Information Bulletin will also provide guidance on these provisions once they are enacted. Recommendations a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission is noted. c. That the submission is noted. d. That the submission is noted. e. That the submission is noted. Issue: Preserving the use of the terms “tax invoice”, “credit note”, and “debit note” Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Mayne Wetherell) That the removal of the terms “tax invoice”, “credit note”, and “debit note” will have significant impact on existing legal and commercial documentation. An amendment of some form to the proposals is required to preserve the effect of current documentation. Comment Officials support the submission. We agree it would be helpful to insert a provision to ensure that references to the old terminology in existing documentation (such as contracts, process documentation, Inland Revenue publications and software) is treated as a reference to the new terminology to the extent necessary to give effect to the intention of the documentation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Supplier’s taxable supply information requirements Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell, PwC) a. That the requirement for a supplier to hold information about the recipient is an unworkable requirement for a supplier having many small transactions. It may lead to a significant increase in compliance costs for some retailers. The proposed requirement 203 should apply for supplies that exceed the value of common everyday transactions. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell) b. That officials should consider why, in a modern business environment, the requirement for a supplier to hold recipient details is included in proposed section 19E given that this information would be collected as part of general business record-keeping requirements. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) c. That the proposed requirement that a GST-registered person making a taxable supply to another GST-registered person should provide the taxable supply information to the recipient on the day of the supply, unless a later date is agreed in writing, should not proceed. The requirement to provide the information on the day of supply is a significant deviation from the current rule, which requires the supplier to provide this information within 28 days in all instances, and the current 28-day rule should be retained. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Mayne Wetherell, PwC) d. That the taxable supply information requirements should provide an option for the supplier to treat all their customers as non-registered. (KPMG) e. Consistent with the policy intent of providing greater flexibility for businesses, the proposals should not impose additional obligations on GST-registered suppliers by requiring changes to existing business systems and processes. (PwC) Comment a. Officials support this submission and consider the requirements should be simplified. We also recommend incorporating the requirements in the current law for tax invoices where a taxable supply does not exceed $1000, as retaining this threshold value would help to ensure compliance costs are not increased. b. Officials consider that the proposals formalise the information requirements that are necessary to support the integrity of the GST system. The information requirements proposed are based on existing record-keeping practices. The proposals do not require recipient information to be collected in any particular form and, in most cases, general business record keeping would meet the requirement for the supplier to hold this information and so should not impose additional compliance costs. c. Officials agree with the submission to provide the supplier with a 28-day period in which the information is to be provided. We note that a registered recipient will need this information to support their input tax deductions. Therefore, we consider it is no longer appropriate for the law to require taxable supply information to be provided only on request (this is the current law position for tax invoices). We note that the modern business practice of using electronic information exchange generally means taxable supply information is provided without such a request, and retail businesses having lower value transactions generally apply the practice of asking customers if they would like a GST receipt or tax invoice. d. Officials do not support this submission. We consider the provision of taxable supply information to a registered recipient is fundamental to the integrity of the GST system. This submission raises potential risks to the integrity of the GST system. The submission appears to be concerned about the potential compliance cost impact for medium-sized businesses with large volumes of small value transactions. We note that it is common business practice for a retailer to ask the recipient if they would like a GST invoice, and we expect this practice would continue. Officials consider this would continue to be sufficient to determine at the time of the supply transaction if a customer would need to be provided with taxable supply information. 204 e. Officials support the principle of not imposing additional compliance costs. Consequently, we recommend the taxable supply information provisions be simplified further to achieve this. In particular, we recommend that proposed section 19F be omitted from clause 19 of the Bill. Recommendations a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be declined. c. That the submission be accepted. d. That the submission be declined. e. That the submission be accepted. Issue: Different taxable supply information requirements for supplier and recipient Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) That it is unclear why proposed section 19E and section 19F contain different information requirements for suppliers and recipients, respectively, than is required for the new “taxable supply information” in section 19K(8). Comment Officials agree that the information requirements should be consistent between the provisions. The information requirements should be aligned where possible, subject to other recommendations on information requirements for both the supplier and the recipient. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Date of taxable supply information Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell) Several submissions were received on the issue of the date of taxable supply information: • That the date recorded in the taxable supply information should be the date of the taxable supply information. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) • That the proposed requirement to record the time of supply as determined other than under section 9(1) is potentially impractical as this information may not necessarily be 205 available at the time a supply transaction is entered into. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • That the date requirements in both proposed section 19K(8)(c) and section 19L(1)(b) should refer to the date of the taxable supply information. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • That the proposed requirement to record the date of the taxable supply information may be impractical in some circumstances. For example, the date of an invoice and the date of issue of the invoice may differ due to logistical issues around bulk invoicing. (Deloitte) • That the proposed requirement for a GST registered recipient to keep a record of the time of supply, or anticipated time of supply, under section 19F(2)(d) could be onerous. (KPMG) • That the requirement in proposed section 19K(5) to agree that the taxable supply information may be issued at a later date should be changed to an alternative date. (KPMG) • That proposed section 19K(8) should be amended to require the supplier to confirm the time of supply for the transaction in situations where the date of issue of taxable supply information does not trigger the time of supply. (KPMG) Comment Officials support these submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Taxable supply information requirements for a registered recipient Submission (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KMPG, PwC) That it does not seem appropriate that a recipient should have to hold information about “the time, or anticipated time, of the supply” under proposed section 19F(2)(d), as the “time of supply” or “anticipated time of supply” could be uncertain. This requirement should either be removed or be consistent with the record-keeping requirement that would apply for a supplier under proposed section 19E(2). Comment Officials support this submission. We consider this requirement could be omitted, as the time of supply is a defined term that is determined as a factual matter from business records and does not need to be recorded separately. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 206 Issue: Information requirements to support a deduction of input tax Submissions (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) a. That more clarity is needed in relation to the requirements for enabling an input tax deduction to be claimed for expenditure under the suggested low-value threshold. (Accountants & Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand, Baucher Consulting Limited) b. That to reflect the “threshold amount” for suppliers, recipients of a supply should be able to assume all supplies received under $200 were taxable supplies, unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) That proposed new section 19F be amended to exclude taxable supplies valued under $200, consistent with the position under current law whereby the recipient of a supply valued below $50 is not required to hold a tax invoice to support an input tax deduction. (PwC) Comment a. Officials support this submission. We also note that Inland Revenue has published the following guidance on its website (How tax invoices work for GST ), which relates to the record-keeping requirements in the GST Act: “When you buy supplies worth $50 or less it’s still a good idea to get a receipt. If you want to claim the GST on these purchases, you will need a record of the: • date • description • cost • seller.” We consider this published item would continue to be an appropriate guideline for low- value transactions (under $200) under the proposed modernisation of the GST invoicing rules. b. Officials do not agree with these submissions. In consultation, the submitters commented that accepting these submissions could have compliance cost reduction implications, particularly for organisations dedicating resources to managing employee expense claims. We consider that firms will still have to provide checks and balances to ensure employees expense claims are appropriately made. We also consider these business practices would ensure businesses are complying with commercial and employment legislation for such transactions. The record-keeping requirements in section 75 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 require evidence of all supplies made to or by a registered person. Officials consider that reducing evidential requirements for supplies having a value under $200 has the potential to create an integrity risk for the GST system, as there would then be no legislative checks and balances for input tax deductions for low-value transactions. Recommendations a. That the submission be accepted. 207 b. That the submission be declined. Issue: Supply correction information requirements Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell) a. That the proposed term “supply correction information” is supported. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) b. That the proposed simplification in proposed section 19N for correcting errors in taxable supply information is supported. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) c. That the proposed section 19N should also extend to corrections required for invoices issued for Customs GST to allow importers to correct the GST claimed in the GST return when the correction information is received from the freight forwarder/broker. (KPMG) d. That the circumstances in which supply correction information is issued should not be constrained to "errors" and should contemplate any reason for changing the original taxable supply information. (Mayne Wetherell) Comment c. Officials consider this submission has some merit and note that Customs GST is not supported by an invoicing process. We note that Inland Revenue is considering issuing operational guidance on the application of the current invoicing requirements to Customs GST, and this may require some minor changes to clause 21(2) of the Bill. Recommendations a. That the submission be noted. b. That the submission be noted. c. That the submission be noted. d. That the submission be accepted. Issue: Copies of information Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) a. That the proposal to remove the requirement to mark copies of taxable supply information or supply correction information with the term “copy only” is supported. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) b. That the requirement in proposed section 19K(6) to keep a record of all issued copies of invoices should be removed from the Bill (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) 208 Recommendations a. That the submission be noted. b. That the submission be accepted. Issue: Support for increased threshold for exemption Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) That the proposal to increase the threshold for exempting a supplier from the requirement to provide taxable supply information is supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Regulatory power Submission (Regulations Review Committee) That proposed section 19F and section 19H should be amended either to: • remove the regulatory power to set a threshold of $200 from the primary legislation and make the setting of thresholds a matter for secondary legislation, or • simply remove the regulatory power. Comment Officials support the submission, and we recommend removing the regulatory power from the proposed provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Buyer-created supply information Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) a. That the proposal to allow a registered person to issue a buyer-created tax invoice provided there is an agreement between the parties is supported. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 209 b. That the proposals to remove the requirement for taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner for approval to issue buyer-created tax invoices are supported. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) c. That the requirement to reach an agreement is vague and unclear on whether the taxpayers must sign an agreement or separately record that an agreement has been made. The proposed requirements that an agreement be recorded along with the reasons for entering the agreement are also overly onerous. The reasons for the agreement should be documented by the recipient of the supply, but the requirement to record an agreement between the parties should be removed. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment c. Officials support this submission. The points raised will be addressed by a combination of improved clarity in the proposed legislation. In addition, Inland Revenue is considering providing operational guidance as to what would constitute an agreement for these purposes. Recommendations a. That this submission be noted. b. That this submission be noted. c. That this submission be accepted. Issue: Shared invoices Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) a. That the improved rules for shared tax invoices and supplier groups contained in proposed new section 55B are supported. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) b. That there is no reason why these rules should be restricted only to registered persons who are not part of a GST group as this unnecessarily restricts their application. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) c. That proposed new section 55B(1) be amended to refer to members of the “same GST group”. (PwC) d. That joint and several liability should not be necessary to issue shared tax invoices as this will limit the entities able to utilise the proposed changes. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, PwC) e. That consideration be given to expanding the ability of entities to utilise the agency opt- out rules in sections 60(1B) and (2B). (Deloitte) f. That consideration be given to treating opt-out transactions as occurring on a net basis, rather than the current gross approach, as this is likely to reduce compliance costs with no fiscal impact. (Deloitte) 210 Comment b. Officials support this submission. c. Officials support this submission. d. Officials support this submission. e. Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission but note that, as it is beyond the scope of modernising the GST invoicing rules, further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. f. Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission but note that, as it is beyond the scope of modernising the GST invoicing rules, further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendations a. That the submission be noted. b. That the submission be accepted. c. That the submission be accepted. d. That the submission be accepted. e. That the submission be declined. f. That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of agency rules Submission (KPMG) That section 60 be amended to allow for payment or collection agents who may not be legal agents (as set out in Interpretation Statement IS 21/01: GST and agency ) to issue or receive taxable supply information in their own name on behalf of a principal. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission. However, further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme Recommendation That the submission be declined. 211 Issue: Application Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) That the application dates for the modernisation of information requirements for GST should be reviewed and reconsidered for any changes to allow taxpayers sufficient lead time to understand and implement the changes before they take effect. Comment Officials support the submission. We recommend that application dates for provisions modernising the information requirements are deferred by one year and apply for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. Point of difference In consultation, stakeholders have indicated this would be sufficient lead time to understand and implement the changes, but that proposed compliance cost reduction measures (such as the proposed changes to buyer-created invoices, GST groups, shared invoices and corrections to supply information) should not have a deferred application date. Officials agree with this distinction and recommend that the application dates for proposed provisions that seek to reduce compliance and administration costs not be deferred or alternatively be redrafted to be consistent with the framework of the current framework for tax invoices, credit notes and debit notes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Inconsistent commencement dates Submissions (Deloitte) The commencement dates for clauses 5(1), 9 and 44(3) are inconsistent between the Bill and the Commentary to the Bill and the correct commencement dates should be clarified. Comment The submission raises points about the difference between commencement dates and application. An amending provision that has no specific application provision both commences and applies from the commencement date. An amending provision that has a commencement date that differs from its specific application provision comes into force on the commencement date (that is, the legislation is amended), but its application is determined by the application for that amendment. For example, clause 44 comes into force on the day the Act receives the Royal assent, but clause 44(4) provides the provision will not have operative effect (that is, apply) until the first taxable period commencing on or after that date. Points of difference We consider the Bill correctly states the commencement date for clauses 5(1) and 9 as the day on which the Act receives the Royal assent. These clauses are primarily definitional in 212 nature and will only have effect in interpreting operational provisions proposed in the Bill. This is because proposed substantive provisions that would rely on these definitions generally will apply for taxable periods commencing with the first taxable period after assent (although note application may be deferred see “Issue: Application” above). While it is not necessary for these definitional provisions to align with application, it would make sense to defer either their commencement or application to avoid confusion. For clause 44, officials note that the Bill states the commencement date as the day on which the Act receives the Royal assent. The application for this proposal is correct for clauses 44(1) and (2). However, we consider that the application of clause 44(3) should be aligned with the application for clauses 44(1) and (2), namely that it applies for taxable periods starting on or after the day on which the Act receives the Royal assent (subject to any deferral of application). We note that clause 44 addresses aspects of supply correction information that provide compliance cost benefits. These aspects would not be deferred but could instead be addressed by amending the provisions in the current law relating to debit and credit notes. Officials recommend that clause 44(4) should be amended to include clause 44(3) within its scope. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: GST trade name Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC) a. That the requirement in proposed section19E(2)(a) (and mirrored in other sections) for a GST trade name to be included in taxable supply information should be removed. If the IRD number for a supplier is included in the taxable supply information, then the supplier can easily be identified and there is no need to know the trade name(s) of a taxpayer. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) b. That proposed section 19L(1)(a) should be amended to allow that only the GST trade name and registration number of the member making the supply is included in the taxable supply information issued for the supply made by the member of a GST group. (KPMG) Comment a. Officials support this submission and consider it would be appropriate to remove the proposed definition of GST trade name. Officials consider that the GST trade name would not necessarily provide unique identifying information that would support the integrity of the GST system. Consequently, we recommend requiring the name and GST number of the taxpayer, rather than the GST trade name. b. Given that this submission is inconsistent with a. above (which we recommend be accepted), we recommend this submission be declined. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be declined. 213 Issue: Organisation of Act’s provisions Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed inclusion of section 8AA is unnecessary as it provides very little utility, and the provision should be removed from the Bill. Comment The purpose of proposed section 8AA is to provide a signpost to provisions that have an overriding effect on the application of the general rules (for example, determining who is the supplier and who is liable to pay GST). Point of difference Proposed section 8AA(9) points to special cases where the supplier differs from the person who is usually treated as making the supply. The issue addressed by this proposed provision is to overcome perceived ambiguity as to who the supplier is for the purposes of the Act. We have discussed this point with the submitter, and they acknowledged that they had not considered the detailed subclauses that would give the purpose for the proposed rule. However, they suggested that this policy purpose could be achieved by amending the definition of supplier. Officials therefore recommend that the drafter consider amending the definition of supplier in the way suggested by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Ta xable supply information for GST groups and supplier groups Submission (KPMG) Proposed section 19L(1) should be amended to refer to a taxable supply instead of a member supply. Comment Officials agree with the technical point that the term “member supply” does not include a supply made by a member of a GST group. Point of difference However, officials consider the issue raised could be addressed by including GST groups within the meaning of the term “member supply”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 214 Issue: Drafting issues – taxable supply information Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) a. The reference to “taxable supply information” in proposed section 19H(2)(b) appears to be a drafting error and should instead refer to “supply information”. (KPMG) b. Paragraph (f) in the proposed definition of “taxable supply information” should be updated to refer to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 (rather than 2021). (New Zealand Law Society) c. The ability to agree alternative information requirements under section 24BAC(d) should be preserved. (PwC) Comment a. Officials support the submission and agree the drafting should be reconsidered. b. The year reference in the title of the Act would be updated as part of the assent process. No drafting action is required for this submission at the FEC stage of the Bill. c. Officials consider the submitter has overlooked that the ability to agree alternative information requirements for certain imported goods is preserved in the proposed relocated provision (proposed new section 12C in clause 12 of the Bill). Recommendations a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be declined. c. That the submission be noted. Issue: Rounding of amounts for fractions of cents Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) a. That the clarification of the rounding provisions in the GST are supported. b. That there should be further clarification that a supplier making multiple supplies to one customer on a regular basis can choose to apply the rounding of amounts on either a supply-by -supply basis or as a single rounding calculation on an aggregate basis for amounts charged during a usual billing period. Comment b. Officials support providing an option to allow the rounding to be on either an aggregate or individual item basis. This option would allow a reduction in compliance costs. Recommendation a. That the submission be noted. 215 b. That the submission be accepted. Issue: The GST Act should undergo a rewrite Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) That it is timely for a rewrite and re-ordering of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to be considered. Comment Officials acknowledge the matters of legislative complexity within the GST Act that were raised by submitters in their submissions. However, further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 216 SECONDHAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDIT – ASSOCIATED PERSONS SUPPLIES Clause 6 Issue: Application date Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) a. That the proposal is supported and that it should be backdated to 2011. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That the proposed amendment should apply retrospectively to supplies made on or after 1 March 2018. (PwC) b. That the proposal in clause 6 be supported, specifically the backdating of the proposal allowing it to apply to purchases of goods dating back to 1 October 1986. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) c. That further clarity should be provided generally as to the timing of the application of the current or amended law. (PwC, New Zealand Law Society) Comment a. Officials do not support the submissions that the amendment apply retrospectively. Officials consider that accepting these submissions would result in a retrospective effect that would affect settled tax positions. Officials consider the law has always been clear about its intent and its effect, and therefore consider a retrospective application is not justified. We note that PwC commented that the current law arises from a drafting error. We do not agree with the submitter on this point. No evidence exists of a drafting error having occurred as the current law achieves its policy objective, which was to deny input tax credits for purchases of secondhand goods from an associated person. b. Officials note this submission expresses support for the proposal to allow an input tax deduction for an acquisition of secondhand goods from an associated person, provided that: • the associated person has acquired the secondhand goods from an unrelated party, and • that unrelated person acquired the secondhand goods on or after 1 October 1986. To address circumstances involving a chain of related-party transactions, a tracing rule is available to identify if an earlier transaction with an unrelated party (on or after 1 October 1986) has occurred relating to the goods being acquired from the associated person. That earlier transaction is used to determine the value of the input tax deduction. c. Officials do not consider this is necessary. We consider it is clear the proposed provision would apply to a supply of secondhand goods occurring after its application date. However, see also “Issue: Drafting issues” – submission c. below, in which we recommend a transitional measure to accommodate an agreement made after the Bill was introduced for the acquisition of secondhand goods. 217 Recommendations a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be noted. c. That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting issues Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, PwC) a. That proposed section 3A(2)(ab)(ii) should be amended to read “have not been owned, since 1 October 1986”, rather than “since that acquisition”. (New Zealand Law Society) b. That proposed section 3A(3)(a)(i) and (ib) should be amended to clarify the time at which a supplier is associated with a previous supplier or recipient of the secondhand goods. (New Zealand Law Society) c. Because an input tax credit is only available to the extent payment has been made for a supply of secondhand goods, further clarity should be provided as to the GST position if an agreement is entered into before the application date, but payment is made after the application date. (PwC) Comment a. Officials consider the submission has merit and would provide improved clarity to the drafting. b. Officials agree the drafting of the proposed provision is not clear about the time at which the test of association should be met. The submission has been referred to the drafter to improve the clarity of the proposed provision. Points of difference c. Officials agree that the position could be clarified. However, we consider the point raised in the submission should only apply if the agreement has been entered into after the Bill was introduced. This would provide greater certainty for transactions made in this transitional period. We recommend clause 6 be amended so that it applies to an acquisition of secondhand goods made under an agreement made after the Bill was introduced and for which payment was made on or after the start of the first taxable period following the Act receiving Royal assent. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be accepted. c. That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 218 Issue: Error in commentary example Submission (New Zealand Law Society) That Example 21 in the Commentary to the Bill contains a computational error and should be amended before it is included in a Tax Information Bulletin or other publication. Comment Officials agree with the submission and will provide a correct example in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 219 GST INPUT TAX RECOVERY FOR NON-RESIDENT BUSINESS Clause 21(8) Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Deloitte) We support the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Restriction on input tax deduction for Customs GST Submission (PwC) That the proposed restriction to prevent a GST-registered non-resident from claiming an input tax deduction for GST paid to Customs on imported goods that are outside New Zealand at the time of supply to a final consumer in New Zealand be removed. The main issue with the current GST settings is that a GST-registered non-resident business that imports goods to a GST-registered business in New Zealand cannot claim back the Customs GST paid by them on the imported goods where the goods are outside New Zealand at the time of supply. Comment Officials note that the proposed amendment addresses the submitter’s concern by allowing the GST-registered non-resident business an input tax deduction for GST paid by them to Customs, except in cases where the goods are outside New Zealand at the time of supply and are then delivered to a final consumer in New Zealand. This restriction is necessary to ensure that GST is collected on a supply by a GST-registered non-resident business to a final consumer in New Zealand. Officials have spoken with PwC about this, and PwC has subsequently clarified that they agree with officials that the restriction is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 220 EXPORTS OF GOODS DELIVERED TO A RECIPIENT’S VESSEL IN NEW ZEALAND Clause 10 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The submitters support the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 221 GROUND LEASES PAID VIA A UNIT TITLE BODY CORPORATE Clause 7(3) Issue: Change from GST exempt to zero-rated Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Any portion of a levy should be zero-rated if it is charged by a GST-registered unit title body corporate that is charged for supplies that would be exempt supplies if they were provided directly to the member. The current proposed amendment, which deems the body corporate not to be making supplies for that portion, will impose compliance costs on the body corporate as they would have to undertake regular apportionment calculations. Comment Officials consider that making the relevant supply an exempt supply is necessary to achieve the correct policy outcome. The supply of accommodation in a dwelling is exempted from GST to ensure that those in rental accommodation are not disadvantaged compared with owner-occupiers. For the same reason, people who own leasehold apartments through body corporates should have an exempt GST treatment for any ground rent they pay to a body corporate. This ensures neutrality with other owners of residential properties who pay ground rent directly to the landowner of leasehold land. If the supply of ground rent was zero-rated instead, the body corporate could theoretically claim input tax deductions for these supplies, and this could advantage GST-registered unit title body corporates over other types of residential property ownership. However, in practice a body corporate seems unlikely to incur significant expenses passing on the bill for ground rent to its members, and any such expenses (for example, legal fees) should be obviously connected to the exempt supply of ground rent. For these reasons, officials also consider that the proposed exempt supply rule will not require apportionment, and the compliance costs associated with that, as inputs the body corporate incurs should be directly attributed either to making the exempt supply of ground rent (no input tax deduction) or to the body corporate’s taxable supplies (a full input tax deduction). Finally, officials note that if the treatment was changed to zero-rating, the body corporate would still face additional compliance costs as they would have to calculate the correct amount of output tax to be charged to their members and returned to Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 222 GST B2B COMPULSORY ZERO-RATING OF LAND RULES Clauses 7(5) and 33(1), (3) and (4) Issue: Support for the proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposed amendments and notes that they will make compliance easier. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Scope of section 25AB limited Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) That the proposed amendment in clause 33(1) significantly narrows the scope of section 25AB. The proposed provision limits the scope of included supplies to those affected by an event referred to in section 25AA(1)(a). However, section 25AA(1) only applies to supplies of goods or services that are made by a non-resident and that are treated by sections 5B and 8(4B) as being made in New Zealand by the recipient of the supply. The current provision applies to the supply of goods and services by any registered person. The events listed in section 25AA(1)(a) are also more limited than in the current provision, and it is not clear in the Commentary to the Bill why this change in scope was necessary. Comment Officials agree that the proposed amendment to section 25AB(1)(a) limits the scope of that section. This reduction in scope was not intended. Officials recommend that the reference to section 25AA(1)(a) be removed and a list of the events to which the current section 25AB(1)(a) should apply be inserted into the provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Clarification required Submission (Deloitte) The proposed amendment to section 5(23) should be further clarified by providing that it is the vendor who decides to zero-rate the supply of land by way of recording the supply in 223 their GST return. The submitter supports the proposed amendment but considers that this further amendment is required to clarify who treats, and how they treat, section 11(1)(mb) as applying. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised by the submitter. However, officials consider it would be inappropriate to make any further changes without further consultation with stakeholders and affected parties on the issues and potential amendments. Further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deemed non-taxable supply of secondhand goods Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendment should be redrafted to provide for a deemed non-taxable re-supply of secondhand goods in section 5(23). This is necessary to allow the recipient to claim a secondhand goods input tax credit. Comment Officials consider that the proposed amendment achieves the desired policy outcome of allowing the recipient to claim a secondhand goods input tax credit where the supply of land has been incorrectly zero-rated because of the registration status of the vendor or because the vendor is not making a taxable supply. Under current law, a recipient in this situation can claim a secondhand goods input tax credit when the incorrect zero-rating is discovered. This is because the supplier (vendor) would be able to make an adjustment correcting the previous incorrect treatment, making it a non- taxable supply. This would then allow the recipient (purchaser) to claim a secondhand goods deduction. However, this deduction is reversed under current law because section 5(23) also operates in this situation so that the recipient is required to return output tax on the value of the land. Officials consider that by restricting the operation of section 5(23) to cases where a taxable supply was incorrectly zero-rated, a recipient will not have to return this output tax and will thus have a net input tax deduction for their secondhand goods. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 224 GST GROUPS Clauses 19 and 37 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) That the amendments to remove ambiguity in the GST group rules are supported. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC) That the amendments to treat the GST group as a single company and the representative member as carrying on all activities for the GST group are supported. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) That the proposals to allow GST group members who exit the GST group to be relieved from joint and several liability are supported. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) That the proposal to align a GST group’s joint and several liability to that of consolidated groups in the Income Tax Act 2007 is supported. (KPMG) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Taxable supply information for GST groups Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) That the date information requirements for a GST group in proposed section 19L(1)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should be identical to the general date information requirements in proposed section 19K(8)(c), and that both provisions should refer to the date of the taxable supply information. Comment Officials support this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 225 Issue: Practical guidance Submission (PwC) That detailed practical guidance should be provided on the operation of the grouping rules. Comment Officials agree that guidance on the application of the grouping rules would be useful. This will be provided through a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Joint and several liability Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) a. That the proposed amendment should apply to remove joint and several liability for returns filed before the assent date for relevant transaction entered into after introduction of the Bill. For example, this would enable the proposals to apply to commercial merger and acquisition transactions commenced after the Bill was introduced and completed before enactment. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) b. That the provision allowing relief from joint and several liability for members leaving a group should be drafted to align more closely with the equivalent income tax provision. (PwC) Comment a. Officials agree that the submission has merit but consider there should be a reasonable time constraint on the retrospective application suggested. Officials consider the retrospective application could be based on the date of introduction of the Bill, namely 8 September 2021. b. Officials agree with this submission. Given the proposed provisions are based on similar rules in the Income Tax Act, they will be reviewed by the drafter to improve their consistency with the rules in the Income Tax Act. Recommendations a. That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. b. That the submission be accepted. 226 Issue: Clarify the GST treatment of business asset sales Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Mayne Wetherell, New Zealand Law Society) That the proposed amendments to section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should clarify the GST treatment of business asset sales involving multiple vendors in the same GST group for the zero-rating rules for land and going concerns. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission but note that the submission relates to the scope of the zero-rating rules as they apply to sales of land and the going concern rules and is outside the scope of the proposals to amend the GST grouping rules. Officials note the matter raised in the submission would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting issue Submission (EY, KPMG) That section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) be rewritten to enable a better logic flow and enhanced readability. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission but note it is similar in effect to other submissions that recommend a rewrite of the GST Act. Officials note that such a rewrite would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 227 NON-STATUTORY BOARDS Clause 8 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposal to amend section 6(3)(c)(iii) to remove the word “statutory” is supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 228 MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR CHANGING END DATE FOR TAXABLE PERIOD Clauses 13─18 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) That the proposed amendments to provide increased flexibility for GST period end dates are supported. It is sensible to allow a registered person to account for GST according to their business cycle. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Alternative methods should be available Submissions (Deloitte, PwC) a. That the proposed provisions are unclear and may not fully align with the commercial needs of GST-registered persons. (Deloitte) b. That GST-registered persons should be able to elect to use an alternative methodology to determine the end date of a taxable period. (PwC) Comment a. Officials consider the proposal accommodates a wide range of possible situations provided there are good commercial reasons for making an application. We have consulted with the submitter, and they do not have any specific concerns that would give rise to compliance cost concerns. b. Officials do not agree that GST-registered persons should be able to apply to use an al ternative methodology to that proposed in the Bill. We consider the proposal accommodates a sufficiently wide range of possible situations, provided there are good commercial reasons for making an application. The proposals in the Bill were also developed on the basis that the Inland Revenue START system would not require any change. Providing for alternative methodologies to those proposed could impact on the START system. We have consulted with the submitter, and they now accept the proposed provisions have a wider application than they considered possible when making their submission. Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be declined. 229 TAXABLE SUPPLIES OF GOODS NOT YET IN PHYSICAL POSSESSION Clause 21(4) Issue: Proposed amendment should be removed from Bill Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, PwC) The amendment is unnecessary and should not proceed. Comment Officials note the proposals originally stemmed from submissions made on a GST Issues Paper published in February 2020. Officials have reviewed the present submissions against the background of those earlier submissions and now agree the proposals are unnecessary. Accordingly, we recommend that clause 21(4) be omitted from the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 230 OTHER ISSUES Issue: GST B2B election under section 20F Submission (Deloitte) The current rules should be changed so that all GST-registered persons are treated as having made a business-to-business (B2B) election under section 20F unless they elect out. Where a business fails to lodge the B2B election, it is prevented from using the GST B2B zero-rating of financial services rules. It will therefore end up paying more GST than it should from a purely policy perspective. Two identical businesses can end up with different GST outcomes simply because one business was advised to lodge the GST B2B election and the other was not. When section 20F was originally issued for consultation, the default position was that every taxpayer was in the rules unless they elected out of them. Comment Section 20F of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was introduced as one of several amendments to allow supplies of financial services between businesses to be zero-rated (taxed at the rate of zero percent). The amendment was first introduced in 2003 as clause 111 of the Taxation (GST, Trans- Tasman Imputation, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. It was proposed that the rules would be compulsory for all GST-registered persons supplying financial services to recipients meeting the statutory criteria to receive zero-rated supplies of financial services. Provision was made for taxpayers to be able to elect out of the rules and continue to exempt their supplies of financial services from GST. A submission on that Bill noted that the proposed changes would have compliance costs on GST-registered persons as they would have to gather the required statistics and information to establish whether supplies of financial services in New Zealand should be zero-rated. It was submitted that a financial institution wishing to take advantage of the new zero-rating provisions should have to elect into those rules, and that this was consistent with other elective provisions in the GST Act that involved an element of compliance cost. The submission was accepted and, in its report on the Bill, the Finance and Expenditure Committee noted that electing into the zero-rating rules would allow providers of financial services to: • assess the benefit of providing zero-rated services to their customers balanced against the compliance cost of determining a customer’s eligibility to receive zero-rated services, and • consider the benefit of an increased entitlement to input tax credits. Clause 111 was replaced with an elect-in rule in clause 114 of the Bill, which was then enacted as section 155 of the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. The current submission notes that there would be no additional compliance costs for taxpayers in being within the B2B zero-rating of financial services rules. This is because the sole purpose of the rules is to increase the level of GST refunds a business can claim. 231 The current Bill does not amend the rules supporting B2B supplies of zero-rated financial services, and officials note that no work or consultation has been done to test the correctness of the submitter’s assertion. However, officials note that the rationale for an elect-in system was based on business systems as they existed nearly twenty years ago. It is possible that the associated compliance costs created by the statistical requirements of the zero-rating rules has decreased over time. Any work on retesting the assumptions underpinning the elect-in framework would need prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 233 Income tax remedials 235 HYBRID AND BRANCH MISMATCHES – IMPORTED MISMATCH RULE Clauses 81, 82 and 127(10) Issue: Support for changes Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC) Submitters support the changes to section FH 11, particularly the inclusion of the concept of surplus assessable income and the carry forward of denied deductions and surplus assessable income. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Inclusion of branch charges in imported mismatch rule Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Deductible charges made to New Zealand branches by their parents should not be subject to deduction denial under the imported mismatch rule. This was not contemplated by the OECD hybrids and branch mismatch report. Comment The submitters are correct that the relevant reports do not deal with branch charges. However, there is no reason in principle not to apply the imported mismatch rule to a branch charge, since this is a payment that is deductible in New Zealand in the same way as a payment to a third party. This should also not give rise to any co-ordination issues with other countries in applying the imported mismatch rule. However, the submissions do make the point that including branch charges in the imported mismatch rule is a new decision, rather than correction of an oversight, and that it is not taxpayer favourable. These two points support a conclusion that the proposed change to section FH 11(1)(b) should only apply from enactment of the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the effective date of proposed section FH 11(1)(b) should be enactment of the Bill. 236 Issue: Inclusion of payments by NZ branches in imported mismatch rule Submission (PwC) The legislation should clarify whether proposed section FH 11(1)(b) is intended to apply to a payment by a payer that is a New Zealand deducting branch of a non-resident. Comment Officials agree. The current legislation applies to such a payment. However, while the proposed new section FH 11(1) makes it clear that the imported mismatch rule applies to a deductible charge to a New Zealand deducting branch, the language dealing with straightforward payments made by a New Zealand deducting branch is no longer clear. This should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Amendments unnecessary Submission (Deloitte) Section FH 11(5) should be extended to also apply to deduction denial under section FH 11(3) (the structured imported mismatch rule), rather than amending section FH 11(1). The requirement in existing section FH 11(5) that amounts denied under the unstructured mismatch rule be determined consistently with chapter 8 of the hybrid mismatch report is sufficient to ensure that payments made through an intermediate entity in a country with hybrid rules do not give rise to deduction denial under section FH 11(4) (the unstructured imported mismatch rule). This should be extended to also apply to deduction denial under the structured imported mismatch rule. The current “bottom-up” approach articulated in the legislation is not consistent with the “top-down” approach in the OECD Final Report. Comment As a general proposition, officials think it preferable to provide rules in the legislation itself, rather than referring to other sources. While the complexity of the unstructured rule meant that the costs of a legislatively prescriptive approach outweighed the benefits, this does not seem to be the case for the structured rule. On balance, officials remain of this view. The amendments are intended to ensure that the bottom-up approach produces the same outcome as the OECD top-down approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 237 Issue: Tracing “payments” between members of a consolidated group Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) There should be no requirement to trace payments from one tax consolidated group member to another. This would be complex, and there is no guidance from the OECD as to how it might be done. It will significantly increase the work for New Zealand taxpayers when considering the application of the rules. Comment Officials disagree. We acknowledge that it is more complex to apply tracing to a payment made to a consolidated group member company on the basis that consolidation involves an implicit payment from members who are in profit to members who are in loss than it is in cases where there is a specific grouping of profit and loss between a profit and a loss company. However, proposed section FH 11(5) does not specifically require tracing on that basis. It only requires that the approaches described in the OECD hybrid mismatch report be followed. This allows some flexibility and, most importantly, a common approach to be taken. For example, to the extent that a payment is deemed to exist between profit and loss members of a tax consolidated group when Australia applies its imported mismatch rule, there is no reason for that not to apply under New Zealand rules as well. The purpose of expanding section FH 11(5) is to allow a common approach to be taken by jurisdictions with hybrid mismatch legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: More should be done to simplify section FH 11 Submission (EY) While the changes to section FH 11 are welcome, more needs to be done to simplify the section. Comment Officials acknowledge that the imported mismatch rule, in particular, is complex. However, any further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 238 Issue: Inland Revenue should publish a list of countries with hybrid mismatch legislation Submission (EY, PwC) Inland Revenue should publish a list of countries that it considers have hybrid mismatch legislation, as section FH 11 requires a taxpayer to determine whether another country has such legislation, and this information may not be publicly available. Comment Officials have received a number of requests for such a list. Officials have discussed this with other tax administrations, and we are not aware of any other country having published such a list. Publication of a list inevitably has risks and creates continued pressure to keep the list up to date. Officials also are of the view that most advisers working in the hybrids area are aware of which counterparty countries have hybrid rules. Therefore, no list is currently contemplated. If other countries do publish lists, the practice in New Zealand may be reviewed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inland Revenue should publish examples Submission (KPMG) The proposed amendments to section FH 11 are welcome, but Inland Revenue should publish examples of offsets and other matters that give rise to imported mismatches. Comment Officials note the support for the amendments. Examples will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin published following enactment of the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 239 Issue: Rules dealing with branch mismatches should be separated from other mismatch rules Submission (KPMG, Mayne Wetherell) There should be separate sections in the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) dealing only with branch mismatches. The Act currently deals with branch mismatches and hybrid mismatches in the same sections. This adds to the length of the sections and makes for convoluted drafting. Separate sections dealing only with branches would simplify and clarify the rules. Comment Officials disagree. A trade-off must often be made between concise legislation and legislation that deals separately with closely related areas. Officials’ view is that the current law is not sufficiently unsatisfactory that the costs of undoing the current grouping of the branch and other mismatches in the same section would justify the benefits. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Hybrid and branch mismatch rules should be subject to a post-implementation review Submission (Mayne Wetherell) A post-implementation review should be undertaken to assess whether the complexity and compliance burden of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules is warranted and whether simplification is desirable. Comment Officials disagree. The hybrid and branch mismatch rules only took effect for most taxpayers in the income year ending 1 April 2020, with the unstructured imported mismatch rule applying for income years beginning on or after 1 January 2020. There is no indication that other countries with hybrid rules are making significant changes to their rules. Officials consider it too early to undertake a post-implementation review. As the submitter noted in their submission, the operation of the rules has been under active review by Inland Revenue and changes have been made to ensure the rules apply appropriately. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 240 Issue: Retrospective effect should be limited Submission (Mayne Wetherell) Taxpayers should be entitled to file their tax returns for years beginning on or before the enactment of the Bill in reliance on the law existing before the amendments in the Bill if they wish to do so. Comment Officials agree some form of protection from retrospectivity could be given. The proposed amendments are intended only to more accurately reflect the OECD recommended imported mismatch rule, and they are generally taxpayer friendly. The only amendment that is likely to increase tax obligations is clause 81(4), and this is stated in clause 81(6) to apply only for income years beginning on or after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. However, it is not impossible that the amendments might lead to the imposition of further tax. Preserving the position would mean taxpayers did not have to revisit returns they have already filed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted Issue: Drafting issues Submission (NZLS, PwC) Submitters suggested the following drafting changes should be made to clauses 81 and 82: a. The definition of “hybrid mismatch legislation” in section FH 15 should extend to regimes intended to comply with the OECD hybrid and branch mismatch reports. (NZLS, PwC) b. Proposed section FH 11(1B)(g) should not include the words “that counteracts the hybrid mismatch”. This would simplify compliance for taxpayers. (NZLS, PwC) c. Proposed section FH 11(6)(b) should be omitted as unnecessary. (NZLS) d. Section FH 11 should contain a definition of a “funded payment”, rather than relying in section FH 11(5) on the OECD guidance. (NZLS) e. Proposed section FH 11(1B)(g) should be amended so that the section is not satisfied if the payer jurisdiction counteracts the mismatch. (PwC) Comment a. Section FH 1(2) states that subpart FH implements the recommendations made by the OECD in the hybrid and branch mismatch reports. Section FH 1(4) contains a section-by - section mapping of the provisions of subpart FH to the OECD recommendations. Accordingly, the reference in the definition of “hybrid mismatch legislation” to legislation having “an intended effect” corresponding to the effect of a provision in subpart FH incorporates the principles of the OECD reports. Officials do not consider a further explicit reference necessary. b. We agree that the words “that counteracts the hybrid mismatch” can be omitted. 241 c. We agree that proposed paragraph FH 11(6)(b) can be omitted. d. There is no need for a definition of a funded payment. Proposed section FH 11(1B)(a) says it is a payment from a person in a country outside New Zealand to a person in the same or another country outside New Zealand, for which an original payment or charge provides funds. Whether the original payment or charge does provide funds is determined by applying the OECD top-down tracing principle. Accordingly, there does not seem to be a basis for a definition separate from section FH 11(5). e. Officials do not agree that section FH 11(1B)(g) should be amended by including a reference to the payer jurisdiction. Section FH 11(1B) only applies if a funded payment gives rise to a hybrid mismatch. A hybrid mismatch only arises if an amount is deductible. If the payer has hybrid mismatch legislation, the payment will not be deductible. Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be accepted. c. That the submission be accepted. d. That the submission be declined. e. That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of hybrid mismatch legislation needs to be limited Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference to hybrid mismatch legislation in section FH 11(1)(b) and section FH 11(1B)(c) needs to be narrowed to legislation having the same effect as subpart FH. Those sections are intended to ensure section FH 11 does not apply if a payment is made to a payee in a country with comprehensive hybrid mismatch legislation. However, the reference to “hybrid mismatch legislation” means that the section does not apply if a payment is made to a payee in a country whose law counteracts the effect of only one type of hybrid mismatch (see proposed amendment to paragraph (b) of the definition of “hybrid mismatch legislation” in clause 82(2) of the Bill). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 242 EARLY-PAYMENT DISCOUNT RATE CHANGES Clause 111 Issue: Application date Submission (Deloitte) The current early-payment discount (EPD) rate of 6.7% should continue to apply until 31 March 2022 to align with the last filing date for returns with an extension of time. The commencement date for the proposed amendment should be changed to 1 April 2022 to provide certainty for affected taxpayers. Comment Officials agree that taxpayers should be able to benefit from the EPD rate of 6.7% for the 2021–22 tax year. Therefore, the proposed change should only apply for the 2022–23 and later income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Alignment with FBT prescribed rate Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The EPD rate should equate with the FBT prescribed rate of interest. The method for determining the rate at which the Commissioner pays use of money interest (UOMI) on overpaid tax is flawed. Therefore, determining the EPD rate by reference to the Commissioner’s UOMI rate would exacerbate this issue. Comment Officials disagree that the way the Commissioner’s UOMI payment rate is set is flawed. Therefore, officials consider the need to align it with a different rate is not necessary. The Commissioner’s paying rate is designed to be aligned with market rates and is therefore an appropriate measure. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 243 Issue: Proposed amendment should not proceed Submission (KPMG) The proposed amendment should not proceed as this is clearly not a remedial change but rather an explicit policy change. The rationale for the 6.7% rate is that it is approximately equivalent to a 10% pre-tax discount on tax payable for early payment. The proposed amendment alters the rate to tie it to the prevailing use of money interest credit rate plus 200 basis points. However, there does not appear to be any policy rationale as to why the effective 10% pre-tax discount on tax payable is no longer appropriate. Comment The policy rationale has not changed. The EPD rate is designed to incentivise early payment. It is appropriate for this rate to be pegged to market interest rates so it can adapt to changing economic circumstances. Having it set at 6.7% in primary legislation causes it to be inflexible and significantly above market interest rates. The proposed amendment aims to ensure the EPD rate better aligns with what would be expected from market rates. Aligning it with the Commissioner’s paying rate, which is itself aligned with market rates, does this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 244 RESTRICTED TRANSFER PRICING REMEDIALS Clauses 51 and 86 Issue: Deemed dividend remedial should not proceed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) Submitters consider that the proposed deemed dividend remedial should not proceed. This is because: • It is inconsistent with the rationale of a dividend arising when a transfer of value is made by a company to a shareholder. In transfer pricing situations, the value transferred is the amount of interest in excess of what would have been paid by third parties (that is, the arm’s length amount). This is not the same for an amount of interest denied under the restricted transfer pricing rules since the amount of deductible interest is below the arm’s length amount. (EY) • The arbitrary nature of the restricted transfer pricing rules, which can result in arm’s length amounts of interest being non-deductible, should not be compounded by then deeming such amounts to also be a dividend when they are an arm’s length amount of interest. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) • At the time the restricted transfer pricing rules were introduced, they were stated to be consistent with the arm’s length principle. Therefore, the proposal should not be necessary as the restricted transfer pricing rate and the arm’s length rate should be the same. If officials disagree, then a review of the restricted transfer pricing rules is required. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials disagree. The purpose of the restricted transfer pricing rules is to provide a more robust method of determining an appropriate price for an intra-group loan than an unmodified arm’s length approach. If a New Zealand company is paying more than the amount determined by the restricted transfer pricing rules, the excess is a transfer of value by the company to its shareholder and must logically be a dividend. Officials also note that this proposal does not affect how the restricted transfer pricing rules apply to the deductibility of interest incurred. It merely confirms that interest charged above the deductible amount is a transfer of value to the shareholder and should be treated as a deemed dividend. This outcome is consistent with the policy intent when the restricted transfer pricing rules were introduced. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 245 Issue: More guidance required Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) If the proposed deemed dividend remedial proceeds, it needs to be supported by additional detailed guidance – in particular, clear guidance on how the deemed dividend rules and the non-resident withholding tax rules interact together. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) Clear guidance should be provided on whether the restricted transfer pricing rules are interest limitation rules or a form of transfer pricing rules, and there should be confirmation that Inland Revenue will consistently apply this characterisation. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree that clear guidance should be provided as to the interaction of the deemed dividend rules and the non-resident withholding tax rules. This will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin published after enactment of the Bill. Point of difference On the issue of the characterisation of the restricted transfer pricing rules, officials do not consider it necessary to characterise them as either transfer pricing or interest limitation rules. The rules were implemented to address specific base erosion and profit shifting concerns and their characterisation as a certain type of rule is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Commissioner to agree acceptable pricing with taxpayers Submission (EY) A streamlined process should be available to taxpayers to provide certainty on how amounts denied under the restricted transfer pricing rules, in excess of the amount that would be denied under the arm’s length amount, should be treated. This process should give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to deviate from the amounts calculated under the restricted transfer pricing rules, where appropriate, to align the outcome with the arm’s length principle. This flexibility would recognise that applying the rules can produce outcomes that do not align with the arm’s length principle and would allow for an agreed resolution that takes into account the taxpayer’s specific circumstances. Comment Officials disagree that the Commissioner should be given a discretion to override the restricted transfer pricing rules. This would undermine the certainty of an agreed outcome and create an unsatisfactory tension between the rules-based regime of the restricted transfer pricing rules and a regime based on arm’s length pricing principles. Allowing a 246 separate discretionary rule would move the rules closer to standard transfer pricing rules, which have been shown to be inadequate to deal with base erosion and profit shifting challenges. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amending section CD 39 will not achieve intended result Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed amendment to section CD 39(8) will not achieve the intended outcome of ensuring that the deemed dividend that arises when interest is disallowed under the restricted transfer pricing rules is calculated based on the amount disallowed under those rules, rather than the arm’s length amount. Section CD 39 calculates a dividend when value is transferred by a company to its shareholder. For example, when a company provides a below market interest loan to its shareholder, the shareholder derives a dividend equal to the market interest they would have paid. Under section CD 39(5), the amount of the dividend is the excess (if any) of interest calculated for the quarter on the basis of the benchmark rate specified in section CD 39(6) to (8) over the actual amount of interest accruing on the loan in the quarter. However, in the context of cross-border loans, the transfer pricing and restricted transfer pricing rules are aimed at scenarios where money is lent by an offshore shareholder (for example, a parent company) or associate to a New Zealand company at excessive interest rates, that is, the transfer of value is through the interest paid to the shareholder being above market, rather than the interest paid by the shareholder being below market. Therefore, section CD 39 will not apply in the context of interest disallowed under the restricted transfer pricing rules. Consequently, officials recommend that section CD 38, which provides the general calculation of transfer of value from a company, should instead be amended consistent with the intention of the original proposed amendment to section CD 39(8). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 247 FOREIGN CURRENCY LOANS THAT FINANCE RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY IN A FOREIGN JURISDICTION Clause 70 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, KPMG) The submitters support the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (Deloitte) The proposed amendment should apply from the 2021–22 income year, rather than from income years beginning on or after the date of enactment, so that taxpayers with an early balance date can apply this amendment in their tax returns. Comment Officials agree that taxpayers with an early balance date should be able to apply the proposed amendment in the same income year as taxpayers with a standard or late balance date. However, for taxpayers with a standard or late balance date, the amendment would apply from the 2022–23 income year based on the application date proposed in the Bill, not the 2021–22 income year. Therefore, to enable taxpayers with an early balance date to apply the amendment in their tax returns in the same income year as taxpayers with a standard or late balance date, the application date should be from the 2022–23 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Amendment not required Submission (PwC) The proposed amendment is not required because the residential rental property loss ring- fencing rules do not apply to foreign exchange losses. Foreign exchange gains or losses arise because of the application of the financial arrangements rules, and foreign exchange losses on financial arrangements that finance residential rental properties are not incurred in relation to residential rental properties for the purposes of section EL 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 248 Comment The policy intention is that the residential rental property loss ring-fencing rules apply to all expenditure that arises because of the application of the financial arrangements rules to a foreign currency loan that finances a residential rental property. Officials therefore consider that this expenditure, including foreign exchange losses, is incurred in relation to residential rental properties for the purposes of section EL 4 and is ring-fenced. As a result, the amendment is required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 249 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX – UNCLASSIFIED BENEFITS PAID BY ASSOCIATES Clause 114 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) Submitters support the amendment to exclude unclassified benefits paid by an employer’s associate to that associate’s employees from the calculation of the de minimis concession when the employer and its associate are not part of the same commonly owned group. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: De minimis rule should be reviewed Submission (Deloitte) The de minimis rule is an area of high compliance costs for business and it would be of benefit to review this rule in its entirety. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised by the submitter. However, further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax work policy programme. We note that Inland Revenue is currently undertaking a stewardship review of FBT, and the findings of this review will be taken into consideration for future FBT changes by the Government. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Provide certainty of the documentation required Submission (Deloitte) The requirement to categorise payments will add to compliance costs. Certainty as to what documentation must be kept to prove that payments have been correctly categorised should be provided. 250 Comment General record-keeping obligations are set out in section 15B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These include that taxpayers must keep all necessary information to support their tax position. The proposed changes in the Bill will not change those requirements. It will simply mean that in this case records to confirm that any associated employers excluded from the de minimis are justified must be kept. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 251 ELECTION DAY WORKER TAX CODE Clause 127(6) Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposed amendment to the definition of “election day worker”. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 252 APPROVED ISSUER LEVY AND SECURITY TRUSTS Clause 119 Issue: Further amendments should be made to prevent the overreach of the associated person rules Submission (Australian Securitisation Forum) a. The proposed amendment to remove the overreach of the associated person rules for security trusts in the approved issuer levy rules is welcomed by the submitter. b. Further amendments to the overreach of the associated persons rules should also be made. A person should not be associated with a securitisation SPV (or treated as holding related-party debt) simply because the person (or an associate of the person) is a settlor of the securitisation SPV, has the power to appoint, or is a beneficiary of a security trust solely as an incident of the person’s role as a creditor to the securitisation SPV. Comment b. The submitter points out that the relevant association tests appear to have been drafted with a family trust or similar private arrangement in mind, where being a settlor or having the power to appoint might carry the necessary degree of control or influence to give rise to association. For a securitisation SPV, on the other hand, the trust is a mechanism to hold receivables and allocate cash to noteholders. Any rights held over the trust by a creditor are usually an incident of the person’s role as a creditor to the trust and are not a quasi-ownership right. Therefore, such rights should not give rise to association. The submitter also acknowledges that it is possible to structure around the overreach in the existing association tests, but states that this results in increased costs and complexity. Officials acknowledge the matter raised by the submitter. There does seem to be the potential for the associated person rules to overreach in the circumstances identified by the submitter. However, the requested amendments are beyond the scope of the proposed amendment to the approved issuer levy rule. Further work would be required to understand the impact of amending the associated person rules in those contexts. For example, excluding association as an incident of a creditor relationship might inadvertently extend to cases where there is a substantive association that co-exists with a creditor relationship. Further consideration of this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation a. That the submission be noted. b. That the submission be declined. 253 ELECTING INTO THE SECURITISATION REGIME Clause 89 Issue: An earlier date for election into the regime should be allowed Submission (Australian Securitisation Forum, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Russell McVeagh) a. Submitters support the proposed amendment. b. The amendment should allow the election to be made earlier. The requirement that the election into the securitisation regime be made “after the first transfer of assets to the debt funding special purpose vehicle” may be restrictive in practice. The election should be able to be made any time after the creation or appointment of the debt funding special purpose vehicle (securitisation SPV). (Russell McVeagh) Comment b. There is no particular reason why the election into the securitisation regime cannot be made before the first transfer of assets is made to the securitisation SPV. Accordingly, allowing an earlier date seems beneficial if it would facilitate use of the regime. Officials consider that the election should be able to be made any time after the creation of the securitisation SPV. Point of difference However, the intent of the amendment is to allow an earlier date than is currently provided for, not a later date. Therefore, the election should not be able to be made after the return has been filed for the income tax year in which the first transfer of assets by the originator to the securitisation SPV was made (being the time at which an election may be made under the current legislation). Recommendation a. That the submission be noted. b. That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Transfers between special purpose vehicles Submission (Australian Securitisation Forum) The position regarding whether an election can be made for a new securitisation SPV following the transfer of assets from a previous securitisation SPV should be confirmed by Inland Revenue guidance or (if necessary) remedial amendment. Sometimes assets must be transferred between securitisation SPVs. For example, the originator may establish a “warehouse trust” securitisation SPV to hold assets before they are transferred to a second securitisation SPV. Assuming that both the warehouse trust and 254 the second securitisation SPV are consolidated (for financial reporting purposes) with the originator, and that an election into the regime has been made for the warehouse trust securitisation SPV, the question may arise whether an election can be made for the second securitisation SPV. The submitter considers this is already the position as a matter of interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions, but given the importance of this fundamental eligibility point, it considers this should be clarified. Comment The intention of the securitisation regime is that a securitisation SPV subject to the regime is transparent for tax purposes. Accordingly, if the originator of a securitisation SPV elects into the regime for a securitisation SPV, and that securitisation SPV transfers its assets to a second securitisation SPV, then that transfer should be treated as a transfer of the assets by the originator into that second securitisation SPV. Therefore, section HR 9 should apply as if the transfer of assets into the second securitisation SPV was made directly by the originator. This means that the second securitisation SPV should be able to elect into the securitisation regime (assuming the other requirements are met for the originator and the second securitisation SPV). Officials agree with the submitter that this is the result under the current law. For clarity, guidance will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Transfers from a securitisation SPV that does not elect into the regime Submission (Australian Securitisation Forum) Where a company or trustee that meets the definition of “debt funding special purpose vehicle” but has not elected into the regime (Transferor SPV) transfers its assets to another company or trustee (Transferee SPV) that also meets the definition of “debt funding special purpose vehicle” and is consolidated for financial reporting purposes with the originator of the Transferor SPV, the transfer should be able to be treated (by election) for tax purposes as a transfer by the Transferor SPV to the originator(s), and in turn by the originator(s) to the Transferee SPV. Comment The submitter points out the difficulties that can arise where a securitisation SPV meets the criteria to elect into the securitisation regime under section HR 9 but cannot easily make the election into the regime. This often arises for legacy securitisation arrangements. In these cases, it is preferable for the securitisation SPV to transfer its assets to a new securitisation SPV, and for that new securitisation SPV to elect into the regime. However, this is not possible under the current law due to a requirement that all originators are members of the same wholly owned group. The submitter also identifies that a workaround currently exists using a two-stage transfer via the originator, but that it may be undesirable for legal or commercial reasons, and it imposes greater transaction costs on the parties. Officials acknowledge the issue raised by the submitter but note that it is outside the scope of the proposed amendment. Further work is required to understand its implications, particularly given that it involves a deemed transfer of assets and would allow assets to be directly contributed to a securitisation SPV from outside the originator’s wholly owned group 255 (which is outside the initial policy intent). Further consideration of this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Some anti-avoidance rules overreach in relation to securitisations Submission (Australian Securitisation Forum) Notes issued by a securitisation SPV should be excluded from section GC 18 of the transfer pricing rules. Where an originator holds junior notes, the restricted transfer pricing rules require the junior notes to be priced for tax purposes as if they ranked equally with the senior notes under the transfer pricing rules (as the originator and securitisation SPV will be associated parties). This means part of the interest paid by the securitisation SPV will not be deductible. This is because section GC 18 requires subordination to be disregarded. However, subordination is fundamental to the structure and purpose of a securitisation, and it should not be disregarded in this case. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised by the submitter but note that it is outside the scope of the proposed amendment and would involve a change in policy. Further consideration of this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Securitisation vehicles should be excluded from the thin capitalisation rules Submission (Australian Securitisation Forum) Securitisation vehicles should be excluded from the thin capitalisation rules. Currently there is an on-lending concession available to securitisation vehicles. This allows a securitisation SPV to 100% debt fund its assets, but only to the extent its assets are financial arrangements or property incidental to financial arrangements. Where a securitisation SPV holds assets that are not financial arrangements (such as operating leases), the thin capitalisation rules may deny deductions for interest paid by the securitisation SPV on the debt that funds those non- financial arrangement assets. It is possible to work around this by ensuring that no more than 10% of the securitisation SPV’s debt is issued to the originator or its associates. However, this creates a material 256 restriction on the amount of owner-linked debt that is permitted and is contrary to steps being taken internationally to encourage risk retention. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised by the submitter but note that it is outside the scope of the proposed amendment to the approved issuer levy regime and would involve a change in policy (rather than being a remedial amendment). Further consideration of this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 257 TAX POOLING AND EARLY-PAYMENT DISCOUNT SETTINGS Clauses 112, 124 and 126 Issue: Support for proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The submitters support the proposals. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (PwC) The application date of the proposed amendments should have a retrospective effect to ensure the use of purchased tax pooling funds by qualifying taxpayers in the preceding years that have been erroneously denied an early-payment discount credit are remedied. Comment The proposed amendment is designed to remedy an unintended consequence of system changes. It is therefore appropriate for the proposed amendment to be retrospective to the date of the change. The proposed amendments should therefore apply from the 2019–20 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Guidance should be issued Submission (PWC) It should be clarified that a rate of 6.7% will be used to calculate the outstanding early- payment discount (EPD) of taxpayers who should have received the EPD but did not due to Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised by the submitter and will recommend that Inland Revenue provide guidance on this matter. 258 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Non-safe harbour taxpayers Submission (KPMG) Non-safe harbour taxpayers should be able to access tax pooling to meet their tax liabilities in their first year as a provisional taxpayer. Comment Non-safe harbour taxpayers can already access tax pooling in their first year as a provisional taxpayer. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 259 CUSTODIAL INSTITUTIONS – DEFINITION OF END INVESTOR Clauses 117 and 140 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) The proposed amendments are supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 260 CORPORATE SPIN-OUTS AND SHAREHOLDING CONTINUITY Clause 129 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell) The submitters support the proposals. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Determination-making power Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell) The proposed amendments will address a specific shareholder continuity problem caused by corporate spin-outs, but they will not address all shareholder continuity problems caused by these transactions. The submitters consider that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should be given the power to determine that there has been no change in shareholder continuity where, in substance, there has been no change in shareholding, even though certain specific requirements in section YC 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (as well as certain other provisions in subpart YC) are not met. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission. However, expanding the scope of the corporate spin-outs and shareholder continuity proposals to introduce a determination- making power would be a significant change that would require further work and consultation. Any further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 261 SHARE-FOR-SHARE EXCHANGES AND AVAILABLE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION AMOUNT Clause 53(1) Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd and Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, PwC) The submitters support the proposals. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application to historic liquidations Submission (PwC) The proposed amendment should be enacted with retrospective effect, so it applies to historic liquidations as well. Comment As noted in the Commentary to the Bill, the proposed amendment will apply to liquidations from the date of enactment, including where the share-for -share exchange or sale occurred before the date of enactment. Officials understand that the problem dealt with by this amendment was known to many advisors for a long time and their advice to their clients was usually either not to do a share-for -share exchange or not to liquidate a company in this circumstance. Therefore, we expect the number of historical liquidations where tax on the gain arose would be relatively few. Part of the benefit of the proposed amendment is to remove the disincentive for commercially sensible restructures that were being prevented solely due to tax. Applying the proposed amendment to historical liquidations would potentially open the Government up to an incalculable fiscal risk, while not being able to affect whether, or how, a restructure had happened in the past. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 262 Issue: Alternative proposals should be considered Submission (KPMG) There is no good policy reason to retain the current available subscribed capital (ASC) limitation in the absence of a comprehensive capital gains tax and alternative proposals should be considered. The ASC limitation was previously necessary to prevent revenue reserves being converted to tax-free capital gains. Its introduction was a reaction to companies creating internal capital gains to make tax-free distributions. However, this was a historical problem as the associated person capital gains rules have since addressed this. Comment While the ASC limitation was originally introduced to prevent internally generated capital gains being distributed in preference to (taxable) revenue reserves, the policy also applies to externally generated capital gains. New Zealand has a policy that capital gains can only be distributed tax free from an ordinary company upon its liquidation, and the ASC limitation supports that policy. Without the ASC limitation, a group could transfer a company with an existing gain to a second company via a share-for -share exchange and then distribute the gain (now in the form of ASC) tax free without having to liquidate or pay tax on the distribution. Removing the ASC limitation, or otherwise allowing capital gains to be distributed by a company in the ordinary course of business, would be a significant change and would require consideration of the impact on other aspects of the tax system. Further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Capital gains sold to an associated party Submission (Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd and Hawke’s Bay Regional Council) The restriction to non-associated disposals is unnecessary and will result in genuine capital gains being permanently taxable. Comment Rather than being a restriction on internally generated capital gains, the restriction to sales to third parties will prevent capital gains being distributed without an entity being in- substance liquidated. This restriction ensures that a group cannot distribute a capital gain without liquidating a company by restructuring via a share-for -share exchange then selling the target company to another group company. In the absence of the restriction to third party sales, this series of transactions would allow a capital gain to be distributed to shareholders without any assets being sold outside the group. While this restriction may limit some restructures, this would only be the case in a small subset of cases where a group has been restructured twice since the capital gain was 263 generated. The overall proposal is taxpayer favourable considering that disposals in this circumstance are currently taxable whether the sale is to a third party or a related party. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Memorandum accounts for ASC and capital gains Submission (KPMG) Memorandum accounts for ASC and capital gain amounts should be established and the time bar rules should apply to the amounts recorded in these accounts. The proposed amendment will require the capital gain amount to be amended. This could be some time after the Target is acquired in the share-for -share exchange and the information may not be readily available at that time. A memorandum account with an applicable time bar would motivate the Commissioner to confirm the company’s position on a more real-time basis. Comment While the time between the share-for -share exchange and the liquidation may be several years, at the time the share-for -share exchange occurs the taxpayer will be aware of the future benefit in retaining this information. Indeed, if the taxpayer considers it beneficial, nothing prevents them from maintaining a memorandum account of ASC and capital gains already, although there is no formal capacity to provide this to Inland Revenue. Requiring a memorandum account to be filed with Inland Revenue would have much wider implications than the scope of the current proposed amendment. Officials note that this matter is under consideration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Capital losses Submission (KPMG) Officials should confirm the intended effect of the proposed amendment if the value of the Target decreases. Comment The submission provides an example. We have amended this slightly to make it more consistent with example 29 in the Commentary to the Bill. 264 Shareholde r 1 Shareholde r 2 Acquirer $1,000 C ash $1,000 R/earnings Target $1,000 Asset $100 ASC $900 ACDA Acqu irer Sh ares Targ et sh ares Before Aft er Shareholde r 1 Acquirer $1,000 Cash $1,000 Shares in Target $100 ASC $1,000 R/earnings Target $900 Asset $100 ASC $900 ACDA $-100 R/loss Distribution $1,900 C ash $ 100 ASC $ 800 ACDA $1,000 Dividend Shareholde r 2 Sale to third party Disposal of shares Sale of shares $900 Cost $1,000 Sub-total -$100 ACDA uplift $900 C ap it al gain $ 800 As shown in this diagram, under the proposed amendment, Acquirer makes a $100 capital loss on the sale of Target shares for $900 that were acquired for $1,000; however, they also make an additional capital gain amount equal to the ASC limitation of $900. When considered together, these amounts total to a capital gain of $800. This is consistent with the result in the submitter’s example. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 265 DEBT REMISSION WITHIN AN ECONOMIC GROUP Clauses 50, 52, 53(2)–(3), 65, 80, 85 and 127(11), (14) and (15) Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd and Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, KPMG) Submitters support the debt remission proposals. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) The submitter strongly supports the extension of the rule to remissions of debt owed by a New Zealand branch of a non-resident to a member of the non-resident’s wholly-owned group. (KPMG) The submitter supports the proposal that available subscribed capital that arises in a New Zealand resident borrower when a parent company remits a debt owed by the borrower is extended to include remission within a wholly owned group by a New Zealand resident parent. (Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd and Hawke’s Bay Regional Council) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Amounts forgiven before the date of enactment Submission (Hawke’s Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd and Hawke’s Bay Regional Council) We seek confirmation that amounts forgiven within a wholly owned group before the date of enactment will result in an available subscribed capital (ASC) uplift if ASC is calculated after the date of enactment. Comment As introduced in the Bill, the proposed debt remission provisions would have applied to debt remitted after the date of enactment. This is because ASC arises when a transaction occurs, rather than at some later time when a taxpayer has a reason to calculate their ASC. However, officials have reconsidered the application date of the proposed changes and consider they should apply to debt remitted on or after 30 March 2017. This is the date that sections CD 43(6B)-(6D), which provide for ASC upon a debt remission in other circumstances, were introduced by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 266 EMPLOYER SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION TAX ON CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PAST EMPLOYEES Clause 115 Issue: Retrospective application of change in rate Submission (Deloitte, EY, Financial Services Council) The proposed amendment to change the flat rate of employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) for contributions made for past employees to 33% should have an application date of 1 April 2021. This would ensure the reversal of any overtaxation that has occurred since the 39% personal tax rate was introduced. Comment The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 increased the flat rate of ESCT that applies when employers make superannuation cash contributions for the benefit of a past employee from 33% to 39%. This was to mirror the new top personal income tax rate that was introduced by the same Act. Limited data on ESCT contributions made for past employees was available to Inland Revenue at the time policy decisions on the 39% rate were taken and engagement with external stakeholders was not possible. The original rationale behind aligning the ESCT rate for past employees (and the rate for defined benefit schemes, where the employer chooses to) with the new top rate was that defined benefit schemes are generally legacy schemes no longer open to new employees and members tend to be on higher incomes compared with the standard population. In the absence of detailed information on such contributions, officials considered that not aligning the past employee ESCT rate with the top rate would create an integrity risk. After receiving more recent data from the Workplace Savings Committee of the Financial Services Council, officials accepted that a 39% rate resulted in overtaxation in almost all cases and there was minimal integrity risk associated with reducing the rate to 33%. We initially recommended this change apply proactively from 1 April 2022. This is the approach normally taken with changes to withholding taxes, because of potential issues with reopening periods. There are also risks associated with recommending a 1 April 2021 application date (for example, if the legislation does not pass and taxpayers have used the incorrect rate). However, on balance we accept that a 1 April 2021 date should apply to remedy the full extent of overtaxation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 267 Issue: Contributions made to defined benefit scheme Submission (EY) An additional amendment is necessary to ensure that employers who make contributions to defined benefit schemes can also use the 33% flat rate. Comment An additional amendment is not necessary. This is because, for contributions to a defined benefit scheme, employers can allocate contributions to a particular employee and use their correct personal rate. It is therefore appropriate for the option to elect the top personal income tax rate of 39% to be available. Allowing employers to elect a 33% flat rate would pose an integrity risk where an employee to whom the contribution applies should be on the 39% rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 268 DEFINITION OF DECOMMISSIONING IN THE PETROLEUM MINING REGIME Clause 127(4) Issue: “Permanently” should not be inserted Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Energy Resources Aotearoa, PwC) The word “permanently” should not be inserted into the definition of “decommissioning”. It will have unintended consequences in the context of plugging and abandonment. Comment The intent of the proposed amendment is to ensure that the refundable tax credit for expenditure on decommissioning is not available for expenditure on wells that are only suspended with the possibility of being used again in the future. The refundable tax credit was always intended to be available for expenditure on permanently plugging and abandoning wells. However, officials recognise that the steps required to permanently plug and abandon a well involve suspending a well first. In addition, decommissioning can take place over several income years. Therefore, under the proposed amendment, the refundable credit may not be available in years before the petroleum miner finishes the permanent plugging and abandoning of the well. This is not an intended outcome of the change, as it was always intended that the refundable credit be available each year that qualifying losses were incurred. Officials still intend that this credit is only for wells that are permanently plugged and abandoned. However, this must include wells that are intended to be permanently plugged and abandoned even if this process has not finished at the time the credit is calculated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Removal of certain exploratory wells Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Energy Resources Aotearoa) The proposals will alter a petroleum miner’s economic decisions and behaviour regarding decommissioning, and tax costs should not be driving a petroleum miner’s decommissioning decisions. A blanket removal of certain exploratory wells would have significant unintended implications for petroleum miners and deny eligible exploratory wells access to the tax credit. (Energy Resources Aotearoa) Exploratory wells could instead be excluded from the tax credit if they are drilled toward the end of the field production life and there is insufficient subsequent income to cover the decommissioning costs of those wells. (Energy Resources Aotearoa) 269 Comment The proposed amendments currently remove certain exploratory wells from the definition of decommissioning. These are wells that are plugged and abandoned in a permit area together with a commercial well geologically contiguous with the exploratory well. It has been determined that the phrase “geologically contiguous” may be wider than initially contemplated when the decommissioning definition was developed. This may result in expenditure on decommissioning some exploratory wells being eligible for the refundable tax credit in cases where that was not intended. The proposed amendment was intended to ensure that this was not the case. Expenditure on drilling an exploratory well can be considered analogous to a business in another industry spending money developing a new product that may or may not be commercially successful. If this expenditure is incurred before, or while, the business is profitable, this expenditure will reduce the business’s tax liability (either in the year incurred or as a loss brought forward). Expenditure on decommissioning an exploratory well can be deferred for commercial reasons much later than the expenditure on drilling that well in the first place. The refundable credit should be available to an exploratory well that could have been decommissioned while the miner was still profitable so that the decommissioning expenditure would reduce the tax liability in that year, even if the decommissioning was deferred for commercial reasons. Access to the refundable credit in this circumstance prevents the tax outcome influencing the commercial decision regarding when is most efficient to decommission the well. Officials agree that the proposed amendment could be better targeted at the wells for which there are specific policy concerns. Officials agree with the suggestion to make expenditure on exploratory wells ineligible if the well is drilled toward the end of the field production life and there is insufficient subsequent income to cover decommissioning. This would be a better targeted approach to achieve the policy intent without providing a fossil fuel subsidy or support measure. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Decommissioning definition should not change Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Energy Resources Aotearoa) a. Any concerns with the decommissioning definition as it relates to expenditure on certain exploratory wells being eligible for the tax credit should be addressed by amending the tax credit rules rather than the decommissioning definition. b. To ensure there are no unintended consequences relating to the deductibility of decommissioning expenditure, the definition of decommissioning should not be altered. (Energy Resources Aotearoa) Comment a. Officials acknowledge the concern that there may be a difference in how the refundable credit operates for certain exploratory wells depending on where in the legislation the relevant rules are inserted. Amendments should be made to the refundable credit rules to bring back in scope the type of wells for which decommissioning expenditure was always intended to qualify for the refundable credit. These include wells that are drilled relatively early in a field’s life but are decommissioned later for commercial reasons. 270 b. Officials do not have concerns regarding the linkage between the decommissioning definition applying to exploratory wells and the deductibility of expenditure on decommissioning an exploratory well. Although the current proposed amendment would result in expenditure on certain exploratory wells no longer being deductible as decommissioning expenditure under section DT 16, that expenditure would still be deductible in the same period under the general rules for petroleum exploration expenditure. Section DT 1 provides a deduction for petroleum exploration expenditure, which includes expenditure on abandoning an exploratory well. Officials have discussed this with the submitter and understand they now agree that deductibility will not be affected. Points of difference a. Officials agree with the submitter’s proposal with the following adjustment. As a substantive rule, officials agree it is better to situate access to the refundable credit for qualifying exploratory wells within the provisions for the refundable credit rather than in the definition of decommissioning. However, as the current paragraph (b)(ii) of the decommissioning definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 includes exploratory wells that are not intended to be within the scope of the refundable credit, it is recommended to continue with the proposed amendment to repeal paragraph (b)(ii), then add the qualifying exploratory wells back into the refundable credit provision, rather than cross-referencing to a subset of exploratory wells within the decommissioning definition. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. b. That the submission be declined. Issue: Consequential amendment Submission (Matter raised by officials) Repealing paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of decommissioning in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 leaves a redundant reference to exploratory wells in paragraph (d)(i). This reference to exploratory wells should be removed. It was always intended that paragraph (d) simply covered monitoring of sites and wells that were included within the other paragraphs of the decommissioning definition, rather than having a wider scope (for example, monitoring all exploratory wells). As the proposed amendment removes all references to exploratory wells by repealing paragraph (b)(ii), the reference to exploratory wells in paragraph (d) will be made redundant. It is possible an exploratory well is also included within paragraph (b)(iii); however, the monitoring of these wells would still be included within paragraph (d) as an “other well referred to in paragraph (b)”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 271 AMENDING MEMORANDUM ACCOUNTS WHEN MAKING TRANSFER FROM PREVIOUS YEARS Clauses 98–107 Issue: Support for amendments to section OB 4 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The submitters support the amendments to section OB 4. The amendments will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. (Deloitte) Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendment should be extended to tax purchases transferred to Inland Revenue from a tax pool Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The amendment to section OB 4 should be extended to tax purchases transferred to Inland Revenue from a tax pool. Comment Following discussions with officials, submitters now agree the proposed amendment as drafted addresses this issue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 272 BUSINESS CONTINUITY TEST Clauses 89B–89K Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Mayne Wetherell) Submitters support the proposed amendments, although question whether some of the amendments are necessary. Comment Officials note that some of the amendments provide clarification where provisions could be interpreted differently than the policy intent. Whilst these existing sections can be read in line with the policy intent, officials consider that clarification is preferable for the avoidance of doubt. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Drafting issue Submission (EY) In proposed new section IP 1(1)(c), the reference to section IB 3(2)(b) and (c) should be changed to section IB 3(2)(b) and/or (c) to make it clear that only one of the subsections needs to be satisfied for subpart IP to apply. Comment Officials agree that the provision would be clearer using an “or” rather than “and” and will redraft the provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Taxpayers not in business Submission (PwC) The business continuity test (BCT) should be extended to include companies that are not in business, such as a not-for -profit entity or a taxpayer that has deductible pre-commencement expenditure but is not yet in business. 273 Comment Officials do not consider the BCT should be used to enable losses to be carried forward in either of the situations raised by the submitter. We consider that to allow the BCT to apply in those situations would increase the risk of taxpayers being able to trade tax losses. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deferred expenditure under the hybrid mismatch rules Submission (PwC) The business continuity test (BCT) currently does not provide for deferred expenditure under the hybrid and branch mismatch rules contained in subpart FH to be carried forward provided the BCT is satisfied. These excess deductions should be able to be carried forward and used following a continuity of ownership breach if the requirements of the BCT have been met. Comment Officials consider that the current rules do permit deferred expenditure under the hybrid and branch mismatch rules to be carried forward if the taxpayer would meet the requirements of Part I of the Income Tax Act 2007 if they had a tax loss that would meet the BCT. We have discussed this with the submitter, and they concur with this interpretation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarify the definition of “group of companies” Submission (EY) The definition of a “group of companies” in the business continuity test (BCT) rules should be restricted to New Zealand tax resident members of a group. Comment The BCT allows a company to carry forward tax losses to future years if they have a change in ownership provided there is no major change in the nature of the business activities of the company. The BCT rules provide that companies purchased as a group are one company for the BCT. The current definition of “group of companies” can include non-resident companies that are not in the New Zealand tax base. This definition was intended to be restricted to New Zealand tax resident members of a group. Officials recommend an amendment to clarify that policy intent. 274 The proposed amendment should apply from the 2020–21 income year, when the BCT originally applied from. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Business continuity test for subsequent ownership changes Submission (Matter raised by officials) Ensure a new business continuity period is created for subsequent changes in shareholding and pre-2020–21 tax losses. When a company has an ownership breach, the business continuity test (BCT) will apply. For most companies, provided they do not have a major change (unless it is a permitted major change), they will be able to continue to carry forward losses. For most companies, they must not have a major change for five years after they apply the BCT. The intention was that if a company had a subsequent breach in shareholding, the BCT period would be re-started for the new shareholders. Otherwise, it would be possible for a company to be purchased subsequently for the tax losses and the remainder of the business continuity period would simply run until its expiry. This was done for losses incurred in the 2020–21 and subsequent income years, but the rule does not work as intended for losses incurred before the 2020–21 income year. Officials recommend an amendment to align the treatment for losses incurred before the 2020–21 income year with that for losses incurred in the 2020–21 and subsequent income years. The proposed amendment would apply from the 2020–21 income year, when the BCT originally applied from. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Measurement of ownership continuity Submission (Matter raised by officials) The way in which shareholder continuity is determined for the business continuity test (BCT) should be modified for the purposes of the BCT to prevent minor changes in shareholding triggering a new business continuity period (BCP). Continuity of ownership is counted from the date a loss is incurred to the date the loss is used or the business continuity period ends. For a company that is maintaining losses under the BCT, this may mean that small subsequent changes in shareholding may trigger a further business continuity period where there has been no breach in shareholding continuity. 275 Example 2: Existing position Charlie and Keith own 52% and 48% of Watts Electrical Limited respectively. The company has tax losses. Charlie sells to Ron, which results in the BCP applying. Six months later, Keith sells to Mick. The continuity of ownership test measures the lowest percentages fro m the time the loss was incurred until the change in ownership. In this case, this means Charlie = 0, Keith = 0, Ron =0 and Mick =0. This would be a breach and reset the BCP. However, as Ron is still holding 52% of the shares and Keith is only selling 48% (a change of less than 49%), this should not be a breach and trigger a shareholding continuity issue. Officials recommend that, for the BCT only, the rules should be modified to deem a purchasing shareholder to have owned their interest from the time the loss was incurred until the date of the next breach. Example 3: Proposed change Reconsidering Example 2 above, when Charlie sells to Ron, Ron would be deemed, for the purposes of the BCT only, to have held his 52% of the shares from the date the losses being carried forward under the BCT were incurred. When Keith then sells to Mick, that will trigger Watts Electrical Limited to reassess whether it has breached continuity. In this case, the calculation will then be (with Ron being deemed to have held his shares from the date the loss subject to the BCT was incurred) Charlie = 0, Keith = 0, Ron =52% and Mick =0. This would not be a breach, nor reset the BCP. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Exclusion of mining companies Submission (Matter raised by officials) The exclusion of mining companies from the business continuity test (BCT) should be extended to losses incurred by mining companies from mineral mining. Mining companies are excluded from the BCT on the basis that they have their own similar business test that allows them to carry forward losses for a particular mining permit despite a change in shareholding continuity. However, those losses cannot be used against other income unless shareholder continuity is maintained. Technically a mining company that changes its business before a change in ownership will no longer be a mining company at the time of the change in ownership. This may allow that company to use the BCT. Given that the quantum of mining losses could be material, it could be beneficial for a company to change from being a mining company before a change in ownership and to maintain the alternate business for five years to utilise the tax losses. Officials therefore recommend an amendment to exclude losses incurred by mining companies from mineral mining as an integrity measure. The proposed amendment would apply from the 2020–21 income year, when the BCT originally applied from. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 276 Issue: Clarify the application of the permitted major changes Submission (Matter raised by officials) The wording of the permitted major changes under the business continuity test (BCT) should be clarified to ensure they relate to business activities performed before the ownership change in the company. The BCT allows companies to carry forward tax losses to future years if they have a change in ownership, provided there is no major change in the nature of the business activities of the company. However, even if there is a major change, provided that major change fits within the permitted major changes in existing section IB 3(5), the company will still be able to carry forward its tax losses. There is a concern that several of the permitted major changes do not specifically refer to a business activity of the company that was undertaken before a shareholding breach, although this was the policy intent. The policy intent behind the permitted major changes was to allow for growth and innovation within companies. However, it was not intended that they would also allow for new business activities (other than the pivoting scenario, which is dealt with separately in the legislation). Officials therefore recommend an amendment to clarify this and ensure the permitted major changes relate to business activities carried on before the shareholding breach. The proposed amendment would apply from the 2020–21 income year, when the BCT originally applied from. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 277 FBT – POOLED ALTERNATE RATE OPTION Clauses 114B to 114E Issue: Threshold should be simplified Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The proposed threshold for the new pooled alternate rate option of $129,681 in all-inclusive pay should be amended to something that can be estimated with greater certainty. For example, consideration could be given to allowing employers to pay FBT at the rate of 49.25% on attributed benefits for employees receiving gross salary and wages of $160,000 or less if the benefits provided to the employees are less than $13,500 annually per employee. Comment Submitters note that the proposed new FBT calculation option may not represent much of a simplification for employers in cases where an employee earns less than, but close to, $180,000 before tax. This is because the employer would need to calculate the employee’s all -inclusive pay to determine if the employee is above or below the $129,681 threshold. In theory, it should be clear in most cases that a given employee is either above the threshold (because they earn more than $180,000 in salary or wages before tax) or (more likely) below it (because they earn well below $180,000 and do not receive significant fringe benefits, which is true of most employees). However, “all-inclusive pay” 13 is not the most intuitive concept, and it may not be obvious to employers what the threshold is trying to achieve. As such, employers may struggle to determine whether a given employee is above or below the $129,681 threshold (potentially even in some cases where the employee is in fact well below the threshold). Officials agree the proposal could be simplified by using a clearly defined “safe harbour” threshold based on the amount of • the employee’s pre-tax salary or wages, and • the benefits attributed to the employee that together would be equivalent to $129,680 in all-inclusive pay (rather than a threshold defined as a specific dollar amount of all-inclusive pay, as currently proposed). Point of difference Officials propose a safe harbour rule based on gross salary and wages of $160,000 or less (as suggested by the submitters) but with a maximum allowable amount of attributed benefits of $13,400 per employee (rather than $13,500). This is because the all-inclusive 13 “All-inclusive pay” of an employee is calculated as the employee’s after-tax cash pay plus the value of any fringe benefits received. Thus, the amount of all-inclusive pay at which the top FBT rate of 63.93% applies is determined by reference to the personal income tax rates and the income brackets at which these rates apply. This top FBT rate applies to employees with an all-inclusive pay of $129,681 or more. This equates to an employee earning a before-tax salary of more than $180,000 (and in some cases less than that amount, depending on the value of fringe benefits provided to the employee). FBT rates are based on the concept of all-inclusive pay, rather than monetary remuneration, because it is important to include the value of fringe benefits received when determining an employee’s FBT rate – otherwise employers may be incentivised to provide fringe benefits instead of cash remuneration to employees earning near the personal income tax brackets. 278 pay of someone who earns $160,000 before tax and receives attributed benefits to the value of $13,400 is $129,680. Officials further recommend that employers still be allowed to choose to pay FBT at the rate of 49.25% on benefits attributed to employees receiving all-inclusive pay below $129,681, even if the employee earns over the $160,000 safe harbour threshold detailed above. This would ensure that employers with employees earning between $160,000 and $180,000 but who receive only relatively modest fringe benefits (such that the employees each receive less than $129,681 in all-inclusive pay) can pay FBT at the lower 49.25% rate on benefits attributed to those employees. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Treatment of non-attributed benefits provided to major shareholders Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Employers should be allowed to pay FBT at the 49.25% rate on non-attributed benefits provided to employees who are major shareholders if those employees receive less than $129,681 in all-inclusive pay. Comment Most fringe benefits that employers provide to their employees are required to be attributed to the individual employee receiving the benefit when calculating the employer’s FBT liability. Other fringe benefits (referred to as non-attributed benefits) must be pooled. FBT is required to be paid at the top rate (currently 63.93%) on non-attributed benefits provided to employees who are major shareholders or to persons associated with an employee who is a major shareholder. FBT is paid at the second-highest FBT rate (currently 49.25%) on non- attributed benefits provided to all other employees. The requirement to pay FBT at the top rate on non-attributed benefits provided to employees who are major shareholders is a long-standing policy setting. This setting is in recognition of the control that such major shareholders are likely to have in determining the respective levels of salary, fringe benefits and dividends they receive from their companies. This control gives them the ability to substitute between different forms of remuneration or income subject to different taxation regimes. The proposed new pooled alternate rate option is intended to simplify the calculation of FBT on attributed benefits, which include most fringe benefits provided to employees. The new option would allow employers to pay FBT on attributed benefits at the second-highest rate for most employees. This would mean employers would not have to pay FBT at the top rate on all attributed benefits (including on those provided to employees earning well below $180,000 before tax) or otherwise perform complex calculations for each individual employee. The intention of the proposal is not to change the policy settings for non- attributed benefits. As a category distinct from attributed benefits, officials consider the current policy settings for non-attributed benefits are appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 279 OTHER ISSUES Issue: Donations of trading stock to charities Submission (Jim Gordon Tax Limited) The tax law should be amended so that the changes to the trading stock rules implemented in response to COVID-19 are a permanent part of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment As a COVID-19 response measure, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 introduced an exclusion from the deemed income rule in the Income Tax Act 2007 for donations of trading stock in certain circumstances. This exclusion ensures businesses donating trading stock are not taxed on the market value of any donation (for example, when businesses donate food to food banks or face masks to hospitals). This exclusion is for a limited period (from March 2020 to March 2022) with the ability to extend that period by Order in Council. Officials are currently progressing a 12-month extension to March 2023. Officials note it is intended to progress a permanent solution to the donated trading stock rules in 2022. However, further work on this matter will require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “capital contribution” Submission (Russell McVeagh) The term “capital contribution” is defined in section CC 1B. However, there is no reference to section CC 1B in the definition of “capital contribution” in section YA 1. It should be clarified that paragraph (a) of the definition of “capital contribution” in section YA 1 applies for the purposes of section CC 1B. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 280 Issue: Tax rate for ACC lump sum payments Submission (Baucher Consulting Limited) Backdated weekly ACC payments should be taxed at the claimant’s average tax rate for the year before the year of claim. The current tax treatment of the payment of backdated ACC weekly compensation is inequitable and can result in a lump sum payment being taxed at higher rates than would have been the case if the weekly compensation payments had been paid when originally due. The Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to tax payments of backdated weekly ACC compensation at the claimant’s average income tax rate for the income year before the income year in which the claim resulting in the backdated compensation was first lodged. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised by the submitter. However, further work on the matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Remedial amendment for PIE losses Submission (BDO, Bruce Lay) A remedial amendment to section DB 53(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is required. Section DB 53(1)(b) was replaced by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. The previous version of paragraph (b) limited a deduction for a PIE loss to zero-rated investors and certain exiting investors. However, the new wording has the unintended effect of expanding the scope of the provision when section HM 36B does not apply (that is, when the investor is not a natural person). This should be corrected. Comment Officials do not consider that the wording change has expanded the ability to use PIE tax losses, as an investor still needs to satisfy section HM 40 and the criteria for claiming a loss in section HM 40 have not changed. Therefore, al though section DB 53(1)(b) and section HM 40 do not interact in the way they should (that is, if you satisfy section HM 40 you get a loss under section DB 53(1)(b)), a taxpayer’s entitlement to a deduction for a loss for their PIE income is not altered because the criteria in section HM 40 remain the same. Point of difference However, officials agree the wording should be aligned and have discussed and agreed with the submitter that this will be do ne in a future tax Bill, subject to government priorities. 281 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Racing entities income tax exemption Submission (Deloitte) Consistent with other racing organisations (the Racing Codes and TAB NZ), the Racing Integrity Board should be exempt from income tax. The Racing Integrity Board is an independent statutory body established by the Racing Industry Act 2020 (RIA) to regulate aspects of the activities of the Racing Codes, which are each statutorily exempt from income tax under section CW 47 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). There is no clear reason why the Racing Integrity Board should be subject to income tax and the compliance costs of being a filing taxpayer and determining a tax filing position. Comment Officials agree with the submission and note that similar issues also arise for Racing New Zealand. The Racing Industry Act 2020 created these two new organisations, the Racing Integrity Board and Racing New Zealand, but overlooked the income tax treatment of these new entities. TAB NZ and the three Racing Codes are listed as being exempt from income tax under section CW 47. Point of difference The income tax exemption in section CW 47 of the ITA should be updated to include references to both Racing New Zealand and the Racing Integrity Board. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Depreciation treatment of grandparented structures Submission (BDO) The definitions of “building” and “grandparented structure” in the Income Tax Act 2007 should be reinstated to enable a deduction to be claimed for the loss on disposal of a “grandparented structure”. Comment Inland Revenue’s interpretation statement IS 10/02: “Meaning of ‘building’ in the depreciation provisions”, which applies from 30 July 2009, brought within the definition of “building” certain items that were previously “structures”, such as barns, carpark buildings and site huts. This changed the way these were treated for tax depreciation purposes. 282 Buildings were subject to a 0% depreciation rate from 2010. However, the structures affected by IS 10/02 were grandparented to preserve their depreciation treatment. To facilitate this grandparenting, the definition of “building” did not include these affected structures. The definitions of “building” and “grandparented structure” were repealed by the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020 as part of the reinstatement of depreciation on non-residential buildings. This means that grandparented structures are now buildings for the Income Tax Act and are no longer eligible for depreciation deductions for loss on disposal. This was not intended. Point of difference Officials consider the reinstatement of deductions for loss on disposal of a grandparented structure can be achieved without reinstating the definition of “building”. Instead, officials propose to reinstate the definition of “grandparented structure” and provide that section EE 48(3) does not apply to grandparented structures. Section EE 48(3) prevents a deduction for loss on disposal for buildings, except in very narrow circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Alignment of ICA provisions relating to tax pooling Submission (Matter raised by officials) The wording in the imputation rules between individual companies and consolidated imputation groups for the transfer of tax pooling funds should be aligned to make them consistent. In 2009, a remedial amendment was made to the imputation rules for individual companies to correct a rewrite issue relating to tax pooling. The imputation rules for individual companies are replicated almost identically for consolidated imputation groups. However, the 2009 amendment to the individual company imputation rules was not replicated in the consolidated imputation group rules. The proposed amendment will correct this and realign the rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 283 Other remedials 285 EXTENDING USE OF MONEY INTEREST RELIEF DURING COVID-19 Clause 169 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) General support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Relief should be broader Submission (Matter raised by officials) Given the restrictions brought on by COVID-19 in the second half of 2021, further use of money interest (UOMI) relief measures should be allowed for provisional taxpayers that are significantly adversely affected in their ability to make a reasonably accurate forecast of their residual income tax. The existing amendments in the Bill increase the scope of relief available for taxpayers for some, but not all, types of UOMI. A taxpayer may choose to revise their estimate of their residual income tax downward due to anticipating that COVID-19 will obstruct their trading, allowing them to pay less provisional tax during the year. However, if the taxpayer makes an inaccurate forecast and revises their estimate down too far, they will be charged with UOMI because of underpaying amounts at provisional tax dates relative to what their ultimate residual income tax liability is. Situations like these are not within the scope of the proposed amendments as currently drafted. Legislation was enacted in August 2020 to allow remission of UOMI charged in this situation as it was not covered by the general COVID-19 UOMI remission rules. This relief is currently available for UOMI charged on residual income tax payable for the 2020–21 tax year. Owing to the recent COVID-19 Alert Level changes, officials consider that this relief should also be available for the 2021–22 tax year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 286 USE OF MONEY INTEREST RELIEF DURING EMERGENCY EVENTS Issue: Eligibility test Submission (Matter raised by officials) The existing eligibility test for remission of use of money interest (UOMI) under the emergency events provisions requires that an emergency event “physically prevents” a taxpayer from making a payment of tax on time. When UOMI remission rules were developed in response to the economic impact of COVID-19, a new eligibility test was introduced. Under that test, UOMI remission is allowed if the taxpayer is “significantly adversely affected” by COVID-19 in their ability to make a payment of tax on time. This wider test allows remission for a broader range of reasons, including being physically prevented from being able to pay tax or being financially affected by COVID-19. Officials now consider that the broader test for COVID-19 should be applied to the emergency events rules. This would mean that a taxpayer can receive UOMI remission in response to an event like a flood or earthquake if the event significantly adversely affects the taxpayer’s ability to make a tax payment on time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Revised estimate of residual income tax too low Submission (Matter raised by officials) Use of money interest (UOMI) remission during emergency events is allowed if a taxpayer has not made a payment required by a tax law on or before the due date for the payment. When an equivalent measure was introduced for COVID-19, it was determined that this did not cover situations where a taxpayer had underpaid their provisional tax instalments at a due date because they had revised their estimate of their residual income tax liability down to pay less tax but had revised it down too far. Revising an estimate may be justified when a provisional taxpayer genuinely expects their income to fall during the year, but it was recognised that taxpayers may face difficulties in accurately revising their estimate. Legislation was later enacted to ensure that UOMI charged in this situation could also be remitted. (See also “Issue: Relief should be broader” .) No equivalent provision exists for emergency events; UOMI remission for this reason is only available for COVID-19. Officials consider that UOMI remission should also be allowed when an emergency event significantly adversely affects a provisional taxpayer’s ability to forecast their residual income tax reasonably accurately. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 287 INVESTMENT INCOME INFORMATION – ALIGNING FILING AND PAYMENT DATE FOR SIX-MONTHLY PAYERS OF INVESTMENT INCOME Clause 141 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Submitter supports the proposal to align the filing and payment date for six-monthly payers of investment income. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 288 NON-ACTIVE ESTATES RETURN FILING Clause 143 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, KPMG) The submitters support the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (Deloitte) The submitter supports the proposed amendment but believes the amendment should apply from 1 April 2021. Given tax returns for the 2021–2022 income year are not due until 7 July 2022, which is after the likely date of enactment of the Bill, making the application date 1 April 2021 would reduce compliance costs for non-active estates. Comment The proposed date of application of 1 April 2022 allows Inland Revenue to implement the system and administrative changes necessary. Bringing this date forward to 1 April 2021 would make it administratively challenging to implement the change in time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 289 REPEAL OF INFORMATION-SHARING CLAUSES FOR ACC AND THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES BY AN ORDER IN COUNCIL Clause 173(2) and (3) Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (Regulations Review Committee) That the Committee consider whether the clauses should be enacted with a fall-back commencement date or whether the amendments could be enacted once the approved information sharing agreements (AISAs) are closer to coming into force. The submitter usually takes the position that, where commencement of a provision is by Order in Council, the clause should also include a date whereby the Bill or provision will come into force automatically (fall-back date). This ensures the Bill comes into force as Parliament intended and in a timely manner. Comment Inland Revenue is developing AISAs with the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE). The two AISAs will replace existing information-sharing provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the proposed amendments will repeal the related provisions once the AISAs are in force. The Privacy Act 2020 requires that, before recommending the making of an Order in Council, the relevant Minister must be satisfied that, among other things, any potential conflicts or inconsistencies between the sharing of personal information under an AISA and any other enactment have been identified and appropriately addressed. If primary legislation was in force at the same time, it would result in a conflict and would mean part of the AISA would not be operational until the conflict was resolved. Officials consider that having a fall-back date is not appropriate in this instance. Having a fall-back date is appropriate when legislation is being brought into force. However, in this sit uation, legislation is being repealed from a date to be specified by Order in Council. Officials have reconsidered whether both amendments should be enacted now or whether, as suggested by the submitter, the amendments should be enacted when the AISAs are closer to coming into force. 290 Point of difference The MBIE AISA is progressing well and is likely to come into force in 2022. The amendment should therefore remain in the current Bill. Officials have discussed the AISA with ACC and they have advised that, due to other work commitments, the AISA is not likely to apply until 2023. Due to this delay, officials recommend the amendment relating to the ACC AISA be removed from the current Bill and included in the next available taxation Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 291 COMMISSIONER’S REMEDIAL POWERS – DISPUTABLE DECISIONS Clause 155(1) Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposal to clarify that decisions of the Commissioner using the remedial powers are not subject to the disputes and challenge procedures of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 292 CHALLENGE NOTICES – WHETHER REQUIRED AFTER AMENDED ASSESSMENT ISSUED Clause 148 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposal to clarify the Commissioner is not required to issue a challenge notice if, following completion of the disputes process, the Commissioner issues an amended assessment that reflects some, but not all, of the proposed adjustments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 293 REMOVING FAX AS A MODE OF COMMUNICATION Clauses 41, 128, 136, 137, 138, 199 and 200 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (Deloitte) The amendments should apply retrospectively from 1 August 2021, as faxes were no longer supported from 1 August 2021. Comment Officials considered applying the amendment from 1 August 2021. However, there is a general presumption in law against retrospective legislation. Officials decided, on balance, that the amendments should apply once the Bill is enacted. This allows tolerance for any interim communication arrangements made throughout the transition period away from faxes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 294 R&D TAX INCENTIVE – EXTENSION OF DUE DATES Clauses 142 and 145 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG) General support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Extension for criteria and methodologies applications Submission (KPMG) A further six-month extension is required for applications for criteria and methodologies approval to mitigate the need for R&D-performing businesses to also submit a general approval application for the same activities. Comment For the purposes of the R&D Tax Incentive, significant performers of R&D may have their activities approved through either a general approval (GA) application or through a criteria and methodologies (CAM) application. CAM applications require the applicant to submit information on the processes the business uses to meet R&D standards. This can allow a range of activities to be covered, which may be preferable to filing multiple GA applications. If a CAM application was intended to cover a certain activity but is declined, the applicant can still seek approval of the activity through the GA process. However, significant performers run the risk that they may be notified their CAM application has been declined too late to have enough time to prepare a GA application. To mitigate this risk, some businesses are filing both CAM and GA applications for the same activities. Officials agree that an extension of the GA application date, contingent on the business filing a CAM application on time but not having been notified of the outcome as the GA application deadline approaches, would be desirable. This is because such an extension would reduce compliance costs for businesses because they would not have to file two applications for the same activities. It would also reduce administrative costs, as Callaghan Innovation and Inland Revenue would not have to process multiple applications for the same activities. Points of difference Officials agree with the submitter’s proposal with the following adjustments: • Officials recommend that a three-month extension be allowed rather than the suggested six -month extension. 295 • Officials recommend that the extension period is determined from the date the applicant has been notified of the outcome of their CAM application, rather than from the ordinary GA application due date. If the extended date would fall earlier than the ordinary GA application due date, then no extension is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 296 R&D TAX INCENTIVE – TAX YEAR CUT-OFF FOR CLAIMING SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES Clauses 92 and 144 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC) General support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Year supporting activity occurs Submission (EY) a. An R&D activity must be approved under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to be able to claim the R&D Tax Incentive. This requirement must also be satisfied for any supporting activity made eligible because of this amendment. To achieve this, the proposed provisions must be amended to provide that supporting activity in the year immediately before or after the year of the core activity is deemed to occur in the year the core activity was conducted. b. Despite the deeming rule proposed in a. above, for applicants in the significant performer regime, R&D expenditure should be included in the year it is incurred rather than deemed to occur in the year of the core activity. Comment a. Officials consider that deeming supporting activity to occur in the year of the corresponding core activity is not required to achieve the desired outcome. Sections 68CB(2) and 68CC(3) of the TAA already permit approval of R&D activities in years outside of the income year. b. Given that officials recommend that the substantive suggestion in a. above be declined, consideration of this submission is not necessary. Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be declined. 297 Issue: Supporting activity in additional years Submission (PwC) Supporting activity should be allowed in income years beyond the year either side of the related core activity. The proposed period of one year either side of the related core activity for claiming supporting activity does not reflect R&D in practice and should be extended. Businesses should be required to state the estimated timeframes of their activities with no time limits. Comment Officials agree that, in some cases, expenditure on supporting activities may be incurred in relation to a core activity outside the permitted period of one income year either side. However, on average, the link between a supporting activity and a core activity becomes weaker as the period between those two activities increases. Officials consider that allowing supporting activity in the year immediately before and after the core activity is a balanced period for maintaining the integrity of the R&D Tax Incentive regime. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Multi-year approvals Submission (Matter raised by officials) A further amendment is needed to ensure that multi-year approvals, which can include up to two further years, apply from the initial income year of the core activity, rather than from the year of the supporting activity in the year before the core activity. The current proposed amendment is intended to allow expenditure on supporting activities that take place in the year before the corresponding core activity to be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. The legislation should therefore recognise that, for some applicants, the amendment will bring an extra year of R&D activities into a general approval application or criteria and methodologies approval application. A consequential amendment is needed to ensure the additional year can be included in those applications under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 298 R&D TAX INCENTIVE – TRANSITIONAL SUPPORT PAYMENT Clauses 56, 64 and 132 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG) General support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 299 ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENTS TO THE CHILD SUPPORT ACT 1991 Clauses 175–186 Issue: Time bar exclusion for administrative reviews Submission (Matter raised by officials) An additional exception to the time bar is needed for administrative reviews to be reflected in an assessment that relates to a time-barred period. The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 (the Amendment Act) introduced a four-year time bar to reassessments of child support that applies following the end of a child support year. The time bar means that, after the four-year period, changes to the assessment cannot occur, subject to specified exceptions. The time bar provides more certainty for parents and reduces administration costs, while balancing equity concerns through specified exceptions. One of the key factors in calculating child support is each parent’s income. The Child Support Act 1991 (the Principal Act) allows a person’s special circumstances that affect the formula assessment, such as their unexpected costs, to be considered through an administrative review process. In most cases, the time bar prevents a person from applying for an administrative review of the time-barred period. The Amendment Act introduced a four-month exception to this, which allows a person to apply for an administrative review of an assessment that relates to a time- barred period. The application must be received by Inland Revenue within four months of the date of the latest notice of assessment. This ensures that a parent will have a short window to apply for an administrative review, while maintaining the policy intent of the time bar. If a departure from the formula assessment is granted under the Principal Act, the intention is to allow the time-barred period to be reassessed. However, the current exclusions to the time bar in the Principal Act do not allow successful administrative reviews under this provision to then be reflected in a child support assessment. 300 Example 4 On 1 January 2022 Inland Revenue notifies Caoimhe of an assessment for the child support year from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. The assessment is dated three months before the period will become time barred (1 April 2022). Caoimhe has four months from 1 January (the date she was notified by Inland Revenue) to apply for an administrative review. That is, she could apply for an administrative review up until 30 April 2022 (one month after the period has become subject to the time bar). However, even if her administrative review is successful, there is no exception to the time bar that allows the time-barred period to be reassessed after 1 April 2022. Figure 2 31/03/201801/01/202231/05/2022 1/01/22 Assessment 1/05/22 Administrative review window closes 1/04/22 Time bar takes effect 1/04/18 Child support year ends The specified exceptions to the time bar, such as if a court order is received for the time- barred period, are listed in the Principal Act. However, this list does not include an exception to the time bar for administrative reviews that occur within the four-month window. This means that an administrative review successfully applied for under the four-month exception cannot be applied to time-barred assessments as intended. An additional exception to the time bar is needed to allow for administrative reviews that are received within the four-month window. This would ensure that the policy intent can be achieved, that is, to provide a limited period for reassessments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification of the definition of “reconciliation period” Submission (Matter raised by officials) An additional amendment is required to the proposed amendment to the definition of “reconciliation period” to ensure it operates correctly when Inland Revenue receives a backdated estimation that spans multiple child support years. The income used in child support assessments is based upon earlier periods. If a parent believes their income will be lower than the amount used in their child support assessment, 301 they may estimate their income. An estimate can be made for the whole child support year or at any time during the child support year (this is referred to as an election period). At the end of the child support year, the estimate is reconciled with the amount earned. The Amendment Act introduced a “reconciliation period” to ensure that if a parent estimates their income, the income used for the end-of -year reconciliation accurately reflects what has been earned over the period the estimate applies to. The reconciliation period applies from the start of the month in which notice of an election is given until the day before the next election. If there is only one estimate, or if it is the last estimate in the year, the reconciliation period is from the start of the month in which notice of an election is given until the end of the child support year. The definition of “reconciliation period” is tied to the first day of the month in which notice of an election is given. However, this does not work with the new backdated estimations introduced by the Amendment Act. These estimations allow a person to make an election after the end of the child support year to which the election relates, provided Inland Revenue receives the estimation within 28 days of the notification of assessment. Because these estimations are backdated, notice would be given after the start date of the assessment. Therefore, an amendment is proposed to the definition of “reconciliation period” to allow backdated estimations to be squared up accurately. The proposed amendment provides that a reconciliation period will start on the first day of the month in which the formula assessment begins. This ensures the reconciliation period will not start too late to cover the correct period. However, the proposed amendment does not work in cases where Inland Revenue receives a backdated estimation that spans multiple child support years. This is because, when multiple years are involved, the estimation for the second year onwards would be applied from the start of the child support assessment, which could be part way through the year, rather than from the start of the child support year. In those cases , where a backdated estimation for multiple years is involved, the definition should apply to the first day of the child support year. This could occur, for example, when a parent receives their notice late. 302 Example 5 Hubert is a newly liable parent. On 1 April (Year 4), he is notified of his child support assessment. However, the relevant child support assessment begins on 1 August (Year 1). This delay is because a backdated parenting order has taken place, and Hubert has only just been confirmed as the liable parent of his daughter Kim. Hubert is entitled to make a backdated estimation to the start date of the new assessment, provided it is received within 28 days of the notification of the assessment. In early April (Year 4), he makes backdated estimations covering multiple child support years. These assessments will be squared up using the reconciliation rules. Currently the drafting refers to the first day of the month in which the formula assessment begins. This means the start date for the reconciliation periods for Years 2 and 3 are incorrect. The start date should instead refer to the first day of the child support year. Figure 3 An amendment is needed to allow for consistency between the definitions of “election period” and “reconciliation period” relating to new backdated estimations. This will provide for an accurate reconciliation of these estimations. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Additional transitional provision for reconciliations Submission (Matter raised by officials) A new transitional provision is required that allows the old reconciliation rules to be used for estimations made for child support years before 1 April 2022. 303 The Amendment Act introduced a transitional provision to the Principal Act. The provision has the effect that the Principal Act applies as it was enacted, before any amendments made under the Amendment Act, for financial support for child support years before 1 April 2021. The current Bill proposes the repeal of this provision. This is because it is unnecessary and may result in some difficulty with the application of certain amendments to the Principal Act. For example, it would limit the retrospectivity of new backdated estimations and their subsequent reconciliations. However, in removing the provision, any reconciliations made by Inland Revenue must use the new rules, including when the reconciliation is for a child support year before 1 April 2022. This means Inland Revenue would be required to use rules that do not work for a particular year because of, for example, changes to the child support assessment formula. Officials therefore recommend the introduction of a transitional provision that allows the old reconciliation rules to be used for the earlier child support years in which they apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Correction to the reference to “taxable income: Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Amendment Act has amended the definition of “income” used for child support purposes to better reflect a parent’s financial capacity to pay child support by incorporating investment income and no longer offsetting losses from earlier years. References to “taxable income” in the Child Support Act will be replaced with references to this broader definition of “income” from 1 April 2022. However, an amendment, which has not yet entered into force, refers to “taxable income”. As this amendment comes into force at the same time as the new “income” definition, it is uncertain whether the reference in the amendment will be updated. An amendment is needed to ensure the new definition is used. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application dates Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application dates for the proposed amendments to the Principal Act should be amended to be consistent with the application date of the Amendment Act. When the Amendment Act was introduced, it was intended that the child support scheme would move to Inland Revenue’s START system in April 2021. However, due to COVID-19, this move was delayed until the second half of 2021. Because of this delay, the 304 commencement dates of many of the proposals in the Amendment Act were changed to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date as set by Order in Council. The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Commencement Order 2021 moved the commencement dates of several amendments to 26 October 2021 to align with the START transfer. Where appropriate, the application dates for the proposed amendments should be amended to be consistent with that Order. The proposed amendment to the penalty rules should apply from 1 April 2021 to align with the simplification of penalty definitions under the Amendment Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 305 DEFINITIONS OF “SENSITIVE REVENUE INFORMATION” AND “REVENUE INFORMATION” Clause 139 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The submitters support the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendment too broad Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The wording of proposed s 16C(3)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be changed. It is too broad and does not achieve its purpose. Nothing in the proposed wording prevents the Commissioner from releasing information capable of being used to identify a person or entity. Comment The amendment is to avoid the potential for a court to interpret the definition as restricting Inland Revenue from disclosing routine information that other government agencies would release. Officials consider the amendment clarifies this and does not change the current protections that keep taxpayer information confidential. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Purpose of the amendment Submission (KPMG) The need for the amendment is overstated and ignores the policy intent of the most recent amendments to the secrecy rules. However, it is likely to be more efficient to amend the Act than to leave the issue open. 306 Comment When responding to requests under the Official Information Act, the legal department of Inland Revenue has raised concerns with phrases in section 16C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The phrase “information relating to the affairs of a person or entity” could include all the information the Commissioner holds, which would prevent routine information from being disclosed. This would run counter to the purpose of modernising the confidentiality rules, which was to enable more information held by Inland Revenue to be made available. The amendment does not have any impact on taxpayer information, which is required to be kept confidential. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 307 AMENDING AND LATER REPEALING THE DEFINITION OF “START TAX TYPE” Clauses 135(6) and (7) and 170 Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the proposed amendments to amend and later repeal the definition of “START tax type”. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 308 ACC AND KIWISAVER BEING MADE SUBJECT TO A TIME BAR Clauses 146, 147, 149–151, 154, 156, 189–191, and 193–197 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) Submitters support the proposed amendment Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Treating KiwiSaver deductions like other PAYE deductions Submission (Financial Services Council) The proposed treatment is not appropriate for KiwiSaver contributions. There should be consistency between different types of employee entitlements, rather than with the treatment of PAYE deductions, for limitation periods. Alternatively, any time bar should not apply where an employer electively wishes to make remediation payments for shortfalls outside the proposed time bar period. Although KiwiSaver contributions are administered through the tax system, those contributions are employee entitlements analogous to salary and wages, and therefore, the ordinary limitation period principles should apply in the case of error remediation (for example, for Holidays Act 2003 remediation and addressing wages shortfalls). Employers should also be able to make voluntary remediation payments for employer contribution shortfalls that may not come to light for a long period. Under the proposed amendments, employers would be prohibited from doing so if it was outside the time bar period. Comment Officials disagree. Introducing a time bar on assessments for KiwiSaver contributions will improve consistency and certainty for taxpayers, fund providers, and Inland Revenue, and will represent an overall strengthening of the integrity of the tax system. However, officials acknowledge that a time bar is a trade-off between the accuracy of payments, and certainty and reduced compliance and administration costs for employers, providers and Inland Revenue. There are three types of adjustments that can be made to KiwiSaver contributions: adjustments to the income of an employee, adjustments to the calculation of KiwiSaver contributions and adjustments relating to who the funds are credited to. Adjustments to income (for example, where an employer omits to pay wages to the employee for a period) are recalculated and paid in the current pay period and KiwiSaver deductions are also made. This is the same treatment as under the Holidays Act 2003. The proposed 309 time bar would not apply to income adjustments, and this is consistent with the treatment of adjustments to salary and wages. Adjustments to the calculation of deductions that do not result from an income adjustment would be subject to the proposed time bar. To ensure deductions are correct on a pay period basis, Inland Revenue undertakes automated checks of employer-filed KiwiSaver contributions to identify errors in the payment of contributions. These errors are therefore adjusted before the four-year time bar applies . If an error occurs that neither Inland Revenue, the employer nor the employee identifies before the four-year time bar applies, then the error will not be able to be corrected once the time bar is introduced. However, the employer is not restricted from electing to make a voluntary contribution on behalf of an employee, either through Inland Revenue or direct to the fund, to address an underpayment of an employer contribution. Adjustments relating to who the KiwiSaver contributions are credited to will continue to occur regardless of the time bar provision. Officials note that records show the number of adjustments that have been made in these circumstances more than four years after an error has occurred has been very low. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 310 PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO KEEP TAXPAYER INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL Clause166 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Submitters support the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 311 OTHER ISSUES Issue: R&D Tax Incentive – expenditure exclusions Submission (Deloitte) Oil and gas businesses are more adversely affected by R&D exclusions than other industries. Amendments were made in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 to make ineligible some expenditure incurred by petroleum/mineral miners. The changes go much further than their intention of bringing the treatment of expenditure on assets in the mining industries in line with the treatment of expenditure on depreciable tangible assets in other industries. Consequently, petroleum miners are restricted to only being able to claim employee and contractor labour costs incurred for core R&D activities, regardless of whether those costs are deductible immediately or over time. Comment The amendments in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 were designed to take a more comprehensive, end-to-end approach to the petroleum and mineral mining industries. One element was to recognise that these industries have their own tax regimes outside of the depreciation rules and, consequently, are not covered by the R&D tax credit exclusions relating to depreciable intangible property. The intention of the amendments was to bring the tax treatment of expenditure on assets in these industries in line with the general treatment of depreciable intangible property. Officials agree that it was not intended to disadvantage the mining industries relative to other industries for revenue account spending on R&D. However, further consideration of this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 312 MISCELLANEOUS SUBMISSIONS The Committee has received the following submissions and officials recommend these be noted: Submission description Submitter The Government and officials should take greater account of the negative impact that tax legislation regarded as being inappropriate could have on the willingness of taxpayers to pay tax. Jim Gordon Tax Limited General support for remedial amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and Income Tax Act 2007. Corporate Taxpayers Group Support for addressing drafting errors and unintended consequences through remedial amendments. Mayne Wetherell A shift to principles-based drafting supported by interpretative guidance, rather than specific rules, should be considered. The Government should devote adequate resourcing to addressing drafting errors and unintended consequences in tax legislation through remedial amendments. The Bill should promote equity in taxation by taxing those with the most to redistribute to those with the least. Alexandra Cohen Companies that create the highest greenhouse gases should be taxed to fund the creation of a green economy. All those in New Zealand should receive the same pay rate and be taxed at the same rate. (Likewise, for overseas business owners, managers, operators and investors.) Aorangi Kawiti The Revenue Acts should include provision to include Te Ao Māori and tikanga Māori concepts similar to those set out or referenced in: • The Strategic Partnership Relationships with Te Tiriti o Waitangi Tangata Whenua Partners (specifically the partnership relationships). • Te Whakaputanga me te Tiriti o Waitangi. • The Waitangi Tribunal Te Paparahi o te Raki Report 2014 (specifically tino rangatiratanga and mana motuhake). • The Waitangi Tribunal Muriwhenua Report 1997. • The Reform of the Law of Succession 1996 (specifically te o Māori concepts). • The claims to the Waitangi Tribunal, High Court, District Court, Māori Land Court and Appellate Court. Rates should not be levied on Māori land. 313 Public Works Act takings of Whenua Māori for the business of access to land should be taxed retrospectively. Toll entry to hapū and whānau whenua tuku iho could be charged instead of tax/rates. Government must achieve systemic economic transformation. Catherine Murupaenga- Ikenn Māori Authority tax rates should remain at the current, or a lower, level. The Government should reform taxes and install a carbon tax. Wealth should be taxed instead of income because those on low incomes cannot make climate responsible choices. Living under financial hardship depletes people of energy. Those who contribute most to the climate crisis should pay their fair share of tax to help remedy the crisis. A pollution tax should be applied to major polluting industries, including the agricultural sector. Policy makers should consider the relationship between wealth distribution and the country's ability to take crisis mitigation and adaptation action. The Government should take proactive measures on wealth distribution. A tax-free allowance should be introduced for all taxpayers as in the UK. This should be reviewed annually to account for inflation. Frank Fordham The tax thresholds should be adjusted for inflation. Secondary tax should be abolished. Gary Wills Support for the Bill. Jonathan Braniff Rent controls should be on all residential properties. GST should be removed from food and essential services. Libby Good, Rhoda De Felton Healthier foods should be more accessible to lower socio- economic households. Libby Good The public should not be taxed until ACC is taxed. Tui Williams Submissions should be run privately rather than by government. 315 Maintenance items 317 MAINTENANCE AMENDMENTS Clause 47 Issue: Correcting the list of defined terms in section BC 5 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The amendment to remove “tax loss” from the list of defined terms for section BC 5 should not proceed. “Tax loss” is still a defined term in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment The defined term “tax loss” is not used in section BC 5. The defined term used in the section is “available tax loss” and this is included in the list of defined terms. Officials’ view is that a term should not be included in the list of defined terms for a provision if it is not used in that provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: References to “grandparented structure” should be removed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The definition of “grandparented structure” was repealed with effect from 1 April 2020 with application for the 2020–21 and later income years, and therefore the term should be removed from sections EE 47(4) and EE 48(3)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007. We also suggest officials review sections EZ 23B, EZ 23BB, EZ 23BC and EZ 73 for the reference to “grandparented structure”. Comment Officials note they have recommended the definition of “grandparented structure” be reinstated to enable a deduction to be claimed for the loss on disposal of a grandparented structure – see “Issue: Depreciation treatment of grandparented structures” above. However, officials agree that the references to “grandparented structure” in sections EE 47(4), EE 48(3)(a), EZ 23B, EZ 23BB, EZ 23BC and EZ 73 are unnecessary and should be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 319 Matters raised by officials 321 BACK-DATED VALIDATION OF KIWISAVER ENROLMENT Issue: Back-dated validation of enrolment of KiwiSaver members who joined KiwiSaver aged 65 years or over Submission (Matter raised by officials) KiwiSaver members who were aged 65 years or over at the time of their enrolment in KiwiSaver should be permitted to remain in KiwiSaver by allowing the back-dated validation of their enrolment. Before 1 July 2019, a person of New Zealand superannuation qualification age (65 years) or over could not enrol in KiwiSaver. On 1 July 2019, a legislative change was made to allow people aged 65 years or over to opt in to KiwiSaver. However, automatic enrolment into KiwiSaver is still prevented for those people. Where a person aged 65 years or over opted in to KiwiSaver before 1 July 2019, or they are automatically enrolled at any time, their enrolment is invalid and cannot be subsequently validated. The KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended to allow back-dated validations for those persons who were over 65 at the time they joined KiwiSaver and were still a member of KiwiSaver on 1 September 2021. Some consequential amendments will also be required to ensure the back-dated validation works correctly with the existing KiwiSaver rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 322 SMALL BUSINESS CASHFLOW (LOAN) SCHEME AND COVID-19 SUPPORT PAYMENTS SCHEME Issue: Recovery of funds from ineligible applicants Submission (Matter raised by officials) The recovery provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) for the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme (SBCS) and COVID-19 Support Payments (CSP) Scheme should be amended to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to recover funds in situations where an ineligible applicant receives a loan and/or grant amount, but the funds are received by, or otherwise passed on to, an associated person. The SBCS provisions in the TAA (section 7AA) provide that a person who has received a loan under the scheme must immediately repay the total amount to the Commissioner if they do not meet the eligibility requirements. This provision allows for the recovery of funds from ineligible applicants. An issue arises when the loan has been received by the applicant, but the benefit of the funds has been received directly or indirectly by an associated person. The TAA only provides for a statutory right of recovery from the applicant. For example, a company applies for (and receives) a loan under the SBCS and has paid the funds to its 100% shareholder/director as a dividend. If the company was ineligible to receive the loan, the Commissioner only has a statutory right of recovery against the applicant (the company) and not the associated person (shareholder/director) who has received the funds. No contractual relationship exists with that other person, and there is no statutory provision requiring repayment from that person in this situation. Often in these cases, the company is just a shell or deregistered and the Commissioner cannot recover the funds from the company. However, the Commissioner has no statutory right to recover the funds from the other party (albeit that the Commissioner could, depending on the circumstances, have a claim against that other party for money they had received). The CSP Scheme (formerly the Resurgence Support Payments Scheme) was designed on similar principles to the SBCS. This same integrity risk applies to the CSP Scheme (section 7AAB of the TAA). The lack of statutory right of recovery from an associated party that has received the benefit of a SBCS loan or CSP Scheme grant from an ineligible applicant is an integrity risk. The proposed amendment would allow the Commissioner to recover funds from persons who have directly or indirectly received the benefit of the funds in connection with an ineligible application. This would be limited to associated persons of the applicant that have received the benefit of the funds for no or inadequate consideration (that is, the funds have not been provided for goods or services). The proposed amendment would apply prospectively to any contracts entered into from the day after the Bill receives the Royal assent and would not affect any existing contracts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 323 DOMESTIC TRUST DISCLOSURE RULES Issue: Minor and incidental non-cash distributions Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 59BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) should be amended to exclude distributions that are minor services incidental to the operation of the trust from the disclosure requirements with effect for the 2021–22 and later income years. Trustees subject to the disclosure rules in section 59BA must disclose details of each settlement that is made on the trust in the income year. The exception to this is if the settlement is the provision to the trustee, at less than market value, of minor services incidental to the operation of the trust. In contrast, trustees must disclose details of every distribution made by them in the income year. There is no equivalent exclusion for minor and incidental distributions. The disclosure rules were introduced to evaluate whether the new top personal tax rate of 39% is working effectively and to gain insight into the use of structures and entities by trustees in New Zealand. The requirement to disclose minor and incidental, non-cash distributions imposes unnecessary compliance costs on trustees and provides negligible benefit to Inland Revenue. Officials recommend requiring all cash distributions and all taxable distributions to be disclosed. This will support the policy intent of evaluating whether the new 39% rate is working effectively. A “minor and incidental” test should be introduced in section 59BA(2)(d) to provide relief from disclosing minor and incidental non-cash, non-taxable distributions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Nature of distributions Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 59BA of the TAA should be amended to explicitly require trustees of trusts subject to the disclosure requirements to disclose the nature of each distribution made by the trustee in the income year, with effect for the 2021–22 and later income years. The disclosure rules require trustees to disclose the amount of each distribution made by the trustee of the trust in the income year. The rules do not specifically require trustees to disclose the nature of each distribution. This poses a risk for the quality of data collected. Requiring trustees to disclose the nature of distributions would help ensure the quality of information collected is sufficient to draw informed conclusions. Trustees would be required to disclose whether the distributions were cash, land, buildings, shares/ownership interests, provision of trust property for less than market value or forgiveness of debt. 324 To align the disclosure requirements for settlements and distributions and to improve the clarity of the legislation, officials recommend a retrospective amendment to the new disclosure rules to explicitly state that trustees subject to these rules must disclose the nature of distributions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Non-resident trusts Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 59BA of the TAA should be amended to fully exclude all non-resident trusts from the domestic trust disclosure rules with effect for the 2021–22 and later income years. The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Matters) Act 2020 introduced increased disclosure requirements for domestic trusts from the 2021–22 and later income years. The new rules were introduced to evaluate whether the new top personal tax rate is working effectively and to gain insight into the use of structures and entities by trustees in New Zealand. Trustees that are required to make a return under section 59D (which relates to foreign trusts) were excluded from the disclosure rules, as foreign trusts already have a disclosure regime. However, not all non-resident trusts are captured by section 59D. A non-resident trust with no New Zealand resident trustees or settlors may earn New Zealand-sourced income and be subject to the new rules in section 59BA. Subjecting these types of trusts to the disclosure rul es raises several practical issues, including: • how a de minimis threshold would be measured for foreign assets, income and expenditure • who would be responsible for ensuring compliance with the new rules if there are no New Zealand resident trustees or settlors, and • whether the non-resident trust would need to prepare branch accounts for its New Zealand assets and income. Inland Revenue’s records show that approximately 180,000 domestic trusts will be subject to these new rules, whereas no more than 700 non-resident trusts file income tax returns each year. Requiring non-resident trusts to comply with the new rules is likely to impose unnecessary compliance costs for limited benefit. Section 59BA should be amended to exclude all non-resident trusts from the domestic trust disclosure rules. Non-resident trusts with no New Zealand resident trustees or settlors but with New Zealand-sourced income are outside the intended scope of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 325 PROVISIONAL TAX – SAFE HARBOUR CONCESSION Issue: Removing the requirement to pay in full and on time Submission (Matter raised by officials) Sections 120KE and 120KF of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) should be amended to remove the requirement to pay in full and on time to retain the safe harbour concession. The safe harbour concession for provisional tax is available to standard method provisional taxpayers whose residual income tax (RIT) is less than $60,000, provided they meet the requirements in the TAA. Qualifying as a safe harbour taxpayer prevents use of money interest (UOMI) being charged for underpaid provisional tax during the income year. A safe harbour taxpayer will only be charged UOMI after the terminal tax due date. In 2017 the concession was amended to include a requirement that the person must have paid their provisional tax instalments in full and on time to qualify as a safe harbour taxpayer. At the time the change was made, the number of taxpayers who unintentionally pay one or two days late was underestimated. A large number of taxpayers have since been caught out by this change, and this has resulted in them incurring UOMI as well as late payment penalties. In these circumstances, the application of UOMI and late payment penalties is not proportionate to the offence committed. We consider it appropriate to allow taxpayers to retain the safe harbour concession even if they miss a payment. This is because late payment penalties should be a sufficient penalty to incentivise taxpayers to continue to make their payments on time. To address this, we recommend that the requirement to pay in full and on time to access the safe harbour concession be removed. The proposed amendment would apply for the 2022– 23 and later income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 326 REGULAR COLLECTION OF BULK DATA Issue: Including government departments within the scope of section 17L Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 17L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) should be amended to include government departments within its scope. Section 17L of the TAA authorises the making of regulations covering regular and/or ongoing requests for bulk data. The section was intended to improve transparency, efficiency and certainty when information collection is sought on a regular and repeated basis. When enacted, this section was intended to facilitate the regular collection of information, particularly from other government departments. The section was intended to provide an efficient alternative to the one-off data collection requests available under section 17B of the TAA. However, the section may not apply to the Crown or government departments. To address this, we recommend that the section be amended to make clear it applies to the Crown and government departments. The amendment would apply from the date of Royal assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 327 INCOME EQUALISATION RESERVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION FUND ACCOUNTS Issue: Removal of reference to special bank accounts Submission (Matter raised by officials) The references to specific bank accounts relating to the income equalisation reserve and environmental restoration fund should be removed as specific accounts are no longer used. Sections EH 2 and EK 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 currently require that Crown bank accounts called the “Income Equalisation Reserve Account” and the “Environmental Restoration Funds Account” are maintained. All deposits for the main income equalisation scheme, the thinning operations income equalisation scheme and the environmental restoration fund are deposited are made into these accounts. Historically, deposits into these accounts were made by cheque and put into special bank accounts. With the removal of cheques, it is now much simpler and easier for taxpayers to deposit funds directly with Inland Revenue through internet banking into Inland Revenue’s general account. This change also provides better information for taxpayers, as they have visibility on the amounts that sit within their income equalisation accounts through MyIR. Consequently, the requirement to keep a separate bank account for these funds seems redundant. There is no change in security of the funds as both those accounts are backed by the government. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 328 FINANCE LEASE DEFINITION Issue: Reference updated Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference to NZIAS 17 in subparagraph (c)(iii) of the definition of “finance lease” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be replaced with NZ IFRS 16. Subparagraph (c)(iii) of the definition of “finance lease” refers to NZIAS 17, but this accounting standard has been replaced by NZ IFRS 16. The recommended change will ensure that the definition continues to apply as intended and will not change its scope. This change should be effective from 1 January 2019, with application for income years beginning on or after 1 January 2019, to align with the application date of NZ IFRS 16. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 329 DEFINITION OF REPORTABLE INCOME Issue: Amendment required Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) and Leave Support Scheme (LSS) were introduced in March 2020, and the Short-Term Absence Scheme (STAS) was introduced in February 2021. However, because the definition of “reportable income” within section 22D(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) does not include WSS, LSS and STAS receipts, taxpayers who received payments under these schemes were required to file an IR3 return. Approximately 50,000 of these taxpayers had previously been eligible for an Inland Revenue “auto-calc” income assessment. The requirement for recipients of the various scheme payments to file an IR3 return increased compliance costs for taxpayers, as well as raising administrative costs for Inland Revenue. To address this issue, for the 2021–22 tax year, we recommend that the definition of “reportable income” within section 22D(3) be amended to include amounts received under the WSS, LSS and STAS. This will allow taxpayers who receive only reportable income, including receipts under these schemes, to receive an auto-calc assessment. This will ensure they are no longer required to complete an IR3 return, and it will reduce compliance and administrative costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 330 INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF VOLUNTARILY CANCELLED EMISSIONS UNITS Issue: Remedial amendments Submission (Matter raised by officials) Two remedial amendments are proposed: • That the income tax treatment of emissions units voluntarily cancelled through the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme be amended so that the taxpayer is not deemed to derive income when they cancel an emissions unit. • That past tax positions taken by taxpayers for cancelled emissions units be preserved. The first proposed amendment is necessary to remove an unintended consequence that arises when a person purchases and voluntarily cancels an emissions unit. Specifically, income equivalent to the market value of the unit is deemed to be derived by the taxpayer when they cancel an emissions unit, although no consideration is received for the unit. The recommended amendment would remove this deemed income. This recognises that the purchase and cancellation of an emissions unit is a cost incurred by the business for which they should receive a net deduction equivalent to the cost of the unit. The proposed amendment would apply to positions taken in tax returns filed on or after 1 April 2022. Officials understand there has been widespread non-compliance with the current provisions because those provisions are unclear and counter intuitive. Officials therefore consider it necessary to include the second amendment to preserve past positions taken by taxpayers who have cancelled emissions units so that past tax returns do not need to be revisited. This amendment would apply to cancellations included in tax returns filed before 1 April 2022. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 331 UNCLAIMED MONEY ACT CROSS REFERENCE Issue: Correction to cross reference required Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 8(5)(c) of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 refers to a reporting period that ends after the date on which “this Act” (that is, the Unclaimed Money Act 1971) receives the Royal assent. However, as section 8(5) was inserted into the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 as part of the recent administrative reforms to the unclaimed money regime, the reference should be amended to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 333 Summary of recommendations 335 SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS GST policy items Tax treatment of cryptoassets Rec # Recommendation description Submitter Page # 1.

October 2022 1 MLI Article 4(1) Administrative Approach Australia and New Zealand administrative approach Australia and New Zealand are signatories to the Multilateral Convention 1 (MLI) and have both deposited their instruments of ratification with the OECD. This reinforces the commitment of Australia and New Zealand to addressing base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) risks and ensuring a better functioning international tax system. In recognition of the Single Economic Market agenda between Australia and New Zealand, which seeks to create a seamless trans-Tasman business environment, and the fact that our respective tax systems and administrations are comparable and both countries are committed to adopting measures to address BEPS risks, this joint approach represents a measured risk-based approach that seeks to provide certainty and minimise compliance costs for taxpayers. It is envisaged that this approach will only be implemented between Australia and New Zealand at this stage. For taxpayers that satisfy all of the eligibility criteria outlined below for the relevant year, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and New Zealand Inland Revenue (IR) jointly determine that:  Where an eligible taxpayer reasonably self-determines its place of effective management (PoEM) to be located in Australia, it will be deemed to be a resident of Australia for the purposes of the Convention between Australia and New Zealand for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and fringe benefits and the prevention of fiscal evasion (Australia-New Zealand treaty)  Where an eligible taxpayer reasonably self-determines its PoEM to be located in New Zealand, it will be deemed to be a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of the Australia- New Zealand treaty. This determination is made for the purposes of the Australia-New Zealand treaty as modified by Article 4(1) of the MLI. Where an eligible taxpayer reasonably self-determines its PoEM to be located in New Zealand and it is deemed to be a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of the Australia-New Zealand treaty, the taxpayer will also be a prescribed dual resident under the definition in subsection 6(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA 1936). This approach is designed to reduce the compliance burden and costs for lower materiality taxpayers as they are able to assess their eligibility based on readily available information. It also allows the ATO and IR to focus compliance resources on arrangements that could have material revenue consequences and/or pose higher risk of non-compliance with the tax laws. Where the taxpayer is uncertain as to whether they satisfy the eligibility criteria or uncertain as to the self-determination of PoEM, we encourage the taxpayer to engage with either competent authority about their circumstances. I f the taxpayer does not meet the eligibility criteria, then an application will need to be lodged (see: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tax-treaties/australia ). October 2022 2 The ATO and IR will monitor the operation of this administrative approach to ensure it remains fit for purpose. Eligibility criteria Structure 1. The taxpayer is an ordinary company 2 incorporated under either the Corporations Act 2001 in the case of Australia or the Companies Act 1993 in the case of New Zealand. 2. The taxpayer has reasonably self-determined its place of effective management to be solely in either Australia or New Zealand for the purposes of the Australia-New Zealand treaty. Financials 3. The taxpayer’s group 3 annual accounting income 4 is less than AUD $250 million or NZD $260 million based on prepared financial statements for the most recent reporting period. 5 4. The taxpayer’s gross passive 6 income is less than 20% of its total assessable income for the most recent income tax year. 5. The total value of intangible assets 7 (other than goodwill) held by the taxpayer is less than 20% of the value of its total assets based on prepared financial statements for the most recent reporting period. Compliance activities 6. The taxpayer or any member of the group 8 is currently not, and has not been in the last five years, subject to any compliance activity 9 undertaken by either the ATO or IR which relates to the determination of residency for taxation purposes. 7. The taxpayer or any member of the group 10 is currently not engaged in an objection, 11 challenge, 12 settlement procedure or litigation in either Australia or New Zealand in relation to a dispute with either the ATO or IR. Where the taxpayer has only failed criterion 7 (that is, the taxpayer meets all other criteria), we encourage the taxpayer to contact either competent authority to discuss their particular facts and circumstances prior to lodging an application for a competent authority determination. The administrative approach will only be valid if the taxpayer satisfies all of the following conditions on an on-going basis: 8. Upon being notified by either the ATO or IR of a new compliance activity, 13 the taxpayer notifies the ATO or IR that it has been eligible for the dual resident administrative approach and the jurisdiction of residence for the purposes of the Australia-New Zealand treaty has been determined under this approach. 9. The taxpayer or any member of the taxpayer group 14 has not entered into, or carried out:  a tax avoidance scheme whose outcome depends, in whole or part, on the location of its residence  a tax avoidance scheme affecting the location of its central management and control, including previous or subsequent 'migration' of residency  arrangements to conceal ultimate beneficial or economic ownership  arrangements involving abuse of board processes (including backdating of documents) or the board not truly executing its functions, or October 2022 3  arrangements under which any benefits under the Australia-New Zealand treaty would be potentially denied under the conditions of the Principal Purpose Test in paragraph 1 of MLI Article 7. Taxpayer obligations Where there is a material change, the taxpayer is required to re-assess their eligibility and approach either competent authority if the practical administrative approach no longer applies to their circumstances. Where the taxpayer has assessed their circumstances and eligibility to apply the practical administrative approach, they are still required to meet the general record-keeping requirements under domestic law. 15 This includes supporting documentation that must be clearly identifiable for each relevant year for which they have determined their residency for the purposes of the Australia- New Zealand treaty under this approach. Review of agreement The ATO and IR will generally not seek to review a taxpayer’s self-determined PoEM as long as all material facts and circumstances remain the same. The ATO and IR reserve the right to review the outcome of a taxpayer’s self-determined PoEM especially in instances where the ATO or IR is of the opinion that any anti-avoidance rules may apply. In most circumstances, the tax law puts a time limit on the period in which the ATO or IR can amend a tax assessment. These time limits provide certainty and finality for both the taxpayer and the Commissioner. Generally the period of review of a taxpayer’s assessment is four years. However, in a case where the ATO or the IR forms an opinion of fraud or evasion, there is no time limit for amending an assessment. When a review concludes, the outcome will be communicated in writing, generally within seven days of a decision. If the outcome of the review results in the reversal of a taxpayer’s self-determined position the result will be retrospectively applied from the later of: • the date of the MLI (1 January 2019) • the date of the change in a taxpayer’s circumstances that resulted in the determination ceasing to be correct. 1 Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. 2 Ordinary company takes its meaning from plain English that is, an entity that is not a trust, partnership, cooperative, or other like vehicle.

\[SENSITIVE\] Supplementary Analysis Report: Cost of Living Payments Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Advising agencies: Proposing Ministers: Date finalised: Problem Definition Note the analysis in the report Inland Revenue Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue 4 May 2022 The Government is concerned about the adverse effects of increases in the costs of living on the wellbeing of low to middle income households. Low to middle income households are disproportionally affected by the cost-of-living impact caused by current inflation, and many of these households have not had the benefit of recent increases in income support and will not be receiving the Winter Energy Payment over the winter period. Executive Summary Background This Supplementary Analysis Report considers options to provide short-term financial support to low-to middle-income households to address the impacts of cost-of-living increases driven by the recent spike in inflation. The report focuses on the Government's preferred option, which is a payment like the Winter Energy Payment (WEP) to certain people earning less than $70,000 per annum and who would not be entitled to the WEP in 2022. Owing to the narrow scope of the commissioning, including timeframes for developing officials' advice, the range of options considered in this analysis is limited. Development of preferred option The initial commissioning was for a payment to low-middle income individuals earning under $70,000 per annum who were not receiving WEP. During the policy development process various design decisions were considered and ruled out, including: • delivering the payment as a lump sum assessed at a single point in time based on an individual's finalised 2021-22 tax assessment (Inland Revenue's preferred delivery option), and • imposing a minimum income level to be eligible for the payment. The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) also provided a range of more targeted options for extending the scope of WEP. These included extending WEP to non-beneficiary clients of MSD and providing a lump-sum payment to existing non-beneficiary clients. However, Ministers decided that the options proposed would not meet the Government's objectives because of the limited range of potential recipients. Regulatory Impact Statement I 1 Regulatory I mpact Statement | 2 \[SENSITIVE\] The Treasury recommended against progressing a broad-based payment, instead recommending investigating a more targeted form of support to lower-income households like what was proposed by MSD (refer to section 2). Some of the concerns the Treasury noted were: •Inflation has risen over the past year and is expected to be widespread and to persist in the future. This makes a one-off payment a poor mechanism for supporti ng hous eholds with a longer-term problem. •A broad-based one-off payment of this magnitude would add to inflationary pressures in the short-term, although the risk to longer-term inflationary pressures is relatively small assuming any interventions of this nature were temporary. •There are other Government priorities that could be pursued using the funding for this payment, for example, initiatives that more directly impact on interim child poverty targets. H owever, the Treasury also advised that if Ministers wished to proceed with the payment, that Inland Revenue should be the delivery agency as they would be the agency best placed to deliver such a broad payment in the short term. Inland Revenue recommended against being the delivery agency for the proposed new payment. This was because it would have critical operational impacts on Inland Revenue , while delivering the current COVID-19 economic supports at the same time. The advice Inland Revenue provided about how a new payment could be structured was heavily influenced by these concerns. Cost of Living payment parameters ( Ministers’ preferred option) The preferred option would be a one-off payment of $350 made in three periodic instalments paid in August, September, and October 2022. The proposed payment would be paid to eligible individuals who: •earned up to $70,000 in the 2021-22 tax year, •are aged 18 or over, •are not eligible to receive the WEP during the payment period , •ar e New Zealand tax residents and present in New Zealand, •currently hold a New Zealand bank account, and •are not incarcerated or deceased. Potential eligible population Inland Revenue estimates that approximately 2,136,000 individuals would be eligible for the proposed payment. This information was used to cost the proposal. Inland Revenue was not able to accurately forecast the number of eligible individuals for the 2021-22 tax year. The estimate above is based on Inland Revenue’s administrative data from the 2019-20 tax year, the latest year for which Inland Revenue has completed tax assessments, which indicated that 2,081,700 individuals could be eligible. The table in Appendix 1 shows the income distribution of the population of those earning up to $70,000 (net income) using this data. This figure was then adjusted for forecast labour force participation growth of 2.6%, which increased the estimated eligible population to 2,136,000 individuals (rounded). s 18(c)(i) Regulatory I mpact Statement | 3 \[SENSITIVE\] Based on the Treasury’s modelling analysis, 1 the payment would be somewhat targeted to middle income households with around 55% of the total payments going to the middle 40% of households, with 20% going to the bottom 30% and 25% going to the top 30%. 478,000 households with children and 610,000 households without children would receive the payment. Around 60% of potentially eligible recipients have family incomes below $70,000, 10% have family incomes between $70,000 and $100,000, and 30% have family incomes over $100,000. Fiscal cost The fiscal cost of the payments is expected to be $747.600 million. This is based on a payment of $350 to an estimated 2,136,000 recipients. That estimate is highly uncertain because the size of the eligible population is unknown. The estimated population has been based on 2019/20 tax year data adjusted for population growth. Given this, $800.000 million was sought due to the uncertainty of the estimated cost. The cost to implement and administer this payment is $16.000 million, with Inland Revenue self-funding $2.000 million of this cost. Equity concerns There are aspects of t he design which may raise equity concerns, such as: •Using the individual’s 2021-22 tax assessment: this may not reflect a person's current position and impact their eligibility. •Using individual income, instead of household income: this may result in different outcomes for households with the same income level. •Requiring an income tax assessment: this will mean some people who hav e no i ncome but are still experiencing increased costs of living will be excluded (those who have no income and who are not receiving Working for Families (WFF)) while others will be included (people with no income who are receiving WFF) . •I mposing a requirement that the recipient be 18 or over: this may excl ude i ndividuals who are impacted by increased costs of living (for example, if they are supporting themselves independent of family). Administrative impacts While Inland Revenue can administer the payment, doing so will significantly impact their services to its customers. The addition of this payment to their portfolio of services Inland Revenue already delivers will compromise Inland Revenue’s already stretched workforce and affect the taxpayer population, including the families and individuals that this payment would be intended to support. This payment would require Inland Revenue to devote a significant number of their frontline staff to deliver the payment and manage contacts from people seeking support about the payment in Inland Revenue’s busiest period. Inland Revenue anticipates that contact would begin as soon as the announcement is made and peaking to approximately 750 FTEs being required in the weeks of 1 August, 1 September, and 1 October when the 1 The Treasury modelling uses different data to Inland Revenue’s administrative data, so the total number of people who would receive the payment will be different. The modelling was prepared using HEFU21 forecasts. \[SENSITIVE\] payments are made, and decreasing to approximately 250 FTE in the week before a payment being made. From November to March 2023, ongoing support of approximately 30 FTE per week would be required for IR3 filers. Inland Revenue has sought funding to hire additional temporary staff to support this payment. Further information on the implementation difficulty is discussed in section 3. Limitations and Constraints on Analysis The original commissioning for advice was narrow in scope and the advice needed to be provided within very compressed timeframes. The Minister of Finance originally sought urgent advice on options for a payment like the WEP to certain individuals earning less than $70,000 per year and who would not be entitled to the WEP in 2022. The Minister of Finance also indicated that the payment should be made at a similar time to the 2022 WEP, 2 or shortly thereafter. Additionally, the Minister of Finance indicated that the payment should be aimed at short term financial support to people who might be heavily impacted by the recent increases in cost of living and who might also be less likely to have benefited from income support changes on 1 April 2022 (e.g., increases to main benefit rates, Working for Families rates, and the increase in the minimum wage). Given the narrow scope of the commissioning and the speed at which advice was produced, the advice does not include consideration of the full range of options for addressing the issue of increased costs of living for many New Zealanders. Because of these constraints, it is also possible that the problem definition has not been fully analysed by officials. Owing to the very compressed timeframes and budget sensitivities, no consultation outside of government agencies has taken place. There is a risk that significant issues with the resulting proposal have not been identified. The distributional analysis is based on Treasury modelling, which uses data that is different to the administrative data used by Inland Revenue to assess eligibility for the payment. Accordingly, the total number of people who receive the payment will be different. These results assume that people's incomes and family situations do not change significantly between the 2021-22 tax year and the payment periods in tax year 2023. The input data does not provide any information to exclude individuals who do not file a tax assessment, who will be excluded when this policy is implemented. These results were prepared using HEFU21 forecasts, as Treasury are currently finalising incorporating BEFU22 forecasts into their modelling. The administrative data provided by Inland Revenue to estimate the potential number of recipients was based on the 2019-20 tax year. As the data are from the 2019-20 tax year, they reflect limited effects from the COVID-19 pandemic (if any), which began late in that tax year. Therefore, these figures are an indication of the potential size of the population and are not precise. This Supplementary Analysis Report has been produced under extremely tight time constraints without consultation or the benefit of robust data, and accordingly there is a risk that the analysis is incomplete. It represents Inland Revenue's best assessment of the option identified by the Government in the time available. 2 WEP is paid during the winter period -from May to October each year. Regulatory Impact Statement I 4 \[SENSITIVE\] Responsible Manager(s) (completed by relevant manager) Kerryn McIntosh-Watt Policy Director Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue 9(2 Ri} 4 May 2022 Quality Assurance (completed by QA panel) Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Panel Assessment & The Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Panel has reviewed the Comment: Cost of living payments Supplementary Analysis Report {SAR) prepared by I nland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the SAR partially meets the quality assurance criteria. Analysis of the problem and potential options has been significantly constrained by shortened timeframes, Ministerial direction on options and lack of stakeholder consultation outside Government. Given this, the panel considers that the information in the RIS is as complete as could reasonably be expected and identifies the main judgements, risks and uncertainties within the policy. Regulatory Impact Statement I 5 Regulatory I mpact Statement | 6 \[SENSITIVE\] Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What i s t he context behind the policy problem and how i s t he status quo expected to develop? Inflation has risen sharply and has increased New Zealanders’ costs of living At the time the advice on options was provided to Ministers, the Treasury anticipated inflation to increase over the near term due to the war in Ukraine, which affected international supply chains and oil prices. This followed the increase in the headline Consumers Price Index (CPI) by 5.9% in 2021, 3 reflecting higher fuel, food, and housing-related costs. Higher prices impact on people’s ability to purchase goods and services and can disproportionately affect lower-income households. The Household Living-Costs Price Index (HLPI), which measures the change in costs of living for particular groups of individuals, increased similarly in magnitude in 2021, with an average of 5.2% across all groups. Highest- expenditure groups (5.4%) and Māori (5.3%) had somewhat higher increases. Superannuitant (5.0%), beneficiary (4.8%) and lowest-e xpenditure groups (4.9%) had somewhat lower costs of living increases. Wage growth has been lower than inflation, although this is expected to be temporary. The Quarterly Employment Survey (December) showed annual nominal hourly wages rose 3.8% in 2021. The Treasury forecasts that CPI increases will average higher than wage growth for the June 2022 fiscal year. 4 However, that is the only fiscal year in the forecast period where CPI inflation will average higher than wage growth. The Treasury forecasts wages to grow faster than inflation in the fiscal years June 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, meaning the impact on real wages is expected to be short-lived. Lower income households are the ones most impacted by increased inflation The Treasury considers that inflation has a larger immediate effect on low or middle-income households, compared with higher income households based on analysis using IDI (Integrated Data Infrastructure) information. The increase in household expenditure owing to inflation has almost doubled the immediate impact on low- or middle-income households, compared with higher income households, as a proportion of current household income. Inflation has become widespread and persistent The Treasury has advised that strong aggregate demand, combined with constrained supply and a tight labour market, will result in inflation staying above target in t he near term. In t his context, an increase in the level of fiscal support would further exacerbate inflation. This i s mitigated by the payment being a one-off temporary support measure. Furthermore, the payment does not add to forecast fiscal spending as it i s f unded from expected future underspends in t he COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF). Broader context - other support measures that will address cost of living increases for lower income households The Government has already taken action to reduce fuel and public transport costs, and several income support changes were available on 1 April 2022. A summary of these changes and an assessment of whether those changes are l arger than the CPI change are included in Appendix 3. 3 This figure reflects the numbers as at the December 2021 quarter. 4 Between 2018 and 2021, average ordinary time wage growth in New Zealand averaged 3.5%, outstripping CPI inflation, which averaged 2.2%. Regulatory I mpact Statement | 7 \[SENSITIVE\] What is the policy problem or opportunity? The Government sought advice on a temporary payment to support lower to middle income individuals that are likely to be disproportionately impacted by the increases in the costs of living because of the recent spike in inflation. This commissioning arose because the Government identified an equity issue where a specified group of lower to middle income individuals would be more likely to bear the burden of higher costs of living caused by inflation, without the benefit of receiving other forms of Government support. As discussed above, the Treasury forecasts that CPI increases will average higher than wage growth for only the June 2022 fiscal year in the forecast period. As wages are forecast to grow faster than inflation in the fiscal years June 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, the impact of inflation on real wages is expected to be short-lived. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? The Government’s objective is to provide temporary support to low-to-middle income individuals who: • have been heavily impacted by the recent increase in costs of living, • are less likely to have benefited from income support changes on 1 April, such as increases in main benefit rates, Working for Families, and the increase in the minimum wage, and • will not be receiving the Winter Energy Payment (WEP) to support living costs over winter. Owing to the requirement for a payment to be delivered in 2022, this would require a solution to be implemented quickly that would improve the financial position of low- and middle- income households, relative to high income households. Regulatory I mpact Statement | 8 \[SENSITIVE\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? The following criteria were used to assess the options: 1. Equity: the payment should be targeted to the Government’s desired cohort of low- and middle-income households who are facing a spike in the costs of living and who are not eligible for the WEP. 2. Economic efficiency: the payment should be designed to minimise upward pressures on inflation by being targeted, timely, and temporary. 3. Administrative efficiency: the costs for the government in delivering and administering the payment should be minimised to the extent possible (including the payment should be implemented without significant pressure on the delivery agency’s resources). 4. Compliance efficiency: the costs for individuals and households in accessing the payment should be minimised to the extent possible (including eligible persons should be able to receive the payment in a timely manner). 5. Alignment with fiscal cost strategy: the design of the payment should have regard to the Government’s fiscal strategy and goal to maintain prudent levels. These criteria used are traditional tax policy principles, given the time constraints there was not sufficient time to assess the options against the He Ara Waiora or the living standards framework. What scope will options be considered within? The scope of the options presented was determined by the original commissioning and directions from the Government. Given the time frames, limited data were able to be obtained and analysed. In addition, no stakeholder engagement has taken place outside Government agencies because of extremely compressed timeframes and budget sensitivity. These factors might have had the effect of limiting the range of options considered. After considering officials’ initial advice, Ministers narrowed the scope for final design decisions. Potential eligible population Inland Revenue estimates that approximately 2,136,000 individuals would be eligible for the proposed payment. This information was used to cost the proposal. Inland Revenue was not able to accurately forecast the number of eligible individuals for the 2021-22 tax year. The estimate above is based on Inland Revenue’s administrative data from the 2019-20 tax year, the latest year for which Inland Revenue has completed tax assessments, which demonstrated 2,081,700 individuals would be eligible. The table in Appendix 1 shows the income distribution of the population of those earning up to $70,000 (net income) using this data. This figure was then adjusted for forecast labour force participation growth of 2.6%, which increased the estimated eligible population to 2,136,000 individuals (rounded). The payment would be targeted to middle income households, around 55% of the total payments would go to the middle 40% of households, with 20% to the bottom 30% and 25% Regulatory I mpact Statement | 10 \[SENSITIVE\] recipients or, for the new payment based on a high trust model, were complex and potentially not able to be delivered in the required time frame. Regulatory I mpact Statement | 11 \[SENSITIVE\] What options are being considered? Three options were considered: the status quo, a lump sum payment and periodic payments with no income floor. Option One – Status Quo Option One is the status quo and assumes that no additional financial support is provided to low- to middle-income households. Option Two – Lump sum payment Option Two is the introduction of a one-off payment of $350 (half of the couple rate for the WEP), to individuals who: • Earn up to $70,000 per annum (on an individual, rather than a household basis) • Are not eligible to receive the WEP during the payment period • Are aged 18 or over • Present in New Zealand and tax resident for payment period • Are not incarcerated or deceased Entitlement to the lump sum would be assessed at a single point in time, with the income criterion based on an individual’s 2021-22 tax assessment. The payment would be: • Tax exempt (exempt income) • Not included as income for the purposes of entitlements for Working for Families or other social policies • Not offset against other liabilities owed to Inland Revenue • Not considered income or a cash asset for income support paid by MSD Inland Revenue proposed that the lump sum payment could not be made earlier than late July 2022. This was to align with when most of the annual income tax assessments for the 2022 tax year would be completed. Point in time assessment The point in time assessment results in fairness issues for some individuals who move into or out of WEP eligibility after this specific date, but before the end of the 2022 WEP payment period. The level of impact would depend on the date chosen to do the point in time eligibility check. Those impacted would have included people who are eligible for the WEP at the specific point in time when eligibility for the payment is assessed but later become ineligible (e.g., beneficiary who becomes employed). This could mean some people would either: • miss out on the proposed payment entirely, while only receiving the WEP for part of the winter period (e.g., ceases benefit after the eligibility check but during the WEP period) • miss out on both the proposed payment and the WEP (e.g., cease benefit the day after the point in time eligibility check but before the WEP period). There would also be some people who are not eligible for the WEP at the specific point in time but become eligible after (e.g., those who turn 65 after the point in time) and they would receive both the proposed payment and the WEP. \[SENSITIVE\] How do the options compare to the status quo? Equity Economic efficiency: targeted, timely, temporary Administrative efficiency Option One - Status Quo 0 0 0 Option Two - Lump sum payment + Likely to reach the Government's targeted population. There might be instances, however, where an individual's situation changes between their 2021-22 assessment and their actual position in August, September, and October 2022 (such as income change or eligibility for WEP changing). Single point in time assessment would reduce the ability to target the intended population. Changes in benefit and NZ Super status after the point in time assessment, for example, would not be able to be considered + Provides support to many recipients based on readily accessible data, without the requirement to apply. There would, however, be some individuals who receive this payment after winter, owing to their tax filling situations. A broad-based payment of this magnitude would add to inflationary pressures in the short-term, but this is mitigated by the temporary nature of the payment. This option would add considerable operational pressure for Inland Revenue, but it would be simpler to Option Three - Periodic payment + Likely to reach the Government's targeted population. There might be instances, however, where an individual's situation changes between their 2021-22 assessment and their actual position in August, September, and October 2022. + Same as Option Two Same as Option Two. This option would add considerable operational pressure for Inland Revenue with a negative flow on effect to customers. This Regulatory Impact Statement I 15 Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 \[SENSITIVE\] Option One – status quo Maintaining the status quo would not achieve the Government’s objectives. The status quo would not require Inland Revenue to administer a payment (carrying no administrative costs, would not impose compliance costs or pose any implementation difficulty) and would have no fiscal cost. Option Two – lump sum payment Equity This option would provide temporary support of $350 lump sum to low to middle income eligible recipients. Inland Revenue estimates that approximately 2,136,000 individuals would be eligible for the proposed payment. This information was used to cost the proposal. Inland Revenue was not able to accurately forecast the number of eligible individuals for the 2021-22 tax year. 5 The estimate above is based on Inland Revenue’s administrative data from the 2019-20 tax year, the latest year for which Inland Revenue has completed tax assessments, which demonstrated 2,081,700 individuals would be eligible. The table in Appendix 1 shows the income distribution of the population of those earning up to $70,000 (net income) using this data. This figure was then adjusted for forecast labour force participation growth of 2.6%, which increased the estimated eligible population to 2,136,000 individuals (rounded). While the payment would be targeted to some extent toward low to middle income households, it may also go to higher income households because it is based on individual income rather than household income. Preliminary distributional modelling shows that close to a quarter of the payments would go to households with incomes in the top 30%. Under the current criteria, there are likely to be many individuals who would be eligible for the payment because of tax structuring under the $70,000 threshold or because they are the secondary earner in a high-income household. There is potential for individuals (particularly those with non-salary and wage income) to rearrange their incomes on their tax return to just below the income cap. Inland Revenue is unable to estimate this risk; however, those returns would be subject to normal integrity checks as part of the year end assessment. There are also other aspects of the design that could raise equity concerns such as: - using the individual’s 2021- 22 tax assessment, - point in time assessment (specific to option two), - using individual income, instead of household income, - requiring assessable income, and - imposing a requirement that the recipient be aged 18 or over. 5 There are factors that would increase this number such as population growth, and factors that would decrease it such as income growth. In costing this proposal, officials have taken the conservative approach of adjusting the number of eligible recipients up using the BEFU forecast labour force population growth of 2.6% to the 2021/22 March year. This increases the estimated eligible population to 2,136,000 individuals (rounded). Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 \[SENSITIVE\] Using the individuals 2021-22 tax assessment There is a risk this payment could be inequitable, as some people’s circumstances might have changed since the end of the 2021-22 tax year, and this could impact their eligibility for the payment. The fact that delivering this payment would require using historical income information means that the target population of this payment might not perfectly match everyone’s current circumstances. For example, this payment would not be provided to someone who was earning over $70,000 last tax year but has suffered a recent decrease in income. However, the payment would be provided to someone who earned less than $70,000 in the last tax year but has recently had an increase in income over $70,000. Point in time assessment (specifi c to option two) The design of the payment would require assessing at a specific point in time whether an individual is eligible for the WEP. This would result in fairness issues for some individuals who move into or out of WEP eligibility after this specific date, but before the end of the 2022 WEP payment period. People who are eligible for the WEP at the specific point in time when eligibility for the payment is assessed but later become ineligible (e.g., a beneficiary who becomes employed) would miss out on the payment entirely, while only receiving the WEP for part of the winter period. People who are not eligible for the WEP at the specific point in time but become eligible after that time (e.g., those who turn 65 after the point in time) would receive both the payment and the WEP. Using individual income, instead of household income Providing a payment based on individual income would also lead to different outcomes for households with the same level of income, which may be perceived as unfair. For example, a household with two earners making $60,000 would get two payments (a total of $700), while a two-adult household with one earner on $120,000 and a stay-at home parent would get one or zero payments (depending on if the stay-at-home parent had some level of non-wage income). Inland Revenue does not hold information on household income and therefore must use individual income. R equiring assessable income W hen designing the payment, the Government decided individuals with no assessed income would not be eligible for the payment. These individuals may still be impacted by the increased cost of living but would be ineligible for this payment. This decision was supported by Inland Revenue due to the data constraints and extra compliance costs it would add to these individuals to have to apply and supply all income information to Inland Revenue. For context, Inland Revenue has no information on individua ls who have no assessed income reported or do not interact with Inland Revenue (for example, those who sleep rough or adults who do not work or receive any social policy support). However, despite the choice to exclude individuals with no assessed income, WFF recipients who have no other income will Regulatory Impact Statement | 19 \[SENSITIVE\] still be eligible for the payment. This is because a tax assessment is automatically completed for them to assess their eligibility for WFF payments. Imposing a requirement that the recipient be 18 or over The payment would also only be available to people aged 18 or over. This may exclude individuals who may be impacted by increased costs of living, for example, if they are living out of home or may be supporting themselves independent from family support. Inland Revenue would use the birthdate information it holds to check individuals’ age before the payment (i.e., August, September, and October in the case of option three). This could lead to arbitrary outcomes if an individual turns 18 after the relevant date. E conomic efficiency Timely The payment would be automatically paid to the eligible population as assessed at a determined date. This is provided the eligible person has a bank account number recorded 6 and has submitted a 2021- 22 tax assessment. This meets Ministers objectives to broadly align the payment window with the WEP window (May to October). However, eligibility would be based on a finalised 2021-22 tax assessment and the window for filing some assessments does not close until 31 March 2023. This means some people would not receive their payments until after 31 March 2023. Tem porary The payment would be time-limited, with eligibility ending on 31 March 2023. The proposed payment is temporary to assist during the June 2022 fiscal year, where CPI is averaging higher than wage growth. I nflationary impact The Treasury has advised that strong aggregate demand, combined with constrained supply and a tight labour market, will result in inflation staying above target in the near term. In this context, an increase in the level of fiscal support would further exacerbate inflation. This is mitigated by the proposed payment being a one-off temporary support measure. Furthermore, the payment would not add to forecast fiscal spending as it will be funded from expected future underspends in the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF). A dministrative efficiency Option Two would be simpler for Inland Revenue to administer, compared to Option Three, because it would be based on assessing eligibility at single point in time rather than three times. However, option two would still have critical operational impacts on Inland Revenue 6 Inland Revenue holds this information for 79.4% of potentially eligible recipients, other recipients would need to update their details in myIR in order to receive a payment. Regulatory Impact Statement | 21 \[SENSITIVE\] Option three – periodic payment The analysis for option two (above) applies for option three, unless stated otherwise. Equity Treasury modelling suggests that 1,088,000 households will gain an average of $590, indicating that over half of the households will receive two payments. About 478,000 households with children and 610,000 households without children are expected to receive the payment. The payment is somewhat targeted to low- and middle-income households. Around 54% of the total payments are estimated to go to the middle 40% of households, with 21% going to the bottom 30% and 24% going to the top 30%. The Treasury estimates that the characteristics of the individual recipients would be: -A third have children, two thirds do not have childr en -22% received self-employment income in the previous tax year -60% have partners -Approximately 57% of families (couples and single people) receiving the payment have total family incomes below $70,000, 12% have family incomes between $70,000 and $100,000, and 31% have family incomes over $100,000. Some of the information Inland Revenue holds may not be up to date. This would mean some people who should receive the payment may not, and conversely, some people who received the payment should not have. To mitigate this, Inland Revenue would run monthly checks to identify such cases and any missed entitlement would be paid out separately, as they are approved (as described in the process below). E conomic efficiency Timely The payment would be automatically paid to the eligible population as assessed at the start of August, September, and October 2022. This is provided if the eligible person has a bank account number recorded with Inland Revenue and has submitted a 2021-22 tax assessment. This meets Ministers objectives to broadly align the payment window with the WEP window (May to October). However, eligibility would be based on a finalised 2021-22 tax assessment and the window for filing some assessments does not close until 31 March 2023. This means some people would not receive their payments until after 31 March 2023. A dministrative impacts Inland Revenue has estimated the cost to implement and administer this option is $16 million. Inland Revenue will self-fund $2 million of this cost. The cost arises from the significant effort involved in periodic assessments, administering three payments and collecting bank account information for customers who do not already have one on file. Inland Revenue anticipates that contact would begin for the proposed payments under option three as soon as the announcement is made. This would peak to approximately 750 FTEs s 18(c)(i) \[SENSITIVE\] being required in the weeks of 1 August, 1 September, and 1 October when the payments are made, and decreasing to approximately 250 FTE in the week before a payment being made. From November to March 2023, ongoing support of approximately 30 FTE per week will be required for IR3 filers. Compliance efficiency At the time of the first proposed payment on 1 August, Inland Revenue expects to have tax assessments for around 3.2 million individuals (around 75% of individual customers). This includes people who had their income tax assessment completed automatically by Inland Revenue and people who filed a tax return by 7 July. Around 25% of potentially eligible recipients (around 500,000 individuals) would not receive this payment during the proposed August-October window because their assessment for the 2021-22 tax year is not complete. This includes those who file IR3 tax returns through a tax agent and have until 31 March 2023 to file, and those with assessments held awaiting further information (including some Working for Families recipients). What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? Option Three best fits the Government's commissioning, addresses the problem, and meets most of their objectives. The eligibility criteria, as outlined above, might impact on the ability to effectively target the intended population. These criteria were designed in a way to best deliver the proposed payment in a timely manner that meets the Government's policy objectives, while reducing the operational impacts on Inland Revenue.

Administration of the proposed payments The proposed scheme would be administered by Inland Revenue. The option would require amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow Inland Revenue to administer the payments. The amendments will allow Inland Revenue to: • include administration of the proposed payments as one of the functions of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, • use the information it holds to determine eligibility and make payments, and • use recovery provisions where payments have been issued based on fraudulent or wilfully misleading information. The proposed legislative amendments would take effect from the day after the proposed bill receives Royal assent. The first payment w ould be made on 1 August, with the two remaining periodic payments made on 1 September and 1 October (or the next working day if the payment date falls on a weekend). Lump sum payments would continue to be made as individual tax assessment are finalised and tax returns are filed (the final date to file tax returns for the 2021-22 tax year is 31 March 2023). There would be no application required for the payments. Entitlement to the payments would be determined by Inland Revenue based on information it holds (e.g., tax assessments and employer information from MSD). Implementation risks While Inland Revenue can administer the payment, doing so will significantly impact existing services to its customers.

The advice provided by Inland Revenue officials on the design of the payments scheme has focused not only on how the scheme might address Ministers’ stated objectives, but also on factors that simplify the build and reduce the operational impacts on Inland Revenue. Making the design as simple as possible (e.g., using finalised 2021-22 tax year income, not having an application process, and not apportioning the payments) reduces the risk to successful implementation.

As p art of the design and systems build for the proposed payment, Inland Revenue would incorporate reporting functionality. The detailed design is still being finalised but is likely to include: 1. Numbers of recipients, 2. Amounts paid out, 3. Timing of payments; and 4. Income levels of recipients The time-limited nature of the payment scheme means that the monitoring would only be in place until 2024. No payments would be made after 31 March 2024; therefore, monitoring would cease after any credits that had not been issued are returned to the Crown. Inland Revenue has existing processes in place to manage any concerns or complaints raised by individuals, industry bodies or other agencies, and these processes would be used to gather information and concerns about the proposed payment scheme.

This draft long-term insights briefing (LTIB) examines how New Zealand’s tax settings are likely to affect incentives for firms to invest into New Zealand and benchmarks New Zealand’s tax settings against those in other countries. Inland Revenue consulted on this proposal to base our LTIB on this topic in August 2021. Submissions were mainly supportive of the proposal. 2. Compared to other OECD countries, New Zealand appears to have relatively high taxes on inbound investment. These taxes are likely to mean higher costs of capital (or hurdle rates of return) for investment into New Zealand than for investment into most other OECD countries. High taxes on inbound investment ha ve the potential to reduce economic efficiency by reducing New Zealand’s capital stock and labour productivity. 3. Variability in costs of capital across different types of assets or for investment into New Zealand that is financed in different ways also has the potential to reduce productivity. 4. This draft LTIB aims to help build up an understanding of how taxes on inbound investment can combine to affect incentives to invest in New Zealand. The analysis is underpinned by modelling the costs of capital and effective marginal tax rates when taking into account the combined effects of company tax rates, depreciation provisions, special tax incentives, such as the research and development tax credit, and withholding taxes. It does so for investment that can be financed using different proportions of debt and equity. 5. The draft LTIB suggests that, despite New Zealand’s broad-based income tax settings, there is likely to be considerable variability in costs of capital. This variability is increased significantly by quite small levels of inflation, especially when interest rates are low. 6. There are likely to be ongoing questions about whether New Zealand should change its business tax settings in ways that lower costs of capital and make them more neutral. Whether to lower costs of capital is a difficult issue because measures that do so will normally have a fiscal cost and may often reduce the progressivity of personal income taxes. They can also at times provide windfalls to those who have invested in the past or to those who would invest in New Zealand regardless of whether taxes were cut. 7. Changing the way in which businesses are taxed will always be a vexed issue. As well as the direct impact of any changes on business investment and productivity and growth, complex issues arise about how the tax system as a whole fits together and, ultimately, whether it is fair. Questions of how to improve economic efficiency will be important but so too will questions of fairness, as well as whether the business tax system is providing a robust source of revenue to finance government spending. 8. When considering whether to change the business tax system and how best to change it if change is deemed desirable, there will always be difficult trade-offs to consider. These are likely to be ongoing issues for future governments. 9. The aim of this draft LTIB is to initiate a process of discussion on these sorts of issues. It considers several possible tax changes, namely: • a cut in the company tax rate • accelerated depreciation provisions 6 • inflation indexation of the tax base • a higher thin capitalisation rule safe harbour • an allowance for corporate equity • special industry-specific or firm-specific incentives, and • a dual income tax system. 10. These measures are possible ways of lowering costs of capital and some of these can also promote tax neutrality. There is unlikely to be a single ‘best option’. Choices between the options will ultimately depend on the weightings that are given to different possible objectives of reforms. Feasible options are likely to depend on some quite difficult questions about the sorts of tax instruments that are desirable for New Zealand. 11. The analysis in this draft LTIB is supported by Tax, foreign investment and productivity: Technical appendices to support Inland Revenue’s draft long-term insights briefing (LTIB), Inland Revenue (2022) (Technical appendices). 1 12. The aim of this draft LTIB is to start a conversation on what people see as the most important objectives for reform and whether particular reforms are worth considering further. The closing date for submissions is Thursday, 14 April 2022. 1 https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2022/2022-other-draft-ltib 7 CHAPTER 1 Introduction • Inland Revenue is required to produce a long-term insights briefing (LTIB) at least once every three years. • This is Inland Revenue’s first LTIB. • It examines how New Zealand’s tax settings are likely to affect incentives to invest and benchmarks our tax settings against those in other countries. • Concerns have been raised for many years about New Zealand’s relatively weak economic performance and the LTIB questions whether New Zealand’s tax settings might be a contributing factor. • It examines the pros and cons of some possible reform options. 1.1 New Zealand’s poor productivity performance has been a longstanding concern. International tax reviews and the work of other agencies have often highlighted tax and its impact on investment as an important factor affecting productivity and economic performance. Despite other public sector work on productivity, no broad analysis has been undertaken of how New Zealand’s tax settings compare with those of other countries, whether the settings are likely to be having a relatively large effect on investment and/or whether this might be contributing to New Zealand’s weak productivity performance. 1.2 Questions of how best to address weak productivity and poor economic performance are complex, and there is unlikely to be a single ‘silver bullet’. Many other important productivity issues could be considered including: • competition policy and the degree of monopoly power • migration settings and incentives for firms to invest in productivity- improving technology or to bring in cheaper labour, and • broader policy settings, which may affect the housing market and incentives to invest there. 1.3 While there are likely to be many channels through which taxes affect productivity, one that may have an important influence is tax on inbound investment. 1.4 In its August 2021 scoping paper, Inland Revenue proposed that its 2022 LTIB should focus on tax, investment and productivity. 2 Submissions received were mainly supportive of this suggestion and we are proceeding with this topic. 1.5 This is a first draft of the 2022 LTIB. We are seeking further input from the public on this draft LTIB. After consultation, Inland Revenue will prepare a final LTIB that should be presented to Select Committee early in the second half of 2022. 2 Inland Revenue. (2021). Tax, investment and productivity: consultation on the scope of Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2021/2021- other-scope-ird -ltib-tax-liability-productivity 8 1.6 Other agencies are also looking at productivity issues in their LTIBs, for example, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s LTIB entitled The future of business for Aotearoa New Zealand. 3 Our LTIB is narrower in scope, but it aims to be complementary to, and supportive of, other work in this area. 1.7 Work on this topic has been facilitated by work at the OECD that allows us to benchmark how tax provisions are likely to be affecting costs of capital in New Zealand and in other OECD countries. Costs of capital are hurdle rates of return. New Zealand’s investment demand exceeds the pool of domestic savings of domestic residents, so we rely to a considerable extent on imported capital to fund domestic investments. For investing into New Zealand to be attractive, New Zealand investments will need to generate risk-adjusted returns net of New Zealand taxes comparable to what non-residents are able to obtain from investing in other countries. Costs of capital are the hurdle pre-tax rates of return that will make investment in New Zealand marginal, that is, just worth undertaking. These will affect inbound investment into New Zealand and the level and composition of New Zealand’s capital stock. 1.8 Analysing costs of capital is helpful when considering how different possible tax changes might affect incentives to invest in different assets financed in different ways. It is also helpful when examining the likely effects, and pros and cons, of possible future business tax changes. 1.9 The modelling in this paper is consistent with, and builds upon, many other international studies. These include the cost of capital and effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) analysis of the OECD. The EMTR is the proportion of the real pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment that is lost in tax. For example, if a marginal investment earns a 4% real pre-tax rate of return but only earns 3% net of New Zealand taxes, its EMTR is 25% or (4% − 3%)/4%. We work with the OECD model and extend it in several ways to consider New Zealand’s tax settings. 1.10 It should be noted at the outset that any economic modelling work will be a simplification of the real world and, at most, will provide partial insights into how taxes are likely to impact on investment. The assumptions underlying the modelling are discussed further in chapter 3. 1.11 Despite its simplifications, the modelling can be helpful when considering: • whether New Zealand appears to be an outlier in how heavily it taxes inbound investment • whether a potential case for policy change exists, and • the pros and cons of different possible policy changes. 1.12 In practice, there will be important trade-offs to consider when thinking about the pros and cons of any policy changes. If New Zealand is an outlier in its tax treatment of inbound investment, this does not necessarily mean there are compelling grounds for New Zealand to alter its tax settings. At times, New Zealand may be different from other countries in important ways, for example, in its geographical remoteness from other countries or in the set of taxes that it is willing to impose. Decisions about whether to alter tax settings will need to 3 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. (2021).

Decisions on whether to change current settings (and, if so, how) will depend on the weightings given to competing objectives. Background 1.13 Alongside the Treasury, Inland Revenue provides advice to the Ministers of Finance and of Revenue on the tax and social policies administered through the tax system. As part of providing this advice, Inland Revenue has an important stewardship role to ensure that we are well placed to advise present and future governments on tax policy issues that are likely to be of vital interest to New Zealand in the future. 1.14 Under the Public Service Act 2020, there is a new legislative requirement for public service chief executives to undertake public consultation on the topics to be included in an LTIB and on a draft of the LTIB itself. 4 This is required to happen at least once every three years. 1.15 LTIBs are not intended to involve advocacy for any particular policy change. Pros and cons of different policy options are to be considered, but LTIBs are not intended to push for particular policy conclusions. They are expected to look out at least ten years into the future. 1.16 The purpose of an LTIB is to make available to the public: • information about medium- and long-term trends, risks, and opportunities that affect, or may affect, New Zealand society, and • information and impartial analysis of the trends, risks and opportunities that have been identified, including policy options for responding to them. 1.17 This is Inland Revenue’s first LTIB, and the following chapters provide a first draft. Key trends and issues 1.18 The scoping paper noted that, while New Zealand had a low company tax rate compared to most other OECD countries in the late 1980s, this was no longer true. Since the late 1980s, there have been two cuts in New Zealand’s company tax rate, but most other OECD countries have cut their company rates more than New Zealand over this period. This is shown in figure 1.1. 5 4 See schedule 6, clauses 8 and 9 of the Public Service Act 2020. 5 Data for figures 1.1 to 1.4 is available on the OECD website at https://stats.oecd.org/. Data for figure 1.1 was supplemented by some additional information for early years provided to us by the OECD but not yet available on their website. 10 Figure 1.1: Company tax rates in NZ and some other OECD countries 1.19 A potential concern is whether high taxes on inbound investment, and a high company tax rate in particular, are reducing inbound investment, productivity and economic performance. The scoping paper noted that New Zealand’s lagging productivity performance had been an issue for decades, and this included periods when New Zealand’s company tax rate was relatively low as well as when it was relatively high. 1.20 The scoping paper noted that New Zealand had relatively high EMTRs on inbound investment. This evidence is discussed further in chapter 3. High EMTRs may make it harder for New Zealand firms to respond to new risks and opportunities that require investment in new activities (for example, climate change or providing important new infrastructure). 1.21 The scoping paper also noted the New Zealand Productivity Commission had suggested that attracting both high-quality inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) and outbound direct investment (ODI) was critical for very high- performing frontier firms to develop in small, advanced economies. The scoping paper pointed out that New Zealand’s FDI was not growing as quickly as most other OECD countries and New Zealand’s ODI performance looked particularly weak. This is shown in figures 1.2 and 1.3. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 19811983198519871989199119931995199719992001200320052007200920112013201520172019 AustraliaCanada New ZealandUnited Kingdom United StatesOECD unweighted average OECD weighted average 11 Figure 1.2: FDI as a percentage of GDP Figure 1.3: ODI as a percentage of GDP 1.22 This LTIB focuses on taxes on inbound investment that may affect FDI performance, as in figure 1.2. It has not been possible to consider the potential impact of tax settings on ODI in the time available. New Zealand’s very low levels of ODI have continued despite a major tax policy change for income years starting on or after 1 July 2009. At that time, New Zealand changed its tax rules on outbound investment to exempt the active income of controlled foreign corporations, making the rules much more like those of many other countries. While this might have been expected to encourage ODI, there is no evidence of a strong positive response in the data. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019 AustraliaNew ZealandUnited KingdomOECD 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019 AustraliaNew ZealandUnited KingdomOECD 12 1.23 Finally, the scoping paper discussed New Zealand’s economic performance relative to the USA in real GDP per capita and labour productivity. Real GDP per capita fell in New Zealand relative to the United States until about 1992, when it seemed to stabilise for a period. There has been some small sign of recovery since then. However, as the scoping paper discusses, New Zealand’s labour productivity performance looks worse than its real GDP per capita performance. New Zealand’s level of labour productivity is now 60% of that of the United States. This is slightly lower than it was in the early 1990s. Figure 1.4: Real GDP per capita relative to the US 1.24 There are likely to be many other issues that may be more crucial for economic performance than tax policy settings, but important questions are whether New Zealand’s current settings are likely to be having a material adverse impact and whether there are ways of improving our tax settings. Feedback received on the scoping paper 1.25 Our scoping paper suggested that our LTIB focus on tax, investment and productivity. We received feedback from eight individuals and groups. Most supported tax investment and productivity as a topic for our LTIB. At the same time, several concerns and qualifications were raised. 1.26 Four of the submissions discussed capital gains tax or productivity concerns arising from the light taxation of property. Two of these suggested that under- taxation of sectors that benefit from tax exempt capital gains may be a bigger issue than the impact of high tax rates on inbound investment reducing productivity. A third submission was concerned that the absence of a capital gains tax was reducing the coherence of the tax system. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) has advised that LTIBs should not focus on issues that have already been subject to considerable analysis. Capital gains tax was considered by the recent Tax Working Group and the Government decided against a general tax on capital gains. Therefore, we are not making a capital gains tax on property or a more general tax on capital gains a central focus because it has been the subject of recent debate and policy consideration. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 United StatesAustraliaNew Zealand United KingdomOECD - Total 13 1.27 A fourth submission commented that the OECD cost of capital and EMTR benchmarking analysis ignores taxes on capital gains. The submission was concerned that this may make New Zealand look relatively worse than is true. New Zealand’s lack of a tax on capital gains could be an advantage of investing in New Zealand, relative to most other countries, when gains are realised through sales of assets such as buildings or goodwill. 1.28 Most submissions raised other important factors that could affect investment that were not included in the OECD benchmarking analysis. As well as the desirability of coherence in tax settings, concerns were expressed about overly complex legislation, high compliance costs, and a lack of certainty and predictability adding to the costs and risk of investing in New Zealand. Concerns were also expressed that, for a small country like New Zealand, there may often be relatively small benefits to non-resident firms from investing in the country. Small levels of other costs and uncertainties may make it unattractive for firms to investigate whether investing in New Zealand is likely to be beneficial. 1.29 Several of the submissions pointed out that other factors may be as, or even more, important than taxes on inbound investment in affecting decisions about investment in New Zealand. Issues pointed to included comparative advantage, the underlying profitability of investments, and other regulatory issues, such as Overseas Investment Office criteria. 1.30 Two submissions discussed our company tax full imputation scheme and questioned whether it was desirable to continue with an imputation system. One of these submissions pointed to the prevalence of ‘classical’ company tax systems overseas – where profits are taxed at the company level and then taxed a second time when dividends are paid to shareholders. A third submission appeared to be pushing in the opposite direction. It raised concerns about differences in tax settings between different entities. These are substantial economic issues, and it has not been possible to consider them in this LTIB. 1.31 Two submissions argued that personal taxes should be taken into account when considering incentives to invest for small and medium enterprises. Even if small and medium enterprises operate as companies, profits will be subject to personal tax when distributed as dividends. We discuss how the OECD modelling might be extended to these sorts of enterprise in chapter 4. 1.32 Two submissions discussed environmental taxes. An increase in measured economic performance, such as growth in GDP or labour productivity, may be unattractive if it is accompanied by environmental degradation. This is important and underlines the partial nature of cost of capital and EMTR studies. We do not see any real conflict between this observation and the analysis in this LTIB. Normally, neutrality of tax settings is seen as a plus. However, as the submissions have pointed out, tax neutrality may not be desirable in specific instances where there are negative or positive externalities (spillover costs or benefits to other firms or individuals). In those circumstances, there might be a case for either higher or lower levels of tax on specific investments. One of the submissions argued that, for use of non-neutral taxes to be justified, there needs to be clear evidence of market failure and for tax instruments to be the best way of addressing externalities. The submissions also pointed out that environmental taxes could be a way of raising revenue, as well as correcting for market failures. 1.33 Two of the submissions argued that New Zealand had been served well by its broad-based low-rate tax settings, and that this suggests a high burden of proof is necessary before moving away from these settings. However, two of the 14 submissions commented favourably on specific tax concessions that had been made available in other countries. Outline of the draft LTIB 1.34 The content of the draft LTIB is as follows. Chapter 2 discusses a framework for examining taxes on inbound investment and whether changes in tax settings are likely to be in New Zealand’s best interests. Chapter 3 provides estimates from the OECD benchmarking analysis of costs of capital or hurdle rates and EMTRs in New Zealand against those for other countries. These suggest that New Zealand has relatively high costs of capital and EMTRs compared with most other OECD countries. Chapter 4 extends the OECD analysis in several ways to examine how taxes can be impacting on costs of capital and EMTRs in New Zealand. This analysis is supplemented by a set of technical appendices which are available on its tax policy website. 6 1.35 The subsequent chapters examine the pros and cons of different ways of reducing costs of capital. Some of these ways can also help in making tax settings more neutral. Chapter 5 provides an overview of the different policy options that are considered. While these are meant to cover the most likely options to be put forward, the list is far from exhaustive. Chapter 6 examines a cut in the company tax rate. Chapter 7 examines two accelerated depreciation measures: a depreciation loading for assets, and a system of partial expensing. Chapter 8 considers the possibility of indexing the income tax base for inflation so that taxpayers would no longer be taxed on inflationary gains and could no longer deduct inflationary losses. Chapter 9 discusses the possibility of loosening the current thin capitalisation rules by allowing a higher safe harbour threshold. Chapter 10 explores the possibility of an allowance for corporate equity. Chapter 11 discusses the possibility of specific incentives for different types of business. Finally, chapter 12 considers the possibility of a more fundamental shift towards a dual income tax system.

Introduction 2.1 New Zealand’s tax policy settings will affect incentives for non-residents to invest in New Zealand. They will impact on costs of capital (that is, the real pre- tax rates of return that investments in New Zealand need to generate to be attractive on an after-tax basis). 2.2 New Zealand depends on capital inflows for its economic development and performance. Inbound investment can generate growth in New Zealand’s capital stock, and with a greater capital stock, labour will tend to become more productive. This will support higher wage rates in New Zealand. Inbound investment could also support productivity and growth through transferring technology, building management expertise and broader business knowhow, and raising the skills and knowledge of the New Zealand workforce. In addition, inbound investment provides access to international production chains and markets. 2.3 Company tax is the main tax on inbound investment income. Company tax settings may have important impacts on inbound investment and the efficiency and effectiveness of New Zealand’s tax settings more broadly. 2.4 Later chapters examine, and extend, work by the OECD on how taxes on inbound investment income can impact on costs of capital and effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs). They look at the pros and cons of some different possible tax policy changes. This chapter discusses an economic framework and some empirical evidence that can be helpful in thinking through the likely welfare consequences of taxes on inbound investment. 17 2.5 We start by presenting a simple economic model, with a single type of capital inflow and a single type of investment, that economists have used to start to examine these sorts of issues. We explain why this model suggests that high taxes on inbound investment into New Zealand can be undesirable. We then discuss a broader range of capital inflows and forms of investment and consider how non-neutral settings can reduce productivity and economic performance. Gains in productivity and economic performance from reducing high EMTRs and making these more neutral will ultimately depend on the responsiveness of investment to tax settings. We complete this chapter by discussing international evidence on how large the effects on investment are likely to be of any reductions in costs of capital and EMTRs. 2.6 Much of the analysis in this chapter has been discussed in other tax reviews, including the Tax Review 2001 (chaired by Sir Robert McLeod and commonly referred to as the McLeod Review) 7 and New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment, Inland Revenue and Treasury (2016). 8 The chapter draws on this analysis. The effects of source-based taxes on inbound investment income in a small open economy – a simple model 2.7 New Zealand imposes company tax and other taxes on non-residents on income sourced from New Zealand, and this is often referred to as a source-based income tax. Tax is also imposed on New Zealand residents when they earn income from New Zealand or foreign countries. This is often referred to as a residence-based income tax. New Zealand’s tax settings comprise elements of both source-basis and residence-basis taxation. 2.8 A key question is whether it is in the best interests of a small open economy (SOE) to impose source-based income taxes on the income that non-residents earn from investment in the SOE. 2.9 A standard simple economic model considers an SOE importing a single type of capital. Under the standard SOE assumption, an SOE like New Zealand faces a perfectly elastic supply of capital. This means New Zealand can import as much capital as it wants without affecting the returns that foreigners demand (net of any New Zealand taxes) for supplying their capital to New Zealand. In the model, investment is assumed to take place until additional investment is earning only marginal (or break-even) returns. 2.10 To provide non-residents with the returns they demand, investments need to generate a rate of return that is at least as good as what could be achieved if the non-residents supplied their capital to other countries. Economic rents are returns in excess of the return that non-residents demand on their funds. If there are no economic rents, the implication of this model is that there should be no taxes imposed on inbound investment, except to the extent that taxes imposed in the SOE are creditable abroad (that is, taxes overseas are reduced dollar for dollar as a result of tax being paid in New Zealand). This is because it is likely to be a particularly inefficient backdoor way of taxing domestic residents. Any tax imposed will be passed on to other domestic factors of 7 McLeod Review. (2001). Tax Review 2001, Final Report. https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2007-11/taxreview2001-report.pdf 8 Inland Revenue and Treasury (2016). New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016/2016-other-nz-framework-inbound- investment 18 production, such as land and labour, but in a manner that is less efficient than taxing those factors directly. 2.11 The logic behind this model can be most easily seen if we think of debt as being the single form of capital and lending to New Zealand being no more or less risky than lending to other countries. If New Zealand is a net capital importer importing debt from the rest of the world, it must offer an interest rate that non-resident lenders are willing to accept. Suppose we tax interest payments to non-residents. Unless non-residents can claim credits for these taxes (which reduces the amount of tax they pay overseas on this income), the interest rate will need to rise until the net-of -NZ-tax interest rate is the same as what the non-resident can obtain from lending to other countries. Thus, the economic incidence of this tax will be borne by domestic borrowers, rather than foreign lenders. 2.12 Much the same story will apply if the single form of capital were equity. A source-based company tax is likely to push up hurdle rates of return until foreign equity investors are earning comparable risk-adjusted returns to what they can obtain elsewhere. If there are no economic rents, the tax will not be borne by non-residents because they will never be willing to accept less than the marginal rate of return that they can obtain from investing in other countries. Instead, hurdle rates of return will need to rise, which will mean less capital stock, a less productive labour force and lower wages. The tax will fall on New Zealanders rather than non-residents. 2.13 With equity-financed investment there are some additional issues to consider. Risk and uncertainty will complicate the story because different non-resident suppliers of capital will generally have different views about what the returns on an investment are likely to be. This may make the supply of capital less than perfectly elastic. However, it might still be expected that taxes in New Zealand will largely drive up the pre-tax rates of return that investments are required to generate to provide the returns (net of any New Zealand tax) that non- residents demand on their funds. 2.14 If there are no economic rents and the supply of capital is perfectly elastic, the implication of this model is that, except to the extent that taxes imposed in the SOE are creditable abroad, there should be no source-basis taxes imposed on inbound investment income. 2.15 This model is discussed in Gordon and Hines (2002), who conclude the burden of a source-based tax will be borne entirely by labour or other fixed factors. A labour income tax would reduce the net wage rate, and this would create some labour market distortions. The key point, however, is that these distortions would also be created by a tax on inbound investments that reduces capital stock and makes labour less productive. However, while a source-based tax also distorts investment decisions, a labour income tax does not. Gordon and Hines argue that a strong conclusion about tax policy in an open economy setting is that a source-based tax on capital income should not be used since it is dominated by a labour-income tax (Gordon & Hines, 2002, pp. 1939-1940). 2.16 Thus, in this model, source-based taxes that drive up the cost of capital are always undesirable because they burden New Zealanders more than necessary for the tax amount being collected. 2.17 This analysis provides some arguments against source-based taxes on marginal investment into an SOE like New Zealand. However, there are several balancing considerations that push against abandoning source-based taxes altogether. 19 2.18 SOEs have not abandoned such taxes (although, as will be discussed in chapter 3, many other countries have lower source-based taxes than New Zealand does). In particular: • Economic rents (profits above a global minimum hurdle rate) may sometimes be substantial, and the burden of taxes on these rents may often be borne by foreign investors. • While the supply of capital is likely to be very elastic, it may be less than perfectly elastic, and this may allow some of the burden of taxes to be borne by foreign investors. • Reducing tax on both sunk investments and land would provide windfall gains to existing owners of firms with these assets where the firms had undertaken the investment in the expectation that future returns would be taxed. Replacing this revenue source is likely to impose burdens on New Zealanders. • Foreign tax credits for taxes paid in New Zealand may be available overseas, especially non-resident withholding taxes (NRWT). • When taxes are borne by foreign investors, it allows New Zealanders to pay lower taxes. To give tax cuts where a substantial benefit flows to non- residents may be costly to New Zealanders. • In later chapters we look at some other ways of taxing economic rents. The analysis suggests that if we could find sensible and efficient ways of taxing economic rents and if we could restrict the benefits of source-based tax cuts to new investment only, high source-based taxes on inbound investment would be reducing economic efficiency and there would be a case for reducing these taxes. 2.19 There are, however, also some important fairness issues to consider. Company tax has a dual role in New Zealand. Not only is it the most important source- based tax on the income of non-residents, it is also an important source of revenue and an important way of supporting the progressivity and integrity of personal income taxation. 9 Without a company tax, it would be much easier for those with high income and wealth to earn their income through companies and minimise the tax they paid. Thus, company tax is important in maintaining the integrity and coherence of the personal tax system. 2.20 For example, Inland Revenue data on a set of high-wealth individuals (HWIs) suggests that, of their total taxable income earned both directly and through entities, only 5% is taxed at personal rates, with 12% taxed at the trustee tax rate and 83% taxed at the company rate. A zero company tax rate would create considerable scope for some HWIs to pay little or no tax until profits accumulating in companies are eventually paid to shareholders as dividends. 2.21 A balancing consideration is that lowering the company tax rate would reduce incentives for multinational companies to shift profits away from New Zealand through transfer pricing or thinly capitalising their New Zealand subsidiaries. 9 For the year to June 2021 net corporate tax revenue (inclusive of NRWT) was $18,405 million. This amounted to 16.6 percent of total tax of $110,753 million. See Tax Outturn Data - June 2021, https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/tax-outturn-data/tax-outturn-data-june-2021 Inland Revenue data reveals that roughly one-third of net corporate tax revenue is from foreign controlled companies. 20 2.22 McKeehan and Zodrow (2017) provide a formal model that attempts to trade off the different pros and cons of cutting source-based taxes in an SOE. Different types of capital inflows and different costs of capital 2.23 The simple model outlined above assumed a single type of capital inflow and a single type of investment. In practice, source-based taxes may affect: • both foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) (passive portfolio holdings of New Zealand debt and equity securities by overseas investors) • how firms are financed, for example, with debt or equity, and • the sorts of assets that are acquired (for example, buildings, machinery and equipment, inventories or intangible assets). FDI or FPI 2.24 The simple model outlined above makes no distinction between FDI and FPI. However, as the McLeod Review discusses, there may be some important differences. For example, there could be important productivity spillovers from FDI that may make FDI a more powerful way of promoting productivity and growth than FPI. By itself, this might be a reason for considering lower source- based taxes on FDI than on FPI. At the same time, economic rents are likely to be more of an issue for FDI than for FPI, which might be a reason for having a higher tax rate on FDI than on FPI. Debt and equity 2.25 Costs of capital and EMTRs are likely to be much higher for equity-financed investment into New Zealand than for debt-financed investment because interest is a deductible expense, whereas dividends are not. We see in later chapters that, while New Zealand has relatively high costs of capital and EMTRs compared to most OECD countries, there will be instances where investments are being subsidised by the tax system and EMTRs are negative. The same model that suggests source-based taxes on inbound investment are particularly inefficient would suggest that source-based subsidies to inbound investment are also particularly inefficient – unless the subsidies are justified by important productivity spillovers or perhaps assist in supporting broader measures of wellbeing. The subsidies would benefit domestic factors, such as labour, but in a less efficient way than if these factors were subsidised directly. 2.26 Some measures that may reduce source-based taxes, such as a reduction in the company tax rate, would also reduce differences between equity-financed and debt-financed investment. Other measures, such as accelerated depreciation, would reduce costs of capital and EMTRs without reducing the distortions between these different ways of financing investment. Types of asset 2.27 The OECD benchmarking exercise suggests New Zealand has relatively high costs of capital and EMTRs on average. However, costs of capital and EMTRs do differ between investment in different assets. For some assets, such as investment in intangible assets, there can often be an element of subsidy if investments are partially debt financed. 21 Tax neutrality 2.28 The neutrality of tax settings is an important consideration. Suppose that investment funds can be attracted at a real cost of 3% to New Zealand (net of any New Zealand taxes). Also suppose that a non-neutral tax system means that investment in one type of asset (type 1 assets) initially has a cost of capital or hurdle rate of return of 5% because it faces a relatively heavy tax impost. Investment in a second type of asset (type 2 assets) has a cost of capital of 2% because it faces a much more favourable tax impost. Suppose we change the tax rules so that the cost of capital for both types of assets becomes 3.5%. This will increase investment in type 1 assets and reduce investment in type 2 assets. New Zealand will gain type 1 assets earning pre-tax rates of return of between 5% and 3.5% while losing type 2 assets earning between 2% and 3.5%. This will mean gaining higher-returning investments while losing lower- returning investments. Economic efficiency and the productivity of New Zealand’s capital stock will tend to increase. 2.29 Likewise, greater neutrality in the tax treatment of different forms of capital inflow is also likely to promote economic efficiency and productivity by causing more productive investments to displace those with lower productivity. How important are source-based taxes likely to be in determining FDI and broader levels of capital stock in New Zealand? 2.30 The key benefit of reducing source-based taxes is that this is likely to increase FDI and inbound investment and New Zealand’s capital stock more broadly. 2.31 Important questions are whether additional FDI is likely to generate important productivity spillovers (for example, through the transfer of technology, management skills and broader business knowhow) and how big the effects on FDI and New Zealand’s capital stock are likely to be. In this section, we examine some international evidence on these issues. 2.32 It should be noted that an increase in FDI does not necessarily mean an increase in New Zealand’s capital stock. For example, if a foreign company takes control of an existing New Zealand business, this will be measured as an increase in FDI. There may, however, be no increase in New Zealand’s capital stock. FDI: productivity spillovers and sensitivity to tax 2.33 Many countries have attempted to impose low taxes on inbound FDI in the hope that this will generate positive productivity spillovers for other firms in the same industry or firms in connected industries. If there were substantial productivity spillovers, this could be a reason for going further than the simple model discussed earlier in this chapter suggests and subsidising inbound investment. 2.34 However, there are reasons to require a high burden of proof before cutting taxes or subsidising investment because of potential productivity spillovers or other externalities. Unless there is strong and quantifiable evidence of spillover benefits, a danger exists that providing tax subsidies would encourage lobbying and make it much more difficult to maintain a robust tax revenue base and a neutral and efficient tax system. 2.35 Our reading of the evidence is that, while examples of productivity spillovers will inevitably exist, there is very little clear and consistent evidence of substantial productivity spillovers from FDI into New Zealand. These issues are discussed by Doan, Maré, and Iyer (2015). They find that, while foreign-owned firms make a significant contribution to the New Zealand economy, there is little 22 evidence of substantial positive spillover effects from inbound FDI to local firms’ productivity. There are also questions about whether firms in New Zealand that are acquired by foreign entities have an improved productivity performance. Fabling and Sanderson (2014) discuss this issue. While foreign-acquired firms appear to increase both average wages and gross output relative to firms that remain in domestic ownership, the authors find no evidence that these acquired firms boost their productivity performance. 2.36 Many authors have argued that tax will have little effect on FDI and that a host of other factors, such as the nature of competition in product markets, the cost and availability of intermediate supplies, and proximity to final markets, will be more important. For example, Markusen (1995) argues that any effects of taxes on FDI will be unnoticeable in practice. 2.37 However, there is evidence that taxes may have important effects on levels of FDI and that the sensitivity of FDI to tax may have been growing over time. This literature is discussed in Hines (1999). De Mooij and Ederveen (2003) (in a widely cited review of the literature) found a median semi-elasticity of -3.3 (meaning that a 1% point cut in the company tax rate of the host country – where the income is sourced from – leads to a 3.3% increase in FDI). Moreover, the authors find evidence that this elasticity has been increasing over time, and that bigger effects are found if tax effects are measured in terms of effective tax rates (such as the OECD EMTR analysis reported in this LTIB) rather than statutory tax rates. 2.38 There is an open question whether these international studies are likely to be relevant to an economy like New Zealand, which is very distant from other markets. It is reasonable to suspect that elasticities may be much higher for, say, small landlocked countries in Europe, where companies can respond to taxes and locate a production centre to supply much the same market in one of several countries other than the country where final sales of goods or services will take place. 2.39 New Zealand observed limited growth in FDI when the company tax rate was cut in 2008 and 2011 (see pp. 8-9 of Inland Revenue and Treasury (2016) New Zealand taxation framework for inbound investment). However, evidence presented in appendix 5 of the Technical appendices suggests that EMTRs increased, rather than decreased, in 2011 as a result of other tax changes, including changes to depreciation rates. Also, the eyeballing of the data in the Inland Revenue and Treasury paper may be misleading if tax changes take a long time to have an effect. Freebairn (2015) reports studies suggesting that it may take seven to ten years for half of the long-run response to take place. Other confounding things may be happening at the same time (including a Global Financial Crisis and other tax measures, such as reductions in depreciation deductions and a tightening of thin capitalisation rules). As far as we are aware, no study of the sensitivity of FDI in New Zealand to tax rates has been conducted. 23 Capital stock: sensitivity to tax 2.40 An alternative is to look at the responsiveness of capital stock to tax parameters. Hassett and Hubbard (2002) suggest that studies have tended to find increasing elasticities through time, although this appears to be the result of more robust ways of estimating elasticities rather than because the elasticities themselves are changing through time. The authors suggest elasticities of capital stock with respect to user costs are in the range of -0. 5 to -1.0. Nolan and Nolan (2021) discuss two models for New Zealand. One provides an estimate of around -0.7, which is consistent with previous work for New Zealand by Szeto and Ryan (2009). This is within the range suggested by Hassett and Hubbard. A second model has a higher elasticity of -1.42. There has been insufficient modelling in New Zealand for us to have a very robust set of estimates. 24 CHAPTER 3 Benchmarking New Zealand’s costs of capital and EMTRs against those of other OECD countries • OECD analysis suggests that New Zealand has relatively high costs of capital and EMTRs for buildings, tangibles and inventories. • New Zealand is likely to have higher hurdle rates of return than in many other countries before firms will find it profitable to invest. • Other things equal, this is likely to reduce investment into New Zealand and New Zealand’s capital stock. Introduction 3.1 The aim of this chapter is to examine how New Zealand’s company tax rate and tax depreciation rules are likely to compare to those in other OECD countries. To do this we make use of a model that has been developed by the OECD. 3.2 The OECD examines how tax provisions can affect incentives to invest by considering their impact on costs of capital, effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) and effective average tax rates (EATRs) for a set of assets. This can be useful in benchmarking New Zealand’s tax rules against those in other countries and for examining whether New Zealand is an outlier in the way that it taxes investment. Our focus is on the cost of capital and the closely related EMTR measure. 3.3 The OECD data is provided on the OECD website. 10 The model that underlies these results is discussed in Hanappi (2018). 3.4 This chapter explains key assumptions underlying the OECD modelling and reports on how New Zealand compares to other OECD countries in the OECD estimates. 3.5 The OECD’s model focuses on investment by companies. It only examines the effects of the company tax rate, depreciation rates and the tax treatment of inventories on costs of capital and EMTRs. It does not consider withholding taxes, such as New Zealand’s non-resident withholding tax on interest or its approved issuer levy, or the likely impact of thin capitalisation provisions. It makes some assumptions about debt levels and macroeconomic parameters for its benchmarking exercise. 3.6 The OECD modelling is helpful in providing a first cut analysis of how taxes are likely to compare across OECD countries. However, quite a bit is omitted from this analysis and some of the assumptions being used may not be the most appropriate for New Zealand. We will consider possible extensions to the model and modify some of the parameter values when examining costs of capital and EMTRs for New Zealand in chapter 4. 10 OECD. OECD.Stat. Public Sector, Taxation and Market Regulation / Taxation / Corporate Tax Statistics / Effective Tax Rates. https://stats.oecd.org/ 25 3.7 The OECD’s analysis suggests that New Zealand has relatively high levels of taxation on inbound investment but relatively neutral taxes across different types of investment. The OECD modelling and some key assumptions 3.8 The OECD examines how tax rules can affect the cost of capital. As was discussed in chapter 2, the cost of capital is the minimum real pre-tax rate of return needed for an investment to be profitable on an after-tax basis, or the hurdle rate of return. For investments that just meet their cost of capital, the expected present value of future revenues will exactly match the cost of the investment. The investment is sometimes said to be marginal (that is, break even) on an after-tax basis. 3.9 New Zealand and other countries import capital from abroad. For non-residents to be willing to invest, they must expect to be able to earn as good risk-adjusted returns from investment in New Zealand as they could obtain from investing in other countries. A common assumption (and one that the OECD adopts) is that non-residents are the marginal equity investors into domestic companies. 11 This is likely to be a reasonable first approximation for analysing many sectors of the New Zealand economy. This model may not, however, be relevant for sectors where foreign investment is a negligible fraction of total investment. This is discussed further in appendix 1 in the Technical appendices. 3.10 Suppose that investment is financed by non-resident shareholders who require a fixed rate of return (say, 3%) on their capital that is equal to the return they can obtain from investing in other countries. To make things as simple as possible, assume there is no inflation, so this is the real and nominal rate of return that foreign shareholders demand. Also suppose initially that investment is fully equity financed and that all economic income being generated is fully taxed. 12 If the company tax rate were 0%, the cost of capital would be 3%. This would be the pre- and post-tax rate of return needed to provide non- residents with the return they demand on a marginal investment. With a company tax rate of 25%, the cost of capital would increase to 4%. After this pre-tax rate of return is taxed at the company tax rate, non-resident shareholders would be left with the 3% after-tax return on their capital that they demand. If the company tax rate were increased to 40%, the cost of capital would increase to 5% to ensure non-resident shareholders end up with the after-tax rate of return they demand. 3.11 In this simple model, the net-of -company-tax rate of return is fixed at 3%. Changes to the company tax rate will affect the hurdle rate of return or cost of capital. In a more complex model, depreciation provisions, real interest rates, inflation and levels of debt financing will also affect the cost of capital. 3.12 The OECD’s model takes these other factors into account under a set of possible macroeconomic assumptions. They examine the following two cases: 11 Support for this approach in the Australian context is provided by Murphy, C. (2018). Murphy provides an extensive review of academic literature on this issue. For a contrary approach, see Swan, P. (2019). Swan provides evidence suggesting marginal investment is supplied by residents who can make use of imputation credits and who can borrow on international capital markets to finance investment. 12 To understand the example, it is easiest to consider investment in an asset that maintains its value through time where no depreciation deductions are allowed. For assets that fall in value over time, economic income would be fully taxed if depreciation deductions mirrored economic depreciation (that is, the fall in the market value of assets). 26 • real interest rates and inflation rates that are country specific, and • a common real interest rate and inflation assumption for all countries. 3.13 We work with the second of these two cases because this focuses on the impact of tax rules (rather than macroeconomic settings) in affecting incentives to invest in different countries. 3.14 The OECD assumes that the real interest rate is 3% per annum and the inflation rate is 1% per annum. Foreign shareholders demand a 3% real return on the capital they invest into New Zealand and other economies. The real interest rate is also 3%. With 1% inflation, this means a 4.03% nominal interest rate. 13 Withholding taxes on interest and dividends are ignored in the OECD analysis. 3.15 A key assumption (as in the example outlined above) is that non-residents are the marginal investors and the return on an investment net of New Zealand taxes needs to generate these investors’ required rate of return. Competition is assumed to make this the hurdle rate of return on all investment. This means that taxes on inbound investment are ultimately going to determine costs of capital in New Zealand. 3.16 The cost of capital will also be affected by the proportion of investment that is equity financed and the proportion that is debt financed. This is because interest payments are tax deductible, whereas dividend payments are not. The OECD assumes that 35% of marginal investment is financed by debt and 65% by foreign equity. It is also assumed that all firms are in a taxpaying position. About 34% of companies had a loss that they carried forward from the 2019/20 to the 2020/21 year. The OECD modelling does not consider thin capitalisation restrictions, which may limit interest deductions in some circumstances. Of course, it could be argued that ignoring thin capitalisation restrictions is consistent with the assumption that firms are only 35% debt financed. In New Zealand, firms that are less than 60% debt financed are not subject to any thin capitalisation restrictions. 3.17 The estimates of costs of capital will also be influenced by the tax rules for inventory (or trading stock) and rates of depreciation that are allowed for tax purposes, as well as economic depreciation rates. Economic depreciation is the rate at which assets would fall in market value if there were no inflation. Many countries attempt to have tax depreciation rates as close to economic depreciation as feasible. However, tax depreciation rates are sometimes designed to be faster than economic depreciation rates to provide incentives for investment. 3.18 The OECD’s modelling results are only available for the last four years (2017– 2020) and for four aggregated sets of assets (buildings, inventories, acquired intangibles and a category of asset described as ‘tangibles’, which includes tangible assets that are not buildings – mainly machinery and equipment). 3.19 The OECD model calculates the real pre-tax rate of return that is necessary to make investments break even given the company tax rates and depreciation rates applying in different OECD countries. This is done by finding the rate of 13 The OECD refers to this as the ‘low interest and inflation rates’ option, but it is now the only standardised interest rate and inflation option they report. Previously, they considered a real interest rate of 5% and an inflation rate of 2% as well. Note that the nominal interest rate is (1 )irππ= ++ where r is the real interest rate and π is the inflation rate. To be able to purchase 3% more real goods and services, we need a nominal interest rate of 4.03% because 1.03 × 1.01 = 1.0403. 27 return required to make the present value of the revenues from an investment equal to the cost. A simple version of the OECD model is outlined in appendix 1 in the Technical appendices. 14 3.20 It should be noted that any economic model is no more than a partial insight. In particular, the OECD model treats the tax rules as certain and assumed to continue forever. Macroeconomic variables , such as interest rates and inflation rates, are also assumed to remain constant in the future. All of this seems reasonable when considering the long-run effects of tax settings but may ignore some important other considerations. Submitters have pointed out that if tax rules are uncertain and subject to chopping and changing, and especially if policy frameworks are unclear, this can negatively impact on investment in ways that are not captured in formal economic models. Complexity of legislation and compliance costs may also have a negative impact on investment, especially if these cause foreign investors to question whether it is worth finding out if investing into New Zealand would be a good idea. If different rules apply to different types of firms, this can add to the complexity. 3.21 In the modelling, it is assumed that investment is undertaken by a company that holds the investment permanently. This ignores one aspect of New Zealand’s tax system, namely the absence of a general tax on capital gains, which may tend to promote investment here relative to investment in other countries. In many other countries, capital gains will normally be subject to some level of tax when assets are sold, whereas this is not the case in New Zealand. Where firms invest with the intention of generating capital gains, this analysis may make New Zealand look like it is a relatively higher tax country than is true in practice. The OECD estimates of costs of capital and EMTRs 3.22 OECD estimates of costs of capital or hurdle rates of return allow New Zealand’s performance to be benchmarked against the other 37 OECD countries. Results are provided in table 3.1 for 2020, the latest year for which data is available. 14 Our model provides identical cost of capital estimates to the OECD model for the case that underlies the OECD’s estimates of costs of capital reported on their website when non-residents are marginal investors in companies. The OECD model is more flexible and can be extended to consider other marginal investors as well, but this comes with additional complexity. 28 Table 3.1: Estimated costs of capital in 2020 Country Buildings Inventories Acquired intangibles Tangible assets Cost of capital Rank Cost of capital Rank Cost of capital Rank Cost of capital Rank Australia 3.4 14 3.9 7 4.0 9 3.7 6 Austria 3.5 12 3.5 25 3.9 12 3.4 12 Belgium 2.3 37 2.7 38 3.3 26 2.6 36 Canada 3.2 26 3.9 6 3.4 24 3.1 25 Chile 3.1 30 4.0 5 18.5 2 2.9 31 Colombia 3.7 5 4.0 4 4.1 8 3.7 5 Costa Rica 3.7 4 4.1 2 21.0 1 3.6 8 Czech Republic 3.5 8 3.5 27 4.0 11 3.2 23 Denmark 3.3 21 3.7 13 3.1 31 3.5 9 Estonia 3.0 31 3.0 33 3.0 33 3.0 29 Finland 3.2 25 3.6 19 4.7 5 3.2 22 France 3.3 19 4.2 1 3.7 17 3.4 15 Germany 3.6 6 3.7 16 3.8 13 3.9 3 Greece 3.3 18 3.7 17 4.1 7 3.7 7 Hungary 3.3 22 3.3 31 3.1 29 3.0 28 Iceland 3.2 24 3.6 18 3.8 14 3.4 13 Ireland 3.1 28 3.4 30 3.8 15 3.3 19 Israel 3.3 20 3.8 11 3.6 22 3.5 10 Italy 2.6 36 2.8 37 2.9 36 1.3 38 Japan 3.7 3 3.9 9 5.0 4 4.1 1 Korea 3.5 13 3.8 10 4.3 6 3.2 21 Latvia 3.0 32 3.0 34 3.0 34 3.0 30 Lithuania 2.9 33 3.5 28 3.3 25 3.2 24 Luxembourg 3.3 17 3.5 26 3.6 21 3.7 4 Mexico 3.1 29 3.9 8 7.2 3 3.1 27 Netherlands 4.0 2 3.5 24 3.7 16 3.3 17 New Zealand 4.1 1 4.0 3 3.7 18 3.9 2 Norway 3.5 9 3.7 12 3.1 30 3.5 11 Poland 2.8 34 2.8 36 3.2 28 2.6 35 Portugal 2.1 38 3.0 35 2.7 37 2.2 37 Slovak Republic 3.2 27 3.6 22 3.4 23 3.4 14 Slovenia 3.3 15 3.6 20 3.3 27 3.1 26 Spain 3.5 10 3.7 15 3.6 20 3.4 16 Sweden 3.3 23 3.7 14 4.0 10 3.3 18 Switzerland 3.5 11 3.6 21 3.7 19 3.3 20 Turkey 2.6 35 3.2 32 2.9 35 2.9 33 United Kingdom 3.3 16 3.4 29 3.1 32 2.9 32 United States 3.6 7 3.6 23 2.6 38 2.6 34 Average 3.3 3.6 4.5 3.2 29 3.23 It is helpful to consider what the results are telling us. The underlying assumption is of a 3% real interest rate demanded by non-resident investors. Take buildings, for example. The OECD analysis suggests that the hurdle rate of return for investment in buildings (mainly commercial and industrial buildings) is 3.4% in Australia. This means that tax is resulting in a higher hurdle rate of return than would be the case if investment were untaxed (when the cost of capital would be 3%). This is unsurprising. One would normally expect that taxes would raise hurdle rates of return. 3.24 To the right of the cost of capital estimate for Australia, there is a rank measure of 14. This means that Australia has the 14 th highest cost of capital for buildings under the OECD estimates. 3.25 Other things being equal, higher costs of capital will tend to reduce investment and capital stock because fewer investments will generate the required rate of return. The OECD data suggests that New Zealand has relatively high costs of capital. It has the highest for buildings, third highest for inventories, 18 th highest for acquired intangibles, and second highest for ‘tangible assets’ (meaning non-building tangible assets). 3.26 Of the various estimates, the figures for buildings and for inventories are likely to be most accurate. The figures for tangible assets are attempting to make an estimate for a large group of different non-building tangible assets that can have different tax depreciation rates and different economic depreciation rates. It can be very difficult to aggregate these into a single average cost of capital. 3.27 A smaller group of assets, with less variety in economic and tax depreciation rates, is grouped under buildings. Also, costs of capital for inventories can be calculated reasonably simply. 3.28 The variability of costs of capital for acquired intangibles is surprising and may be a reason for treating results for these assets with some caution. Very high figures for Chile and Costa Rica are pushing up the average cost of capital estimate significantly. It should be noted that purchased intangibles are likely to comprise a relatively small part of New Zealand’s capital stock. The main purchased intangible may be software. As we discuss in appendix 5 of our Technical appendices, this is only 3.7% of the net capital stock of ‘market entities’ whose investment decisions are likely to be directly impacted by the tax settings we are analysing in this LTIB. 3.29 These estimates are for a few highly aggregated assets only. 3.30 Little difference exists between New Zealand’s costs of capital for the three main types of business investment included in the data: buildings, inventory and tangible assets. Thus, New Zealand’s tax settings appear to be reasonably neutral across these three different aggregate assets. In later chapters, we extend the analysis to consider other forms of investment, including investment in assets where capital expenditure can be immediately written off (or expensed). This will include most investment in self-created intangibles. Looking at a broader set of assets reveals some biases that can be hidden in the OECD’s highly aggregated analysis. 3.31 The OECD data only goes back to 2017. The most major change for New Zealand during the period from 2017 to the present was the restoration of building depreciation for commercial and industrial property in 2020. Before that, in 2019, the OECD estimated that New Zealand had a significantly higher cost of capital for buildings of 4.9%. The Netherlands was in second place with a cost of capital of 4.0%. This suggested that, while taxes were pushing the hurdle rate of return for buildings up from 3.0% to a maximum of 4.0% in other OECD countries, they were pushing that rate up to 4.9% in New Zealand. This 30 suggests that a significant number of investments that would have been profitable in other countries were not profitable in New Zealand. In addition, the cost of capital for investment in commercial and industrial buildings was very high relative to other forms of investment. This was likely to be distorting decisions about investment in different assets. 3.32 Thus, the 2020 change appears to have reduced the cost of capital for the least favourably taxed form of business investment (commercial and industrial buildings) and made costs of capital more neutral. However, New Zealand’s costs of capital still appear to be quite high relative to other countries. 3.33 The OECD also provides information on effective marginal tax rate or EMTRs. The ()/EMTRp rp= − where p is the pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment and r is the cost of funds to the economy. For example, as discussed earlier, the cost of capital for investment in buildings in Australia was 3.4% and the cost of funds was 3.0%. This results in an EMTR of 11.8%, that is, (3.4%–3.0%)/3.4%. Clearly there is a very close relationship between the cost of capital and EMTR measures. The higher the cost of capital, the higher will be the EMTR. A higher cost of capital of, say, 3.5% would imply an EMTR of 14.2%, that is, (3.5%-3.0%)/3.5%. 3.34 The OECD provides estimates of average EMTRs for the 38 OECD countries across their four categories of asset. The OECD estimates that if the real interest rate is 3% and inflation is 1%, these average EMTRs vary from 33.4% for Costa Rica to -30.4% in Italy. New Zealand has an average EMTR of 20.1%, which is 4 th highest, and Australia has an average EMTR of 14.9%, which is 10 th highest. However, these estimates are unweighted averages across the four types of assets. This means that equal weighting is being given to each of the four categories of asset. In principle, it would be preferable to use a weighted average EMTR, reflecting the relative sizes of the four categories of asset in the asset mix, but data limitations may make this impractical for a cross-country benchmarking study. 3.35 In their 2022 Economic Survey of New Zealand, the OECD has noted that New Zealand’s statutory company tax rate and its average level of EMTRs were high relative to other OECD countries and to other small, advanced economies. Data is provided in figure 3.1. 15 15 OECD. (2022). OECD Economic Surveys: New Zealand 2022.

Small advanced economies are defined as the OECD countries with populations above 1 million and below 20 million people, and with a per capita income above US $30,000. Source: OECD Tax Database 3.36 It might be noted that while New Zealand has relatively high EMTRs, there are some countries that are estimated to have negative EMTRs. The models discussed in chapter 2 would support reducing EMTRs to zero but not going further and driving them negative unless there are externalities or other broader benefits from inbound investment. 3.37 Chapter 4 explores the effects of changing some of the assumptions. We extend the modelling by: • considering possible changes to macroeconomic assumptions and assumptions on gearing that are likely to be more relevant for New Zealand • considering some factors missing from the OECD analysis, such as non- resident withholding tax on interest and New Zealand’s approved issuer levy -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 BEL DNK NOR IRL CHE ISR AUT SWE NDL FIN NZL ITA PRT POL TUR USA EST LVA GBR HUN LTU CAN SVN SVK FRA ESP LUX ISL CZE KOR AUS DEU GRC MEX COL CHL JPN CRI Panel B.

They will tend to favour investment in assets that have lower rates of economic depreciation relative to assets with higher rates of economic depreciation. New Zealand’s tax settings are likely to contain these biases. • We find evidence of significant biases between different tangible assets, which is a fact not apparent in the OECD’s estimate of an average cost of capital for these assets. • While we saw in chapter 3 that New Zealand’s costs of capital and EMTRs are often high relative to other countries, at times EMTRs will be negative and costs of capital will be less than the cost to New Zealand of importing capital. In these cases, investment is effectively being subsidised by the tax system. • Inflation tends to increase costs of capital and EMTRs for assets that are already relatively heavily taxed and to reduce costs of capital and EMTRs for assets that are already lightly taxed. These inflation biases become larger when real interest rates are low. • Accounting for NRWT and AIL will add to costs of capital and EMTRs slightly. NRWT will also introduce some variability in tax imposts between companies that are foreign controlled and those that are not, although the biases between the two seem quite small relative to the tax biases between different types of asset. • In the analysis in this draft LTIB, we mainly focus on the case that underpins the OECD model where non-residents are marginal shareholders in companies operating in New Zealand. It is this which leads to high estimated EMTRs. If, instead, New Zealanders are marginal shareholders, it becomes much more likely that EMTRs will be negative. Introduction 4.1 The OECD benchmarking exercise discussed in chapter 3 rested on assumptions the OECD has made and applied to all OECD countries. In appendix 2 of our Technical appendices, we modify and extend the analysis in various ways. In this chapter, we provide a shorter discussion of some of the main results. 4.2 We consider the implications of different levels of debt, inflation and real interest rates. We also allow for investment in a broader set of assets. We extend the OECD model to consider the approved issuer levy (AIL) and non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest. We consider biases that can arise between companies that are foreign controlled and those that are not. We also briefly discuss costs of capital and EMTRs for firms where non-residents may not be marginal shareholders. 4.3 We consider the following set of assets: • commercial and industrial buildings 34 • plant, machinery and equipment that is assumed to have a variety of economic and tax depreciation rates • a zero-depreciation asset that is assumed to neither appreciate nor depreciate in real terms • inventories • appreciating assets, and • assets for which capital expenditure can be deducted immediately (or expensed). 4.4 Commercial and industrial buildings are assumed to have an economic depreciation rate of 2.69%, which is an OECD estimate of a weighted average of economic depreciation rates across these two types of buildings. New Zealand’s tax depreciation rates for plant, machinery and equipment (PME) are set to reflect how assets fall in value. 16 However, inflation has not been taken into account when setting these depreciation rates. This allows us to examine biases that would arise if New Zealand were perfectly successful in matching tax depreciation rates with economic depreciation rates. In practice, biases are likely to be larger than we identify because tax depreciation rates will at best be an approximation to economic depreciation rates. 4.5 An example, of a zero-depreciation asset might be land if land were not expected to either increase or decrease in real value. If land were expected to increase in real value, it might be covered in the appreciating assets category. As in the OECD analysis, we allow for trading stock or inventories. 4.6 We also consider investments in capital assets that can be immediately written off (or ‘expensed’). This includes investment in planting and growing a forest, mining exploration expenditure, and repairs and maintenance expenditure where this provides ongoing benefits for many years. It also includes investment by a firm in building up intangible assets if the costs of the investment can be deducted immediately, for example, as salaries and wages. Capital expenditure on many intangible assets that are created by a firm itself can be expensed, including building up good information and data, establishing reputation and customer goodwill. Companies with foreign marginal shareholders: no AIL and no NRWT 4.7 Table 4.1 shows costs of capital assuming a real interest rate of 3.0% for our set of assets under different assumptions about inflation and debt levels. As has been discussed, the OECD assumes a real interest rate of 3.0%, inflation of 1% and a debt level of 35%. However, an inflation rate of 2% is in the middle of the Reserve Bank’s target range and evidence present in appendix 2 of our Technical appendices is that average levels of debt for both foreign-controlled and NZX firms is about 43%, ignoring banks. The row labelled d denotes the economic rate of depreciation used and the row d\* denotes the tax depreciation rate allowed. 16 See, for example, the discussion in Inland Revenue and Treasury.

If there is no debt, EMTRs vary, falling from 39.1% for very short-lived PME and inventories to 0.0% with expensing. No investments are subsidised, and there is often a substantial positive EMTR. If there is no debt and capital expenditure can be expensed, the cost of capital will be 3.0% and equal to the cost of funds to the economy. The EMTR will be zero. • However, with full debt finance and 2% inflation, EMTRs are never greater than zero. Required rates of return for marginal investments would not exceed, and would often be lower than, the cost of funds to the economy. They fall from 0.0% for very short-lived PME and inventories to -86.2% with expensing. • At current average debt levels of around 43%, there is normally a positive EMTR and EMTRs can often be over 20%. • Negative EMTRs are possible for some assets. This is true for assets that depreciate slowly, for assets that appreciate and for assets that can be expensed, especially if there are high levels of debt. • When there is no inflation, EMTRs would be constant over a large set of different types of asset for any given level of debt. For example, with a debt level of 43%, EMTRs for many assets would be 18.1%. This is a consequence of assuming that economic depreciation is deductible for many classes of assets. The EMTR would be slightly higher for commercial and industrial buildings if, as assumed, the tax depreciation rate is slightly lower than the economic depreciation rate. The EMTR would be lower for preferentially taxed appreciating assets or assets where capital expenditure can be expensed. • An inflation rate of 2% can increase EMTRs on short-lived assets and inventories significantly (from the company tax rate of 28.0% to 39.1%). Conversely, when there is 100% debt finance, 2% inflation can increase 36 tax subsidies significantly. For example, with expensing the EMTR falls from -38.9% to -86.2%. 17 4.9 We have noted that, with a world real interest rate of 3%, a small level of inflation of 2% per annum can add to investment biases significantly. As discussed in appendix 3 of the Technical appendices, there is some uncertainty about the most appropriate real interest rate to use. The OECD considers a real interest rate of 3% is being demanded by foreign shareholders and lenders. However, other studies have used higher real interest rate assumptions and, until this year, the OECD also had a variant where a real interest rate of 5% was assumed. 4.10 Table 4.2 compares EMTRs for a company that is 43% debt financed, using a 3% real interest rate and a 5% real interest rate. Table 4.2: EMTRs, debt= 43%, different values of r and inflation rates Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% r = 3% Inflation = 2% 20.4% 26.8% 26.3% 22.8% 19.2% 16.3% 10.1% 26.8% -1.8% -24.9% Inflation = 0% 21.4% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 8.4% -13.7% r = 5% Inflation = 2% 19.1% 23.6% 23.1% 20.4% 18.0% 16.3% 13.5% 23.6% 7.3% -20.1% Inflation = 0% 20.5% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 12.6% -13.7% 4.11 We draw attention to the following points: • If there were no inflation and tax depreciation rates accurately measured economic depreciation, EMTRs would be the same for PME with different rates of economic depreciation, zero-depreciation assets and inventories. This would apply whether the world interest rate was 3% or 5%. • With either real interest rate, inflation creates a tax bias that pushes up EMTRs for short-lived PME and inventories. With expensing, it makes the negative EMTRs more negative. • However, inflation is considerably less distorting with a higher real interest rate assumption. With a real interest rate of 3%, inflation raises the EMTR for short-lived PME and inventories from 18.1% to 26.8%, while lowering the EMTR for a zero-depreciation asset from 18.1% to 10.1%. By contrast, with a 5% real interest rate, inflation only increases the EMTR for short-lived PMEs and inventories from 18.1% to 23.6% and only reduces the EMTR for zero-depreciation assets from 18.1% to 13.5%. Inflation biases on costs of capital and EMTRs get large when the inflation rate is large relative to the real interest rate. 17 Appendix 4 of the Technical appendices provides a simple cash-flow example explaining how these negative EMTRs can arise. 37 Non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest and the approved issuer levy (AIL) 4.12 The OECD analysis does not take account of NRWT on interest or AIL. Appendix 2 in the Technical appendices extends the analysis to take account of these two taxes/levies. Here we draw out some key points from the fuller discussion in the appendix. We begin by discussing NRWT on interest and the AIL and summarise the effects of these taxes/levies on the real interest rates that firms will need to pay. We then consider how these changes in interest rates can impact on costs of capital and EMTRs. To keep the extent of the discussion manageable, we do not consider NRWT on dividends or New Zealand’s foreign investor tax credit. Including these could sometimes lead to somewhat lower costs of capital than we analyse, but this is left for further work. NRWT, AIL and real interest rates 4.13 NRWT is withheld at a rate of 10% for countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement and 15% for other countries. Most often it will be withheld at a rate of 10%, and we use this rate in our analysis. Where debt is from a related party (for example, a foreign parent company), NRWT must be withheld. However, an alternative exists when debt is from third parties. This alternative is for the borrowing firms to pay AIL at a rate of 2% in lieu of NRWT. 4.14 A difference between the two types of taxes is that NRWT may give rise to tax credits overseas that reduce the amount of tax overseas lenders must pay on their interest income from New Zealand. A second difference, which becomes important when considering the impacts of these taxes/levies on costs of capital, is that AIL is deductible for income tax purposes while NRWT is not. 4.15 Interest paid to third parties is most often subject to AIL rather than NRWT, and we assume this is the case in our analysis. We assume that all related- party loans from abroad are subject to NRWT at a rate of 10%, and all third- party loans from abroad are subject to AIL. 4.16 Third-party lenders are expected to require an after-tax return that provides them with the real return they could obtain from investing their money elsewhere. Suppose that in the absence of NRWT and AIL non-residents would require a 3% real interest rate for investing into New Zealand. Now consider the impact of introducing AIL. Also assume that the inflation rate is 2%. AIL is levied on the full nominal interest rate and this would raise the real interest rate to approximately 3.10%. 18 This will tend to raise costs of capital and EMTRs slightly for all firms that are partly debt financed. 4.17 For companies with marginal non-resident shareholders that are not foreign controlled, AIL is the only additional tax to consider. Foreign-controlled companies that are partly financed by related-party debt will also be affected by NRWT. At one extreme, if NRWT is fully creditable abroad, there should be no increase in the real interest rate demanded on related-party lending. If, on the other hand, NRWT is not creditable abroad, this 10% tax on nominal interest would be expected to increase the real interest rate that must be paid. If the real interest rate demanded net of any NRWT is 3%, t he real interest rate on related-party lending would be expected to rise to 3.55%. 19 18 More precisely, with inflation at rate π , the domestic real interest rate will rise to ππ−+ + −/ (1)/ ((1)(1)) aaa rttt . 19 The real interest rate rises to / (1 )/ ((1 )(1 )) NNN rt ttππ−+ + − where N t is the rate of NRWT. 38 4.18 Data on firms from whom Inland Revenue collects information as part of its International Questionnaire (IQ firms) reveals that 37.3% of interest-bearing debt acquired by these firms was from related parties. In our analysis, we assume that this fraction of debt is subject to a 10% NRWT for foreign- controlled companies with the remaining debt being subject to AIL. We consider both the possibility that NRWT is creditable and the possibility that NRWT is not creditable for these firms. NRWT, AIL and impacts on costs of capital 4.19 We now have two separate ways in which taxes may be impacting on costs of capital: • by depreciation rates and company tax rates affecting hurdle rates of return at a given set of real interest rates in New Zealand, and • by NRWT on interest and AIL affecting real interest rates themselves. 4.20 Estimated effects on costs of capital are examined in table 4.3 assuming a world real interest rate of 3% and 2% inflation. EMTRs can become somewhat difficult to interpret when we start to take account of creditable taxes such as NRWT. Levying a fully creditable tax may increase the EMTR because it reduces the cost of borrowing to New Zealand even if it has no impact on costs of capital and incentives to invest in New Zealand. For this reason, we focus on costs of capital rather than EMTRs. Table 4.3: Costs of capital, r = 3%, inflation = 2%, debt = 43%, AIL = 2% and NRWT = 10% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital No AIL or NRWT All companies 3.77% 4.10% 4.07% 3.89% 3.71% 3.58% 3.34% 4.10% 2.95% 2.40% AIL and NRWT Domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders 3.81% 4.14% 4.11% 3.93% 3.76% 3.63% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% AIL and NRWT - Foreign-controlled companies, NRWT creditable 3.80% 4.13% 4.10% 3.91% 3.74% 3.61% 3.36% 4.13% 2.98% 2.42% AIL and NRWT - Foreign-controlled companies , NRWT not creditable 3.92% 4.25% 4.22% 4.03% 3.86% 3.73% 3.49% 4.25% 3.10% 2.51% 4.21 We draw attention to the following points illustrated by table 4.3: • By comparing the third and fourth rows, we see that AIL pushes up costs of capital but only by very small amounts for domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders that are not foreign controlled. • By comparing the fourth and fifth rows, we see that the combination of AIL and NRWT has an even smaller effect on pushing up costs of capital 39 for foreign-controlled companies that can claim credits for NRWT. Unlike AIL, NRWT is not increasing the cost of capital for these companies. • By comparing the fourth and sixth rows, we see that the combination of AIL and NRWT has a bigger effect on costs of capital for foreign-controlled companies that cannot make use of credits for NRWT. • Differences in costs of capital going down the rows seem small relative to differences in costs of capital going across the rows. This suggests that tax biases between these different types of company are likely to be small relative to tax biases between different types of asset. SMEs where there may be little or no shareholding by non-residents 4.22 Appendix 2 of the Technical appendices also considers the possibility of an SME where non-residents are not marginal shareholders. Instead, the firm is owned by residents who can borrow or lend at a given real interest rate. In appendix 2 we consider two sub-variants. In the first, it is assumed that taxable profits are fully distributed to domestic residents. In the second, it is assumed that profits are retained in the company. 4.23 Here we report only the results for the full distribution case. It is assumed that domestic residents are taxed at a marginal tax rate of 33%, that the world real interest rate is either 3% or 5% and that there is 2% inflation. AIL pushes up the domestic real interest rate to 3.10% or 5.14% respectively. 4.24 Table 4.4 provides estimates of costs of capital and EMTRs. Table 4.4: Costs of capital and EMTRs for domestic SMEs - full distribution m = 33%, inflation = 2.0%, AIL = 2% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital r = 5% 4.71% 5.14% 5.10% 4.86% 4.63% 4.47% 4.18% 5.14% 3.68% 2.80% r = 3% 2.72% 3.10% 3.07% 2.88% 2.67% 2.50% 2.14% 3.10% 1.64% 1.43% EMTRs r = 5% -6.1% 2.8% 1.9% -2.9% -7.9% -11.8% -19.7% 2.8% -35.7% -78.7% r = 3% -10.4% 3.3% 2.3% -4.2% -12.3% -19.9% -40.5% 3.3% -82.6% -109.7% 4.25 We draw attention to the following points: • There will be small positive EMTRs for very short-lived PME and inventories, but significantly negative EMTRs for long-lived PME, zero- depreciating assets, appreciating assets and assets where capital expenditure can be expensed. • Changes in EMTRs across the different asset types are qualitatively similar to those provided by the OECD model. EMTRs are highest for inventory and PME with fast economic depreciation rates and lowest for assets where capital expenditure can be expensed. 40 • Unlike the OECD model, there are no large positive EMTRs. Not only is interest expense deductible, the opportunity cost of owners’ own funds will also reflect an after-tax interest rate. This is because interest income would be taxable if the owners of a business earned interest rather than investing their money in a business. 41 CHAPTER 5 Tax changes to reduce New Zealand’s costs of capital and EMTRs and make them more neutral • OECD analysis suggests that NZ has relatively high taxes on inbound investment. • There are important trade-offs between competing objectives to consider when examining if, or how, to reduce taxes on inbound investment. • This chapter introduces some possible reform options that will be considered in more detail in later chapters and considers if, and how, they are likely to impact upon these competing objectives. Costs and benefits of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs 5.1 In chapter 2, we discussed a framework for evaluating taxes on inbound investment in a small open economy. There are trade-offs to consider when deciding on tax settings for inbound investment. 5.2 On the one hand, tax can discourage marginal inbound investment, and this can lower a country’s capital stock and reduce economic performance. The economic incidence of the tax is likely to be borne by domestic residents in a way that is more costly to them than if the same amount of revenue were raised by taxing the incomes of domestic residents directly. 5.3 On the other hand, we have discussed several reasons for levying source-based taxes. Source-based taxes tax location-specific rents (returns that are better than marginal) on investments that non-residents will want to make in New Zealand regardless of whether they are taxed. Given that New Zealand provides the infrastructure that firms require to generate these rents in New Zealand, there is a reasonable fairness case for New Zealand having a right to levy tax on these rents. 5.4 Options that reduce taxes on sunk investments (investments made in the past) would provide a windfall benefit to those that invested in the past in the expectation of the current company tax rate continuing. The lost revenue stream is likely to be costly to New Zealand, especially when the companies are owned by non-residents. Replacement taxes are likely to fall on New Zealanders. 5.5 Other issues may also be critical. One is the importance that is placed on the company tax base as a source of raising revenue. In its Long-Term Insights Briefing and Long-Term Fiscal Position He Tirohanga Mokopuna 2021, the Treasury has identified long-term fiscal pressures from an ageing population and rising healthcare demand. Moreover, responding to COVID-19 has been fiscally costly. A cut in company tax revenue would create pressure for increases in other taxes or cuts in government spending. Increases in taxes are always controversial. Governments may consider that there is little scope to make changes which lead to a substantial reduction in company tax collections. 5.6 Another issue is the distributional effects of any tax changes. There are many ways of lowering costs of capital that can have different distributional effects. However, some, including lowering the company tax rate, may make it harder 42 for the government to levy as progressive an income tax on individuals. High income earners may be able to shelter their income in companies and have it taxed at the company rate, rather than at higher personal tax rates, and a lower company tax rate would increase the benefits of doing so. These concerns might be able to be addressed in other ways, for example, by increasing taxes at the shareholder level. The overall implications of any package of measures on the progressivity of the tax system may be an overriding concern. 5.7 At the same time, chapter 3 provided evidence that New Zealand does appear to be an outlier in the way it taxes inbound investment. Costs of capital and EMTRs are higher in New Zealand than in most other OECD countries. It is reasonable to question whether New Zealand’s tax settings are appropriate or whether we are unnecessarily detracting from New Zealand’s economic performance and lowering productivity more than is desirable by taxing inbound investment relatively heavily. Choosing between different methods of reducing taxes on inbound investment 5.8 If a government wishes to reduce taxes on inbound investment, several potential aims and objectives will need to be traded off when considering the best way of doing so. 5.9 In chapter 4, we saw that not only was the current tax system likely to be leading to substantial costs of capital and EMTRs for many assets, but there were also major biases between different types of investments and between investments which are financed in different ways. Our current method of trying to allow for economic depreciation would be neutral if there were no inflation and we were successful in matching our tax depreciation rates to economic depreciation rates. In practice, we will never be able to measure economic depreciation very accurately. Moreover, there are biases created by even minor levels of inflation. Another issue is the way in which costs of capital and EMTRs can vary markedly for multinational firms with different debt levels. Is addressing these current biases an important objective? 5.10 There are several other issues to consider. First is whether to maintain current levels of tax on location-specific rents. If so, how do we best reduce taxes on marginal investments without reducing taxes on these economic rents at the same time? 5.11 A second issue is whether to minimise windfall gains to firms with sunk investments. About one-third of company profits in New Zealand accrue to foreign-controlled companies. Providing windfall benefits to those firms is likely to be particularly costly to New Zealand if replacement taxes are levied on New Zealanders. 5.12 A third issue is that EMTRs are not always positive. As well as having high EMTRs on many investments, we can have negative EMTRs on some heavily debt-financed investments. Should we reduce the size of tax subsidies at the same time as reducing higher EMTRs? 5.13 A fourth issue is whether there is any case for targeted tax reductions for particular industries or activities, rather than reducing taxes on inbound investment in a more general way. 5.14 Finally, there are the questions of how personal income should best be taxed, how any changes in company tax provisions should be integrated with personal taxation, and whether having good integration should be an objective. How governments wish to tax the income of individuals may place constraints on 43 how they wish to tax companies. This can have implications for costs of capital and EMTRs. Conversely, concerns about costs of capital and EMTRs could lead to a consideration of how personal income itself should best be taxed. Possible options 5.15 There are many ways of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs with different impacts on tax neutrality. In subsequent chapters we consider a small number of possible options and their pros and cons. The options chosen are key options to consider, but the list is not meant to be exhaustive. 5.16 For example, we discuss the possibility of a company tax rate reduction by itself (without any changes to the full imputation company tax system or any other measures to boost taxes at the shareholder level to maintain the progressivity of the personal income tax system). This would increase the incentive for those with a high income or wealth to shelter their income in companies and have the income taxed at a low company tax rate rather than higher rates of personal tax. 5.17 In practice, many other options could be considered. For example, the McLeod Review suggested reducing the company tax rate only for foreign -owned firms to lower the tax rate on inbound investment without giving rise to greater tax sheltering problems. Another alternative might be to shift back from an imputation system to the classical company tax system where there is double taxation of dividends and no credits for company tax. This option was discussed in a 2009 paper to the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group. 20 It might be accompanied by a tax on capital gains on shares. A further option we consider is a dual income tax, but we welcome comments if people think there are other approaches that should be explored in the final briefing. 5.18 At this stage we have not attempted to cost the different options. This is because much of the resulting revenue changes would require assumptions about how the rest of the tax system (in particular, the personal tax system) was being changed at the same time. As set out in many of the policy chapters in this draft LTIB (that is, chapters 6 to 12), unless changes to the personal tax system were being made, then any reform might make little sense. 5.19 The options we have identified include: • Lowering the company tax rate: This is discussed in chapter 6. This option would reduce taxes on marginal investments, which would reduce current biases between investment in different assets and investment financed in different ways. It would reduce distortions caused by inflation as well as tax subsidies for tax-preferred investments with negative EMTRs, at the same time as reducing some of the relatively high EMTRs. It would also reduce taxes on location-specific rents and provide a windfall benefit for owners of sunk investments. As noted above, it is likely to reduce the progressivity of the tax system. • Accelerated depreciation: This is discussed in chapter 7. This option could lower tax on investments with some of the highest EMTRs. If restricted to new investment only, it would be doing so without providing a windfall to owners of sunk investments. This would constrain the costs but create some other distortions. At times this could lead to investment subsidies and promote inefficient investment. 20 This option was discussed in Inland Revenue and Treasury (2009). 44 • Indexation of the tax base: This is discussed in chapter 8. Some of the highest EMTRs are likely to be for short-lived depreciating assets and inventories, and these EMTRs will typically increase with inflation. One way of reducing these EMTRs would be to index the tax system comprehensively. This would be likely to reduce the highest EMTRs and make the tax system more neutral. No longer taxing the inflationary component of interest income is also likely to reduce savings distortions. The key argument against comprehensive indexation is the administration and compliance costs it is likely to impose. This could be a fatal objection at present, although greater adoption of digital accounting packages may make indexation more and more feasible in the future. An alternative might be to index depreciation, or both depreciation and inventories, but not interest. As with accelerated depreciation measures, this could at times lead to investment subsidies and promote inefficient investment. It might, however, be a more neutral way of dealing with distortions caused by inflation than allowing accelerated depreciation. • A higher (less stringent) thin capitalisation threshold: This is discussed in chapter 9. This option would reduce costs of capital and EMTRs, but it would only do so for foreign-controlled firms. It is also likely only to be effective for firms that are trying to maximise their interest deductions and are close to the current thin capitalisation threshold. Data suggests that many foreign-controlled firms are not in that position. • Allowance for corporate equity (ACE) system: This would involve allowing firms a notional interest deduction for corporate equity and is discussed in chapter 10. In principle, it could reduce taxes on marginal inbound investment without forgoing tax on economic rents. It could also reduce or remove debt/equity biases. Some ACE systems have been designed to apply only to new investments to minimise windfalls. A key question is whether it is possible to minimise windfalls in a country like New Zealand without a capital gains tax. There is also the question of how such a tax would integrate with the personal tax system. This is difficult without a capital gains tax at least on sales of shares. • Specific incentives for certain types of business investment: This is discussed in chapter 11. Rather than providing measures that reduce costs of capital and EMTRs generally, this option would involve tax cuts targeted at specific investments. • Dual income tax system: This is discussed in chapter 12. This option would allow a lower company tax rate on inbound investment income in a way that would integrate well with personal income taxation. Dual income tax systems have been adopted in several Nordic countries, so their performance can be assessed. Despite involving a lower tax rate on capital income than on labour income, the system has been adopted by several countries with quite progressive fiscal systems. However, a move in this direction would go well beyond addressing cost of capital concerns. Decisions would need to be made that it was fair and reasonable to tax capital income at lower rates than labour incomes. At the same time, a dual income tax system may possibly be used to support progressive tax rates on forms of income that can be taxed without too much distortion or evasion. 45 CHAPTER 6 Reducing the company tax rate • Reducing the company tax rate would reduce the relatively high costs of capital and EMTRs for many forms of investment into New Zealand. • To the extent that this encourages investment that would otherwise not take place, thi s is likely to promote economic efficiency and productivity. • This would also reduce distortions between different types of assets and different methods of finance and reduce distortions that arise because of difficulties in measuring economic income. • It would also reduce transfer pricing pressures. • At the same time, there are trade-offs to consider. This would provide a windfall to firms with existing investments and to firms earning location- specific economic rents that would invest irrespective of whether there were a cut in the company tax rate. • Unless accompanied by higher taxes at the shareholder level, a reduction in the company tax rate is likely to make the personal income tax system less progressive and increase the benefits of sheltering personal income in companies. • This is likely to reduce the integrity of the personal income tax system. Introduction 6.1 Company tax is the major tax on inbound investment in New Zealand and changes to the company rate can have a significant effect on costs of capital and EMTRs. 6.2 One of the many ways the cost of capital can be lowered in New Zealand is by reducing the company tax rate from the current 28%. This would reduce marginal taxation on inbound investment and potentially attract foreign investment. It might attract some additional firms to set up operations in New Zealand. However, this policy option comes with trade-offs, such as loss of taxation from location-specific economic rents and more scope for personal income to be sheltered in companies. This could reduce the progressivity and integrity of the personal income tax. The dual role of company tax 6.3 Company tax has two roles. One supports the coherence of personal tax settings and makes sure that higher income earners do not pay very low rates of tax on the income they earn. The second role is to tax income earned by non-resident investors investing into New Zealand, both as foreign direct investment (FDI) by foreign-controlled entities and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) into domestic companies. 6.4 Supporting the coherence of personal income tax settings creates a motivation to make the company rate as close to the top personal rate as possible. If the 46 company rate is significantly lower than the top personal rate, there is an incentive for those with high income and wealth to use companies to shelter income from higher rates of personal tax. 6.5 However, company tax is also a tax on non-resident investment into New Zealand and high taxes may reduce investment, capital stock and economic performance. Concerns about taxes on marginal inbound investment and the cost of capital may create an opposing motivation to cut the company rate. 6.6 This dual role was acknowledged in the 2001 McLeod Tax Review, which led to a consideration of cutting the company rate, but only to the extent that it applied to non-resident shareholding. This would mean that companies owned by domestic residents would continue to be taxed closer to the top personal rate. 6.7 The Review further suggested restricting this cut to new activities, or significant expansions of existing activities, by non-residents. This would more narrowly target new investment by non-residents, which would avoid providing a significant windfall to those who had invested in the past. It would mean that the tax cut was focused where investment responses were likely to be sensitive to tax. 6.8 The McLeod Review suggestion was a logical and more targeted response to cost of capital concerns that takes into account the dual nature of company tax. In practice, we suspect that it may be difficult to limit a company tax cut to new investment only. It could seem unfair to firms replacing their capital stock if existing firms face a different tax rate from new firms. 21 Having a lower tax on foreign-owned firms is not common internationally, and its economic justification is likely to be difficult to explain to domestic businesses who think they also should benefit from a company tax rate cut. 6.9 In this chapter, we focus on the implications of a general cut to the company rate for both New Zealand residents and non-residents. There are other more targeted options, such as the McLeod Review suggestion, that could also be considered. These could reduce some of the downsides of the company tax rate cut that we consider. Impact on costs of capital and EMTRs 6.10 In chapter 4 we discussed how inflation and the mismeasurement of income could affect costs of capital and EMTRs. 6.11 Costs of capital and EMTRs are estimated in table 6.1 for a domestic company with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders and assuming that there is a world real interest rate of 3% and 2% per annum inflation in New Zealand. We assume that foreign shareholders demand a real return of 3% on their funds net of any domestic taxes, as do foreign lenders. Because of the approved issuer levy (AIL), the domestic real interest rate is bid up to 3.10%. We assume that firms are 43% debt financed and the depreciation deductions are set to mirror how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation for plant, machinery and equipment (PME). 6.12 We examine three possible company tax rates: 28%, 24% and 20%. 21 At the same time, countries that have introduced an allowance for corporate equity have most often restricted this allowance to new equity only, which raises some of the same issues. This is discussed in chapter 10. 47 Table 6.1: Costs of capital and EMTRs, companies, debt = 43%, r = 3%, inflation = 2%, AIL = 2% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital t = 28% 3.81% 4.14% 4.11% 3.93% 3.76% 3.63% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% t = 24% 3.67% 3.94% 3.91% 3.76% 3.62% 3.51% 3.32% 3.94% 3.00% 2.52% t = 20% 3.54% 3.75% 3.73% 3.61% 3.50% 3.41% 3.26% 3.75% 3.01% 2.61% EMTRs t = 28% 21.3% 27.6% 27.0% 23.7% 20.1% 17.3% 11.3% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% t = 24% 18.2% 23.8% 23.3% 20.2% 17.1% 14.6% 9.6% 23.8% 0.0% -19.0% t = 20% 15.1% 20.0% 19.6% 16.9% 14.2% 12.1% 8.0% 20.0% 0.3% -15.0% 6.13 We draw attention to several points: • Focusing on the current tax rules (rows where t = 28%), we see that costs of capital can vary significantly from 4.14% for very short-lived PME and inventories to 2.43% for assets that can be expensed. 22 The real cost of funds to New Zealand is assumed to be 3.00%, so this varies from a substantial tax (an EMTR of 27.6%) to a significant subsidy (with an EMTR of -23.3%). • Reducing the company tax rate to 20% would narrow this range of EMTRs to between 20.0% and -15.0%. • Thus, unsurprisingly, a cut in the company tax rate lowers costs of capital for investments that are heavily taxed and reduces tax subsidies for investments that are subsidised. This reduces tax distortions between investment in different assets. Pros Lowering costs of capital when EMTRs are high 6.14 A benefit of a company tax rate cut is that this would address New Zealand’s relatively high costs of capital and promote additional investment in activities that have high EMTRs. This is likely to increase economic efficiency and productivity. Reducing distortions between different investments 6.15 As discussed in chapter 4, an attraction of allowing economic depreciation (at least if there is no inflation) is that it would promote neutrality across different types of investment for any company. There would be incentives to invest in the most productive assets rather than assets that provide the biggest tax advantages. Hurdle rates of return across different possible investments would be the same. 22 These are, of course, identical to the estimates provided in the fourth row of table 4.3 for domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders. 48 6.16 There is, however, a major difficulty in setting depreciation rates to mirror economic depreciation because we are far from certain about how different assets are likely to depreciate. As a result, biases to investment decisions are inevitable. These are likely to be compounded by inflation if the tax system is not indexed to take account of inflation. Biases will also be created if, for practical reasons, some forms of income are untaxed (for example, because there is no tax on capital gains) or because certain forms of capital expenditure can be expensed. An obvious way of reducing these distortions is to lower the company tax rate. As table 6.1 above shows, reducing the company tax rate will tend to reduce investment biases. There is a narrower range of costs of capital when the company tax rate is 20% (from 3.75% to 2.61%) than when the company tax rate is 28% (from 4.14% to 2.43%). Reducing base erosion and profit shifting 6.17 New Zealand has reasonably robust anti-avoidance rules to mitigate the risk of tax base erosion and profit shifting. Nevertheless, no rules will be watertight, and if profits are shifted away from New Zealand, this will tend to reduce New Zealand’s national income and reduce tax collections. This puts upward pressure on the levels of taxes New Zealanders must pay. 6.18 New Zealand becomes more vulnerable to international profit shifting if its company tax rate is high relative to tax rates in other countries. Other measures, such as the future global minimum tax rules, will put a floor of 15% on income from intangibles. This is likely to be reducing incentives to shift profits out of New Zealand. However, a potential benefit of reducing the company tax rate is that this would further reduce the incentive for firms to shift profits out of New Zealand to countries with lower company tax rates. Cons Reducing tax revenue on existing investments 6.19 One disadvantage associated with reducing the company tax rate is that it would reduce the tax revenue from existing investments in New Zealand. This provides windfall gains to existing owners of firms where the investment was undertaken with the expectation that future returns would be taxed at a higher rate. Where the firms are owned by non-residents, this will involve a loss of tax revenue and of national income to New Zealand. It is likely that the burden of replacement taxes will largely fall on New Zealand residents. Ideally it would be preferable to limit any company tax reductions to new investments only, as it is only in this case that new investment will be promoted. However, this is likely to be impractical with a company tax rate cut. Loss of taxation on location-specific economic rents 6.20 Furthermore, a company tax rate cut would mean reducing taxes on location- specific economic rents. Economic rents are returns over and above those required for investment to take place, and location-specific means the rents arise from factors that are linked to a location. Economic rents are an efficient source of taxation, and especially valuable when they are earned by non- residents, because New Zealand gains from the additional tax revenue but does not bear any of the costs. If we forgo tax on these rents and have to levy replacement taxes, these replacement taxes are likely to be less efficient than the taxes we have forgone. Rents of this kind are likely to be larger in a geographically isolated market like New Zealand where supply of certain goods and services is likely to be helped by having a physical presence. New Zealand’s geographical remoteness is likely to create a bigger than normal barrier to many goods and services being supplied from nearby other countries. 49 Consistency, fairness and efficiency of personal income tax 6.21 A reduction in the company tax rate would mean that income being earned through companies is taxed at rates that are further below higher rates of personal tax rates than they are at present. Personal tax rates are set to reflect a government’s views on the level of progressivity that is desirable so that higher income earners pay rates of tax that are deemed to be fair. This goal is undermined if income taxed in different entities is taxed at significantly lower rates. 6.22 The tax system becomes less fair if people with high levels of wealth and income can shelter income in companies to avoid the top personal tax rates. Only small amounts of the taxable income of high-wealth individuals are taxed at personal rates. As noted in chapter 2, 5% is taxed at personal income tax rates, 12% is taxed at the trust tax rate and 83% at the company tax rate. There is now a 5% rate differential between the company rate and trust rate (33%), and a greater 11% rate differential between the company rate and the top personal tax rate (39%). This can provide incentives for higher income earners to shelter income in companies and have it taxed at the company tax rate rather than at personal tax rates. 6.23 Reducing the company tax rate would exacerbate these gaps unless personal tax rates were cut at the same time. Cutting personal tax rates may be supported by some future governments but not by others. 6.24 If governments want to lower the company tax rate and maintain the progressivity of the New Zealand tax system, higher levels of tax might be needed at the shareholder level. One option might be a tax on gains from share sales. As discussed by Chen and Mintz (2009), New Zealand is particularly vulnerable to a gap between the company tax rate and the top personal tax rate because of the absence of any tax on capital gains. As a result, those on the top marginal tax rate of 39% are able to have income taxed at a low rate if this is earned in a company and then gains are realised by selling shares in the company. Chen and Mintz expressed surprise that New Zealand had not adopted the solution of taxing share gains to help with integrity concerns. 6.25 Company tax rates and top personal marginal tax rates in OECD countries are provided in table 6.2. Having a small gap between the company tax rate and the top personal rate is attractive because it limits the scope for personal income to be sheltered in companies. At the same time New Zealand’s gap between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate is not high compared to other OECD countries. In 2020, the latest year for which OECD data is provided, New Zealand had a company tax rate of 28% and a top personal marginal tax rate of 33%. The gap between the two was 5 percentage points, which was the fifth equal lowest gap for the 37 OECD countries for which data is recorded. Even now, with a top marginal tax rate of 39% and an 11 percentage point gap, the gap is not large compared with other OECD countries. Only six other OECD countries had a smaller gap than this in 2020. 50 Table 6.2: Company and top personal tax rates – 2020 Country Company tax rate Top marginal tax rate Difference Australia 30.0 47.0 17.0 Austria 25.0 55.0 30.0 Belgium 25.0 52.9 27.9 Canada 26.2 53.5 27.3 Chile 10.0 35.0 25.0 Colombia 32.0 33.0 1.0 Czech Republic 19.0 15.0 -4.0 Denmark 22.0 55.9 33.9 Estonia 20.0 20.0 0.0 Finland 20.0 51.2 31.2 France 32.0 55.4 23.4 Germany 29.9 47.5 17.6 Greece 24.0 54.0 30.0 Hungary 9.0 15.0 6.0 Iceland 20.0 46.2 26.2 Ireland 12.5 48.0 35.5 Israel 23.0 50.0 27.0 Italy 27.8 47.2 19.4 Japan 29.7 55.9 26.2 Korea 27.5 46.2 18.7 Latvia 20.0 31.4 11.4 Lithuania 15.0 32.0 17.0 Luxembourg 24.9 45.8 20.9 Mexico 30.0 35.0 5.0 Netherlands 25.0 49.5 24.5 New Zealand 28.0 33.0 5.0 Norway 22.0 38.2 16.2 Poland 19.0 32.0 13.0 Portugal 31.5 53.0 21.5 Slovak Republic 21.0 25.0 4.0 Slovenia 19.0 50.0 31.0 Spain 25.0 43.5 18.5 Sweden 21.4 52.3 30.9 Switzerland 21.1 41.7 20.6 Turkey 22.0 40.8 18.8 United Kingdom 19.0 45.0 26.0 United States 25.8 43.7 17.9 Average 23.1 42.6 19.5 51 6.26 If about 39% of gains were taxable, so gains on shares were taxed at a rate of approximately 15.2%, there would be a similar tax impost when shares are sold to when imputed dividends are paid for shareholders taxed at the top personal marginal tax rate. 23 Of course, there are other issues to consider. Taxing gains on shares would add to compliance costs but, especially if this were accompanied by taxing other forms of capital gain as well, it might provide a revenue base that could help reduce costs of capital and EMTRs. Taxing gains on shares or other forms of capital gains may be unlikely as a short-term or medium-term measure. However, many other countries tax these gains and this may be feasible in the longer term. 6.27 There may be options (other than taxing gains on shares) that could make a significant difference between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate less of a concern. There appear to be some other countries with a larger gap than New Zealand (for example, Switzerland and Belgium) that also do not tax gains on shares. It is possible that these countries have ways of making a large gap between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate less of a concern without taxing gains on shares. However, it is also possible that these gaps are creating important inconsistencies in these countries as well. 6.28 Other options might involve shifting away from New Zealand’s full imputation company tax system to one that leads to heavier taxation of dividends. This would, however, create additional pressures for a tax on gains from share sales and make it less attractive for those on lower marginal tax rates to invest in companies. There would be a broad set of other pros and cons to consider. 6.29 New Zealand is not alone in needing to work through these sorts of issues. In a recent paper, McKenzie (2021) suggests higher taxes on dividends and capital gains plus taxation of rents at the company level as a possible option for Canada. In an accompanying paper, Smart (2021) discusses pressures that arise in Canada through sheltering of personal income in closely-held companies. International experience 6.30 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, New Zealand had a relatively low company tax rate compared to most OECD countries, which made New Zealand a relatively attractive place to invest. However, as at 2021, New Zealand’s company rate of 28% is the 8th highest in the OECD. This is due to the ongoing trend for OECD countries to cut their company tax rates, prompted by concerns about promoting investment and reducing international tax avoidance. Substantial cuts in company tax rates have occurred in non-OECD countries as well. 6.31 An important aspect of this trend is that the competition for tax base and location of companies is likely to be greater in countries that are close substitutes. In Europe, a business may, at times, be able to supply a large 23 If $100 is earned as company income and this is taxed at the 28% company tax rate, this leaves $72 net of company tax. If this is taxed at 15.2% when shares are sold, this would mean a further $11 of tax, leaving a shareholder on the 39% marginal tax rate with approximately $61 of after-tax income. This tax on gains could be achieved by including 39% of the gain as taxable income because 39% × 39% is approximately 15.2%. This abstracts from timing issues. With a 39% tax on share gains, there could still be advantages in those on the top marginal tax rate accumulating profits in companies for lengthy periods before selling these to generate capital gains. 52 number of countries out of one country. In that case, a tax rate decrease may attract businesses that were otherwise largely indifferent to location. 6.32 Australia is the closest country to New Zealand, and if Australia were to reduce its company tax rate, this might put downward pressure on New Zealand’s company tax rate. Currently, just over half of foreign direct investment into New Zealand is from Australia, 24 and a reduction in Australia’s company tax rate would increase incentives for profits to be streamed to Australia. Australia’s company tax rate for larger companies is 30%, which is higher than New Zealand’s company tax rate (although Australia has a lower 26% rate for small to medium companies). Our relative company tax rate is only one of several factors to consider. A bigger issue may be the Australian full imputation system. This currently provides incentives for companies with Australian parents to pay tax in Australia rather than New Zealand. This is because Australian imputation credits (referred to as franking credits in Australia) are available for taxes paid in Australia but not those paid in New Zealand. 6.33 There are recent indications that there may be some movement back towards higher company tax rates internationally. Many countries are examining how best to repair their fiscal position after their COVID-19 response, and this may reduce downward pressure on company tax rates. The UK has announced an intention to increases its company tax rate from 19% to 25%. Most recently, 130 out of 139 jurisdictions have signed up to a new international tax framework that would result in a global minimum company tax rate of 15% targeted at income from intangibles. All of this may be reducing or even reversing the long downward trend in company tax rates that has been evident in the last 40 years (see figure 1.1). Should future company tax rate cuts be signalled in advance? 6.34 If governments wished to cut the company tax rate, there is the question of whether to do this in a way that minimises windfalls for sunk investments. One way of doing so might be to announce a commitment to cut the rate at some stage in the future. A credible announcement of a future company tax rate cut, or a programme of such cuts, could promote investment before the cuts taking place. This could reduce the windfall element in the future company tax rate cuts. Implications for unincorporated enterprises and domestic SMEs operating as companies 6.35 Some businesses are organised as sole proprietorships or partnerships and, in these enterprises, income is taxed at the personal tax rates of the owners. For domestic small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that operate as companies and that are fully distributing profits to their domestic owners, this income will also be taxed at personal rates. 6.36 The question might be asked whether personal tax rates should be cut at the same time as the company tax rate. If personal tax rates are designed to reflect a government’s goals on the progressivity of the tax system, it would seem that a reduction in the company tax rate because of cost of capital concerns should not provide a case for lower personal tax rates. Rather the issue should be how to ensure that company income is adequately taxed at the personal level to ensure that company income ends up being taxed at appropriate personal rates. 24 Statistics NZ National Accounts Data for the year to 31 March 2021. 53 Key questions to consider Q6.1: If New Zealand wished to reduce EMTRs, should reducing the company tax rate be an option to be considered? Q6.2: If governments wanted to reduce costs of capital and EMTRs without reducing the progressivity of the tax system, what accompanying tax changes would you suggest? Q6.3: Would the case for or against company tax rate cuts depend materially on what happens to company tax rates in other countries? Q6.4: If there were a cut in the company tax rate, should there be changes to other tax rates at the same time? 54 CHAPTER 7 Accelerated Depreciation • Accelerated depreciation schemes are measures that many countries have used to incentivise investment. • They could reduce higher costs of capital and EMTRs by reducing taxes on marginal investments, and by offsetting some biases caused by inflation they could potentially increase the neutrality of many forms of investment. • They would, however, lead to biases between assets that benefit from these accelerated depreciation schemes and inventories. • An attraction of accelerated depreciation schemes relative to a company tax rate cut is that accelerated depreciation could be restricted to new investments and minimise windfalls. • At the same time, restricting accelerated depreciation to new investment only would create some distortions by discouraging sales of assets. • Accelerated depreciation would also not be as likely to create tax sheltering opportunities as a cut in the company tax rate would. • Unlike a cut in the company tax rate, accelerated depreciation would not reduce biases between debt and equity financing by non-resident investors. • Accelerated depreciation would also not reduce international tax avoidance pressures caused by New Zealand’s company tax rate being higher than the company tax rates in many other countries. • At times, accelerated depreciation may lead to investment subsidies and promote inefficient investment. Introduction 7.1 Accelerated depreciation or additional deductions for capital costs (such as investment allowances) or tax credits are commonly used by countries to lower the cost of capital and incentivise investment. 7.2 Before 2010, New Zealand allowed accelerated depreciation of machinery and equipment but not buildings. Accelerated depreciation as a deliberate policy was removed in 2010. Possible accelerated depreciation measures 7.3 In this chapter we focus on two types of accelerated depreciation measures: depreciation loading and partial expensing. • Depreciation loading means allowing a deduction from taxable income that is greater than the standard depreciation rate. Suppose an asset would normally receive a diminishing value (DV) rate of depreciation of 10% each year. This means that if an asset costs $10,000, $1,000 would be allowed as a depreciation deduction in the first year, $900 (namely, 10% of the residual balance of $9,000) in the next year and so forth. Now 55 suppose that an additional 20% depreciation loading is permitted. The yearly DV depreciation deduction would be increased to 12%. • Partial expensing means that a portion of the cost of a new asset can be deducted immediately (in the year that an asset is acquired) from taxable income. The remaining cost of the asset is deducted at the normal depreciation rate. For example, suppose once more that an asset costs $10,000 and would normally qualify for a 10% DV rate of depreciation. Now suppose that partial expensing of 50% is permitted. Taxable income is reduced by $5,000 immediately. The remaining $5,000 is depreciated at a 10% DV rate of depreciation. Impacts on costs of capital and EMTRs 7.4 Table 7.1 reports the estimated EMTRs for various assets. As in chapter 6, we assume that the assets are held by a domestic company with marginal foreign shareholders. The world real interest rate is 3%, and non-resident shareholders demand a real rate of return of 3% net of any New Zealand taxes. Due to approved issuer levy (AIL), the domestic real interest rate is bid up to 3.10%. Furthermore, we assume that firms are 43% debt financed. The depreciation allowance rates for ‘plant, machinery, and equipment’ (PME) are assumed to be set to mirror how the asset would depreciate in the absence of inflation. Rows 3–5 report estimated costs of capital and rows 6–8 report estimated EMTRs. We consider three possible tax treatments: • the status quo • 20% depreciation loading for both buildings and PMEs, and • 20% partial expensing for buildings and for PMEs with depreciation rates greater than zero. 7.5 There is a question how depreciation loading would be applied to an asset that qualifies for full depreciation of \* 100%dd= = over its first year. This is because it would be impossible to give a depreciation loading without allowing more than the full cost of the asset to be depreciated. We assume that current depreciation rules are maintained for these assets, so costs of capital and EMTRs are unchanged from the status quo. An alternative might be to allow some level of partial expensing in lieu of depreciation loading for those for which \* 100%dd= = . 56 Table 7.1: Costs of capital and EMTRs, debt = 43%, r = 3%, inflation = 2%, AIL = 2%, Status quo compared with accelerated depreciation options Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital Status quo 3.81% 4.14% 4.11% 3.93% 3.76% 3.63% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% Depreciation loading 3.73% 4.14% 3.85% 3.75% 3.64% 3.56% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% Partial expensing 3.54% 3.80% 3.78% 3.63% 3.49% 3.39% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% EMTRs Status quo 21.3% 27.6% 27.0% 23.7% 20.1% 17.3% 11.3% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% Depreciation loading 19.6% 27.6% 22.1% 20.0% 17.6% 15.7% 11.3% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% Partial expensing 15.2% 21.1% 20.6% 17.4% 14.1% 11.5% 11.3% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% 7.6 We draw attention to the following points: • As has been discussed elsewhere, the current rules lead to considerable variety in costs of capital, varying from 4.14% for heavily taxed PME and inventories to 2.43% for assets that can be expensed. EMTRs vary from 27.6% to -23.3%. • Either form of accelerated depreciation would be a way of lowering some of the higher costs of capital and EMTRs. For example, consider assets that are provided with a 50% rate of depreciation (such as computers). Depreciation loading would drop the EMTR from 27.0% to 22.1%. Partial expensing would drop the EMTR a bit further to 20.6%. In the absence of inflation, all depreciable and non-depreciable assets would have an EMTR of 18.7%. Thus, either change could be thought of as offsetting some of the upward bias to EMTRs that is caused by inflation for these assets. • Depreciation loading would have a smaller effect than partial expensing on assets with lower depreciation rates. For example, an asset with a 2% rate of depreciation has an EMTR of 17.3% under current tax rules. It is significantly less heavily taxed than assets with much faster economic depreciation rates. Such an asset’s EMTR falls to 15.7% under loading or 11.5% under partial expensing. • Neither of the measures would increase tax subsidies to appreciating assets or assets that can be expensed. Nor would they reduce the high EMTR of 27.6% faced by inventories. Effects of the two accelerated depreciation schemes on neutrality 7.7 Either of the two schemes would reduce EMTRs on depreciating assets that are currently facing high EMTRs. This would reduce disparities in EMTRs between these assets and assets that are taxed less heavily. At the same time, they would introduce a tax bias between these depreciating assets and inventories unless there were also measures to reduce EMTRs on inventories. 57 7.8 Of the two schemes, depreciation loading seems more targeted at depreciating assets with high EMTRs. Depreciation loading gives a relatively small benefit to assets that depreciate slowly, while partial expensing provides a significant benefit to all depreciating assets. 7.9 The results for depreciation loading for assets that fully depreciate over a year look anomalous (the EMTR remains 27.6% when EMTRs for other depreciating assets are falling). An alternative might be to allow partial expensing for these particular assets. 7.10 These are just two types of accelerated depreciation. It may be possible to devise a scheme that is better targeted at supporting assets with relatively high EMTRs. Design issues New or all investment 7.11 Accelerated depreciation can be restricted to new assets. This would mean a firm that owns depreciable assets on the day the new scheme came into force would not benefit from a higher depreciation rate on these assets. Also, if it sold these assets to a new purchaser, the new purchaser could only claim depreciation at the old depreciation rates. 7.12 New Zealand used to allow a 20% loading for purchases of new machinery and equipment. This provision, which was repealed in 2010, was restricted to purchases of new machinery and equipment. 7.13 Restricting accelerated depreciation to new assets minimises windfall benefits to firms that have invested in the past. It reduces the fiscal cost of accelerated depreciation. If accelerated depreciation were given to incentivise investment, there would seem to be little reason to allow it on investments that have already taken place. 7.14 At the same time, restricting accelerated depreciation to new assets would have implications for assets that were acquired new after the accelerated depreciation scheme came into force. It would mean that the assets would only continue to qualify for accelerated depreciation if they were retained by their initial owner. Restricting accelerated depreciation to new investment might create biases. For example, some firms might want to use relatively new trucks or buses only, while other firms may be quite willing to use older trucks or buses. Efficiency may decrease if tax is an obstacle to assets being acquired by those who will use them most productively. Treatment of firms in loss 7.15 Accelerated depreciation confers a benefit to businesses that have tax liabilities, but it will not benefit businesses that are in tax loss. A common criticism of accelerated depreciation measures is that they are only of benefit to firms in a taxpaying position and this can be distortionary. This is because accelerated depreciation measures can result in larger numbers of firms being in a tax-loss position. However, it is only for firms that are in a taxpaying position that high costs of capital and high EMTRs are a concern. In this context, the fact that firms in loss may obtain no benefit from accelerated depreciation may be of little concern. 58 Asset limitations 7.16 If a system of accelerated depreciation were put in place, the question of which assets should be included in the scheme would arise. Depreciation loading is only relevant for assets that are depreciable for tax purposes. Potentially, a system of partial expensing could apply, not only to depreciable assets, but also to non-depreciating assets or even appreciating assets. However, table 7.1 suggests that non-depreciating and appreciating assets are unlikely to face high EMTRs. As a result, it would seem appropriate for any partial expensing scheme to also be limited to depreciating assets. 7.17 Before 2010, New Zealand applied depreciation loading to machinery and equipment but not buildings. Buildings depreciate relatively slowly and assets that depreciate more slowly tend to face lower costs of capital and EMTRs. However, there would appear to be little reason for distinguishing buildings from other assets that also depreciate at slow rates. International experience United States 7.18 The United States introduced a partial expensing scheme, which it referred to as “bonus depreciation”, for certain forms of qualifying expenditure in two tax changes in 2002 and 2003. Under the 2002 change, 30% of qualifying capital expenditure could be expensed, and this was increased to 50% in the 2003 change. Qualifying assets were investments in new machinery and equipment but not buildings. This bonus depreciation scheme terminated at the end of 2004, but in 2008, bonus depreciation measures were reintroduced and the fraction of investment that can be expensed has varied since then. Currently, 100% of qualifying expenditure can be expensed. As has been discussed, full expensing will involve negative EMTRs and a tax subsidy for investment that is partially debt financed. Australia 7.19 Australia introduced a partial expensing scheme as part of its response to COVID-19. Under the Australian legislation, 50% of the cost of qualifying assets can be expensed. Qualifying assets include new machinery and equipment but not buildings. To qualify, assets need to have been first held on or after 12 March 2020 and first used or installed and available for use by 30 June 2021. To qualify for this incentive, firms need to have a turnover of less than $50 million. (In addition, Australia offered immediate capital write off to these firms for assets costing less than $150,000 acquired between 12 March 2020 and 30 June 2020). Pros and cons of accelerated depreciation 7.20 Both forms of accelerated depreciation reduce some of the higher costs of capital and EMTRs. They both could be targeted at new investment, which would limit windfall gains to those with sunk investments and limit the fiscal costs of the measures. Of the two schemes, depreciation loading would probably be better targeted at reducing costs of capital and EMTRs on the most heavily taxed depreciable assets. 7.21 An important question is whether accelerated depreciation measures merely reduce high positive EMTRs or go further and produce negative EMTRs. With 20% loading or 20% partial expensing, accelerated depreciation would appear to be reducing higher EMTRs without making EMTRs negative (at least at 59 average debt levels). However, with high enough levels of depreciation loading or partial expensing, EMTRs can become negative. 7.22 For example, with full expensing, EMTRs in table 7.1 would fall to -23.3% and investment would be subsidised. It would be attractive at the margin for firms to be acquiring funds at a cost of 3% net of New Zealand taxes and investing these in investments earning only 2.43%. Even though this investment would be adding to capital stock, which would support greater labour productivity, borrowing at 3% to earn 2.43% is likely to be inefficient. 7.23 There is also a question about the effects of accelerated depreciation for firms where non-residents are unlikely to be marginal shareholders. In chapter 4, we discussed SMEs owned by domestic residents where the individuals would otherwise invest in interest-bearing securities. As discussed in chapter 4 in table 4. 4, these firms may have incentives to invest at risk-ad justed rates of return that are lower than the interest rate. Negative EMTRs can arise for these firms even if investment is fully equity financed. An unattractive feature of accelerated depreciation measures is that they can increase investment subsidies for such firms. 7.24 Table 7.2 examines costs of capital and EMTRs for such SMEs owned by domestic residents on a marginal tax rate of 33%. It considers the case where these SMEs are fully distributing taxable earnings. As in table 4.4, it is assumed that the world real interest rate is 3.0% but there is 2% inflation, and this has increased the domestic real interest rate to 3.10%. Owners of the SMEs can borrow or lend at this real interest rate. We compare the status quo with either 20% depreciation loading or 20% partial expensing. Table 7.2: Costs of capital and EMTRs for domestic SMEs – full distribution, m = 33%, inflation = 2%, AIL = 2% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital Status quo 2.72% 3.10% 3.07% 2.88% 2.67% 2.50% 2.14% 3.10% 1.64% 1.43% Depreciation loading 2.63% 3.10% 2.81% 2.69% 2.55% 2.43% 2.14% 3.10% 1.64% 1.43% Partial expensing 2.46% 2.77% 2.74% 2.59% 2.42% 2.29% 2.14% 3.10% 1.64% 1.43% EMTRs Status quo -10.4% 3.3% 2.3% -4.2% -12.3% -19.9% -40.5% 3.3% -82.6% -109.7% Depreciation loading -14.1% 3.3% -6.7% -11.5% -17.6% -23.5% -40.5% 3.3% -82.6% -109.7% Partial expensing -22.0% -8.4% -9.4% -15.9% -23.8% -31.2% -40.5% 3.3% -82.6% -109.7% 7.25 We draw attention to the following points: • Under current rules (the status quo), EMTRs are slightly positive for inventory and PME with fast economic depreciation rates, but for many forms of investment EMTRs are negative. • Allowing depreciation loading or partial expensing can lead to negative EMTRs if the opportunity cost of capital is a heavily taxed income stream. 60 • There will be times when accelerated depreciation schemes are likely to lead to inefficient investment subsidies rather than merely reducing high EMTRs on inbound investment. Key questions to consider Q7.1: If New Zealand wished to reduce EMTRs, should accelerated depreciation be considered as an option? Q7.2: If accelerated depreciation measures are considered, should these be restricted to new investments or available for both new and existing investments? Q7.3: If accelerated depreciation measures, or other measures that increase the present value of depreciation deductions, are considered, are there reasons to prefer depreciation loading, partial expensing or some other scheme? 61 CHAPTER 8 Indexation • Under the present income tax system, costs of capital and EMTRs for real investment can vary significantly from the statutory rates when there is inflation. • This increase can be significant even at low rates of inflation in the middle of the Reserve Bank’s 1% to 3% target range. • The effects of inflation are not uniform across different asset classes. • This tends to reduce the neutrality of the tax system. • In principle, these distortions could be addressed by comprehensively indexing the tax base for inflation, which would include sales of revenue account assets, depreciation, trading stock, and interest. • While comprehensive indexation could eliminate the mismeasurement of income and reduce tax distortions, it could also be complex and have high compliance and administration costs. • Currently, no OECD countries comprehensively index their tax system for inflation. • Indexing depreciation deductions, or both depreciation deductions and inventories without indexing interest, might be a way of lowering costs of capital and EMTRs and making these more neutral. • However, like accelerated depreciation schemes, this would sometimes lead to investment subsidies. • The case for indexation measures will depend on compliance and administration costs and how these change over time, as well as on future interest and inflation rates. • The case for indexation is strongest when inflation is high relative to real interest rates. Introduction 8.1 Currently, the New Zealand tax system is not indexed for inflation, so it taxes nominal income and allows deductions for nominal interest expenses. However, some nominal income is compensation for inflation and should not be taxed under an economic definition of income. Under an economic definition, gains in the value of a person’s assets that are merely compensating for inflation would not be taxed. However, gains that contribute to an increase in a taxpayer’s real net worth should be taxed. 62 Example 8.1 Suppose the average price of goods is initially $10, and a person has $10,000. That person can buy 1,000 goods. The person puts the money into a bank account and earns 5.06% interest, and there is a 2% inflation rate. This is a 3% real interest rate. After one year, the person will have $10,506, but the average price of goods will increase to $10.20. Before accounting for tax, the person’s real worth will have increased by 3% – in the first year, they can buy 1,000 goods and in the following year they can buy 1,030 goods. However, New Zealand currently taxes nominal income. If the person’s marginal tax rate is 30%, then the person will have $10,354 in the second year and can only buy 1,015 goods. The person has been taxed at a rate of 50% on their real economic income. 8.2 Taxing nominal gains can increase the effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) for investment and undertax those with nominal interest expenses. When compared to the economic definition of income, the current rules can: • overtax taxpayers with income and assets that have an inflationary component, such as interest, trading stock, and depreciable property, and • undertax taxpayers with interest expenses. 25 8.3 This can increase costs of capital and EMTRs on investments that are already taxed quite heavily. This overtaxation can reduce investment in many types of assets and be distortionary between different types of investments. While it is not the focus of this LTIB, it can also impose a heavy tax impost on those who are earning interest income, which may discourage savings and distort how people choose to save. This can reduce economic efficiency and horizontal equity. 8.4 As was seen in chapter 4, at times the current rules can lower costs of capital and EMTRs and promote investment in certain assets, especially for heavily geared investments. How might the tax system be indexed for inflation? 8.5 This chapter looks at the idea of comprehensively adjusting the income tax base for inflation. To clarify, this is different to the idea of inflation indexing personal income tax thresholds. Even if personal income tax thresholds were indexed for inflation, or if there were a flat personal tax rate and no personal income tax thresholds to index, there would still be a question of how to take inflation into account so that people who earn interest or other forms of capital income are not taxed on purely inflationary gains. 25 Tax Working Group. (2018). Appendix E – Inflation indexing the tax system https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/twg-bg-3985472-appendix-e-inflation-indexing-the- tax-system 63 8.6 One approach to comprehensive indexation was proposed by the 1989 Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital. 26 This Consultative Document approach involves four key changes: • Sale of revenue account capital assets – on sale, the cost base of the asset and improvements is increased by the amount of inflation since incurring these expenses. • Inventories or trading stock – the ‘opening value’ of trading stock is increased by an inflationary component based on the average value of stock through the year. • Depreciation – the cost base of depreciable assets is increased every year by inflation. • Financial arrangements – the inflationary component of interest received is non-assessable and the inflationary component of interest paid is non- deductible. If inflation exceeds interest, the cost base for the value of the arrangement is increased. Other adjustments would be required for more complex financial arrangements, such as derivatives and arrangements in foreign currency. Impacts on costs of capital 8.7 In chapter 4 we discussed how inflation and the mismeasurement of income could affect costs of capital and EMTRs. 8.8 Costs of capital are estimated in table 8.1. As in previous chapters, we consider a domestic company with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders, using the OECD company tax model modified to take account of approved issuer levy (AIL). 27 We assume that foreign shareholders demand a real return of 3% on their funds net of any domestic taxes, as do foreign lenders. Because of AIL, the domestic real interest rate is bid up to 3.10%. We assume that firms are 43% debt financed and the depreciation deductions for plant, machinery and equipment (PME) are set to mirror how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation. 8.9 Rows 3–5 report costs of capital and rows 6–8 report EMTRs. We consider three possible tax treatments: • the status quo • full indexation of depreciation allowances, inventories and interest payments, and • indexation of depreciation allowances and inventories but not interest. 26 Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital (December 1989) https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tp/publications/1989/1989-dd-taxation-income- capital/1989-dd-taxation-income-capital- pdf.pdf?modified=20200910102401&modified=20200910102401. 27 As discussed in chapter 4, costs of capital and EMTRs would be slightly lower for foreign- controlled companies that are able to claim foreign tax credits for NRWT levied in New Zealand and somewhat higher for firms that are unable to claim foreign tax credits. However, the differences are not very large. 64 Table 8.1: Costs of capital and EMTRs OECD company tax model debt = 43%, r = 3%, inflation = 2%, AIL = 2% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital Status quo 3.81% 4.14% 4.11% 3.93% 3.76% 3.63% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% Fully index 3.84% 3.69% 3.69% 3.69% 3.69% 3.69% 3.69% 3.69% 3.30% 2.66% Index dep reciation and inventory 3.53% 3.38% 3.38% 3.38% 3.38% 3.38% 3.38% 3.38% 2.99% 2.43% EMTRs Status quo 21.3% 27.6% 27.0% 23.7% 20.1% 17.3% 11.3% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% Fully index 22.0% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 9.2% -12.9% Index depreciation and inventory 15.0% 11.3% 11.3% 11.3% 11.3% 11.3% 11.3% 11.3% -0.3% -23.3% 8.10 We draw attention to the following points: • As was discussed in chapter 4, the current tax rules can result in costs of capital and EMTRs that vary significantly — from an EMTR of 27.6% for very short-lived PME and inventories to an EMTR of -23.3% for assets that can be expensed. • Comprehensive indexation would be a way of reducing higher EMTRs and making these more neutral. – EMTRs for short-lived PME and inventories would fall from 27.6% to 18.7%. Rather than taxes pushing up the hurdle rate of return by 1.14 percentage points from 3.0% to 4.14%, they would only be pushing up the hurdle rate of return by 0.69 percentage points. – Under our assumptions, the EMTRs for all different types of PME, zero-depreciation assets and inventory would all be the same (although differences would arise in practice because tax depreciation rates will never reflect economic depreciation rates perfectly). – The negative EMTRs for assets that can be expensed would become less negative (changing from -23.3% to -12.9%), which means that the tax subsidy for these investments would be reduced, promoting tax neutrality. – An anomaly would be the tax treatment of commercial and industrial buildings, and there would be a case for considering a higher tax depreciation rate for these buildings if we had a fully indexed tax system. • Only indexing depreciation allowances and inventories might be a way of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs and making them more neutral. • While not reported in the table, only indexing depreciation allowances and inventories could sometimes lead to inefficient tax subsidies. This can be 65 true for domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders that are sufficiently debt financed. It can also be true for domestic SMEs where New Zealand residents are marginal shareholders. The analysis parallels the discussion in table 7.2 above, which considered the effects of accelerated depreciation measures. Pros and cons of comprehensive indexation 8.11 Comprehensive indexation of the tax system for inflation would reduce tax distortions and improve economic efficiency and horizontal equity. The EMTRs on different investments would be more consistent. Table 8.1 shows how the range of EMTRs would narrow for firms with an average level of debt finance (that is, 43% debt finance). While it is not directly reported in table 8.1, it is evident that full indexation would also reduce biases between debt and equity finance by limiting interest deductions to only real interest expense. 8.12 Indexation would get to the heart of the problem of removing biases in measuring the tax base that are caused by inflation. In this regard, indexation could be better at mitigating the tax effects of inflation than other more ad hoc measures, which can introduce further biases into the tax system. 8.13 However, comprehensively indexing the tax system for inflation using the Consultative Document approach would require adjustments to the rules for capital assets, trading stock, depreciation, and interest and financial arrangements (as set out above). Of these adjustments, those required for interest income and expense from financial arrangements would be the most complex, particularly for financial arrangements involving foreign currency or derivatives. Where taxpayers have financial transactions with New Zealand financial institutions, complexities could normally be removed for most taxpayers by the financial institutions advising on the real component of interest income and interest expense. However, at times financial transactions will not involve New Zealand financial institutions, and in this case, sophisticated tax calculations might sometimes be required of relatively unsophisticated New Zealand taxpayers. 8.14 The main issues with indexing are its complexity and practicality, which can lead to high compliance and administrative costs. No OECD country currently comprehensively inflation indexes their tax system. At the same time, advances in technology and the widespread uptake of accounting software may in time make comprehensive indexation more feasible. Pros and cons of partial indexation 8.15 An alternative approach to comprehensive indexation is partial indexation, which reduces the complexities involved. Partial indexation involves adjusting particular items of income or deduction for inflation. Partial indexation measures adopted by various other countries include: • Explicit indexation of the basis of depreciable property and of revenue account property in calculating capital gains. • Only taxing a portion of the interest (for example, 60%) as a rough proxy for indexation. 8.16 Inflation indexing depreciation deductions and sales of revenue account property or inflation indexing both these and inventories might be ways of both reducing higher EMTRs and also making EMTRs more consistent and neutral. 66 Several OECD countries, including Chile, Costa Rica, Iceland, Mexico, the Netherlands and Turkey, index depreciation deductions for inflation. 28 It would not reduce tax biases between debt and equity investment in companies with non-resident shareholders, and it would at times lead to investment subsidies. At the same time, it might be a more neutral way of promoting investment in depreciable assets than the accelerated depreciation schemes examined in chapter 7. As with accelerated depreciation measures, it would be less prone to reduce the progressivity and integrity of the personal tax system than a company tax rate cut. The appropriate index 8.17 If the tax system were to be indexed for inflation, using a general price index, such as the consumers price index (CPI), would seem likely to be the most appropriate price index to use. Ultimately all income is income of individuals and using the CPI would avoid overstating or understating the true incomes that individuals receive. 8.18 The Reserve Bank’s target range for CPI inflation is 1–3%. Therefore, one option might be to index the income tax base by 2% inflation, which would be in the centre of the range. 8.19 However, prices go up by different amounts. This allows consumers to substitute away from those goods and services that have increased in relative price towards those goods and services whose relative prices have declined. This means that the true cost of inflation to consumers will often be less than the measured increase in the CPI. It might be argued that this should be taken into account if the tax system is indexed. However, other indexation measures do not normally take this into account. We do not, for example, take this sort of effect into account when indexing social assistance for inflation. 8.20 Inflationary biases become large when inflation rates are high relative to interest rates. Currently the inflation rate is high and above the Reserve Bank’s target range. Interest rates are currently low, although they appear to be rising. The case for indexation will depend in part on what happens in the future. If the inflation rate is only temporarily high, and if interest rates are just temporarily low and rise significantly in the future, it might not be worthwhile to index the tax base for inflation given the complexities that this would involve. However, if higher rates of inflation and/or low interest rates continue in the future, there would be a stronger reason to consider whether indexation measures would be sensible, especially if accounting software packages make this more and more feasible. There might also be other possibilities. For example, reducing the target range for inflation from 1–3% to 0–2% might be an alternative approach for moderating the impacts of inflation, but clearly the monetary policy implications of such a change might dominate the tax neutrality aspects. 28 See the OECD’s Effective Tax Rates Explanatory Index, Corporate Effective Tax Rates Explanatory Annex (oecd.org) 67 Key questions to consider Q8.1: Might comprehensive indexation of the tax base, including indexation of interest, depreciation and trading stock, be worth considering further and does the answer depend on future inflation and interest rates? Q8.2: Might partial indexation of the tax base, including indexation of depreciation deductions or indexation of both depreciation deductions and trading stock, be worth considering further and does the answer depend on future inflation and interest rates? Q8.3: How do these measures compare with other ways of reducing higher EMTRs and reducing current tax distortions? 68 CHAPTER 9 Thin capitalisation • The deductibility of interest but not dividends creates incentives for multinational entities to use debt to finance investment into New Zealand subsidiaries, at least if investment is from countries with lower company tax rates. • To combat base erosion and profit shifting by multinationals, most countries (including New Zealand) have introduced thin capitalisation rules, where a deduction for the cost of debt above a debt percentage is denied. • However, thin capitalisation rules can push up costs of capital and EMTRs. • There is international evidence suggesting that thin capitalisation rules can have significant negative impacts on foreign direct investment and increase the tax rate elasticity of investments. • An increased safe harbour threshold would be a way of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs and promoting inbound investment. • It would do so without sacrificing tax on economic rents and without making it harder to levy progressive personal income taxes. • However, the changes are likely to promote inbound investment for only a minority of firms and not for firms facing the highest EMTRs at present. • Additional debt levels may trigger higher taxes overseas, making a higher thin capitalisation threshold an expensive way of promoting inbound investment. • A high threshold could result in inbound investment subsidies. Introduction 9.1 Current tax settings allow taxpayers a deduction for interest but not for dividends paid. This is not a major issue when considering investment decisions for companies owned solely by New Zealand residents, as New Zealand’s imputation tax credit regime effectively makes the corporate income tax a withholding tax and reduces debt/equity biases for such firms. 29 However, multinationals investing into New Zealand may often be able to lower their worldwide tax liability by increasing debt levels in New Zealand. This will be the case if the multinational is based in a country with a lower company tax rate than New Zealand. Interest paid to the foreign parent will reduce tax paid in New Zealand by more than it increases tax paid abroad. 9.2 The distinction between debt and equity is largely arbitrary in related-party situations. This is because the overall risk to a parent company is not generally 29 If taxed profits were fully distributed and taxed at the shareholders’ tax rates each year, there would be no debt-equity bias for firms owned by New Zealand residents. There can, however, be a timing tax bias favouring equity finance when the company tax rate is less than the tax rates of shareholders and profits are retained in a company for several years before being distributed as dividends. 69 affected by choices between these two methods of financing the operation of subsidiaries when the funding is being advanced by related parties. Multinational entities may sometimes be able to reduce their worldwide tax liability by having a subsidiary borrow from the parent, or another subsidiary, and then pay part of their return to the parent as deductible interest rather than as a non-deductible dividend. Alternatively, the corporate group could lower the amount of tax it pays in a jurisdiction by having a subsidiary in that jurisdiction take on a disproportionately large share of borrowing from third parties. 9.3 The arbitrary nature of the distinction means that, in the absence of any restrictions, a subsidiary could be financed almost exclusively with debt. This might lead to interest deductions offsetting most or all income otherwise taxable in that jurisdiction. 9.4 New Zealand currently has a relatively high corporate income tax rate when compared to other OECD countries. Therefore, there could often be a tax advantage in a multinational enterprise using a much higher proportion of debt to finance its New Zealand operations than is true for the worldwide enterprise. Thin capitalisation rules 9.5 To address excessive profit shifting, many countries have ‘thin capitalisation’ rules, including New Zealand. New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules aim to limit the amount of interest deductions against the New Zealand tax base and apply to inbound investment by a non-resident. 9.6 If the debt level of a corporate group or other taxpayer exceeds prescribed levels, the thin capitalisation rules deem the excess debt to be an item of income, effectively denying interest deductions. This can occur if both: • the New Zealand group’s debt percentage 30 is greater than the ‘safe harbour’ of 60%, 31 and • the New Zealand group’s debt percentage is greater than 110% of the group’s worldwide debt percentage. 32 9.7 The rules apply to foreign-controlled companies but not to domestic companies. They disallow interest deductions if the debt percentage of the New Zealand group exceeds 110% of the worldwide group’s debt percentage. However, if the New Zealand debt percentage does not exceed the ‘safe harbour’ ratio of 60%, then the worldwide comparison is not needed, and all the interest may be deducted. This means that deductions for interest on debt-financed investments is unaffected until this 60% threshold is exceeded. 9.8 It should be noted that a case might be made for allowing New Zealand subsidiaries of foreign parents to have higher levels of debt than the worldwide group company. This can reduce costs of capital and help ensure that marginal inbound investment is not subject to high EMTRs. As was discussed in chapter 2, standard economic models would suggest that there is a 30 Calculated as debt/(debt+equity). 31 There is also a separate 75% safe harbour ratio for outbound investment. We do not discuss this further given our focus on inbound investment. 32 Debt percentage calculated using the multinational’s total group debt, total group assets, and total group non-debt liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice or the financial reporting standards of the country where the worldwide group’s consolidated financial accounts are prepared. 70 presumption against high EMTRs on marginal inbound investment. As will be discussed in chapter 10, some countries have introduced an allowance for corporate equity, and this has some similarities to allowing firms to be fully debt financed. At the same time, we have seen that, with high levels of debt financing, EMTRs may often be negative. In that case, investment can be subsidised, and this can be inefficient. International evidence on thin capitalisation rules and investment 9.9 Two international studies have investigated the effects of introducing, or tightening, thin capitalisation rules on investments. They have estimated it has a negative effect on employment and investment by multinational corporations, especially in high-tax host countries. This suggests that thin capitalisation rules may normally add to costs of capital and EMTR concerns in ways that we have not been able to model in our work in chapter 4. 9.10 De Mooij and Liu (2021) estimated that introducing thin capitalisation rules reduces the investment of multinational affiliates by an average of 20% where the average corporate income tax rate is 27%. The size of this effect depends on the corporate income tax rate and is larger at higher rates. 9.11 Similarly, Buettner et al (2014) estimated that introducing thin capitalisation rules, or making them tighter, can significantly reduce the level of foreign direct investment in high-tax countries. In addition, they estimated that foreign direct investment is about twice as sensitive to shifts in tax rates if typical thin capitalisation rules apply than if there are no restrictions. Concerns about excessive taxes on marginal inbound investment become larger the greater the responsiveness of investment to tax rates is. 9.12 This international analysis suggests that tight thin capitalisation rules may have a material impact on inbound investment. One potential way of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs would be to increase the thin capitalisation 60% safe harbour threshold. This would, however, increase the scope for multinationals to have much higher levels of debt in New Zealand than is true of the worldwide entity to shift tax payments out of New Zealand. Alternatively, if tight thin capitalisation rules are required to protect the tax base from profit shifting, there may be a greater case for considering whether concerns about high costs of capital and EMTRs on inbound marginal investment should be addressed in other ways. A variety of different possible ways of addressing cost of capital concerns are being canvassed in this briefing. Impact on costs of capital and EMTRs 9.13 Increasing the 60% thin capitalisation safe harbour threshold would increase debt levels for some foreign-controlled companies. This would reduce costs of capital and EMTRs for these firms. This would have no implications for the debt levels of domestic firms, which are not subject to the rules. 9.14 In chapter 4, we analysed EMTRs for foreign-controlled firms that are required to pay non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest payments to foreign parent companies. NRWT is normally levied at a rate of 10%, which is considerably higher than the 2% rate of approved issuer levy (AIL). Unlike AIL, NRWT is not deductible. 9.15 Whether payments of NRWT increase costs of capital depends on whether this NRWT is creditable against income tax paid in other countries. In this chapter, we focus on the case where NRWT is not creditable, which means that NRWT payments will tend to increase costs of capital. This can be thought of as a 71 worst case scenario. Domestic taxes will be pushing up costs of capital and this would not be the case if NRWT were creditable. 9.16 In table 9.1 we show EMTRs for firms investing in our various assets. First, we show EMTRs for a domestic company with marginal foreign shareholders with the average debt level of 43%. Second, we show EMTRs for foreign-controlled companies at different debt levels. We assume that 37.3% of debt is related- party debt, which was the average level from the data reported in appendix 2 of the Technical appendices. We consider debt levels of 0%, 43%, 60%, 75% and 100% for foreign-controlled firms, assuming interest is fully deductible in all cases. This shows what would happen if thin capitalisation rules were relaxed and this allowed foreign-controlled firms to take up these various debt levels.

This is consistent with data that has been provided in earlier chapters. • For foreign-controlled companies that are 43% debt financed, EMTRs vary between 29.4% and -19.5%. They are slightly higher than for domestic companies because interest payments to related parties in foreign- controlled companies are subject to NRWT rather than AIL. • As is discussed in appendix 2 of the Technical appendices, many foreign- controlled companies have no debt. These would have EMTRs varying between 39.1% and 0.0%. • As is also discussed in appendix 2 of the Technical appendices, there is limited evidence of foreign-controlled companies being clustered at the 60% thin capitalisation threshold. However, for firms that are, EMTRs would vary between 24.6% and -29.5%. These are the firms that would benefit from a higher thin capitalisation threshold. • Relaxing the thin capitalisation threshold to 75% would mean that firms that move to this new threshold would have EMTRs varying between 19.9% and -39.7%. 72 • Abandoning thin capitalisation rules completely would mean that foreign- controlled firms becoming fully debt financed would have EMTRs varying between 10.4% and -61.6%. • Relaxing or eliminating the thin capitalisation threshold would reduce EMTRs and costs of capital for foreign-controlled firms that want to take on more debt to benefit from interest deductibility but are constrained by the current threshold. However, these are not firms that face the highest EMTRs at present. Increasing the safe harbour threshold: policy considerations 9.18 There are pros and cons in increasing the safe harbour threshold. Pros 9.19 Removing the thin capitalisation rules entirely or increasing the safe harbour threshold would be ways of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs for some firms. This is likely to promote inbound investment and foreign direct investment. The international evidence suggests that the effects on inbound investment may be significant. It would have several potential advantages relative to other ways of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs. 9.20 An attraction of increasing the thin capitalisation safe harbour threshold is that it would not mean forgoing tax on economic rents. So long as interest is not being deducted at inflated rates, economic rents would continue to be taxed. Also, unlike cutting the company tax rate, it would not make it more difficult to maintain a progressive personal income tax structure if that is a key objective for future governments. A higher threshold would only be of benefit to foreign- controlled firms, so it would not undermine the role of the company tax in supporting personal income taxation. 9.21 If there were an intention to lower taxes on inbound foreign direct investment without reducing taxes on inbound investment more broadly, increasing the threshold might be particularly attractive. This is because it would be targeted at investment by foreign-controlled firms. However, this is only likely to be justified if it were thought that foreign direct investment brought in important spillover benefits or other wellbeing benefits not associated with other forms of inbound investment. In chapter 2, we questioned whether there was strong evidence of important productivity spillovers from foreign direct investment. Cons 9.22 Increasing the safe harbour would be reducing the effectiveness of the rules as a base-maintenance measure. Many would question whether it is fair to provide multinationals with greater scope to stream profits out of New Zealand and reduce their worldwide tax payments in the process. 9.23 Increasing the safe harbour would only benefit some firms. It would benefit foreign-controlled companies that are close to the thin capitalisation border and would like to take on more debt but are stopped from doing so by the thin capitalisation rules. However, these firms are already likely to be facing relatively low EMTRs and costs of capital. As table 9.1 above points out, EMTRs and costs of capital for these firms are likely to be significantly lower than for either foreign-controlled firms with low levels of debt or for domestic firms. This is likely to reduce rather than increase the neutrality of inbound investment. Productivity is likely to be supported more by tax measures that reduce costs of capital generally than by measures that reduce costs of capital for firms with relatively low EMTRs to start with. 73 9.24 An increase in the safe harbour may only affect a relatively small number of firms. There is limited evidence of firms being clustered close to the thin capitalisation safe harbour threshold (see table 9.2). An increase in the threshold is unlikely to have any effect on costs of capital and EMTRs for the large numbers of foreign-controlled firms that are well below it. Of course, not only would this reduce the effectiveness of the measure as a way of promoting investment, but it would also be likely to reduce the fiscal cost.

This is that increasing the thin capitalisation safe harbour threshold may be a relatively costly way of promoting inbound investment. When it leads to New Zealand subsidiaries being financed with more debt and less equity from a foreign parent, not only will this reduce tax paid in New Zealand, but it will often add to tax paid overseas. 9.26 For example, suppose a higher threshold leads to an extra $100 of interest being attracted from a country with a 20% company tax rate that provides credits for NRWT on interest levied in New Zealand. This reduces New Zealand tax by $18 (a reduction in company tax of $28 offset by an increase in NRWT of $10) but increases foreign tax by $10 (as the interest income is taxed at a rate of 20% but offset by an NRWT tax credit). Overall, the net benefit to the foreign investor would be a reduction in worldwide tax of $8, but this would be smaller than the drop in New Zealand tax. Thus, increasing the safe harbour threshold may be a relatively costly way of promoting inbound investment. 9.27 Finally, as has been discussed, at times debt-financed investment may face negative EMTRs and be subsidised by the tax system. For example, table 9.1 above shows that if firms were allowed to use 100% debt finance, EMTRs for several types of investment would be negative (and in the case of expensing is very negative). Allowing foreign-controlled firms to have very high levels of 33 In presenting this data, we ignore a relatively small group of 40 firms with negative or zero levels of equity. 74 debt finance would not just be reducing high positive EMTRs, it would sometimes be adding to investment subsidies. Other solutions 9.28 One disadvantage of increasing the safe harbour threshold is that increasing debt finance into New Zealand may often mean higher taxes paid overseas. This makes a higher threshold a relatively cost ineffective way of promoting investment. Also, a higher safe harbour threshold is only likely to be of benefit to foreign-controlled firms that are close to the safe harbour threshold initially. An alternative is an allowance for corporate equity. This would reduce the cost of capital on inbound investment without inducing firms to take on additional debt finance and apply to a much broader set of inbound investment. This is discussed in chapter 10. Key questions to consider Q9.1: Would it be sensible for the tax rules to be as neutral as possible between foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment or are there good grounds to promote one form of investment over another? If so, what should be promoted and why? Q9.2: Is the current 60% thin capitalisation safe harbour broadly reasonable? If not, should it be increased or decreased? 75 CHAPTER 10 Allowance for corporate equity • An allowance for corporate equity (ACE) allows companies a deduction at an imputed interest rate for the cost of equity finance. • At first sight, it would appear to have several attractions. • It aims to eliminate tax on marginal inbound investment while continuing to tax economic rents. • If it is applied only to incremental equity acquired after the tax is put in place, it might avoid windfalls to existing owners of shares in companies, and this would reduce the fiscal cost of the measure. • The interest rate used in the ACE calculation should, in principle, reflect the risk to a firm of being unable to claim deductions but some average interest rate would be likely to be used in practice. • The neutrality properties of the tax would depend heavily on how the equity base is defined. • To obtain full neutrality benefits, it would be necessary for the ACE to sometimes operate as an additional tax rather than as a tax deduction. • If a tax policy goal is to tax individuals on both their capital and labour income, it would seem difficult to integrate an ACE with the personal tax system unless ga ins on shares were subject to full rates of personal tax. Introduction 10.1 Current tax settings allow companies a deduction for the cost of debt but not for the cost of equity. An allowance for corporate equity (ACE) grants companies a notional interest deduction for their equity. For example, if a company has $1,000 of equity and the interest rate that applies to notional interest deductions is 5%, the company would be able to claim a deduction of $50. 10.2 Providing an ACE would be one way of reducing the relatively high costs of capital and effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) that New Zealand imposes on inbound investment (discussed in chapter 3). At the same time, a potential danger exists of going beyond the point of merely reducing high EMTRs and instead generating tax subsidies with negative EMTRs. The OECD analysis suggested that several countries with ACE systems, including Italy, Belgium and Poland, had very negative EMTRs on inbound investment. 10.3 An ACE could also reduce or eliminate debt-equity biases for foreign-owned firms. As discussed in chapter 4, costs of capital and EMTRs can be substantially higher for equity-financed investment than for debt-financed and allowing a notional interest deduction would alleviate these biases. Policy objectives 10.4 A key objective for an ACE is to remove tax on marginal inbound investment and make EMTRs as close to zero as possible. 76 10.5 A strong case for an ACE was made by Griffith, Hines and Sørensen (2010) (GHS) in a chapter written for the Mirrlees Review in the United Kingdom. GHS suggested this as an approach that has been adopted in some countries that would respond to the growing openness of the UK economy. It is a possible way of addressing many of the concerns that were discussed in chapter 2. 10.6 An ACE would aim to remove tax on marginal inbound investments and make EMTRs as close to zero as possible. At the same time, it would aim to continue to tax economic rents. It is often suggested that the ACE apply only to new equity that is issued after the tax comes into force to minimise the fiscal cost of the tax change and windfall benefits to existing firms. While this is attractive in principle, we suspect that this might not be feasible for New Zealand without significant other changes to our tax system. 10.7 By creating greater neutrality in the tax treatment of debt and equity investment into New Zealand, an ACE would reduce financing biases. This would be likely to increase economic efficiency and productivity. 10.8 As well as aiming to remove tax on marginal inbound investments and make EMTRs as close to zero as possible, GHS argue that an ACE would eliminate the distortions associated with the misalignment between economic depreciation and depreciation for tax purposes. GHS argue that, under conventional systems of business taxation, accelerated depreciation measures can distort the behaviour of firms and end up subsidising investment (p.975 ff). This can induce low-productivity investment, which would not be attractive in the absence of tax. They argue that an attraction of an ACE system is that it eliminates these distortions. 10.9 Any increase in depreciation will reduce the equity against which an allowance under ACE is calculated. This reduces the ACE allowance by an amount that should, at least in principle, exactly offset any benefits derived from the accelerated depreciation. Regardless of the rate at which firms write down their assets in the tax accounts, the present value of the sum of the capital allowance and the ACE should always equal the initial investment outlay. Therefore, for a fully equity-financed investment, the ACE system is intended to be equivalent to the immediate expensing of investment allowed under a cash flow tax. 77 Example 10.1 Suppose that the tax code allows a taxpayer to bring forward $100 of depreciation from year 2 to year 1. Assuming a tax rate of 28%, their tax liability is reduced by $28 in year 1. In year 2, the taxpayer is not able to claim the $100 depreciation as they claimed it in year 1. Their taxable earnings in year 2 are therefore $100 higher than they otherwise would have been, and their tax liability increases by $28. Assuming a discount rate of 5%, the taxpayer has gained $1.40 by deferring the payment of the $28 to year 2. 34 However, the equity base used for calculating an ACE liability is increased by retained profits from tax accounts. We assume that the tax saving of $28 leads to a matching $28 increase in dividends so that real funds for investment are unchanged. As taxable earnings fall by $100, retained earnings is reduced by $100 in year 1 and the equity base for ACE in year 2 is also reduced by $100. If the imputed rate of return allowed under ACE is also 5%, then the taxpayer deduction under ACE is reduced by $5. This increases their tax liability in year 2 by a further $1.40. Thus, the tax benefit from accelerated depreciation is exactly offset by the fall in the future ACE allowance. This is assumed to be matched by a reduction in dividends of $29.40 in year 2. This means that the rate at which companies write down their assets does not matter for the present value of the taxes they pay. 10.10 This neutrality example requires that the imputed interest charge reflects the company’s discount rate used to discount future depreciation deductions. As will be discussed below, it also requires the equity base to be able to become negative and to then lead to an ACE liability for this neutrality result to hold. 10.11 Lastly, an ACE system will also influence corporate debt policy. By allowing a deduction for equity financing, it could potentially introduce funding neutrality to the current tax system, thereby reducing or eliminating the debt bias. Design issues Rate of allowance 10.12 The efficacy of an ACE in alleviating tax on marginal inbound investment and eliminating the debt bias depends on the allowed rate of notional deduction. 10.13 In principle, the interest rate used might not necessarily need to include a premium for risk and it might be appropriate to allow a deduction for only the risk-free nominal interest rate (that is, the interest rate of long-term government bonds). This would be the case if losses could be carried forward with interest and were certain to be used at some stage in the future, as is discussed in Bond and Devereux (1995). 10.14 However, in practice, firms will often receive less than the present value of their losses, so GHS argue that it would be appropriate to add a risk premium to the interest rate used. 10.15 Under an ACE system, any equity invested will increase the amount the company is allowed to deduct in all future years on a fully equity-financed 34 This is because $28 x 0.05 = $1.40. Paying the tax bill in year 2, rather than year 1, has a future (year 2 value) of $1.40. 78 investment by the amount invested multiplied by the ACE rate. If the value of these deductions is discounted at the same rate, the present value of the additional ACE deductions will equal the amount of equity invested. Thus, the taxpayer ends up receiving the same deduction as if they had been allowed a deduction for the equity invested up front. The premium added to the ACE rate should therefore reflect the risk faced by individual firms in being able to make these future deductions. 10.16 This is also necessary if the ACE is to eliminate the distortions associated with the misalignment between economic depreciation and depreciation for tax purposes. 10.17 Tax authorities are unlikely to know the risk faced by each individual firm, so an average risk premium would seem the only viable option. This would compromise some of the tax neutrality properties of an ACE. GHS argue that the best practical approach could be to use an average interest rate on corporate bonds. 10.18 Most countries with ACE systems have either used rates linked to the yields on government bonds, normally with some additional risk premium, or commercial interest rates. Hebous and Klemm (2019) provide details on the rules used in different countries that have had ACE systems. ACE base 10.19 One question is how the ACE base should best be defined. GHS suggest that the equity base be calculated as follows: “Equity base in the previous year + taxable profits in the previous year (gross of the ACE allowance) + dividends received + net new equity issues – tax payable on taxable profits in the previous year – dividends paid – net new acquisitions of shares in other companies = Equity base for the current year” 10.20 There are several points to note. First, this approach is aimed at removing tax on marginal investments into New Zealand and achieving investment neutrality across assets. As was illustrated in example 10.1, an important part of making this work is to add in taxable profits when calculating changes in the base from year to year. This approach is also aimed at achieving neutrality between debt and equity financing. It does this by aligning EMTRs for equity-financed corporate investments with assets that can be expensed. In this case, the EMTR for all equity-financed investments would be zero. Likewise, if not for non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) and approved issuer levy (AIL), the EMTRs for debt-financed investments would all be zero. As EMTRs on fully debt-financed investments are normally negative, this means increasing the tax impost on debt-financed investment. 10.21 Further, acquisitions of shares in other companies should be subtracted from the equity base. This is to avoid double counting. For example, if company A is set up with $100 of equity and uses this to purchase share capital in company B, the same $100 should not be counted twice as equity in both companies. For 79 ACE purposes, it is necessary to subtract new acquisitions of shares so that company A ends up with zero, while company B ends up with $100. Share purchases in foreign companies would also be subtracted, because income derived by a parent company from such firms would typically be non-taxable. If company A was financed with $50 of share capital and $50 of debt and used this to purchase the shares in company B, then it would have an ACE basis of –$50 and would need to be subject to an imputed interest charge on the –$50 of equity for the GHS approach to work. Thus, under the GHS approach, the ACE deduction might sometimes be negative and adding to a company’s tax liability. 10.22 This seems central to the GHS approach. It is necessary for the ACE system to be increasing the tax impost on debt-financed investment. We have seen that under current tax settings, fully debt-financed investment will normally generate negative EMTRs. With an ACE, these EMTRs would become zero, which means a higher tax liability than at present. Debt-financed investment into an asset that can be expensed would provide an immediate deduction for the cost of the asset. This would reduce the equity base or turn it negative. Debt- financed investment into firms that make tax losses for several years before moving into a tax profit would also tend to generate negative equity bases. Transition to an ACE 10.23 An ACE might, in principle, be applied either to all equity in a company or only to equity acquired after the date that the ACE is implemented. An attraction of applying it only to additional equity built up after the time when an ACE is introduced is that this would limit the cost of the scheme. It would also minimise windfall gains to existing companies. 10.24 As we understand it, most ACE systems are based on additional equity acquired after the initial implementation date. This provides obvious incentives for a firm to be wound up and then reborn in a different entity in which new equity qualifies for the ACE deduction. GHS argue that the incentives for this to happen may be attenuated by other taxes if companies are wound up. However, the other taxes that GHS point to are capital gains taxes. This may make it more difficult for countries like New Zealand, without a capital gains tax, to limit deductions only to what is, in reality, new equity. Anti-avoidance 10.25 The issue of the potential abuse of ACE systems has been raised in policy discussions. Indeed, Hebous and Ruf (2017) found that the increases in equity following the introduction of the Belgian ACE were largely earmarked for intra- group lending and for creating deductions to shelter other sources of interest earnings. 10.26 They found that a unilateral implementation of an ACE system creates an opportunity for multinational entities to implement ‘double-dipping’ structures. This is where capital is injected as equity into an affiliate in a country with an ACE system who then lends that capital to another affiliate in a country without an ACE system. The borrower affiliate receives a deduction for interest paid on the loan, while the lender affiliate receives a deduction under the ACE system. 10.27 In addition, the borrower affiliate can invest the loan into yet another affiliate in a country with an ACE system, thereby doubling (or ‘cascading’) the received allowance corresponding to any given amount of equity. 10.28 The tax avoidance concerns outlined in this section would mean that ACE reforms might need to be accompanied by anti-avoidance provisions targeting intra-company transactions. We note that the implementation of the global 80 minimum taxation regime established by Pillar Two may mitigate these concerns. Integration with the personal tax system 10.29 A policy concern with an ACE, and quite possibly a fatal difficulty for such a tax at least in the short run, is how to integrate it with personal taxes. So long as individuals are being taxed on both their capital and labour income, it would be necessary to have additional taxes at the shareholder level if investment through companies is not to create an obvious tax avoidance loophole. For example, rather than an individual earning money in a bank account and paying tax on interest earned each year as funds accumulate, the individual could set up a company that puts the money into a bank account. Because of the ACE deduction, there would be no tax on the interest income accumulating in the company’s bank account. If there is no tax on gains in shares and the individual subsequently sells the shares in the company for a tax-free capital gain, no tax would have been paid on the interest. 10.30 GHS suggest two possible personal tax systems that could be integrated with an ACE system. The first is what they describe as an income tax regime. This is a dual income tax system as described in chapter 12. The second is a personal consumption tax that exempts individuals from tax on their capital income. If income is to be taxed at the personal level, GHS suggest taxing both dividends and capital gains at full personal rates. In the absence of a tax on share gains, it would seem difficult to integrate this tax with New Zealand’s personal income tax base. Land and property and rents capitalised in prices 10.31 In the absence of good integration between an ACE and personal taxes, there would be considerable scope for individuals to put assets they own, such as rental properties, into companies. If properties are acquired by the companies at market value, the value is likely to reflect the capitalised value of future earnings. Most, or all, future rental income would escape personal tax. Key questions to consider Q10.1: If problems of integration with personal taxes could be resolved, would an ACE be a viable tax reform option if governments wish to reduce EMTRs and make investment decisions more neutral? Q10.2: Are there viable ways of integrating an ACE with personal taxes and, if so, what are they? Q10.3: If an ACE system were to be introduced, would it be viable to levy a tax on firms with negative equity? If not, would the neutrality properties of the tax be sufficiently compromised for this to be an unattractive option? 81 CHAPTER 11 Incentives for specific businesses or industries • The main objective of this policy option is to favour specific industries or activities where it is believed there will be too little of these industries or activities without an incentive. • Reasons for incentives include the possibility of positive externalities or that the incentives may bring some desirable activity to New Zealand that is particularly sensitive to tax. • Downsides of tax incentives are that this reduces the neutrality of the tax system and, unless incentives are very cleverly targeted, this can divert investment into less productive areas and encourage lobbying. • Questions can also be raised about whether there should be surtaxes on certain activities. • New Zealand’s general approach for many years has been (with a few exceptions) to keep the tax base as broad and neutral as possible. • This chapter questions whether there are good grounds for changing this approach. Introduction 11.1 One way of reducing the cost of capital is to target favourable tax treatment to specific businesses or industries. This is usually promoted on one or more of the following premises: • We are competing with other countries for a particular type of activity, and a specific tax incentive is a cost-effective way of attracting that activity while keeping taxes higher on other businesses. • There are positive externalities from the activity, and it will therefore be underprovided by the market unless it is subsidised through a specific tax incentive. • The activity is important to the future of the economy, and future living standards will be higher if we get more of the activity now by subsidising it with a specific tax incentive. 11.2 In the context of a model looking at effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs), a specific incentive can lower the cost of capital by lowering the tax rate applied to income from the investment, or by accelerating or increasing depreciation deductions for the investment. 11.3 A typical list of tax incentives is provided by Klemm: • Tax holidays (a temporary exemption from particular taxes). • Special zones (geographically limited areas where various tax exemptions are applied). 82 • Investment tax credit (immediate tax credit similar to New Zealand’s current R&D tax credit for investment, potentially with refundability). • Investment allowance (immediate deduction for investment, but its value depends on the tax rate for the firm). • Accelerated depreciation (depreciation at a faster rate than generally applied). • Reduced tax rates. • Exemptions from various taxes. • Financing incentives (for example, reduced withholding taxes on dividends) Pros 11.4 At times investment may generate positive externalities (that is, spillover benefits to other firms or individuals). This can provide a case for a tax subsidy for that type of investment. This is the justification for the current R&D tax credit. A concern is that, in the absence of some subsidy for the investment, there may be too little investment undertaken because some of the benefits from R&D are captured not by the firm undertaking the investment but by other firms in New Zealand. If a tax subsidy is justified on those grounds, it is important that the measure addresses a specific market failure, that the market failure is not driven by other poor regulatory settings and that providing a tax incentive is the best way of addressing the issue. 11.5 Another possible argument for incentives is that, if targeted to mobile investment, investment might be attracted without reducing activity in other areas. 11.6 By targeting specific industries, a case can be made that, overall, tax competition might be less damaging because it allows higher general tax rates. 11.7 Another perspective is not to look at this approach as a system that has low rates for specific industries or activities, but rather as having a low cost of capital for industries generally, while levying higher tax rates on particularly immobile tax bases. This approach (levying higher tax rates on immobile tax bases), has been followed to some degree in a country like Norway (with very high taxes on oil and gas but a broad-based low-rate system generally). Cons Moving away from a broad-based low-rate system 11.8 The underlying logic of a broad-based low-rate system is that the most profitable pre-tax investments are the most productive investments. That is, they generate the most income for a given investment cost. New Zealand is likely to have the lowest cost tax system (for a given amount of revenue) if it ensures that the tax system is distorting the choice of which investments by as little as possible. In chapter 2, we discussed some general benefits of neutrality in tax settings. 11.9 The primary weakness of specific incentives is that they create distortions to the economy through preferential treatment. This can have indirect costs even 83 if the investment would not have taken place but for the incentive. This will happen if the favoured investment or activity crowds out other investment or activity that is taxed at the general rate. Normally this would be expected to reduce economic efficiency and productivity relative to providing more neutral tax cuts that cost a similar amount. 11.10 Specific incentives (a move towards a narrow-based high-rate system) would make sense if the government were able to somehow know that, although an investment was less profitable pre-tax than other investments, it was nevertheless more in New Zealand’s interests for the investment to be undertaken, and if there were no better instrument to address this presumed market failure other than the tax incentive. The key weakness is about the ability and incentives to gather that knowledge. 11.11 As noted in the 2001 McLeod review, arguments for favourable tax treatment due to positive externalities or other benefits can become “a platform for practically any lobbyist’s reform agenda”. 35 When low taxes on specific businesses or industries might be in New Zealand’s best interests 11.12 There can be cases where it makes sense for a country (for example, New Zealand) to undercut a different country’s tax rate to try to attract investment that can happen in one country or another (but not both). This will be the case where this lures highly productive firms to New Zealand with substantial economic rents that they can earn in New Zealand or in other countries, and where that investment does not draw investment away from other, higher pre- tax return investments in the attracting country (that is, New Zealand). 11.13 Low taxes are most effective where a tax base is very mobile. That is, the firm has an economic rent it can earn, but it can earn that same level of rent regardless of where it operates. If a tax incentive, such as a low company tax rate for certain businesses or industries, lured firms with large firm specific rents to locate and grow and expand in New Zealand, this could potentially be in New Zealand’s best interests. There would be both the direct revenue benefits of company tax that would otherwise not be collected and potentially wider skills which might be passed on to other firms which would support productivity and growth. Correctly identifying these businesses or industries is likely to be challenging. When low taxes on specific businesses or industries are unlikely to be in New Zealand’s best interests. 11.14 Low taxes on specific businesses or industries will not be in New Zealand’s best interests when there are large economic rents to be earned while operating in New Zealand, but they are location specific and only arise if the firm operates within New Zealand. 11.15 When there are large location-specific rents, some countries apply higher taxes to the business or activity. A specific extreme example is petroleum resources in Norway. The ordinary company rate in Norway is 22%, but the additional tax on cash flow principles on petroleum resources is applied at a rate of 56%, giving a total rate of 78%. 36 35 See paragraph 2.12 of the final report, McLeod Review (2021). 36 Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. The Petroleum Tax System. https://www.norskpetroleum.no/en/economy/petroleum-tax 84 11.16 In one sense, investment in petroleum extraction ‘competes’ with all other investments available to international investors. However, applying a 78% tax rate may still be a sensible policy because the firm must be in Norway to earn the returns, and those returns are so high that, even after this tax, the investment earns sufficient returns to still attract investment. 11.17 Norway has decided it makes sense to move away from an otherwise broad- based low-rate approach for this specific industry because of the level of economic rent available to firms operating in the industry. This is even though it is a capital-intensive industry with global competition. 11.18 Note that even though there are plenty of other countries with petroleum resources, Norway is not ‘competing’ with these other countries, because it is not an either/or question. A firm may appreciate a much lower tax rate in a different country, but it does not have to choose whether to operate in Norway or another country. It can operate and extract and sell petroleum from both countries. Provided the after-tax return in Norway has a positive net present value, it would make sense to operate in both countries, even when the non- Norway country had a more ‘competitive’ tax rate. 11.19 It is challenging to identify areas in New Zealand where location-specific rents are likely to be highest, let alone to design and enforce different tax rates for different activities. Applying higher tax rates where location-specific rents are significant might be easier in an economy with one or two sectors earning high location-specific rents, rather than in an economy where these rents are likely to be much more diffuse and harder to identify. 11.20 In his survey of specific incentives and the literature surrounding them, Klemm (2010) provides a pithy conclusion that summarises his scepticism about the ability to target tax rates in a beneficial way: Even if a tax incentive can be useful in principle, a country may be well advised to refrain from introducing one. This reflects the advantage of a coherent and simple tax system, which cannot take account of all issues, especially since they may be changing over time. Moreover, once a system has created the precedence of an exemption for one particular sector or region, the pressure for further ones will increase. The ultimate outcome may be a less efficient tax system, even if a few of the incentives used have a sound economic rationale and are cost-effective. International experience 11.21 Tax incentives for specific businesses or industries are common overseas. The OECD’s publication, Tax Policy Reforms 2020: OECD and Selected Partner Economies, 37 gives a sense of the sorts of activities and investment that draw special incentives: • In the USA, tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel, electricity produced from certain renewable sources and alternative fuels have been extended. • In Mexico, tax relief for Special Economic Zones has been repealed, but future tax policies are intended to focus on projects rather than regions. 37 OECD. (2020). Tax Policy Reforms 2020: OECD and Selected Partner Economies. OECD Publishing, Paris. https://doi.org/10.1787/7af51916-en 85 • In Korea, tax credits for investments made have been simplified. Previous incentives were more restricted, targeting facilities for (among other activities) research and testing, vocational training, safety, energy saving, and new growth-engine technology commercialisation. The new regime has a ‘negative list system’ 38 that excludes, rather than includes, specified industries and assets. 11.22 In general, specific incentives are particularly common in developing countries, where governments are often trying to balance taxing location-specific rents (for example, mining) at higher rates with attracting other industries with specific incentives. 11.23 Reviews of tax incentives overseas tend to point to a lack of cost-effectiveness (that is, limited additional investment given the fiscal cost) and the risk of rent seeking and corruption, although this is usually in the context of countries that may already suffer from those problems. 39 Key questions to consider Q11.1: Are there specific businesses or industries where spillovers are large enough to justify lower tax rates? Q11.2: Are there specific businesses or industries where economic rents are large enough to justify higher tax rates to fund lower general business tax rates? Q11.3: Are there any other arguments for specific incentives? 38 PwC. (2022).Worldwide Tax Summaries Online.

Introduction 12.1 A ‘dual income tax system’ is a system where capital income is taxed separately (at lower rates) from labour income. 12.2 The tax systems in the Nordic countries are generally described as ‘dual income tax systems’: high progressive tax rates are applied to labour income (for example, salaries, wages) while relatively low tax rates are generally applied to capital income (for example, interest, capital gains). In contrast, New Zealand’s income tax system is more of a ‘comprehensive income tax system’, under which capital income is generally taxed at the same rate as labour income, although there are some notable exceptions (for example, PIE income is taxed at a top rate of 28%, and capital gains not specified in legislation as taxable are generally non-taxable). 12.3 According to Sørensen (2005), a pure dual income tax system has the following features: • A flat uniform personal tax on all forms of capital income (including capital gains), levied at a rate equal to the corporate income tax rate. • Full relief for the double taxation of corporate equity income. • A broad tax base for capital income and corporate income. 87 • A basic tax rate on labour income (equal to the capital income tax rate) combined with a progressive surtax on high labour income. Example 12.1 Assume that: • the corporate, basic labour, and flat personal tax rates are 20%, and • the progressive surtax on labour income is 16% on labour income over $100,000 – thus labour income over and above $100,000 is taxed at a total marginal tax rate of 36%. A taxpayer has $160,000 of salary income, $5,000 of interest income from personal investments, and $15,000 of capital losses. This taxpayer does not have any shares, so the technical details of how corporate equity income is taxed in the shareholders hands is ignored. This taxpayer would be taxed in the following way: • The taxpayer’s general net income would be $160,000 + $5,000 - $15,000, or $150,000. • Tax on this amount would be $30,000, which is 20% of $150,000. • The taxpayer would also be liable for the surtax percentage points of tax on the $60,000 salary income. • This is additional tax of $9,600. • Total tax for the taxpayer in this case is $39,600. 12.4 None of the Nordic tax systems have all the features outlined by Sørensen. Norway’s system probably comes closest. 40 12.5 The Nordic systems all make explicit distinctions between types of income, with earned or personal income taxed differently from capital income. Further divisions exist within these two broad categories, particularly for dividends and capital gains. 12.6 The corporate tax rates in the Nordic countries are generally low – between 20% to 22%. 41 In contrast, the personal tax rates are very high, with top marginal tax rates ranging from around 46% to 55%. 12.7 The corporate tax rates are not generally aligned with the tax rates on capital income, and the tax rates on capital income are not completely flat and uniform either. For example, Iceland taxes capital gains, dividends and interest at 22% (with a tax-free threshold for interest), but it taxes rental income at effectively 11%, 42 and both Finland and Denmark tax capital income progressively. 40 For example, Sweden’s and Iceland’s corporate tax rates differ from their capital income tax rates; Norway does not provide full double tax relief for corporate equity income; Finland and Denmark do not apply a flat tax to capital income. 41 Apart from Norway, the Nordic countries’ corporate tax bases appear to be narrower than New Zealand’s (despite the larger differential between corporate and personal tax rates). New Zealand’s company tax collected 4.0% of GDP in 2019 and Norway’s collected 5.7% of GDP, while the other Nordic countries’ corporate tax only collected between 2.1% to 3.0% of GDP. 42 Fifty percent of rental income is taxed at 22%, with the remaining 50% exempt. 88 12.8 Different reasons have been put forward for taxing capital income at a lower rate than labour income. As we see it, the main considerations seem to be: 43 • to maintain a reasonably low cost of capital for foreign investors while collecting high levels of tax • to maintain a progressive personal tax system with potentially a significantly higher top rate than New Zealand’s current top rate of 39% • concerns that applying high top marginal tax rates to personal capital income may lead to excessive distortions or to excessive evasion of tax • enthusiasm for, or at least a willingness to accept, a low tax rate on capital income as a quid pro quo for quite steeply progressive tax rates on labour incomes. 12.9 One concern about taxing the capital incomes of domestic residents at very high rates is that this can distort intertemporal consumption decisions and cause people to save too little for the future. Up until recently (and at the time dual income tax systems were being put in place), the conventional wisdom held by many economists was that taxing the capital incomes of domestic residents at all was likely to be particularly inefficient. 44 More recent analysis has questioned the robustness of these results, and some analysts have suggested high and progressive taxes on wealth or capital incomes. 45 Scheuer and Slemrod (2020) puts it as follows: “We point out that the former conventional wisdom – that an optimal tax system would feature no taxes on capital income – has been overturned.” It is fair to say that concerns about intertemporal consumption distortions are probably more muted now than they were when Nordic countries adopted their dual income tax systems. Nonetheless, there is no presumption that capital incomes should necessarily be taxed at the same rates as labour incomes. 12.10 A second concern is that capital income taxes can produce significant distortions because different forms of capital income, such as income from housing and interest income, are taxed very differently. As a result, taxes on capital incomes may be particularly distortionary. 12.11 A third concern is the way that capital income tax distortions can be increased because of inflation and the taxation of inflationary gains. This can compound intertemporal consumption distortions and biases between different types of saving. 12.12 A fourth concern is that capital incomes may be particularly hard to tax and prone to tax evasion by taxpayers concealing wealth offshore. International agreements on the automatic exchange of information (AEOI) between countries will have helped to moderate some of these concerns. At the same time new innovations, such as blockchain, may be making it harder for tax authorities to find out about taxable incomes. It is hard to predict now how these pressures are likely to change in the future. 43 See also Sørenson, P.B. (2007). 44 Key papers are Atkinson, A. and Stiglitz, J. (1976); Chamley, C. (1986). Optimal taxation of capital income in general equilibrium with infinite lives. Econometrica, 54, 607-622; and Judd, K. (1985). Redistributive taxation in a simple perfect foresight model. Journal of Public Economics, 28, 59-83. 45 See, for example, Straub, L. and Werning, I. (2020), which argues that standard models did not establish what many claimed they established, and Saez, E. and Zucman, G. (2019). which argues for high and progressive taxes on wealth. 89 12.13 A fifth concern is the way in which high tax rates on capital income could increase the benefits of interest deductions, especially in times of inflation. 12.14 It is hard to know now if these sorts of concerns are likely to become pressing in New Zealand. If they do, a dual income tax approach is something to be considered. At the same time, measures that reduce taxes on capital incomes can obviously end up reducing taxes on some of the wealthiest in society, so there are complex fairness concerns to work through. 12.15 If New Zealand wished to move in the dual income tax direction, there are several ways of achieving this, including increasing the rate of GST and using the revenue raised to reduce income taxes or provide payments to households. If this were done in a way that delivers more benefit to those on lower incomes than on higher incomes, this might be done without reducing the overall progressivity of the tax system. 12.16 The Nordic countries collect very high levels of tax. In 2019, Denmark collected the most tax as a proportion of GDP (46.3%), followed by Sweden (42.9%) and Finland (42.2%). Norway (39.9%) and Iceland (36.1%) collected the least. In comparison, New Zealand’s tax take was 32.3% of GDP. 46 12.17 Despite such high levels of tax, the Nordic countries’ corporate tax rates are all lower than New Zealand’s (see table 12.1). The reasonably low corporate tax rates allow the Nordic countries to maintain reasonably low costs of capital for foreign investors. At the same time, dual income taxes allow the Nordic countries to levy high taxes on labour income 47 without too much distortion. Table 12.1: Nordic countries’ tax rates Country Corporate tax rates Personal/earned income tax rates Capital income rates Sweden 21.4% Around 30% to 52%. Figures include municipal taxes of around 32% but not social security contributions. Social security contributions are around 30% but are capped at around NZ$6,000 and can be credited against other taxes. 25% for dividends, interest, capital gains and rental income. Dividends are double taxed (no imputation). Norway 22% Around 30% to 46%. Figures include national insurance of 8.2%. 22% on interest, royalties, rental and capital gains other than on shares. 31.68% for dividends and capital gains on shares, which are double taxed with an RRA deduction allowed (explained below). 46 OECD Revenue Statistics 2020. 47 In the case of Norway, on economic rents as well. 90 Country Corporate tax rates Personal/earned income tax rates Capital income rates Finland 20% Around 17% to 55%.

Figures include municipal taxes and social security (6.85%). 22% on capital gains and dividends, interest and rent. There is a tax-free threshold for interest and only 50% of rent is taxed. Pros and cons Reducing the cost of capital 12.18 Many of the strengths and weaknesses of a dual income tax system that relate to the lower cost of capital through a lower corporate tax rate are identical to the strengths and weaknesses of lowering the company tax rate, outlined in chapter 6. 12.19 In the context of an exercise looking at costs of capital, the primary strength of a dual income tax system is that it allows a lower cost of capital, but it still allows greater taxation of domestic residents’ labour and capital income (where that capital income earns a higher than risk-free return). One important difference is that cutting the company tax rate and doing nothing else would tend to make the tax system less progressive. This is because those on higher incomes would obtain greater benefits by sheltering personal income in companies. A dual income tax is one way of allowing a company tax cut but supporting this with other measures that support the integrity and progressivity of the personal tax system. These include measures to integrate the corporate tax system with the personal tax system, possibly including a capital gains tax on shareholders. 12.20 As set out above, a lower tax rate on corporate income also reduces the effect of non-neutralities in the capital income base (for example, depreciation schedules that do not match economic depreciation), potentially reduces avoidance and evasion, and reduces tax distortions to saving. Other aspects of the regime ensure that the portion of nominal income reflecting inflation is taxed less under a dual income tax system than a comprehensive income tax system. At the same time there are some complex design issues and distributional issues to consider. 91 Issues with the distinction between labour income and capital income 12.21 The distinction between labour income and capital income can be very difficult to draw. Broadly speaking, labour income is earned from performing services (for example, wages, salaries) whereas capital income is earned from investment (for example, ordinary business income, interest, dividends, capital ga ins). 12.22 However, items that are typically considered ‘capital income’ may also include a labour component. For example, part of the capital gain from buying and selling a property may include value added by labour spent fixing up the property. Similarly, capital gains and dividends from closely held companies may include a component that is properly attributable to work performed by a shareholder-employee in the company who is paid a below-market wage or salary. 12.23 It therefore seems inevitable that a subjective distinction between labour and capital will be complex and give rise to outcomes that at times appear inconsistent or arbitrary and create distortions. This is even in the absence of any tax avoidance or minimisation behaviour. A dual income tax system, therefore, cannot rely solely on anti-avoidance rules that consider the ‘true substance’ of income to work out if it is capital or revenue. Such subjective rules can only be a backstop at best. Norway illustrates an attempt at more objective ‘income splitting’ rules. Income-splitting rules 12.24 An initial question is how to tax the capital incomes of sole traders and partnerships where the return comprises both capital and labour income. In principle, there are two potential approaches for splitting income between the capital income and labour income components. 12.25 One is to identify labour income by attempting to value the labour services that are being provided and then to treat the residual as capital income. A key problem with that approach is that it seems impractical to value the labour services that are being contributed. 12.26 The second approach, and what is used in practice, is to attempt to value the capital income component and to treat the residual as labour income. This can be done by attempting to value capital assets employed in a business and imputing a standard return on these as capital income. Everything else is treated as labour income and subject to higher progressive marginal tax rates. This means that if someone has a very smart idea and can generate economic rents, these rents will be taxed as labour income. 12.27 In calculating capital income, Norway allows an imputed interest rate known as the rate of return allowance (RRA) on the value of capital in the business to be taxed as capital income. The RRA, which is currently around 1.3%, is based on interest rates on government bonds and is practically risk free. 48 This income (along with forms of passive capital income, such as interest and rents) is taxed at 22%. Other income is taxed as labour income and subject to higher progressive income tax rates. 48 The RRA is based on the 3-month interest rate for Treasury Bills: https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/taxes/get-the-taxes-right/shares-and-securities/about- shares-and-securities/the-shareholder-model/ 92 12.28 Before 2006, Norway had mandatory income-splitting rules for sole traders, partners and closely held companies with active owners to prevent labour income being converted to capital income. 12.29 Sørenson explains that these rules were not very effective. Taxpayers could structure their affairs to avoid being ‘active owners’ and thereby avoid the income-splitting rules. Moreover, the rules were frequently changed, usually to be more generous to taxpayers. The salary deduction adjustment is a good example as Sørenson notes that, by the late 1990s, almost 80% of active shareholders had negative labour income as a result of the deduction. 12.30 To address the problems with income-splitting rules for companies, Norway introduced a ‘shareholder model’ in 2006, which is still used today. The key features are the RRA, which is calculated on capital invested, and the intentional double taxation of dividends and capital gains on shares. 12.31 The RRA is a deduction that provides relief against double taxation for the risk- free return. Returns above the risk-free rate are intentionally double taxed at a combined effective tax rate (around 46.7%) that is roughly in line with the top marginal tax rate on labour. 49 The tax rate of 31.68% on dividends and capital gains on shares is set to achieve this result. It should be noted that this tax on capital gains is at quite a high rate and appears to be essential in making Norway’s shareholder model work. However, the tax on capital gains is designed to mitigate or eliminate the lock-in effects that are a standard problem with many capital gains taxes. 12.32 For companies, the RRA model applies at the individual shareholder level, rather than at the corporate level. It applies to both listed and unlisted shares held by residents of Norway (with some exceptions for European Economic Area (EEA) residents for EU law reasons). It applies whether the shareholders are active or passive. 12.33 One reason the RRA model, including the double taxation of returns above the risk-free rate, applies at the shareholder level (rather than corporate level) is so that it does not affect the location decisions of multinational enterprises earning mobile rents. Another reason is that there is a lower revenue cost. This is because many shares may be owned by exempt entities or foreign residents who cannot use a deduction, but whose ownership share of corporate income (including the risk-free return) remains taxed at the corporate level. Taxing the capital income of domestic residents and fairness considerations 12.34 As noted above, a key question is the fairness of reducing the taxation of the return to capital of New Zealand residents. On the one hand, this might be dismissed as a regressive measure that favours some of the wealthiest in society who have high capital incomes. For those earning business income, or earning income through companies, the lower tax rate might be restricted to the risk-free return with any returns over and above these being taxed at labour income tax rates. However, depending on the balance of tax paid under a tax on share gains (required at least in Norway’s dual income tax), as compared with the lower rate on all currently taxable capital income, there might be a reduction in the tax paid by these people. On the other hand, these measures have been put in place by countries with quite progressive fiscal systems and have probably enabled the countries to have a considerably more progressive tax system on the categories of income that are taxed as labour income. 49 $100 profit − $22 tax = $78 available for distribution. $78 × 31.68% = $24.70 tax. Total tax = $22 + $24.70 = $46.70. 93 12.35 For residents, a lower tax rate on the risk-free rate of return to capital would reduce distortions in intertemporal consumption/savings decisions (whether to consume now or save now and consume later) and on the forms of savings undertaken. It would also reduce distortions caused by inflation and might alleviate the tax avoidance pressure that will arise if capital income is taxed at very high rates. A dual income tax system would be complex. 12.36 At the same time, it would provide one way of increasing higher personal marginal tax rates, should future governments wish to do so, without this leading to increases in costs of capital and EMTRs. Alternatively, it might provide a way of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs without changing higher marginal tax rates. 12.37 There are already elements of dual income taxes in New Zealand’s current tax rules. For example, the top marginal tax rate is now 39%, but individuals on this tax rate are taxed only at a capped tax rate of 28% if they invest into PIEs. Also, income can often be taxed at less than their statutory personal marginal tax rates if people invest into trusts or companies. However, with trusts and companies there is scope for sheltering both capital and labour income. A dual income tax might be one way of increasing the coherence with which different forms of income are taxed. Key questions to consider Q12.1: Is a dual income tax worth considering further as a way of allowing costs of capital and EMTRs to be reduced? Q12.2: Would a dual income tax be worth considering as a way of reducing distortions in the way that different forms of savings are taxed? Q12.3: Would a dual income tax be an attractive or unattractive measure on progressivity grounds? Q12.4: Is a dual income tax only worth considering in the future if it becomes harder to tax capital income at high marginal tax rates? 94 REFERENCES Atkinson, A. and Stiglitz, J. (1976).

Inland Revenue’s draft long-term insights briefing (LTIB) on tax, foreign investment and productivity is available on its tax policy website. 1 These technical appendices provide some additional support for the analysis in the LTIB. It provides further analytical detail on the formal models being used. It also provides further discussion on implications of the formal modelling. 2. The technical appendices are as follows: • Appendix 1 provides two formal economic models of how taxes can affect costs of capital and EMTRs. The first of these is the main OECD model that is being used throughout the draft LTIB. A crucial assumption in this first model is that non-residents are marginal shareholders. This model may, or may not, be relevant for SMEs where non-residents own negligible amounts of the business. We also explore two variants of a second model where resident individuals are marginal investors in the business. • Appendix 2 provides a more detailed analysis of how New Zealand’s tax settings can impact on costs of capital and EMTRs. It considers how differences in the tax treatment of different asset types and firms financed in different ways can create tax biases that may reduce economic efficiency and productivity. While EMTRs in New Zealand may often be high, at times they can be negative. The appendix explores the way inflation can increase tax imposts on assets that have high EMTRs in the first place and increase tax subsidies to assets with negative EMTRs. It considers how non-resident withholding tax on interest and approved issuer levy can affect costs of capital and EMTRs for foreign-controlled and other companies. It discusses how changes in assumptions about the marginal investor might affect the analysis. • Appendix 3 discusses risk and its likely impact on costs of capital and EMTRs. • Appendix 4 provides a simple cash flow example to show how some debt-financed investments can end up with negative EMTRs. Rather than investment being taxed, they can end up being subsidised. It also explores how inflation can magnify this effect. • Appendix 5 examines how some tax changes, including changes to the company tax rate, depreciation rates and R&D tax credit, are likely to have affected costs of capital and EMTRs. There are other measures though, such as thin capitalisation rules and transfer pricing measures, which we have not been able to analyse. 1 Inland Revenue. (2022). Draft long-term insights briefing. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2022/2022-other-draft-ltib 6 APPENDIX 1 Cost of capital and EMTR estimates: two formal models 1.1 The OECD website provides estimates across OECD countries and some other countries for the cost of capital, the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) and the effective average tax rate (EATR) for a set of assets. 2 Our main focus is on the cost of capital (or the threshold real rate of return at which investment becomes profitable) and on the closely associated EMTR. Tax provisions will affect the cost of capital and incentives to invest. Changes in the cost of capital will lead to changes in New Zealand’s capital stock. 1.2 This appendix presents two variants of a formal model of how tax rules affect costs of capital and EMTRs. 1.3 The first of these is just a simple version of the OECD model. It allows us to analyse costs of capital when investment is being undertaken through companies in which non-residents are the marginal equity investors (the case that underlies the numerical estimates posted on the OECD website). It provides cost of capital results that are identical to the OECD’s analysis in this case. Our model is less general than the OECD’s. For example, the model cannot be as easily adapted to considering different possible marginal investors. At the same time, it is considerably simpler than the OECD model and allows varying levels of debt and their impact on costs of capital to be analysed directly. 3 This variant is our main focus, and we refer to it as the ‘OECD company tax model’. It is the model the OECD has used to benchmark different countries. 1.4 We also consider an alternative domestic small and medium enterprise (SME) variant. In this variant, foreigners are still the marginal suppliers of debt finance, but there is no foreign equity finance. All equity finance is supplied by resident individuals. There are two sub-variants. In the first, the individuals eit her invest through unincorporated enterprises or through companies that pay the maximum possible level of imputed dividends each year but no unimputed dividends. In either case, taxable income is assumed to be taxed at personal tax rates each year. The opportunity cost of equity-financed investment is the interest income that could be earned by the owners of these SMEs on interest- bearing securities. This is only a ‘first cut’ way of analysing investment incentives for SMEs organised as companies. Under New Zealand’s full imputation system, corporate profits are eventually taxed at shareholders’ tax rates when they are paid as dividends. However, there can be important deferral benefits when the company tax rate is less than the marginal tax rates of shareholders (as will often be the case) and if profits are retained in companies and reinvested for considerable periods of time. The second sub- variant assumes that profits are retained in companies forever, so the personal tax rate becomes irrelevant, and costs of capital depend solely on the company tax rate. 2 OECD.

Public Sector, Taxation and Market Regulation > Taxation > Corporate Tax Statistics > Effective Tax Rates. https://stats.oecd.org/ 3 By contrast, the OECD analyses costs of capital and EMTRs for investments that are either fully equity financed or fully debt financed and then assumes that partially debt-financed cases can be analysed as a weighted average of these two cases. 7 OECD company tax model 1.5 Assume that foreign equity investors demand the real return, e r , on their equity finance and as much equity capital as wanted can be attracted at this fixed rate of return. Debt finance is attracted at a real interest rate, d r . A fixed proportion, b, is borrowed and the remaining 1 b− is financed by equity. The OECD study ignores any withholding taxes on dividends or interest and, for the time being, we also ignore these taxes. 1.6 Let w r be the pre-tax real weighted average cost of funds to a capital importing economy so (1) wed rb rbr=−+ (1) 1.7 For a marginal investment, the present value of the after-tax benefits should be equal to the present value of the costs.

Assume that a dollar invested in a project at the end of year 0 generates c in real revenue (net of any non-financing costs) at the end of year 1, (1)cd− at the end of year 2, 2 (1) cd− at the end of year 3 and so forth.

It is the return that would be required in equilibrium for a firm to acquire capital goods and then use them itself (which can be thought of as leasing capital goods to itself). 1.11 The cost of capital is the pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment. This will be pcd= − . The asset provides a pre-tax gross return of c. However, each 4 See Hall, R.E. and D.W.

Suppose we have inflation at a rate of π per annum. Once more, assume a dollar is invested at the end of year 0.

A marginal investment is one that just breaks even for shareholders when cash flows are discounted at this rate. But a marginal investment will also be one at which the net present value is zero when all cash flows (inclusive of those associated with borrowing) are discounted at the weighted average cost of funds. We take this second approach, which simplifies the model. 9 1.18 The fraction of each dollar that is equity financed costs e r . As much debt finance as demanded can be attracted at the world real interest rate, d r . The fraction that is debt financed is deductible. It would cost (1) d r τ − in the absence of inflation. But deductions are allowed for nominal, rather than real, interest, and the final term / (1) τππ + reflects the deduction for the inflationary component of interest. 1.19 To see this, note that the nominal after-tax interest rate on borrowed funds is () '(1)(1)(1) ddd iirτππ τ = −= ++ − 1.20 This means that the real after-tax interest rate on borrowed funds is ( ) (1)(1) ' '(1) 111 d d dd r i rr ππ τπ π τπ τ πππ + + −− − = == −− +++ 1.21 We can write that the nominal after-tax weighted average cost of funds is ' (1)(1) wed ib ibiτ =−+ − (5) where (1) ee ir ππ= ++ . 1.22 The term A in equation (2) is the present value of tax savings from the future stream of depreciation deductions, as well as any investment tax credits (such as the current R&D tax credit) if these are available. Different rates of tax depreciation will affect the cost of capital by changing the value of A. Suppose, for example, that there are no investment tax credits and an asset with an economic rate of depreciation of d can be depreciated at the diminishing value (DV) rate d\*.

When foreign investors are marginal investors into companies, this can be defined as w pr EMTR p − = (7) where w r is the pre-tax real weighted average costs of funds to a capital importing economy given by equation (1). Domestic SME variant 1.25 An open question is how best to analyse investment incentives for domestic SMEs with no foreign shareholders. This is discussed in appendix 2, in 2.67 to 2.75. Incentives will depend on the opportunity cost of the capital invested in domestic SMEs and there are different cases that can be considered. 1.26 One possible case is where the owners of domestic SMEs would otherwise invest in New Zealand listed companies. If these listed companies are ones where non- residents are marginal shareholders, cost of capital expressions from the OECD 10 model above (as, for example, in equation (2) above) might be argued to continue to be relevant. 1.27 If instead the owners of domestic entities would invest in other assets such as interest-bearing securities or foreign equities, different cost of capital expressions will arise. There is no obvious best way of modelling the different possible cases when domestic residents can own a variety of such assets. 1.28 Here we explore two possible variants. In both variants, the alternative asset is interest-bearing securities. Sub-variant 1: Full distribution sub-variant 1.29 In the first sub-variant, we assume that a corporate SME distributes all its taxable profits to shareholders each year so that the profits are fully taxed at the marginal tax rates of shareholders, m. We assume profits that are not taxed at the company level are not distributed as dividends but are instead retained in the company. Equivalently, we could assume that income is owned through an unincorporated enterprise and the profits are taxed directly in shareholders’ hands. 1.30 Taxpayers can borrow or lend at the nominal interest rate, i, or the real interest rate, r. The nominal after-tax interest rate is '(1)ii m= − , and the real after- tax interest rate is '(1)/ (1)r r mmππ =−− + . 1.31 For a marginal investment by an unincorporated investor, the present value of the after-tax costs must once more equal the present value of the after-tax benefits, so 2 (1)11(1) 11 1' 1'1'' cmddcm A rrrrd  − −−−   −=+ ++ =   + +++    where A is found by discounting depreciation deductions at the net-of -personal- tax interest rate.

Sub-variant 2: Full retention sub-variant 1.33 In the second sub-variant, it is assumed that profits are earned by a domestic SME that retains and accumulates all profits.

In this appendix, we modify and extend the analysis in various ways. Some of the key results from this appendix are discussed in chapter 4 of the draft LTIB. 2.2 The OECD analysis provides a single estimated cost of capital and a single estimated EMTR for non-building tangible assets. However, there are different types of these assets, with different economic and tax depreciation rates. This will lead to a variety of costs of capital and EMTRs. Focusing on these different values allows potential tax biases between different types of these assets to be examined. This is discussed in 2.6 to 2.18. 2.3 The OECD analysis assumes a debt level of 35% and an inflation rate of 1% per annum. In 2.19 to 2.40, we rework this analysis to allow for a slightly higher debt level (which better reflects average debt levels in New Zealand) and a higher inflation rate of 2% (which is in the middle of the Reserve Bank’s target range). We also consider a broader set of assets than the OECD study does and the impacts of different inflation rates, debt levels and real interest rates. 2.4 The OECD study ignores non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest and the approved issuer levy (AIL). The OECD also does not consider how thin capitalisation rules might affect the analysis. In 2.41 to 2.67, we rework the analysis to take account of NRWT on interest and AIL. We also discuss how thin capitalisation provisions might affect the analysis. However, we are unable to provide a satisfactory way of allowing for changes in thin capitalisation provisions on costs of capital. We have also been unable to estimate how the restricted transfer pricing rules, which limited rates at which interest could be deducted for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018, will have impacted on costs of capital. 2.5 Finally, the analysis in this chapter rests on a variant of the OECD’s model of companies where non-residents are marginal shareholders. However, SMEs operating in New Zealand may often have negligible amounts of foreign equity capital. In 2.68 to 2.76 we also consider the domestic SME model that was outlined in appendix 1. In that model, domestic residents who borrow and lend on world markets are assumed to be the marginal shareholders. In this case EMTRs may often be negative. Variations in costs of capital and EMTRs for non-building tangible assets 2.6 We start by looking at non-building tangible assets – referred to by the OECD as ‘tangible assets’. 2.7 The OECD analysis provides a single point estimate of a cost of capital for non- building tangible assets. For example, with a 3% real interest rate and when debt is 35% of capital, New Zealand is estimated to have a cost of capital of 3.9%, which is the second highest of the OECD countries. 2.8 This single point estimate approach has some costs and benefits. Presenting a single point estimate can allow a comparison of costs of capital across countries. However, for our purposes, it is more useful to have a range of possible values. If there is a large range of different costs of capital for different non-building 12 tangible assets, biases in the way different forms of these assets are taxed may be as important as any biases between the average for these assets and other classes of asset. Different possible tax changes may either increase or decrease these biases. 2.9 In New Zealand, depreciation deductions are set in an attempt to reflect ‘economic depreciation’, namely, how assets will actually decline in value. However, there has been no attempt to take account of inflation in setting these values. This was discussed in a 2004 New Zealand officials’ issues paper on depreciation. 6 In practice, New Zealand and most other countries have very poor information on how assets fall in value. The OECD’s estimates of economic depreciation are based on estimates by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the United States. 7 These appear to be the most widely used estimates of economic depreciation and have the benefit of being from an independent agency. 2.10 There are several difficulties in attempting to use these BEA estimates of economic depreciation for estimating costs of capital in New Zealand. An obvious concern is that the BEA estimates were derived for a different country (the United States) and reflect data that has been put together over a long period of time. The data can often be quite dated. However, another concern may be more important still. This is the fact that categories of assets used in the BEA study are often quite different from those New Zealand uses for tax purposes. It therefore becomes very difficult to match tax depreciation rates for non-building tangible assets in New Zealand against estimates of economic depreciation from the BEA study. This means that OECD estimates of costs of capital and EMTRs will be approximate at best. 2.11 To sidestep these problems as much as possible, we use an alternative approach. We examine what would happen if tax depreciation rates did successfully reflect how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation. We see that even if we were perfectly successful in hitting our target, some important distortions will arise with even minor levels of inflation. Because we are likely to be some distance from successfully setting depreciation rates to mirror how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation, New Zealand’s range of costs of capital is likely to be larger than our estimated range. 2.12 Estimates of costs of capital and EMTRs for non-building tangible assets with an economic rate of depreciation, d, and an identical tax depreciation rate, d\*, are provided in table A2.1. 2.13 As in the OECD estimates presented in chapter 3, we assume that debt is 35% of capital and that the inflation rate is 1% per annum. We explore two possible real interest rates. As in the OECD study, we examine the case where the real interest rate, r, is 3% (that, is foreign providers of both debt and equity funds require a real return of 3% on their funds net of any domestic taxes). Results for this case are highlighted. However, studies have often assumed a higher real return is required and therefore we also consider a second possibility of a real interest rate of 5%. There does not yet appear to be a clear consensus on the most appropriate real interest rates to use in these costs of capital studies, and the most appropriate rates will depend on how interest rates change in the future. The real interest rate assumption is discussed further in appendix 3. 6 Inland Revenue and Treasury. (2004). Repairs and maintenance to tax depreciation rules – an officials’ issues paper. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2004/2004-ip-depreciation 7 These BEA estimates are available at https://search.bea.gov/search?affiliate=u.s.bureauofeconomicanalysis&query=depreciation+rat es 13 Table A2.1: Costs of capital for non-building tangible assets debt = 35%, inflation = 1% Non-building tangible assets d 100.0% 50.0% 20.0% 10.0% 4.0% 2.0% 0.0% d\* 100.0% 50.0% 20.0% 10.0% 4.0% 2.0% 0.0% Costs of capital r = 5.0% 6.51% 6.50% 6.45% 6.39% 6.30% 6.24% 6.13% r = 3.0% 4.01% 4.00% 3.96% 3.92% 3.83% 3.77% 3.62% EMTRs r = 5.0% 23.2% 23.0% 22.5% 21.8% 20.6% 19.8% 18.4% r = 3.0% 25.2% 24.9% 24.3% 23.4% 21.7% 20.3% 17.2% 2.14 We draw attention to the following points illustrated by table A2.1: • When the world real interest rate is 3%, costs of capital fall from a value of 4.01% for assets that depreciate fully over the first year to a value of 3.62% for assets that do not depreciate at all. Likewise, EMTRs fall from 25.2% (that is, (4.01-3.00)/4.01) to 17.2%. • The EMTR for assets that fully depreciate is considerably higher than the EMTR for assets that do not depreciate at all. • The OECD estimated cost of capital of 3.9% for tangible assets in New Zealand (reported in chapter 3 for the case where r is 3%) is clearly reasonably central within this range of results. It seems plausible as an average estimate. • For many non-building tangible assets with depreciation rates of 10% or more, costs of capital and EMTRs are within quite narrow ranges (for example, as economic depreciation rates fall from 100.0% to 10.0%, EMTRs fall from 25.2% to 23.4%). However, costs of capital and EMTRs fall quite quickly for depreciation rates below 10%. For an asset which does not depreciate at all, the EMTR is only 17.2%. 2.15 The results suggest a significant non-neutrality in the tax rules. Rather than leading to a uniform cost of capital, hurdle rates of return and EMTRs tend to be significantly higher for short-lived assets. This is the “inflation bias” issue discussed in several studies (see, for example, in Auerbach (1979) or in chapter 3 of the officials’ issues paper on depreciation). 2.16 This is a consequence of inflation and a tax system that takes no account of inflation. If the inflation rate were zero, costs of capital would be uniform for any given real interest rate and EMTRs would be uniform irrespective of the real interest rate. This is shown in table A2.2. 14 Table A2.2: Costs of capital for non-building tangible assets debt = 35%, inflation = 0% Non-building tangible assets d 100.0% 50.0% 20.0% 10.0% 4.0% 2.0% 0.0% d\* 100.0% 50.0% 20.0% 10.0% 4.0% 2.0% 0.0% Costs of capital r = 5.0% 6.26% 6.26% 6.26% 6.26% 6.26% 6.26% 6.26% r = 3.0% 3.76% 3.76% 3.76% 3.76% 3.76% 3.76% 3.76% EMTRs r = 5.0% 20.2% 20.2% 20.2% 20.2% 20.2% 20.2% 20.2% r = 3.0% 20.2% 20.2% 20.2% 20.2% 20.2% 20.2% 20.2% 2.17 We draw attention to the following points illustrated by table A2.2: • In the absence of inflation, there would be strong arguments in favour of attempting to make depreciation deductions reflect ‘economic depreciation’. This would mean neutral tax rules and the same EMTRs across assets with different economic depreciation rates. • However, by comparing these results with those in table A2.1, we see that a small amount of inflation can upset these neutrality results. • With a debt level of 35% and a real interest rate of 3%, EMTRs for most of these assets are higher when the inflation rate is 1% than when it is zero. Thus, often inflation will be adding to EMTRs. • With a depreciation rate of 0%, the EMTR is lower when inflation is 1% than when it is 0% (17.2% rather than 20.2%). 2.18 Inflation normally adds to the tax burden, especially for short-lived assets. This is because inflation reduces the real value of depreciation deductions. However, firms have an offsetting benefit, because they can claim interest deductions for the inflationary component as well as the real component of interest expense. For an asset that does not depreciate (and receives no depreciation deductions), obviously no disadvantage arises from the erosion of depreciation deductions. Thus, firms can benefit from deducting more than real interest without facing any offsetting penalty. Assumptions for debt level, inflation and asset type 2.19 The OECD analysis assumes that firms are financed with 35% debt and 65% equity (that is, the ratio of debt/(debt+equity) is 35%) and that the inflation rate is 1% across all the countries in their analysis. 2.20 Inland Revenue data from its International Questionnaire suggests a higher debt level of 43.1% for foreign-controlled companies in 2020 (the most recent year for which data is available). This data excludes the banks. It also excludes a small number of firms that have negative levels of equity. 2.21 Accounting information for NZX 50 firms in 2020 (excluding the two large banks that are included in the NZX50, namely, ANZ and Westpac) results in a very similar estimate of 43.7%. 2.22 In examining costs of capital in New Zealand, we will assume a debt ratio, which we denote by the symbol b, of 43%. This higher ratio will tend to reduce costs of capital and EMTRs somewhat, relative to the OECD estimates. 15 2.23 The OECD’s assumption of 1% per annum inflation also seems low for New Zealand, given that 2% per annum is in the middle of the Reserve Bank’s 1–3% target range. We replace this with an assumption of inflation of 2% per annum. A higher expected inflation rate will tend to increase costs of capital and EMTRs more for short-lived investment and decrease them more for long- lived investment. 2.24 We also report results for a somewhat broader set of assets than the OECD considers, namely: • commercial and industrial buildings • plant, machinery and equipment that is assumed to have a variety of economic and tax depreciation rates • a zero-depreciation asset that is assumed to neither appreciate nor depreciate in real terms • inventories • appreciating assets, and • assets for which capital expenditure can be deducted immediately (or expensed). 2.25 One class of asset is commercial and industrial buildings. These are assumed to have an economic depreciation rate of 2.69%, which is an OECD estimate of a weighted average of economic depreciation rates across these two types of buildings. The OECD assumes that commercial buildings depreciate at 2.47% per annum and industrial buildings depreciate at 3.14% per annum. This is in line with BEA estimates. 8 2.26 We also consider a broad class of depreciable assets other than commercial and industrial buildings. We refer to these assets as plant, machinery and equipment (PME) for want of any better term. While they are likely to be mainly plant, machinery and equipment, this class includes other depreciating assets as well, such as software and structures other than buildings, including, dams, bridges and roadways. These assets can all be depreciated for tax purposes and are included in the PME category. 2.27 We also allow for a class of asset, zero-depreciation assets, that are assumed to neither appreciate nor depreciate in real terms. Land is an important asset in New Zealand and this zero-depreciation asset class might be thought of as including certain types of land. Other types of land might better be thought of as included in the appreciating assets which are also considered. 9 2.28 As in the OECD study, we allow for trading stock or inventories. Inventories are assumed to be turned over at least once a year, which results in their full nominal economic income being taxed. This means the cost of capital and EMTR for inventories ends up equal to that of a very small group of PME assets that fully depreciate over their first year of life. Some assets that may be associated 8 Treating buildings as being either commercial or industrial buildings with an economic depreciation rate of 2.69% is consistent with the approach the OECD used up until 2021. They have recently updated their work to include a wider group of structures within their definition of buildings. This has led them to estimate a slightly higher average economic depreciation rate of 3.29%. Because we are continuing to use the OECD’s former approach, there is a slight inconsistency between how we define buildings and the OECD’s current definition. 9 Note that because land is in fixed supply, this will mean that a low EMTR for land is likely to produce little in the way of real investment distortions. It can, however, create ownership biases, with those on high marginal tax rates being attracted to investments with low EMTRs. 16 with technological diffusion, like computers and software, have high economic rates of depreciation and may be subject to high EMTRs. 2.29 Some assets may appreciate in real value. We allow for an appreciating asset that is expected to appreciate by 1% per annum in real terms. We assume that this gain is untaxed. 2.30 Finally, we consider investments in capital assets that can be immediately written off (or ‘expensed’). This includes investment in planting and growing a forest, mining exploration expenditure, and repairs and maintenance expenditure where this provides ongoing benefits for many years. It also includes investment by a firm in building up intangible assets if the costs of the investment can be deducted immediately, for example, as salaries and wages. Capital expenditure on many intangible assets that are created by a firm itself can be expensed, including building up good information and data, and establishing reputation and customer goodwill. 2.31 Table A2.3 shows costs of capital assuming a real interest rate of 3.0% for our set of assets. The row labelled d denotes the economic rate of depreciation used and the row d\* denotes the tax depreciation rate allowed.

The cost of capital for an asset that fully depreciates over its first year is 4.01%, whereas the cost of capital for an asset that depreciates at a rate of 2% per annum is only 3.77%. The cost of capital for a zero-depreciation asset is lower still at 3.62%. The cost of capital for inventories is the same as the cost of capital for PME with an economic and tax depreciation rate of 100%. As we discussed earlier, costs of capital and EMTRs for all these assets would be the same in the absence of inflation. Inflation tends to bias 17 investment away from short-lived PME and inventories towards longer- lived PME and zero-depreciation assets. • For commercial and industrial buildings, the cost of capital is 3.94% and the EMTR is 23.8%. Our estimates of costs of capital will be the same as the OECD’s if we make the same assumptions about economic and tax rates of depreciation. 10 There can, however, be slight differences between our estimates and OECD estimates of EMTRs. 11 • This suggests, with 1% inflation and 35% debt, the cost of capital for commercial and industrial buildings would be likely to be lower than for short-lived PME but higher than for very long-lived PME. • Costs of capital and EMTRs for appreciating assets are lower than for zero- depreciation assets. This is unsurprising as part of the economic income of an appreciating asset is untaxed, which will tend to reduce costs of capital and EMTRs. • Assets that can be expensed have an EMTR of -15.0%. The negative EMTR arises because the cost of capital of 2.61% is less than the 3.00% cost of capital that would be demanded in the absence of tax. These assets are being subsidised by the tax system. 12 2.33 Comparing the first and second costs of capital and EMTR rows, we see that a higher debt level in New Zealand than the 35% OECD assumption will tend to reduce both costs of capital and EMTRs somewhat. 2.34 Comparing the second and third costs of capital and EMTR rows show that, as inflation increases, it tends to increase non-neutralities between assets. This can be seen by the ranges of both costs of capital and EMTRs increasing. Higher inflation tends to push up EMTRs for those assets that already face high EMTRs while reducing EMTRs for those assets with relatively low or negative EMTRs. 2.35 There would appear to be some significant non-neutralities in the tax system with 2% inflation and a debt level of 43%. An asset that can be expensed has an EMTR of -24.9% and needs to earn only 2.4% to be marginal. In effect, these investments are being subsidised by the tax system. At the same time, 10 It might be noticed that the cost of capital is slightly lower than the 4.1% figure that the OECD reports for New Zealand, discussed in chapter 3. This is just the definitional issue discussed in footnote 29 above. The OECD has recently updated its definition of “buildings” to be broader than commercial and industrial buildings, and it is now assuming a slightly higher economic depreciation rate of 3.29%, rather than the 2.69% for commercial and industrial buildings. 11 The OECD calculates its EMTR as a weighted average of the EMTRs for a fully equity-financed and a fully debt-financed investment. This can make their estimates appear inconsistent with their cost of capital estimates. Our EMTR is always given by = −()/ w EMTRprp where p is the cost of capital for the partially debt-financed investment and w r is the real weighted average cost of funds to the economy. For example, suppose =3% w r , the cost of capital for a 100% equity- financed investment is 4%, the cost of capital for a 100% debt-financed investment is 2% and the cost of capital for a 50% debt-financed investment is 3%. We would calculate the EMTR for a 50% debt-financed investment as being zero (because the cost of capital and cost of funds are both 3%). The OECD methodology would result in their estimate being -12.5% because the EMTR for a 100% equity-financed investment is 25% and the EMTR for a 100% debt-financed investment is -50%. 12 One possible question is how economic depreciation differs from expensing in the case of an asset that fully depreciates over the first year it is used. In the model, assets are assumed to be acquired at the end of year 0 and provide a single positive cash flow in future years. For an asset that fully depreciates in one year, it would be treated as being acquired at the end of year 0 and generating a single positive cash flow at the end of year 1. Under economic depreciation, a deduction for the cost of the asset would be allowed in year 1. Under expensing, a deduction for the cost of the asset would be allowed in year 0. 18 short-lived assets and inventories have EMTRs of up to 26.8% and need to generate higher hurdle rates of return of up to 4.1%. This is considerably higher than would be required in the absence of tax. 2.36 In table A2.4, we explore how levels of debt could affect EMTRs across a broad set of possible debt levels, assuming that interest is fully deductible. We once again assume a 3% real interest rate and consider an inflation rate of either 2% or 0% per annum. Table A2.4: EMTRs, r = 3%, different inflation and debt levels Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Inflation = 2% b = 0% 34.6% 39.1% 38.7% 36.2% 33.6% 31.7% 28.0% 39.1% 20.6% 0.0% b = 43% 20.4% 26.8% 26.3% 22.8% 19.2% 16.3% 10.1% 26.8% -1.8% -24.9% b = 60% 13.0% 20.5% 19.8% 15.9% 11.7% 8.1% 0.3% 20.5% -14.5% -38.5% b = 100% -11.5% 0.0% -0.9% -6.5% -13.2% -19.2% -34.1% 0.0% -62.3% -86.2% Inflation = 0% b = 0% 30.7% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 20.6% 0.0% b = 43% 21.4% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 8.4% -13.7% b = 60% 17.0% 13.5% 13.5% 13.5% 13.5% 13.5% 13.5% 13.5% 2.5% -20.2% b = 100% 4.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% -14.9% -38.9% 2.37 We draw attention to the following points illustrated by table A2.4: • Consider the set of results when inflation is assumed to be 2%. If there is no debt, EMTRs vary, falling from 39.1% for very short-lived PME and inventories to 0.0% with expensing. No investments are subsidised, and there is often a substantial positive EMTR. • However, with full debt finance and 2% inflation, EMTRs are never greater than zero. Required rates of return for marginal investments would not exceed, and would often be lower than, the cost of funds to the economy. They fall from 0.0% for very short-lived PME and inventories to -86.2% with expensing. • At current average debt levels of around 43%, there is normally a positive EMTR and EMTRs can often be over 20%. • Negative EMTRs are possible for some assets, especially if there are high levels of debt. • When there is no debt, 2% inflation can increase EMTRs on short-lived assets and inventories significantly (from the company tax rate of 28.0% to 39.1%). Conversely, when there is 100% debt finance, 2% inflation can increase tax subsidies significantly. For example, with expensing the EMTR falls from -38.9% to -86.2%. • The EMTR estimates were derived in a model where assets were assumed to fall in value at a constant DV economic rate. However, the estimates in the case of expensing apply generally. Appendix 4 provides a simple numerical example illustrating EMTRs for fully equity-financed and fully debt-financed investments when capital costs can be expensed. 19 2.38 We have noted that, with a world real interest rate of 3%, a small level of inflation of 2% per annum can add to investment biases significantly. As discussed in appendix 3, t here is some uncertainty about the most appropriate real interest rate to use. The OECD considers a real interest rate of 3% is being demanded by foreign shareholders and lenders. However, other studies have used higher real interest rate assumptions and, until this year, the OECD also had a variant where a real interest rate of 5% was assumed. Interest rates appear to be on the rise worldwide and it may not be long before higher real interest rate assumptions appear once more. 2.39 Table A2.5 compares EMTRs for a company that is 43% debt financed, using a 3% real interest rate and a 5% real interest rate. Table A2.5: EMTRs, debt = 43%, different values of r and inflation rates Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% r = 3% Inflation = 2% 20.4% 26.8% 26.3% 22.8% 19.2% 16.3% 10.1% 26.8% -1.8% -24.9% Inflation = 0% 21.4% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 8.4% -13.7% r = 5% Inflation = 2% 19.1% 23.6% 23.1% 20.4% 18.0% 16.3% 13.5% 23.6% 7.3% -20.1% Inflation = 0% 20.5% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 12.6% -13.7% 2.40 We draw attention to the following points: • If there were no inflation and tax depreciation rates accurately measured economic depreciation, EMTRs would be the same for PME with different rates of economic depreciation, zero-depreciation assets and inventories. This would apply whether the world interest rate was 3% or 5%. • With either real interest rate, inflation creates a tax bias that pushes up EMTRs for short-lived PME and inventories. With expensing, it makes the negative EMTRs more negative. • However, inflation is considerably less distorting with a higher real interest rate assumption. With a real interest rate of 3%, inflation raises the EMTR for short-lived PME and inventories from 18.1% to 26.8%, while lowering the EMTR for a zero-depreciation asset from 18.1% to 10.1%. By contrast, with a 5% real interest rate, inflation only increases the EMTR for short-lived PMEs and inventories from 18.1% to 23.6% and only drops the EMTR for zero-depreciation assets from 18.1% to 13.5%. Inflation biases on costs of capital and EMTRs get large when the inflation rate is large relative to the real interest rate. Non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), approved issuer levy (AIL), interest rates and thin capitalisation provisions 2.41 The OECD analysis does not take account of withholding taxes on interest. Nor does it consider how thin capitalisation rules may modify the analysis. We begin by discussing NRWT on interest and the AIL and how these taxes/levies can affect the real interest rates that firms will need to pay. We then discuss how thin capitalisation rules may affect the analysis. To keep the extent of the 20 discussion manageable, we do not consider NRWT on dividends or New Zealand’s foreign investor tax credit. Including these could sometimes lead to lower costs of capital than we analyse, but this is left for further work. NRWT, AIL and real interest rates 2.42 In New Zealand, there are two different types of taxes/levies on interest paid to non-residents. Non-resident withholding tax is withheld at a rate of 10% for countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement or 15% for other countries. Most often it will be withheld at a rate of 10%, and we use this rate in our analysis. Where debt is from a related party (for example, a foreign parent company), NRWT must be withheld. However, an alternative exists when debt is from third parties. This alternative is for the borrowing firms to pay AIL at a rate of 2% in lieu of NRWT. 2.43 A difference between the two types of taxes is that NRWT may give rise to tax credits overseas that reduce the amount of tax overseas lenders must pay on their interest income from New Zealand. 13 2.44 Despite the rate of NRWT being higher than the 2% rate of AIL, it will generally be preferable for loans to be subject to NRWT if the foreign lender is able to make full use of the tax credits. However, very often foreign lenders may be non-taxpayers, in a tax loss position or unable to make full use of tax credits for other reasons. 2.45 Interest paid to third parties is most often subject to AIL rather than NRWT, and we assume this is the case in our analysis. However, AIL could, on occasion, be waived if a New Zealand borrower thought the foreign lender would prefer NRWT to be withheld. This would lead to slightly lower costs of capital than we estimate. We assume that all related-party loans from abroad are subject to NRWT at a rate of 10%, and all third-party loans from abroad are subject to AIL. 2.46 Third-party lenders are expected to require an after-tax return that provides them with the real return they could obtain from investing their money elsewhere. If there were no inflation, it would be expected that this would increase the real (and nominal) interest rate from (say) 3% to 3.06% so that, after AIL is levied, foreign lenders end up with the real return they require (3.06% = 3.00%/(1–0.02)). 2.47 With 2% inflation AIL is levied on the full nominal interest rate. With 2% inflation and a 3% real interest rate (and no AIL) , the nominal interest rate will be 5.06%. Levying 2% AIL will raise the nominal interest rate to 5.16% and the real interest rate to approximately 3.10%. 14,15 This will tend to raise costs of capital and EMTRs slightly for all firms that are partly debt financed. 2.48 Foreign-controlled companies that are partly financed by related-party debt will also be affected by NRWT. At one extreme, if NRWT is fully creditable abroad, there should be no increase in the real interest rate demanded on related-party lending. At the same time, the cost of borrowing to New Zealand as a whole would decrease. The loans would cost New Zealand borrowers 3% real interest 13 There is a second difference that will be incorporated later when deriving cost of capital expressions. While AIL is deductible from income tax, NRWT is not. 14 More precisely, with inflation at rate π , the domestic real interest rate will rise to ππ−+ + −/ (1)/ ((1)(1)) aaa rttt . 15 There is an exemption from AIL or NRWT for widely issued bonds. We assume the benefit of this concession is limited and that it cannot be used widely to step around AIL and negate any upward pressure on domestic interest rates. 21 or approximately 5% nominal interest. After this nominal interest payment is taxed at a rate of 10%, the after-tax real interest cost to New Zealand would fall to approximately 2.5% and the net real interest cost to New Zealand would be approximately 2.5%. 16 NRWT would be reducing the net amount that New Zealand as a whole pays for these loans because part of the interest payment would be flowing to the Government as a tax receipt. This tax receipt increases New Zealand’s national income. 2.49 If NRWT is not creditable, it would be expected to push up the interest rate that borrowers must pay. The real interest rate on related-party lending would be expected to rise to 3.55%, while the net cost of borrowing to New Zealand as a whole would remain at 3%. 17 2.50 Data on firms from whom Inland Revenue collects information as part of its International Questionnaire (IQ firms) is presented in table A2.6 . Table A2.6: IQ data on debt and equity Related- party interest- bearing debt Other interest- bearing debt Total interest- bearing debt Equity Debt + Equity $ billion 14.72 24.78 39.5 52.19 91.69 % of debt + equity 43.1% 56.9% 100% % of interest- bearing debt 37.3% 62.7% 100% 2.51 Table A2.6 indicates that related-party debt was 37.3%, and other debt was 62.7%, of total interest-bearing debt for the foreign-controlled firms in the IQ database. 2.52 This allows us to consider how AIL and NRWT will affect costs of capital and EMTRs for the following types of average firms: • For domestic companies that are not foreign controlled, it would increase the interest rate from 3% to 3.10% on the 43% of capital that is debt financed. The cost of debt finance to New Zealand as a whole would remain 3.00%. • For foreign-controlled companies that can claim credits for NRWT on interest, it would increase the average real interest rate paid to 3.06%. It leaves the interest rate paid on the 37% of debt that is related-party debt unchanged, while pushing up the cost of other debt to 3.10%. At the same time, the average cost of debt finance to New Zealand of borrowing by these firms would fall to 2.81%. • For foreign-controlled companies that are unable to claim credits for NRWT on interest, it would increase the average interest rate paid to 3.27% by pushing up the interest rate paid on the 37% of debt that is related party debt to 3.55% while pushing up the cost of other debt to 3.10%. The cost of debt finance to New Zealand as a whole would remain at 3.00%. 16 More precisely, the real interest cost to New Zealand as a whole (net of NRWT) falls to (1 )/ (1 ) NN rttππ−− + where N t is the rate of NRWT. 17 The real interest rate rises to / (1 )/ ((1 )(1 )) NNN rttt ππ−+ + − where N t is the rate of NRWT. 22 2.53 We now have two separate ways in which taxes may be impacting on costs of capital: • by depreciation rates and company tax rates affecting hurdle rates of return at a given set of real interest rates in New Zealand, and • by NRWT on interest and AIL affecting real interest rates themselves. 2.54 Estimated effects on costs of capital are examined in table A2.7 assuming a world real interest rate of 3% and 2% inflation. 18 Table A2.7: Costs of capital, r = 3%, inflation = 2%, debt = 43%, with AIL = 2% and NRWT = 10% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital No AIL or NRWT All companies 3.77% 4.10% 4.07% 3.89% 3.71% 3.58% 3.34% 4.10% 2.95% 2.40% AIL and NRWT Domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders 3.81% 4.14% 4.11% 3.93% 3.76% 3.63% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% AIL and NRWT - Foreign-controlled companies, NRWT creditable 3.80% 4.13% 4.10% 3.91% 3.74% 3.61% 3.36% 4.13% 2.98% 2.42% AIL and NRWT - Foreign-controlled companies , NRWT not creditable 3.92% 4.25% 4.22% 4.03% 3.86% 3.73% 3.49% 4.25% 3.10% 2.51% 2.55 We draw attention to the following points illustrated by table A2.7: • By comparing the third and fourth rows, we see that AIL pushes up costs of capital but only by very small amounts for domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders that are not foreign controlled. • By comparing the fourth and fifth rows, we see that the combination of AIL and NRWT has an even smaller effect on pushing up costs of capital for foreign-controlled companies that can claim credits for NRWT. Unlike AIL, NRWT is not increasing the cost of capital for these companies. • By comparing the fourth and sixth rows, we see that the combination of AIL and NRWT has a bigger effect on costs of capital for foreign-controlled companies that cannot make use of credits for NRWT. • Differences in costs of capital going down the rows seem small relative to differences in costs of capital going across the rows. This suggests that tax biases between these different types of company are likely to be small relative to tax biases between different types of asset. 18 Note that EMTRs can become somewhat difficult to interpret when we start to take account of creditable taxes such as NRWT. Levying a fully creditable tax may increase the EMTR because it reduces the cost of borrowing to New Zealand even if it has no impact on costs of capital and incentives to invest in New Zealand. For this reason, we do not provide tables showing EMTRs when we are working with NRWT and non-residents are able to claim credits for NRWT. 23 Thin capitalisation rules 2.56 Non-residents investing into New Zealand can reduce the amount of corporate income tax they pay in New Zealand by having the subsidiary borrow from the parent and pay part of the return to the parent by way of deductible interest on a loan (rather than as a non-deductible dividend payment). Alternatively, the corporate group could lower the amount of tax it pays in New Zealand by having a New Zealand subsidiary take on a disproportionately large share of borrowing from third parties. 2.57 The thin capitalisation rules deny interest deductions if there are deemed to be excessive levels of debt in New Zealand. This can occur if both: • the New Zealand group’s debt ratio (that is, debt/(debt+equity)) is greater than 110% of the group’s worldwide debt ratio, and • the New Zealand group’s debt ratio is greater than the ‘safe harbour’ of 60%. 2.58 We understand that the safe harbour test is normally the binding constraint. We assume that firms that fail to satisfy the safe harbour test are not able to use the worldwide test to qualify for a better interest deductibility result. 2.59 If borrowing is from a foreign parent company, interest payments will normally be taxed in the parent’s hands. In this case, it will often be the difference between the New Zealand company tax rate and the foreign tax rate that determines incentives for debt financing. For example, suppose $100 of additional interest is paid from a New Zealand company in tax profit to a foreign parent. This reduces the New Zealand total tax payments by $18 (income tax falls by $28 but NRWT increases by $10). Also suppose that the parent is based in a country with a 20% company tax rate that can claim credits for New Zealand tax. In this case, additional tax of $10 would be paid by the foreign parent (income tax of $20 offset by a tax credit for NRWT of $10). This suggests that incentives to thinly capitalise New Zealand operations will often arise when the New Zealand company tax rate is higher than the tax rate in the country where the foreign parent resides. 2.60 New Zealand has a relatively high company tax rate within the OECD. Therefore, it might be thought a multinational enterprise with a foreign parent would normally have a tax advantage in thinly capitalising New Zealand operations. At the same time, slightly more than 50% of foreign direct investment (FDI) into New Zealand ($66.1 billion or 50.5% of a total stock of $130.9 billion as at 31 March 2021) is from Australia. 19 The Australian company tax rate for large companies is 30%, which is slightly higher than New Zealand’s 28% company tax rate. Nonetheless, there are other factors to consider, and there can be incentives for Australian corporate parents to thinly capitalise New Zealand subsidiaries even if the Australian company tax rate is slightly higher. 2.61 Australia’s full imputation system means that many firms will want to pay tax in Australia, rather than New Zealand, because franking credits (that is, imputation credits) are available for Australian, but not foreign, taxes. Many other factors may be important as well, including whether the foreign parent or the domestic subsidiary are in a taxpaying position and whether foreign tax credits can be claimed for taxes paid in New Zealand. 2.62 One possible way of examining the effects of thin capitalisation rules on the cost of capital, which has been used in prior studies, is to assume that firms are clustered at their thin capitalisation safe harbour limits and that this 19 Statistics NZ National Accounts Data for the year to 31 March 2021. 24 determines the amount of debt they hold. 20 However, this would imply that foreign-controlled companies were all facing a debt ratio of 60%, which is considerably higher than the 43% ratio suggested by IQ data. 2.63 To examine whether there is major evidence of clustering, IQ data on debt ratios is provided in table A2.8 . Firms are grouped by their debt ratio. A ratio of 0 means either no debt or a debt ratio below 1%, which is too low to register. There are 587 firms included in our sample. Table A2.8: Debt/(debt+equity) ratios for IQ firms 21 Debt / (Debt + Equity) Numbers % of total groups Debt ($ billion) % of total debt Equity ($ billion) % of total equity Debt + equity ($ billion) % of total debt + equity) 0% 259 44.1% 0.000 0.0% 14.263 27.3% 14.264 15.6% to 10% 34 5.8% 0.320 0.8% 4.619 8.8% 4.939 5.4% to 20% 28 4.8% 0.719 1.8% 3.879 7.4% 4.598 5.0% to 30% 38 6.5% 1.514 3.8% 4.352 8.3% 5.866 6.4% to 40% 44 7.5% 4.697 11.9% 9.043 17.3% 13.740 15.0% to 50% 31 5.3% 2.516 6.4% 2.866 5.5% 5.383 5.9% to 60% 55 9.4% 8.445 21.4% 6.748 12.9% 15.192 16.6% to 70% 39 6.6% 8.294 21.0% 4.549 8.7% 12.842 14.0% to 80% 19 3.2% 1.835 4.6% 0.586 1.1% 2.421 2.6% to 90% 16 2.7% 5.213 13.2% 0.976 1.9% 6.189 6.7% to 100% 24 4.1% 5.947 15.1% 0.310 0.6% 6.257 6.8% Total 587 100.0% 39.501 100.0% 52.191 100.0% 91.961 100.0% 2.64 We draw attention to the following points illustrated by table A2.8: • We might have expected high numbers of groups with a debt ratio in the 50–60% range or perhaps the 40–60% range. • Only 14.7% of groups are within this 40–60% range, although they tend to be larger groups and hold 22.5% of debt+equity capital. • By contrast, 44.1% of groups (with 15.6% of debt+equity) have no debt and more than two-thirds (68.7% of groups, with 47.3% of debt+equity) have debt ratios below 40%. 2.65 This suggests that modelling foreign-owned firms as being clustered at safe harbour limits is an oversimplification of what is happening at present. It may also be misleading when thinking about policy changes. For example, relaxing 20 The Tax Review 2001 (commonly known as the McLeod Review) Final Report made this assumption (see Part B of Annex E, pp. 139–140) when it examined how the rules at that time could affect effective tax rates (ETRs). Note that a key difference between the ETRs being estimated by the McLeod Review and our EMTRs is that the McLeod Review assumed that income is always being taxed fully at the company level. The McLeod Review did not attempt to capture the way in which EMTRs can be affected, not only by tax rates and levels of debt finance but also by tax depreciation rules, and whether there are other incentives, such as R&D tax credits. These additional effects are being modelled in the OECD work and in our analysis. 21 In presenting this data, we ignore a relatively small group of 40 firms with negative or zero levels of equity. 25 the thin capitalisation safe harbour limit may have no effect on costs of capital for most firms. 2.66 Some firms may be using the worldwide test rather than the thin capitalisation safe harbour test. However, for these firms an increase in the safe harbour would also have no effect on costs of capital. 22 2.67 In our costs of capital estimates, rather than assuming that firms are clustered at thin capitalisation safe harbours, we normally consider firms with average debt levels of around 43% that do not face a binding thin capitalisation constraint. This will understate the importance of thin capitalisation safe- harbour constraints which will be constraining debt levels for some firms. In chapter 9 of the draft LTIB we discuss some international empirical evidence suggesting that thin capitalisation rules often do impact on levels of investment and also on the sensitivity of investment to the company tax rate. However, we do not see an easy and consistent way of analysing the impact of this on costs of capital and EMTRs. SMEs where there may be little or no shareholding by non-residents 2.68 The OECD analysis assumes that non-resident shareholders are the marginal investors into companies in New Zealand. This assumption is a key reason for the high costs of capital and EMTRs for New Zealand reported in the OECD study as well as for those reported earlier in this appendix. However, for SMEs there is often little or no investment by non-resident shareholders. The company tax rate may have much less of an effect in driving up costs of capital for these firms than for companies where non-residents are likely to be marginal shareholders. 2.69 To analyse this case, we make use of the domestic SME model variants outlined in appendix 1. These consider incentives to invest by a domestic SME where domestic residents, rather than non-residents, are marginal shareholders. Domestic residents can invest in either interest-bearing securities or domestic SMEs so the opportunity cost of equity investment is the after-tax interest rate that could otherwise have been earned. The domestic interest rate is being raised by AIL so that, if inflation is 2% and the world real interest rate is 3.00%, the domestic real interest rate becomes 3.10%. Domestic residents can borrow or lend at that rate. 2.70 We consider two possible variants. In the first, we assume that income is taxed each year at the marginal tax rates of shareholders. This would be the case if the company fully distributed its taxable profits each year while paying no unimputed dividends. It is assumed that the shareholder faces a marginal tax rate of 33%. We refer to this as the ‘full distribution case’. 2.71 In the second variant we consider a company taxed at 28% that retains its profits indefinitely. In this case, we assume that profits are being taxed at 28% as a final tax. We refer to this as the ‘full retention case’. 2.72 The main point of these variants is to show that models like the OECD model we are drawing on for much of our analysis are only providing partial insights. Small changes in assumptions can lead to large differences in reported EMTRs. Moreover, as will be discussed in later chapters, they can affect conclusions 22 An on-lending concession allows firms to have a higher safe harbour if they are on-lending funds. This means that some firms with debt ratios above 60% could possibly be within the thin capitalisation safe harbour and so clustering may be greater than is evident from the table. However, it is still likely that the majority of firms are not clustered at safe harbour limits. The data suggests that 74% of firms have debt ratios below 50%. 26 about the desirability of measures such as accelerated depreciation as ways of responding to cost of capital concerns. 2.73 We consider two possible world real interest rates of 3% and 5% and assume that inflation is 2% per annum. 2.74 Table A2.9 provides estimates for the full distribution case, and table A2.10 provides results for the full retention case. Unlike in the OECD model, costs of capital and EMTRs do not depend on levels of debt finance.

EMTRs are highest for inventory and PME with fast economic depreciation rates and lowest for assets where capital expenditure can be expensed. 27 • Unlike the OECD model, there are no large positive EMTRs. Not only is interest expense deductible, the opportunity cost of owners’ own funds will also reflect an after-tax interest rate. This is because interest income would be taxable if the owners of a business earned interest rather than investing their money in a business. • The negative EMTRs that arise for many assets are, to a large extent, the consequences of the impacts of inflation and an unindexed tax system. 2.76 Table A2.11 shows costs of capital and EMTRs in the full distribution case when there is no inflation.

For example, Zwick and Mahon (2017) assume a nominal after- tax rate of 7%, roughly corresponding to 2% inflation and a real after-tax rate of return of 5%. In a paper setting out the OECD methodology, Hanappi (2018) chooses a real interest rate of 5% and 2% inflation to assist in making an initial version of the OECD model comparable with other studies. As we have commented, the OECD is now using a 3% real required rate of return and 1% inflation in its analysis. 3.2 Summers (1987) has argued that different cash flows should be discounted at two different rates. He argues that, while many cash flows from investments should be discounted at a high rate that incorporates a risk premium, those associated with depreciation deductions are close to riskless and should, in principle, be discounted at something close to a riskless interest rate. He reports evidence from a survey of companies that found that, in practice, most companies appear to discount interest deductions at high (much higher than riskless) interest rates. 3.3 There are also some complex issues on how to account for risk more generally. Gordon (1985) and Weisbach (2004) present models in which companies are taxed on economic profits and where company tax involves a government sharing in economic profits and economic losses. In these models, any losses are assumed to be fully utilisable and able to be deducted against other profits, or the tax benefit is cashed out. In these models, only tax on the risk-free component of the return drives up the cost of capital. However, for these models to be applicable to investment in depreciable assets, not only would any losses need to be cashed out, but taxpayers would also need to be able to make deductions for actual economic depreciation (how assets actually fall in value), rather than deductions based on depreciation schedules reflecting how they are expected to fall in value. Bulow and Summers (1984) show that basing depreciation on schedule depreciation rates can add to risk and push up the cost of capital. 3.4 There seems to be no agreed consensus on how best we should take account of all these issues. However, a widespread assumption appears to exist in practice that cash flows are discounted at interest rates considerably higher than riskless rates and that this can be reasonably modelled by incorporating a risk premium in the real return that investors demand. In our analysis, we sometimes consider the possibility of either a 3% or a 5% real required rate of return. 29 APPENDIX 4 Marginal investments with expensing 4.1 Table A2. 4 in appendix 2 presented results from our version of the OECD company tax model showing how expensing can lead to a zero EMTR for 100% equity-financed investment and a negative EMTR for 100% debt-financed investment. This appendix provides some simple cash flow examples to explain these results. 4.2 Suppose that non-residents demand a 3% real return on their capital, net of New Zealand taxes, and suppose there is no inflation (to keep things as simple as possible). Equity-financed investment 4.3 Consider an asset that costs $1,000 at the end of year 0 and produces revenue of $230 at the end of year 1, $224 at the end of year 2, $218 at the end of year 3, $212 at the end of year 4, $206 at the end of year 5 and then expires. 4.4 In the absence of a company tax, this would be a marginal equity-financed investment because it generates a rate of return of exactly 3%. The cost of the asset is equal to the present value of its revenues. 25 230224206 1000 1.03 1.031.03 = + ++ 4.5 Thus, the cost of capital is 3%p= , the cost of funds to the economy is 3% r = and the EMTR is () /(3% 3%) / 3% 0%EMTRp rr=−=−= . 4.6 Now suppose that we have a 28% company tax rate and capital expenditure can be expensed. Suppose that the same investment is once more equity financed. It is straightforward to see that this investment should still be marginal. 4.7 Tax reduces all costs and all revenues in the same proportion. The cost of the investment, net of the tax benefit of expensing, is $720, which is 72% of its pre-tax cost. The revenue in each future year is just 72% of the pre-tax revenue. As costs and revenues fall in the same proportion, this investment will still be marginal because 25 230(1 0.28) 224(1 0.28)206(1 0.28) 720 1.03 1.031.03 −− − =+++ 4.8 Thus, the cost of capital will remain 3% and the EMTR will remain 0%. As is recorded in table A2., for a fully equity-financed investment, the EMTR will be zero. For equity-financed investment in assets that can be expensed, the government is acting like a 28% partner in the investment. It bears 28% of the cost and reaps 28% of the benefits. Because pre- and post-tax rates of return are the same, expensing is not affecting the cost of capital for an equity- financed investment. Debt-financed investment 4.9 Now consider a debt-financed investment. Once more assume that we have a 28% company tax rate. Suppose that firms can borrow at an interest rate of 30 3% (real and nominal) and the after-tax interest cost is 2.16% (that is, 3% x (1–0.28)). It will be a break-even investment for a firm to borrow at an interest rate of 3% to invest in an asset that earns just 2.16% if capital expenditure can be expensed, so long as the firm has profits against which it can set off any deductions. The EMTR will be -38.9% = (2.16%–3.00%)/2.16% (as was reported in table A2.). 4.10 Suppose that an investment costs $1,000 at the end of year 0 and generates revenue of $221.60 at the end of year 1, $217.28 at the end of year 2, $212.96 at the end of year 3, $208.64 at the end of year 4, $204.32 at the end of year 5 and then expires. It is straightforward to check that this generates a 2.16% pre-tax rate of return. 4.11 To finance the investment, the company borrows $720. Together with the $280 tax saving, this finances the investment. The loan is repaid evenly at a rate of $144 per annum over the next five years. 4.12 Cash flows are provided in table A4.1. Table A4.1: Marginal debt-financed investment with expensing Year Capital outlay Borrowing and (repayments) Loan balance Revenue Interest Tax After-tax cash flow 0 -1,000.00 720.00 720.00 -280.00 0.00 1 (144.00) 576.00 221.60 21.60 56.00 0.00 2 (144.00) 432.00 217.28 17.28 56.00 0.00 3 (144.00) 288.00 212.96 12.96 56.00 0.00 4 (144.00) 144.00 208.64 8.64 56.00 0.00 5 (144.00) 0.00 204.32 4.32 56.00 0.00 4.13 This investment earns less than the cost of funds to the economy but is marginal on an after-tax basis. Borrowing at 3% to earn 2.16% is marginal and the EMTR is -38.9%. Just as in the equity-financed case, the firm undertaking the investment benefits from expensing. However, the firm also benefits from a stream of interest deductions in the debt-financed case. 31 APPENDIX 5 Tax changes since the 2000/01 income year and their impact on corporate costs of capital and EMTRs 5.1 There have been several tax changes to depreciation allowances, company tax rates, the thin capitalisation rules and tax incentives for R&D. All of these will have affected the levels and variability of both costs of capital and EMTRs. The aim of this appendix is to document what has happened and to estimate the impact of the various measures on costs of capital and EMTRs and how they have changed over time. 5.2 This appendix should be considered as only a first step towards examining this issue. It provides a rough estimate of the effects on costs of capital and EMTRs of some of the larger tax changes that have taken place. However, there is much that we are unable to analyse. In particular, we are unable to adequately examine the effects on changes to thin capitalisation provisions or the restricted transfer pricing rules within this framework. 5.3 Costs of capital will vary for different assets. A difficulty in attempting to estimate costs of capital is not knowing rates of economic depreciation for the different broad groups of capital assets that make up New Zealand’s capital stock. Statistics NZ provides estimates of net capital stock for nine categories of assets: exploration; land improvements; non-residential buildings; other construction; plant, machinery, and equipment; residential buildings; research and development; software; and transport equipment. It is difficult to estimate how quickly broad categories of asset (like land improvements, or plant, machinery, and equipment) are likely to depreciate over time. It is also difficult to estimate what tax depreciation rates will apply to these various broad categories of asset. However, this is what we need to know if we are to estimate how tax provisions have been affecting costs of capital and EMTRs over time. 5.4 Statistics NZ has provided Inland Revenue with data on consumption of fixed capital and net capital stock for what they describe as ‘market units’ in New Zealand. A market unit’s main objective is to operate in the market by selling its goods and services at competitive prices that are sufficient to generate a profit or surplus in the long term. Tax changes, such as a change in the company tax rate or a change in depreciation provisions, are likely to have a significant effect on investment by market units but much less effect on investment by non-market units. 5.5 Data from Statistics NZ is provided in table A5.1. This can be used to provide rough estimates of economic depreciation rates for different groups of assets. The data provided in the second column shows an average over three years (2017, 2018 and 2019) of gross fixed capital consumption (GFKC) to net capital stock (NKS) at the beginning of the year. Both variables are measured in constant dollar terms. We use these ratios to estimate average rates of economic depreciation for most of Statistics NZ’s asset types where the asset type is sufficiently broad that it would seem impractical to us to estimate economic depreciation rates in any other way. There are, however, two narrower groups of assets where the BEA has provided estimates of economic depreciation for what appear to be comparable assets. These two groups of assets are non-residential buildings (mainly commercial and industrial buildings) and software. 5.6 Our estimates of economic depreciation rates are provided in the third columns. Fo r non-residential buildings, we use an estimate of 2.69%. For software, we use the BEA estimate of 55%. 32 Table A5.1: Data used in estimating costs of capital Asset type Stats NZ GFKC/NKS Estimated rate of economic depreciation Assumed tax depreciation rate Weighting Exploration 7.9% 7.9% Expensed 0.8% Land improvements 5.8% 5.8% 5.8% 2.6% Non-residential buildings 3.1% 2.69% 2.0% 23.4% Other construction 3.3% 3.3% 3.3% 16.4% Plant, machinery and equipment 16.8% 16.8% 16.8% 19.9% Residential buildings 2.1% 2.1% 0.0% 24.4% Research and development 14.6% 14.6% Expensed 2.4% Software 35.4% 55.0% 50.0% 3.7% Transport equipment 19.8% 19.8% 19.8% 6.4% Total 100.0% 5.7 Assumed tax depreciation rates are provided in the fourth column. For some types of asset, it is possible to identify what the tax depreciation rate in New Zealand is likely to be. For example, exploration expenditure and R&D expenditure can normally be deducted immediately (expensed). Non-residential buildings (commercial and industrial buildings) can be depreciated at a rate of 2.0% DV. Residential buildings receive no depreciation deductions. 5.8 For other assets, we assume an ‘average tax depreciation rate’ equal to the estimated rate of economic depreciation. 23 The weightings for the different assets are provided in the fifth column. These are averages over the three-year period (2017–2019) from Statistics NZ’s net capital stock figures. 5.9 We use the economic depreciation rates and the weightings from table A5.1 to estimate the cost of capital for an aggregate asset that is a weighted average of the nine different types of capital asset. Tax depreciation rates in the table are used to estimate costs of capital at present. Tax depreciation rates applicable in earlier years are used to estimate costs of capital in those earlier years. In addition, we estimate how costs of capital for inventories have changed over time because of changes in the company tax rate. Tax parameters that have changed since the 2000/01 year 5.10 We allow for the following changes in tax parameters over time. Company tax rate 5.11 In the initial 2000/01 year, the company tax rate was 33% (which it had been since the late 1980s). It was reduced to 30% from the 2008/09 income year and then to 28% from the 2011/12 income year. 23 Note that only certain diminishing value depreciation rates are allowed for tax purposes. For example, 2%, 4% and 8% are allowed as depreciation rates, but not 3.3% or 5.8%. In reality, land improvements will be depreciated at a variety of these allowed depreciation rates. Assuming a depreciation rate of 5.8% is only a rough, on-average approximation. 33 Depreciation 5.12 There have been several changes to the depreciation rules. From the 2000/01 income year until the 2004/05 income year, assets could be written off under one set of depreciation rules. In addition, a 20% depreciation loading applied for qualifying assets (that is, most depreciable assets other than buildings and land improvements). Buildings could be depreciated at a rate of 4% DV. From the 2005/06 income year, depreciation rates were changed in a way that speeded up depreciation deductions for most PME (especially short-lived PME) but reduced the depreciation rate on buildings. The 20% loading for qualifying assets continued. Budget 2010 announced several changes. Depreciation loading was terminated for assets acquired from 21 May 2010. This occurred in different income years for firms with different balance dates, but it applied for the majority of 2010/ 11 for companies with a standard balance date of 31 March. In our estimates we treat this as applying to assets acquired from the 2010/11 income year. In addition, depreciation deductions on buildings were removed with effect from the 2011/12 income year. 5.13 Depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings were restored at a rate of 2% DV from the beginning of the 2020/21 income year. 5.14 Table A5.2 shows the applicable depreciation rates at the end of the income years that relate to when the above changes were made. The figures in the last column come from table A5.1. Currently the DV rate of depreciation allowed for plant, machinery and equipment is given by d = 2/T where T is the estimated useful life. Before the end of the 2004/05 income year, depreciation allowed was given by 1/ 1 0.135 T d= − . This allows us to estimate average depreciation rates in prior years. 24 Figures reported in table A5.1 are inclusive of the 20% loading, if any. Table A5.2: Tax depreciation rates Asset type 2000/01 to 2004/05 2005/06 to 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 to 2019/20 2020/21 Exploration Expensed Expensed Expensed Expensed Expensed Land improvements 5.60% 5.80% 5.80% 5.80% 5.80% Non-residential buildings 4.00% 3.00% 3.00% 0.00% 2.00% Other construction 4.00% 4.00% 3.30% 3.30% 3.30% Plant, machinery and equipment 18.60% 20.20% 16.80% 16.80% 16.80% Residential buildings 4.00% 3.00% 3.00% 0.00% 0.00% Research and development Expensed Expensed Expensed Expensed Expensed Software 47.30% 60.00% 50.00% 50.00% 50.00% Transport equipment 21.60% 23.80% 19.80% 19.80% 19.80% R&D tax credits 5.15 Before the 2008/09 income year, R&D could normally be expensed and there were no additional tax credits for R&D. In the 2008/09 income year, a 15% R&D 24 This assumes a single ‘average’ depreciation rate for each of the income periods. In practice, there were a discrete number of different depreciation rates allowed. Assets were depreciated at the closest depreciation rate for an asset with the relevant estimated useful life. 34 tax credit was introduced, but this was repealed the following year. A 15% R&D tax credit was reintroduced in the 2019/20 income year. Thin capitalisation rules 5.16 Several changes made to the thin capitalisation rules could have affected costs of capital. We cannot be confident about their overall effects, as has been discussed in appendix 2. Our estimates may therefore understate increases in costs of capital over time to the extent that changes to the thin capitalisation rules have pushed up costs of capital. The estimates also do not take account of changes such as the restricted transfer pricing rules which are difficult to model. Other assumptions 5.17 Costs of capital can be affected not only by tax changes but also by changes in other variables, such as corporate debt levels, real interest rates or inflation. Our focus is on how changes in tax parameters have affected costs of capital. 5.18 A potential difficulty is the number of different cases that can arise for firms in slightly different positions, such as foreign-controlled companies or domestic companies. In our estimates, we focus solely on the case of a domestic company with marginal foreign shareholders. This means that costs of capital and EMTRs are impacted by AIL but not by NRWT on interest. 5.19 Costs of capital will tend to be very slightly lower for foreign-controlled companies that can make use of tax credits for NRWT and somewhat higher for foreign-controlled companies that cannot. However, as was discussed in appendix 2, differences in costs of capital between these different types of firms are unlikely to be very large. Also, changes over time in costs of capital and EMTRs are likely to be much the same for the different types of firms. Our estimates 5.20 Our estimates of the impact of changes to company tax rates, depreciation provisions and R&D tax credits on costs of capital are presented in table A5.3. Columns 2–10 provide estimates of costs of capital over time for the nine different types of assets for which Statistics NZ provides data on net capital stock. In making these estimates, we assume a constant world real cost of debt and equity of 3% and 2% per annum inflation. As a result of New Zealand’s 2% AIL, the domestic real interest rate is 3.10%. We assume that investment is 43% debt financed. Our estimates are for domestic companies with foreign portfolio shareholders. 5.21 The eleventh column then aggregates these costs of capital into a weighted average for the nine types of asset. The weightings for net capital stock are averages over the last three years for ‘market activities’ provided by Statistics NZ. Restricting our data to market activities affects our estimates. For example, the estimates for residential buildings exclude owner-occupied residential housing and government assets, such as schools and hospitals, that are not employed in market activities. 5.22 Over the 20-year period, our estimates suggest there has only been a slight increase – from 3.75% to 3.83% – in the weighted average cost of capital for the nine types of asset that Statistics NZ includes in its estimates of net capital stock. The weighted average rose slightly to 3.78% in 2005/06 when depreciation rates were scaled back for buildings but increased for short-lived machinery and equipment. It dropped to 3.59% in 2008/09 (when the company tax rate was cut from 33% to 30% and the 15% R&D tax credit was introduced). 35 It climbed back to 3.68% in 2009/10 (when the R&D tax credit was repealed) and then to 3.77% in 2010/11 (when depreciation loading was removed). Despite a further cut in the company tax rate to 28%, the weighted average increased to 4.06% in 2011/12 because of the removal of building depreciation. In the last couple of years, there has been some decline in costs of capital because of the reintroduction of an R&D tax credit and the restoration of depreciation deductions for commercial and industrial buildings. 5.23 The final column shows costs of capital for inventories. They are estimated to have fallen from 4.44% to 4.14% over this period because of the cut in the company tax rate in 2008/09 and again in 2011/12.

This is of course in line with the policy intent of subsidising R&D because of concerns that R&D is likely to generate positive externalities. The cost of capital for exploration is less than the 3% real assumed cost of funds to the economy because of expensing. Other investments have hurdle rates of return that exceed the 3% real cost of funds. 5.25 Not too much should be read into the exact numbers provided for the different types of assets because they depend on a reasonably tenuous method of estimating economic depreciation. This method involves dividing Statistics NZ estimates of consumption of fixed capital by net capital stock at the beginning of the year. Small changes in assumptions can have substantial effects. For 36 example, the BEA estimates that stand-alone houses or small groups of connected dwellings with four or fewer dwellings have an economic depreciation rate of 1.14%, and that larger developments of five or more dwellings have an economic depreciation rate of 1.4%. Using either of these estimates of economic depreciation would reduce estimated costs of capital for these assets to 3.82% or 3.93% respectively. We have not adjusted the costs of capital calculated for residential buildings as a result of the recent denial of interest deductibility. Interest on new builds of rental property continues to be deductible. 5.26 Table A5.4 presents estimates of EMTRs, once again assuming a world real interest rate of 3%, a debt level of 43% and 2% inflation. For R&D, the cost of capital is negative in three years (see table A5.5) and the tax wedge is also negative. This leads to very high positive EMTRs, which are meaningless. If the cost of capital were to fall, the calculated EMTR would rise. In cases where costs of capital are negative, EMTRs are not reported and are recorded with the ‘\*\*\*’ symbol.
