Executive summary Research purpose Inland Revenue has commissioned research to measure the tax compliance costs of small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) so that independent and evidence-based information can be used in developing and evaluating tax policy proposals. The research has been set up so that it can respond to policy proposals as they arise over the next 5-10 years. The starting point is a major benchmark survey quantifying relevant tax compliance costs for small and medium businesses. Research methodology A mail-out survey of small and medium businesses was conducted between October and December of 2004. A total of 1907 completed questionnaires were used in the analysis linked to key IRD extracted data. The response rates to the survey were 44% and 45% (for two questionnaire versions 1 ). Extensive qualitative pre-testing and piloting of the questionnaire was undertaken, as well as pilot data verification interviews, to develop and refine the questionnaires as well as to provide reassurance of the validity of the final dataset. A tax advisor sub-survey was conducted in December 2004 to gather information in order to apportion external tax advisor compliance costs to different tax types (this was especially important for businesses paying for external advice on multiple tax types). Key findings Definitions The measure of compliance costs used in this survey includes internal time and external advisor costs. Data is also collected on psychological costs although this is not converted into dollars. Cash flow, tax deductibility and managerial benefits and government cash grants are not included. The population of interest is New Zealand’s small and medium businesses (based on number of employees and annual turnover) and self-employed individuals with substantial income from ‘businesses activities’ (SMEs). 1 Two versions of the questionnaire were designed; a ‘long’ version of the questionnaire which was relevant to multiple tax type businesses, and a ‘short’ version of the questionnaire which was relevant to those paying income tax only. The questions in this short questionnaire were essentially a subset of the long (main) questionnaire. FINAL REPORT PAGE 8 colmar brunton Internal compliance costs Averages for internal compliance costs were calculated using a trimmed mean (i.e. with a few unusually high values removed before averaging) rather than the usual mean (which averages all values). Internal time spent on all tax activities The average SME spends 76.7 hours on tax compliance in a year. A breakdown of this amount by personnel type is as follows: • owners/partners/directors/trustees (56.3 hours) • paid employees (18.4 hours) • unpaid friends or relatives (3.4 hours). The amount of time spent on tax activities is strongly related to business size (from 51.3 hours for businesses without employees up to 204.5 hours for businesses with at least 20 employees). GST requires the greatest time commitment (44.2 hours for GST-registered businesses), followed by income tax (29.2 hours for those who pay income tax), PAYE (27.5 hours for employers), and FBT (12.8 hours for FBT payers). Internal time spent dealing with child support and student loans 11% of employers employ staff paying child support. On average, these employers spend 0.5 hours per year dealing with PAYE issues related to child support. This equates to 1.3% of the time they spend on PAYE in total. 20% of employers employ staff making student loan payments. On average, these employers spend 0.5 hours per year dealing with PAYE issues related to student loans. This equates to 1.3% of the time they spend on PAYE in total. Internal time spent on particular income tax-related activities On average, businesses spent around two hours in the last 12 months on each of the following activities: • Calculating provisional tax and deciding which provisional tax option to choose • Tax activities for depreciation and adjustments for fixed assets, valuing stock • Other end-of-year adjustments. The median values associated with these activities are zero indicating that most businesses have not spent any time on these activities in the last 12 months. Medium sized SMEs spend on average 12 hours per year on tax activities for depreciation and adjustments for fixed assets and valuing stock. Internal time spent on tax-related activities required for entertainment expenses Seventeen percent of businesses have dealt with the 50% deductibility and GST adjustment required for some entertainment expenses in the last 12 months. Businesses that make these type of adjustments spend around two hours per year on them. Value of time analysis The following dollar amounts were used to convert time into compliance costs: • $43.99 (owners/partners/directors/trustees) • $20.31 (paid employees) FINAL REPORT PAGE 9 colmar brunton • $25.70 (unpaid friends or relatives). Income tax The mean annual internal compliance cost for income tax is $1224. Income tax compliance costs rise with business size from $1146 for businesses with no employees to $1896 for businesses with 20+ employees. Income tax compliance costs are the same between those that use a tax advisor and those that do not ($1202 respectively). GST The mean annual internal compliance cost for GST is $1852 (based on those who file/pay GST). GST compliance costs increase with business size (from $1496 for businesses with no employees to $2369 for businesses with 20+ employees). A similar pattern is evident with regard to turnover. However, other analysis also shows that GST compliance costs as a proportion of turnover diminish sharply with size. Forty percent of GST-registrants use manual accounting systems for GST, 38% use computerised accounting software (in-house), 15% use ‘other’ computing systems (in-house) and 14% use external support. Those who pay for an external firm to handle aspects of their GST obligations experience the lowest internal GST tax compliance costs ($1399). Eighty four percent of those who use computerised accounting software say they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ still do so if New Zealand were tax-free, highlighting the importance of this type of software as a management information tool rather than a tax compliance cost. More frequent filers of GST experience higher internal GST compliance costs (annual mean compliance costs of $1993 for 2-monthly filers compared to $1449 for 6-monthly filers). PAYE The mean annual internal compliance cost for PAYE is $937 (based on employers). PAYE compliance costs rise with employer size from $959 for micro businesses (1-5 employees) to $1404 for medium-sized employers (20+ employees). However, smaller employers experience a markedly higher compliance cost on a per employee basis - $520 for micro employers (1-5 employees), $166 for small employers (6-19 employees) and $43 for medium employers (20+ employees). Sixty percent of employers use a manual system for processing staff wages, 26% use a computerised payroll system, and 10% use ‘other’ computing system (in-house). FBT The mean annual compliance cost for FBT is $416 (based on those who make FBT payments). Apart from SMEs with nil employees, FBT compliance costs do not rise with business size. External tax advisor costs Eighty percent of businesses pay for external tax advisor services. Among those who pay for these services, the mean annual payment is $1465. The mean annual payment made for external tax advisor services for each tax type is as follows: • $480 for services relating to GST (among all GST-registered businesses who pay for external services related to GST) FINAL REPORT PAGE 10 colmar brunton • $1,202 for services relating to income tax (among all those who pay for external services related to income tax) • $141 for services relating to PAYE (among all employers who pay for external services related to PAYE) • $149 for services relating to FBT (among all those who make FBT payments to IRD and who pay for external services related to FBT). Tax advisors indicate that the average payment made for external advice on the choice between provisional tax options is $159 (although this differs markedly according to business size). Opinion, among businesses, on whether they would retain the services of an external tax accountant if New Zealand were tax-free is divided: 44% say that they ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ would, 45% say they ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ wouldn’t, and 9% are unsure. Tax advisors are similarly divided on this issue. Payroll services Seven percent of employers use external payroll services. On average, these businesses spend $1550 on payroll services annually. And, a small majority (56%) of these businesses indicate that they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ still use external payroll services if New Zealand was tax-free. Combined costs The combined compliance costs given in this report are the sum of internal compliance costs and external compliance costs. They do not include costs associated with audits or payroll services nor do they incorporate any estimates of cash flow benefits or benefits of tax deductibility. Psychological costs have been collected but are not valued in dollar terms. The mean combined compliance costs for businesses are summarised in the first chart below. The average business faces a combined annual tax compliance cost of $4024. GST-related costs and income- tax related costs are by far the largest contributors to this. Again, the familiar pattern of increasing costs with business size is evident – from $2932 for businesses with no employees to $7649 for businesses with 20 or more employees. However, as illustrated in the subsequent chart, compliance costs clearly diminish as a percentage of turnover.

Around half (51%) find meeting IRD requirements overall less than moderately stressful (rating of 1 to 3), one quarter (24%) find them moderately stressful, and just under a quarter (23%) find them more than moderately stressful (rating of 5 to 7). Reported levels of stress in dealing with GST and provisional tax are higher than those relating to PAYE and FBT. However, additional analysis detailed in the body of the report shows that employers tend to report higher stress levels than those without employees in regard to their overall tax requirements, provisional tax and GST. FINAL REPORT PAGE 13 colmar brunton 2. Background and objectives Background Policy purposes The small and medium-sized business (SME) sector in New Zealand is important, as most New Zealand businesses are small. More than 95 percent employ fewer than 20 people while 86 percent employ fewer than five. Small businesses also form a more significant part of the economy in New Zealand than they do in other OECD countries. New Zealand averages around six employees per firm, whereas most other OECD countries average from ten to twenty employees. The Government’s tax simplification programme recognises that many small businesses struggle to comply with the increasingly complex set of tax laws to which they are subject. Key concerns for small businesses are the costs of compliance and the risks associated with non-compliance. The focus of the simplification programme is on reducing the stress, uncertainty and risks that these concerns place on small business. A number of discussion documents outlining initiatives to reduce tax compliance costs for small businesses have been released, including the Simplifying Taxpayer Requirements (1997) discussion document and, more recently, the Less Taxing Tax (1999), More Time For Business (2001) and Making Tax Easier for Small Businesses (2003) discussion documents. A number of the initiatives have been implemented. Research is required to assist in monitoring the impact of past and present legislative and administrative initiatives on reducing business tax compliance costs and also to allow for better consideration of the impact of proposed changes on tax compliance costs at each stage of the tax policy development process. This should also facilitate better compliance with Business Compliance Costs Statement (BCCS) requirements for policy proposals. Alignment with other Inland Revenue priorities A priority for Inland Revenue is to tailor interventions to make it easier for small businesses to meet their tax obligations and to increase their confidence in the tax administration. Simplification of tax administration interventions is a key focus of the Department’s strategy and the Government is implementing or considering a number of specific proposals. 2 Research objectives The overriding purpose of the research is to provide independent and evidence-based information on the tax compliance costs of small and medium-sized business for the purposes of developing and evaluating tax policy proposals. The research is to be set up so that it can respond to policy proposals as they arise over the next 5-10 years. The starting point is a major benchmark survey quantifying compliance costs in hours and dollar terms for small and medium businesses. 2 Inland Revenue, ‘Our Statement of Intent’, 2004-2005, p23 FINAL REPORT PAGE 14 colmar brunton The overall research objectives, which the benchmark survey contributes to, are as follows: • To estimate the tax compliance costs of small and medium business. • To provide measures of the impact of actual changes to the tax system on tax compliance costs faced by businesses. In particular: - By how much and in what direction do compliance costs change? - Which elements of compliance costs change? - Which groups of taxpayers are affected? - To what extent can the changes be attributed to the specific intervention? • Similarly, for proposed tax initiatives, forecast the expected impact on compliance costs. • To pre-test the impact of proposed initiatives in a prospective or experimental way. • To develop and implement a framework for monitoring, over time, the tax compliance costs incurred at various stages of the life (and tax) cycle of a business. • To provide information for better compliance with BCCS reporting requirements, particularly, in relation to quantitative assessments of compliance costs. This report presents the results of this benchmark study. Defining compliance costs The Government’s objective is to make tax easier for small businesses, and this calls for a broad understanding of tax burdens and costs. For example, some of the proposed initiatives aim to reduce the burden through easing cash flow or budgeting problems and these may potentially involve more time spent on tax than previously. This and the fact that this benchmark survey has an applied policy purpose have a number of implications for the definition and measurement of ‘compliance costs’ adopted by Inland Revenue, a definition which differs from the more conventional ‘total compliance costs’ used in other surveys. First, reducing cash flow management problems is an integral element of some of the proposed initiatives. Therefore it is important to include a measure of cash flow benefit in the equation, both in terms of dollars saved or foregone as well the less quantifiable benefits of ease of mind. Second, some of the less frequent compliance costs that may generate unusually high costs (eg associated with being audited) and those where the tax component is not easily isolated (eg paying a payroll agency) have been acknowledged and quantified to varying degrees but not included in the main calculations. Furthermore, this project does not aim to estimate nationwide business compliance costs in total. First, this research has not surveyed all businesses, e.g. large businesses are excluded. Second, calculated compliance costs are based on trimmed means which exclude the extreme values at the upper end, thus providing a more robust basis for comparing compliance costs over time, in the future. FINAL REPORT PAGE 15 colmar brunton ATAX’s 3 definition of ‘total compliance costs’ is: (Direct monetary outgoings incurred by taxpayers + Imputed costs of time and resources spent by taxpayers) − (Managerial benefits to taxpayers+ Cash flow benefits to taxpayers + Tax deductibility benefits to taxpayers + Cash grants from the government) This is the foundation of the definition adopted by Inland Revenue, with the restrictions noted above. The definition for this benchmark quantifying exercise is: benchmark compliance costs = internal time + external advisor costs – (cash flow benefits + tax deductibility) + psychological costs \[excluding audit costs, computing and other internal non-labour costs, external payroll provider costs\] where: internal time = imputed costs of time spent by owners, staff, family and friends external advisor costs = direct monetary outgoings to tax advisers (regular & occasional) cash flow benefits = financial benefits arising from the mismatch in timing between when taxes are collected and when they are remitted to the tax authority tax deductibility = for example, costs associated with using a tax advisor psychological costs = the level of stress associated with tax activities including finding the money; measures are not converted to dollars This survey contributes the data for the core compliance costs, ie internal time and external tax advisor costs. Data on psychological costs has also been collected (though not converted into dollars). Cash flow, tax deductibility and managerial benefits and government cash grants are not included. 3 The tax compliance costs of small and medium-sized business, C Evans and B Tran-Nam, ATAX, University of New South Wales, January 2004, page 12.

Inland Revenue appreciates and acknowledges the assistance from Dr Chris Evans and Dr Binh Tran-Nam from Atax, University of New South Wales; Katherine Ritchie, Senior Lecturer in Taxation at Manukau Institute of Technology; Charles Sullivan of Capital Research; Business New Zealand; the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand; and Colmar Brunton. The conceptual framework and options provided by Atax are in their report to Inland Revenue, The tax compliance costs of small and medium-sized businesses , by C Evans and B Tran-Nam, January 2004. Sample design Inland Revenue selected a sample of businesses for focus in this research. The population of interest is small and medium businesses in New Zealand, and self-employed individuals with substantial income from such businesses (whose income tax returns are potentially affected by proposed changes to provisional tax). To define this for the purposes of a quantitative survey we used the following dimensions: 1. Business ‘Nature’, indicated by i. legal, or business Structure (IRD’s entity type) ii. types of tax paid 2. Business Size, indicated by i. number of employees ii. annual turnover The survey population is 485,317 SMEs. In practice, the small and medium business population was defined into two sub-populations: 1. multiple tax type businesses, that is paying GST and/or employing staff (in addition to being subject to income tax) (N = 376,929) 2. those paying income tax only (individuals with business income, sole traders too small to pay GST or employ staff, a few business entities not liable for other taxes) 4 – around one quarter of the sample was allocated to this group. (N =108,388) A disproportionate stratified random sample, totalling 4,848 SMEs, was drawn reflecting different levels of turnover, employee numbers, tax type and whether FBT is paid. Data were weighted so that the results can be used to generalise to the entire population of interest (weighting is discussed later in this chapter). 4 Note, individual self-employed entities were limited to those receiving income from business activity which was judged distinct from rental, investment or overseas income. FINAL REPORT PAGE 18 colmar brunton In general terms, SMEs were included if: • they were registered for either GST or PAYE (as at 30 June 2004) as Companies, Partnerships, Trusts, Maori Authorities or Individual – Self Employed or Employing taxpaying entities, or • earned sufficient ‘business income’ and were ‘income tax only’ (IR3, IR4, IR6 & IR7 tax return filers). And excluded if: • on grounds of size, they employ 50+ staff AND have an annual turnover $10+ million • were not active i.e. not trading • were very small or relatively inactive businesses. An in-depth description and discussion of the sampling design used for this study is given in a document prepared by Inland Revenue: ‘Measuring the Compliance Costs of Small and Medium Businesses: Design Summary: Version 2.; 9a. Strata Population Sizes \[New Version: including appropriate non-valid addresses\].’ Before being given the contact lists of businesses, Inland Revenue sent all the selected businesses a letter introducing the purpose of the forthcoming research and giving businesses an opportunity to withdraw their names from the lists before they were passed onto Colmar Brunton. Following the provision of contact lists of businesses from Inland Revenue, Colmar Brunton removed businesses that had participated in survey research over recent months. Questionnaire development Initial scoping work and questionnaire development was undertaken by Charles Sullivan and Katherine Ritchie (including testing questionnaire versions with several businesses). Colmar Brunton undertook further work on questionnaire design. Two versions of the questionnaire were designed; a ‘long’ version of the questionnaire which was relevant to multiple tax type businesses, and a ‘short’ version of the questionnaire which was relevant to those paying income tax only. The questions in this short questionnaire were essentially a subset of the long (main) questionnaire. Cognitive interviewing Colmar Brunton conducted 16 cognitive face-to-face interviews in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch to qualitatively pre-test both versions of the survey questionnaire. Eleven of the interviews involved testing the ‘long’ questionnaire version and five involved testing the simpler, shortened version of the questionnaire. Pilot The questionnaires were then further revised and piloted. The pilot consisted of mailing out 239 questionnaires in total (188 long questionnaires and 51 short questionnaires). Seventy one questionnaires were completed and returned to Colmar Brunton (58 long and 13 short). Pilot data verification interviews Following the pilot, 16 data verification interviews were conducted to provide reassurance regarding the validity of key questions. The key issues addressed were: • Whether respondents regarded the cost of an external tax advisor preparing annual accounts as a tax compliance cost. The data verification interviews indicated that this varied. Inland Revenue FINAL REPORT PAGE 19 colmar brunton subsequently decided that this was a reasonable outcome – it should be left to the respondent to decide whether these costs are tax compliance costs. Following the pilot, ‘check’ questions to ensure the amounts paid to external tax advisors were purely tax-related were revised and emphasised. • How respondents allocated time in Q13a/13b of the long questionnaire and Q6a/6c of the short questionnaire, and in particular whether double counting occurred. Key findings were: - Rows were commonly left blank, but all respondents indicated that these blanks meant zero (ie no time was spent on the activity) 5 - Most respondents claimed to have made an effort to avoid double counting although a few (four of the 16) indicated that there was a degree of overlap between ‘recording information needed for tax’ and ‘dealing with tax advisors’ as it was hard to separate these or break them down into very small time components (eg 5 minutes). - There was a tendency for respondents to overstate their time in the first tax activity line in the question (i.e. recording information needed for tax, etc.) because they included activities we intended them to cover in the subsequent lines. On realising they had done this, these respondents tended to leave the subsequent lines blank (if they had included this time in the first line) and enter a total at the bottom. This finding suggests that the totals are more reliable than the individual tax activities. • What respondents used as a basis for valuing the time spent on tax compliance activities (Q14 in the long questionnaire and Q7 in the short questionnaire). Respondents tended to use either a set charge-out rate or calculation based on salaries and wages. This finding was borne in mind in determining appropriate dollar values to use in calculating compliance costs (this is addressed in depth later in the report in the section entitled ‘Value of time analysis’). The overall conclusion from the pilot data verification interviews was that overall the questionnaire facilitated the collection of data that can be regarded as having high validity, that is, it measures what was intended. Main fieldwork – business survey Business survey Self-completion questionnaires (the long and short versions) were sent to 4848 businesses on the 14 th of October 2004. 3686 long questionnaires were dispatched and 1162 short questionnaires were dispatched. The following measures were undertaken to maximise the response rate: • Highlighter pens with Post-it flags were sent with the initial questionnaires. • Postcard reminders were sent to all businesses approximately one week after the initial dispatch. • Reminder letters with replacement questionnaires were sent to all businesses that had not yet returned a questionnaire. • 600 telephone reminder calls were made (450 to businesses that were sent the long questionnaire and 150 to businesses that were sent the short questionnaire). See Appendix A for when the initiatives were employed. 5 A series of editing rules were developed, and applied, regarding the interpretation of ‘blank’ rows. FINAL REPORT PAGE 20 colmar brunton Response rate analysis In total, 4848 questionnaires were dispatched and 2353 completed questionnaires returned. Therefore, the response rate based on the number of questionnaires dispatched is 49%. However, this response rate does not take into account the number of businesses that declined to participate when they were sent the ‘consent’ letter (thus, these businesses were not included in the contact lists sent to Colmar Brunton). Therefore, based on all eligible SMEs initially selected for the study the overall response rate to the study is 44% 6 . Table 3.1: Response rate analysis Long Questionnaire Short Questionnaire Overall Number of ‘consent’ letters 7 dispatched by Inland Revenue 4142 1478 5620 Less ineligible ‘businesses’: Withdrew – No longer in business Less ineligible ‘businesses’: Returned – Address not known 8 38 104 43 97 81 201 A Overall number of eligible businesses 4000 1338 5338 B Number of contacts provided by Inland Revenue 3721 1184 4905 C Questionnaires dispatched (number remaining after Colmar Brunton’s ‘deduping’ process) 3686 1162 4848 D Completed questionnaires returned 1749 604 2353 E Questionnaires returned indicating we did not have a current address 51 25 76 F Uncompleted questionnaires returned 56 95 95 ‘Questionnaire’ Response rate (D/C) 47% 52% 49% Overall Response rate (D/A) 44% 45% 44% Although 604 short questionnaires were returned, only 158 have been used in the analysis. The 446 respondents who have been excluded fall into three categories: 1. 381 respondents who ticked income tax and some other tax type in Q1, raising considerable concern about whether the results relating to the taxpayer’s time spent on tax compliance (Q6a) related solely to income tax 9 . This concern was supported by the results of ‘callbacks’ made to 20 of these respondents – the majority were involved in other taxable activities and were not able to or didn't separate the business/entity selected from other interests/subsidiaries mixing all other tax types into their responses to Q6a. Hence we cannot be confident that their recorded time relates to only income tax for one business. 2. 26 individuals who Inland Revenue identified as being part of a group that proved to be ineligible after the sample was drawn. 3. 39 respondents did not indicate that they filed/paid income tax at Q1. 6 This response rate is slightly underestimated because it does not exclude those businesses that were removed from the dispatch lists because of the ‘deduping’ process (that ensured businesses who had recently participated in a Colmar Brunton survey were not sent a questionnaire for this study). Further, some of the businesses that declined at the ‘consent’ letter stage may also have been removed at the ‘deduping’ stage had they reached this point. 7 IRD sent out letters to SMEs asking them to participate in a survey which measures their tax compliance costs. If they did not want to take part they had the opportunity of opting out. 8 ‘Businesses’ for which IRD does not hold current address information were excluded on the basis that they are no longer trading businesses and hence ineligible. 9 6 respondents had ticked both income tax and another tax type, but were included in the final sample for analysis because they had clearly separated out these additional tax types in their responses at Q6a (under the category ‘other’). FINAL REPORT PAGE 21 colmar brunton Item response In addition to the overall response rates reported above, the following analysis assesses the extent to which we have successfully collected the key data necessary to estimate compliance costs. This analysis takes into account the amount of missing information, responses where the business indicated that they ‘didn’t know’ the amount of time they spent on tax activities, as well as outliers that have been ‘trimmed’ from the mean calculations. Note, whilst Inland Revenue provided an indication of the tax types relevant to each respondent in the list used for mailing out the surveys, this information did not necessarily match the tax types respondents reported that they filed (at Q1 in the questionnaire). Thus, we are not able to estimate reliable item response rates based on all businesses that were sent a questionnaire and that file the particular tax type in question. Instead, we have looked at the extent to which respondents to the survey were able to answer Q13b. Question 13b has been used for the basis of this analysis as this question provides the key data for the calculation of internal compliance costs for each tax type. Tax type GST Income tax PAYE FBT A. The number of respondents of the survey that pay/file the particular tax type (according to their response at Q1) 1744 1854 1325 343 B. The number of respondents for whom we do not have useable data at Q14b due to missing information, ‘don’t knows’ or outliers. 125 275 128 32 C. The number of respondents whose responses were used in the calculation of internal compliance costs 1546 1521 1155 316 Proportion of respondents that provided useable data (C/A) at Q14b 89% 82% 87% 92% Non-response bias – long questionnaire The following table analyses those who responded to the long business survey and those who did not by tax type. Tax type variables were included on the contact lists that Inland Revenue provided. The analysis suggests that there is little non-response bias in terms of tax type, that is, the likelihood of a business responding does not appear to be dependent on tax type. Table 3.2: Comparison of respondents and non-respondents Questionnaires dispatched Questionnaires returned Questionnaires not returned Tax type Number % of questionnaires dispatched Number % of questionnaires dispatched Income tax 3686 1742 47.3 1944 52.7 GST 3486 1659 47.6 1827 52.4 PAYE 2316 1124 48.5 1192 51.5 FBT 638 305 47.8 333 52.2 FINAL REPORT PAGE 22 colmar brunton Table 3.3 provides further analysis on the possible extent of non-response bias. Respondents have been separated into groups according to how quickly they responded to the survey. This type of analysis surmises that businesses that returned a questionnaire late in the fieldwork period are more likely to be similar in nature to non-responders than businesses that returned a questionnaire early in the fieldwork period. Responses to Question 13b have been used for the analysis as this question forms the basis for the calculations of internal tax compliance costs (presented later in the report). Weighted data has been used to isolate the nature of possible non-response bias from any bias that the weighting will correct for. A oneway ANOVA has been carried out to assess whether there are statistically significant differences by tax type. T-tests were then used to determine statistical differences: • between early and mid responders, or • between mid and late responders, or • between early and late responders. There are significant differences (at the 95% confidence level) by tax type. Further, there are significant differences: 1. between early and mid responders in terms of the number of hours spent on tax activities overall (ie 70.1 hours compared to 83.2 hours) 2. between early and late responders in terms of the number of hours spent on tax activities overall (ie 70.1 hours compared to 89.1 hours). This analysis suggests there may be a small degree of non response bias in terms of the number of hours that businesses spend on tax activities.

This information was collected from named tax advisors in respect to specific clients. A self-completion questionnaire was pre-tested with three tax advisors. Self-completion questionnaires were then sent to 554 tax advisors. Questionnaires were only sent to the tax advisors of businesses that participated in the business survey (long questionnaire) and who gave consent to their tax advisor being contacted for this purpose. Response data for the tax advisor sub-survey questionnaire is specified below. Table 3.4: Response rate analysis – tax advisor sub-survey Number of businesses in long questionnaires that use an external tax advisor 1488 Questionnaires dispatched (number of respondents who gave consent to their tax advisor being contacted within the survey period) 554 Completed questionnaires returned 275 Questionnaires returned indicating wrong address 10 Uncompleted questionnaires returned 1 Response rate A (% of tax advisors sent a questionnaire who returned a completed questionnaire) 50% Response rate B (% of businesses in long questionnaire who use an external tax advisor and whose tax advisor returned a completed tax advisor questionnaire) 18% As indicated in the above table, whilst a good response rate was achieved from tax advisors who were sent the tax advisor questionnaire, the low level of consent from businesses to send tax advisors a questionnaire results in a low overall response rate. However, the following information should also be considered in determining the extent to which results from the tax advisor sub-survey can be generalised. Early testing of the questionnaire indicated that businesses were able to reasonably easily report the total payment made to their tax advisor, but businesses were unsure how this amount was allocated by tax type. Hence, the tax advisor sub-survey is most important for businesses that use external tax advice for multiple tax types. This is because the business survey data can be reliably used for payments made for external advice when the business seeks this advice for one tax type only (as this simply involves using the total payment figure from the business survey). In total, we required information about 1616 respondents (both respondents to the long and short questionnaires) in terms of payments made for external tax advice. Of these 1616 respondents: • data provided by tax advisors has been used for 275 respondents • business survey data has been used for 566 because the business pays for advice on one tax type only (covers both long and short questionnaires). FINAL REPORT PAGE 24 colmar brunton Thus we have data for 841 out of 1616 respondents. This equates to 52%. Thus this is a reasonable basis on which to estimate external tax compliance costs for particular tax types. A detailed explanation of how external tax compliance costs have been calculated is given later in this chapter in the section entitled ‘Data imputation’. Data integrity and data processing A number of steps were undertaken with respect to data integrity including the following: • A series of comprehensive editing checks and database checks to test for the internal validity of the data. This included checking for the distinction between missing values and true 0’s. • Telephoning respondents back to clarify/check their answers. Telephone calls were made for this purpose to 13% of businesses that completed a questionnaire. The most common reason for these telephone calls was that the respondent had failed to confirm whether the amount paid for external tax advice (at Q10a in the long questionnaire) related to tax requirements only. • 100% double-entry of data. We consider the level of internal data validity to be very good. The size of any discrepancies discovered in the data is generally not regarded to be of significant concern. Of particular interest is the reasonably high degree of consistency between: • responses made to Q13a in the long questionnaire (Q6a in the short questionnaire) which relate to time spent on tax activities by tax type, and • responses to Q13b in the long questionnaire (Q6c in the short questionnaire) which relate to the amount of time spent by types of personnel for each tax type. Of respondents who provided values at both Q13a in the long questionnaire (Q6a in the short questionnaire) and Q13b in the long questionnaire (Q6c in the short questionnaire), the total figures given in these two questions matched exactly for: • 85% of respondents in relation to GST • 88% of respondents in relation to income tax • 89% of respondents in relation to PAYE • 96% of respondents in relation to FBT. Database construction Weighting The data have been weighted so that the survey results can be used to generalise to the entire survey population. Unless otherwise stated, weighted data has been used. Weighting was conducted in two stages. First, a pre-weight was applied to correct for sample selection probabilities. The pre-weight was calculated as (N(i)/n(i))\*(n/N) Where: N(i) is the population of statrum i n(i) is the sample size of statrum i N is the total population size And n is the total sample size. FINAL REPORT PAGE 25 colmar brunton This was followed by weighting by strata to strata proportions (based on the figures provided in a document prepared by Inland Revenue: ‘Measuring Compliance the Costs of Small and Medium Businesses: Design Summary: Version 2.; 9a. Strata Population Sizes \[New Version: including appropriate non-valid addresses\].’. It should be noted that since the only variable being weighted to was strata proportions, the pre-weight stage effectively produced weights to these proportions. The second stage of weighting to strata proportions, while unnecessary, was still performed. Strata e and i (micro businesses that pay FBT with nil turnover and turnover of less than $100,000 respectively), f and j (small businesses that pay FBT with nil turnover and turnover of less than $100,000 respectively), and t and x (small businesses that don’t pay FBT with nil turnover and turnover of less than $100,000 respectively) were combined to increase cell size. The weighting was calculated based on a target of 1928, being the total number of respondents before removing 21 due to missing database information making it impossible to assign them to a stratum. Businesses with 20+ employees and turnover of under $100,000 were excluded from the sampling frame and consequently were excluded from the population figures used to calculate weighting proportions. These businesses represent 0.03% of the total population of interest. While any effects from this would be minimal, it should be noted that the results of the survey do not represent these businesses. Data imputation Turnover and sector Missing values for turnover and sector, in the business survey data have been imputed using information from Inland Revenue’s database for turnover and sector. External tax compliance costs The calculation of external compliance costs by tax type has been undertaken using both data from the tax advisor sub-survey and the business surveys, as well as data imputation. Relying solely on the tax advisor sub-survey data would have been problematic due to the relatively low response rate of that survey. To this end, external compliance costs have been calculated by using the following data: • For respondents to the long business survey for whom we have data from their tax advisors, we have used the tax advisor-supplied data (regardless of whether it matched the total $ amount that the business gave and regardless of whether they use their tax advisor for one or more tax types). • For respondents to the long business survey for whom we do not have data from their tax advisors, but who only ticked one tax type at Q10b, we have used the $ amount given at Q10a (if they confirmed at Q10a that the amount only included tax-related costs). • For respondents to the short questionnaire we have used their response to Q4 (if they confirmed at Q4 that the amount only included tax-related costs) as reflective of the amount they paid for external tax services in relation to income tax . We therefore had ‘missing information’ for respondents to the long questionnaire who use external tax advice for multiple tax types, but for whom we do not have data from their tax advisors. Imputed data (utilising results to Q10b as well as industry sector) has been used for these respondents. FINAL REPORT PAGE 26 colmar brunton As a check on the reliability of the above process, an assessment of the extent to which tax advisor reported data and business survey data matches (in terms of the total tax payment made for external advice) was undertaken. This analysis is appended to the report (see Appendix E) and shows a reasonably strong (positive) correlation between these two sets of data. To impute for long questionnaire respondents with multiple tax types, without tax advisor data, groups of respondents based on industry and the number of tax types they filed for were created. From the tax advisor data the proportion of the advisor costs that went to each tax type for each of the previously mentioned segments were found. This proportion was then applied to the total amount that the respondent claimed they paid to their tax advisor in Q10a if they had indicated in Q10aiii that the fees they paid only included tax fees. Long questionnaire respondents with multiple tax types, without tax advisor data who had not indicated in Q10aiii that the fees they paid only included tax fees did not have any external costs imputed for them. Calculation of means Trimmed 10 means have been used extensively in the analysis and reporting of the amount of time businesses spend on tax compliance and associated tax compliance costs. This involved excluding any values whose log falls outside of the Median(log10(x)) + 2.24 MAD(log10(x)) where MAD is the median absolute deviation normalized to approximate the standard deviation for normally distributed data. The constant 2.24 was selected so that only the most extreme values would be trimmed. Given the highly skewed nature of the results, no values were trimmed from the bottom end. Note that by taking logs, zero values are excluded from the trimming process, but the zeros are re-introduced for the mean and median calculations. The primary reasons for the decision to use trimmed means rather than conventional means were as follows: • To avoid misleading descriptions of tax compliance costs – conventional means are prone to considerable influence with the presence of a small number of very high values. • Trimmed means were regarded to be a better fit with policy objectives, that is policy initiatives will likely be aimed at reductions in compliance costs for a broad range of businesses rather than a few businesses with unusually high costs (eg due to audit). • Trimmed means are more sensitive to detecting changes over time than conventional means. When data is affected by a few high values, conventional tests of differences between means can often fail to detect real change. 10 ‘Trimmed mean’ normally refers to a mean calculated after first removing a fixed percentage of values from the top and bottom of the distribution (eg a 5% trimmed mean is the average after 5% of the smallest values and 5% of the larges values have been removed). We used a more flexible trimming process in which the percentage of values trimmed varied depending on the extent to which a particular question elicited extreme values (outliers); only such outliers were removed before averaging. FINAL REPORT PAGE 27 colmar brunton The following graphs show the effect of the trimming process. The first is a histogram of the total annual hours spent on GST returns (Skewness 5.934924; Kurtosis 56.90451). Figure 4: Total annual hours spent on GST returns 2000150010005000 Total GST Hours (Annual) 500 400 300 200 100 0 Frequency Taking the log of this variable has two effects. It removes zero values and changes the distribution to a much more normal distribution (Skewness 0.070814; Kurtosis 0.378891).

Figure 6: Trimmed total annual hours spent on GST returns 4003002001000 Trimmed Total GST Hours (Annual) 500 400 300 200 100 0 Frequency Calculation of medians Outliers have not been removed in calculating medians. Unlike the mean calculations, inclusion of outliers in the median calculations had very little effect. Treatment of missing information The following data has been excluded from the calculation of mean and median values: • Missing information 11 • Don’t knows Where the respondent did not complete Q13a or Q13b and they wrote on the questionnaire that their accountant dealt with the particular tax type, these have been treated as ‘zero’ responses and this included in the mean and median calculations. Missing information has been reported as a separate category for results that are presented as percentages. Thus, missing information has been included in the base in calculating these percentages. 11 The database contains both cases of ‘Value missing’ and ‘system missing value’. The former is what we have labelled as ‘missing information’ in this report. It refers to the situation when a respondent has not provided a response, but yet we would have expected them to have. Whereas a system missing value refers to the situation when a respondent has not provided a response and we did not require them to provide one (eg Questions pertaining to GST were not required to be answered by those who did not file/pay GST). FINAL REPORT PAGE 29 colmar brunton Presentation of results The survey results are largely presented in tables. The following explanations may assist the reader in interpreting the data: • The numbers given in the brackets refer to the unweighted sample size. • Where means have been trimmed, this is specified. • Where percentages do not add to 100% this may be due to rounding or because more than one response category potentially applied to the respondent. Analyses by industry sector are detailed in Appendix F as variations by sector appear to largely be a result of business size variations. Analysis by business size is presented extensively throughout the body of the report. Significance testing Estimated sampling errors have been calculated for the results presented in the section entitled ‘Combined costs’. To account for the imputation and trimming process of the external costs, confidence intervals have been estimated through bootstrapping. This process involved drawing a random sample (with replacement). The resulting sample was reweighted, imputed and trimmed. The mean of the variable of interest was then stored. This was repeated 200 times. The stored mean values is an estimate of the sampling distribution for the variable of interest and therefore the standard deviation is an estimate of the standard error of the variable. This was then used to calculate the confidence interval for the variable. Confidence intervals for internal costs were simply calculated based on the standard error of the variable. In addition, some tests for the statistical significance of apparent differences in the survey results between questions and/or subgroups have been carried out. Unless otherwise specified, all tests have been carried out at the 95% confidence level. Use of the word ‘significant’ in the report refers to statistical significance (at the 95% confidence level). Two types of tests have been used: • In comparing proportions between samples, a z-test has been used to determine statistical significance. The notation is: z=(p1-p2)/sqrt((p1\*(1-p1)/n1)+(p2\*(1-p2)/n2)) where n1/n2 are the sample sizes and p1/p2 are the proportions we are comparing. The resulting z-value is compared to the Normal (0,1) distribution. • In comparing means, the two-tailed t-tests available in the statistical packages SPSS and Toolbox have been used. The sample sizes used in these tests exclude any outliers that were removed as part of the trimming process. FINAL REPORT PAGE 30 colmar brunton 4.

FINAL REPORT PAGE 38 colmar brunton 5. Internal time and costs This chapter examines the internal time that businesses spend on tax compliance activities, followed by an analysis of the value of that time and estimates of internal tax compliance costs. The costs incurred by businesses through the purchase of external tax advice/services are covered in Chapter 6. Internal time Internal time spent on specific tax activities Respondents were asked to estimate the average number of hours per month the business spent on tax activities during the last 12 months (See Figure 7). For each tax type, they were asked to record this information by tax activity. Although monthly data was collected, for analysis and reporting purposes, this data has been converted to annual figures. Figure 7: Question 13a in long questionnaire In answering this question: 13a Recording information needed for tax (e.g. GST amounts, employee tax codes).

Some taxes are dealt with only once or twice a year; please include this time on a monthly basis (e.g. if you spent 12 hourson end-of-year income tax count this as 1 hourper month). •Include time spent by owners/partners/directors/trustees, paid employees, and unpaid friends or relatives. •Only count hours once(e.g. if you count some hours beside the heading “Recording information needed for tax”, do not count the same hours beside “Calculating tax, completing tax forms, paying tax”). •If no time was spent on a particular activity, please write in ‘0’ or a dash (-). If the tax type does not apply to your business, you can cross out the column. Tables 5.1 and 5.2 detail the amount of time spent on specific tax activities for each tax type. Table 5.1 uses mean values and Table 5.2 uses medians 15 . Sample sizes are shown in brackets. 15 The mean values are trimmed. The median values are not trimmed. See explanation on the trimming of means in the report chapter entitled ‘Research Methodology’ for more detail. FINAL REPORT PAGE 39 colmar brunton On average, businesses spend 75.6 hours per year on tax activities. GST accounts for a considerable portion of the time spent on tax activities with GST registrants spending on average 49.3 hours. Income tax and PAYE require similar amounts of time with 29.7 hours and 29.2 hours respectively spent on these tax types (among those who file these tax types). The medians given in Table 5.2 are notably lower than the means given in Table 5.1. This indicates that the distribution of businesses is skewed towards the bottom end (ie towards zero); a minority of businesses with higher hours is essentially ‘pulling’ the means upward. However, this situation is not as marked as it would have been had we not used ‘trimmed’ means. The bulk of the time spent on tax activities appears to be spent in recording information, calculating tax, completing and filing returns and paying tax. Recording information is clearly the dominant tax activity in relation to GST and Income tax. This is evident from the tables and is illustrated pictorially in Figure 8. In interpreting the data, the reader should note the following. As discussed earlier in this report under the chapter entitled ‘Research methodology’, the data verification interviews conducted following the pilot indicated that there was a tendency for some respondents to overstate their time in the first tax activity line in the question (i.e. recording information needed for tax, etc.) because they included activities we intended them to cover in the subsequent lines. On realising they had done this, these respondents tended to leave the subsequent lines blank (if they had included this time in the first line) and enter a total at the bottom. This finding suggests that the totals are more reliable than the individual tax activities. The data verification interviews also suggested there was a degree of overlap between ‘recording information needed for tax’ and ‘dealing with tax advisors’ as it was hard to separate these or break them down time into very small time components (eg 5 minutes).

FINAL REPORT PAGE 41 colmar brunton There is a strong correlation between business size and the number of hours a business spends on tax activities per year. This pattern is also evident within each of the tax activities (with the exception of ‘other’ tax activities).

Table 5.5 breaks this information down by tax type. The time spent on tax activities associated with each of the specific tax types tends to increase as business size increases. However, the differences between some business size groupings are not significantly different. For example between those with no employees and micro-sized businesses in relation to income tax, and between small and medium-sized businesses in relation to FBT.

Thus, respondents in the ‘nil employees’ category can be regarded as not currently employing staff, but having done so in the last 12 months (as they indicated at Question 1 that they had paid/filed PAYE in the last 12 months). FINAL REPORT PAGE 43 colmar brunton Internal time spent on tax activities by specific types of personnel Similarly, for each tax type, respondents were asked to estimate how many hours per month different types of people (eg owners, paid employees, unpaid friends or relatives) spent on tax activities during the last 12 months. Again, this data has been converted into annual figures. Table 5.6, Figure 10, and Table 5.7 detail the amount of time that different types of personnel spend on tax activities in relation to each tax type. Table 5.6 and Figure 10 use mean values and Table 5.7 uses medians. Ideally the amount of time spent by all personnel (as specified in the following tables) should match the amount of time spent on all tax activities (as specified in the previous tables). Whilst these figures are very close, they do not match exactly because two different questions were used to produce these two sets of data. Check questions and telephone call backs were successfully employed to avoid any major discrepancy. Using the data from this question (Q13b), businesses spend an average of 76.7 hours per year on tax activities (across all personnel categories). This compares to 75.6 hours reported earlier in response to Q13a (which asked the respondent to record time by tax activity) 16 . Q13b has been used for the bulk of the analysis in this report – including the calculation of compliance costs – for two reasons. First, it enables us to place values on the time of different personnel categories (this is explained in detail in the section entitled ‘Value of Time’). And second, Q13b is possibly less prone to double-counting. The data in the tables below indicate that owners/partners/directors/trustees spend the most time on tax activities (on average 56.3 hours per year) ahead of paid employees (18.4 hours) and unpaid friends or relatives (3.4 hours). This pattern is evident across all tax types with the exception of FBT. (However, as shown in Tables 5.8 and 5.9, this pattern does not hold across all business size groupings.) Again, the median measures are notably lower than the means. The median measures for the time that paid employees, and unpaid friends or relatives, spend on tax activities is zero. This indicates that for the majority of businesses, no time is spent on tax activities by these types of personnel (either because these businesses do not have these types of personnel or if they do they do not spend time on tax activities). 16 Much larger discrepancies occurred between the similar questions in a major Australian survey. For example, median annual hours spent on all tax activities for ‘medium’ businesses (turnover between $100,000 and $10 million) was 132 hours, whereas when measured in response to list of different tax types median time was only 48 hours (Evans et al., 1996, pp.125, 129).

On average, these employers spend 0.5 hours per year dealing with PAYE issues related to child support. This equates to 1.2% of the time they spend on PAYE in total. 20% of employers employ staff making student loan payments. On average, these employers spend 0.5 hours per year dealing with PAYE issues related to student loans. This equates to 1.3% of the time they spend on PAYE in total. Due to small sample sizes, care should be taken in interpreting the results by business size. However, the data shows that more larger businesses employ staff paying child support and student loans. Among businesses that employ these types of staff, the amount of time spent on child support and student loan issues does not appear to differ according to business size (defined in terms of the total number of employees a business has).

FINAL REPORT PAGE 49 colmar brunton A similar analysis to that presented in the previous table is shown below, but with an assessment made by PAYE filing method. The results suggest that those who file electronically are more likely to employ staff that pay child support and student loans. However, this is likely to be a function of business size (as supported by the sample profile tables earlier in the report). There is no significant difference in the amount of time spent on child support issues or student loan issues between those who file electronically and those who file manually.

FINAL REPORT PAGE 52 colmar brunton Internal time spent on tax-related activities required for entertainment expenses Respondents were asked whether their business spent time during the last 12 months dealing with the 50% deductibility and GST adjustment required for some entertainment expenses and, if so, how much time was spent. Seventeen percent of all SMEs have dealt with these types of adjustments in the last 12 months. This figure rises markedly with business size with around half of medium-sized businesses having spent time on these types of adjustments. The mean number of hours spent per year on these adjustments is low across all business size groupings with businesses that make these types of adjustments spending around two hours per year.

FINAL REPORT PAGE 53 colmar brunton Value of time analysis The task of converting time into a monetary value relies on the robust estimation of the value of time, that is, the time spent by: • owners/partners/directors/trustees • paid employees • unpaid friends or relatives' time. A number of options were considered as follows: • Basing the value of time on the survey responses, ie using ‘reported values’ (Question 7 in the ‘short’ questionnaire and Question 14 in the ‘long’ questionnaire). • Using official statistics. - New Zealand’s Department of Statistics publishes quarterly average hourly rate figures from the NZ Income Survey. It is possible to obtain these rates by both main job occupation or by business nature or sector. - New Zealand’s Department of Statistics undertakes the Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) which is designed to measure quarterly estimates of change and levels of average hourly and weekly (pre-tax) earnings, average weekly paid hours, and the number of filled jobs. - MED produce a table under ‘SMEs in New Zealand: Structure and Dynamics’ which allows a rough estimate (based on 1,920 hours worked per year – 48 weeks /yr , 40 hr /wk). Statistics in this section are drawn from the Annual Enterprise Survey conducted by Statistics New Zealand. • Imputing a value. The wage rates for self-employed business taxpayers can be imputed either by: - asking business taxpayers the minimum wage that would induce them to supply an extra hour of their labour time (the ‘reservation’ wage rate); or - the wage rates of people who have comparable human capital to those business taxpayers, for example using external recruitment sources – Hayes Salary Survey 2004 (this is somewhat arbitrary but practical). Following an in-depth investigation of each of these options, Inland Revenue made a number of recommendations. These recommendations, and the supporting evidence which led to these recommendations, are detailed in a paper prepared by Inland Revenue ‘Measuring the Compliance Costs of Small and Medium Businesses: Value of time – Estimating an appropriate value’. In summary, the recommendations are as follows. The recommendation was made that we can assume that there is no difference in time values between respondents of the ‘short’ income tax only questionnaire and those who completed the ‘long’ multiple tax type questionnaire – that they are ‘equivalent’ small and medium businesses. In drawing this assumption, we escape some of the problems encountered in previous research by not having to differentiate between individuals, sole traders and conventional business structures. We can focus on differences in business size and the role of the person whether it is as an owner/manager or paid employee or unpaid friend/relative. No real gains can be made by introducing the added complexity of value of time across sector type. FINAL REPORT PAGE 54 colmar brunton The ATAX scoping report supported the use of trimmed means for respondent data (which are on average 9% higher than the trimmed medians in our case) over medians. In comparing values we used the trimmed means. Owners/partners/directors/trustees For paid employees, hourly wage rates provide a convenient estimate of opportunity cost. With business owners/directors, selecting a value to apply is less objective and has more difficulties to valuing time spent on personal tax affairs (because owners may do the tax compliance work in what would otherwise be leisure time).

Again, given that the variation across business size is not too large, one figure has been used to value time for owners/partners/directors/trustees. A decision to use respondent data as the best estimate was made as it compares favourably with comparisons to data from the Hayes salary survey, and other research. The value of time figure for owners/partners/directors/trustees was $43.99. Paid employees In line with other research, a recommendation was made to value the time of paid employees based on external data. The close alignment between respondent data and Statistics New Zealand data supports this decision (see table below). Table 5.18: Value of time data relating to paid employees Respondent Data NZ Stats (QES Sep 04) NZ Stats (NZIS Jun 04) Nil employees $25.52 - - Micro (1-5) $ 23.01 $20.37 - Small (6-19) $21.87 $19.61 - Medium (20+) $25.75 $20.35 - Total $23.39 $20.31 \* $18.25 \*\* \*Average total hourly earnings (private sector) from Quarterly Employment Survey Sept 04’ \*\* Average hourly rate from the New Zealand Income Survey June 2004 quarter FINAL REPORT PAGE 55 colmar brunton Given the small variation across business size, the decision to use one figure for all business size groupings was made. The value of time figure used for paid employees was $20.31. Unpaid friends or relatives Most interesting, and probably hardest to estimate, is the value of unpaid friends or relatives. This is because they have no real market wage rate. Also, about one-third of survey respondents indicated that an approximate value for this time was $0. The difficulty with this is that it is not clear whether the helper’s time really has no value or the result of the respondent misunderstanding the point of the question.

Again, given the variation across business size is relatively small, the decision was made to use one figure to value time for unpaid friends or relatives. A decision was made to use respondent data as the best estimate. While slightly higher than comparisons to data from the Hayes salary survey and other research, IRD did not want to underestimate compliance costs. The value of time figure for unpaid friends or relatives is $25.70. Value of time analysis summary The following dollar amounts were used to convert time into compliance costs: • $43.99 (owners/partners/directors/trustees) • $20.31 (paid employees) • $25.70 (unpaid friends or relatives). FINAL REPORT PAGE 56 colmar brunton Income tax This section reports on the internal tax compliance costs associated with income tax. Table 5.20 provides a summary of the internal compliance costs of income tax. The first column of figures summarises the internal time that various categories of personnel spent on income tax. The second column of figures gives the estimated compliance costs of income tax (time multiplied by $). And the last column expresses the compliance costs associated with a particular category of personnel as a percentage of the compliance cost associated with all personnel. On average, businesses spend 29.4 hours per year on tax activities associated with income tax. This equates to $1224. The vast majority of this cost is the result of time spent by owners/partners/directors /trustees.

This is largely the result of the time spent on tax activities by paid employees. Note there is very little difference in the income tax related costs between SMEs employing nil employees and micro SMEs. Costs incurred by owners are reasonably constant across business size with the exception of medium SMEs.

Table 5.24 provides a breakdown by business size. Compliance costs between those who do and do not use a tax advisor are the same overall. However, those who use a tax advisor appear more reliant on, and those who don’t use a tax advisor appear less reliant on, paid employees. In interpreting these results, the reader should bear in mind that those who do not use tax advisors are more likely to be smaller businesses; 80% of those who do not use a tax advisor for income tax have no employees compared to only 51% of those who use a tax advisor for income tax.

Under half (45%) find provisional tax requirements less than moderately stressful (rating of 1 to 3), around one in five (18%) find them moderately stressful, and just over one-third (36%) find them more than moderately stressful (rating of 5 to 7). Businesses with no employees find meeting provisional tax requirements notably less stressful. This may be because, unlike employers, they do not face the dilemma of whether to pay staff or IRD first when experiencing cashflow difficulties 17 . 17 Previous research conducted for Inland Revenue (Colmar Brunton, On-time filing and paying compliance, June 2004) indicates that 63% of employers would pay their staff, and 8% would pay their suppliers, before IRD if they faced cashflow difficulties. Just 26% would give priority to IRD. In contrast, IRD is the payment priority for 57% of businesses without employees; 34% would pay suppliers before IRD.

Source: Long questionnaire Q4, Q22 and Q25; Short questionnaire Q13 and Q15 FINAL REPORT PAGE 61 colmar brunton Table 5.28 analyses the mean reported stress levels associated with provisional tax requirements by business size and GST accounting system. The latter was chosen as a variable worth investigating as it was felt to be potentially indicative of the degree to which a business is organised in collating information for tax purposes (including, eventually, income tax). Perhaps in contrast to initial expectations, the reported stress levels of those with manual systems are lower than those with computerised accounting software (see figures in last column). However, as the data in the table indicates, this pattern only holds for businesses with no employees. Further analysis of the database also shows that businesses with no employees and who use manual accounting systems have markedly lower levels of turnover than businesses with no employees and who use computerised systems. Thus, there is no conclusive evidence that the type of GST accounting system contributes to reported levels of stress associated with provisional tax requirements.

GST-registrants spend on average 44.2 hours per year on tax activities associated with GST. The value of this time equates to $1,852. For all SMEs, most of this can be attributed to time spent by owners/partners/directors/trustees. However, a different pattern emerges for larger businesses (see Table 5.31), where paid employees provide increasing proportions of the labour as business size grows.

They were asked to assume that the costs of buying and updating the software remain as they are now. The distribution of response to this question is provided in Table 5.40. With the vast majority (84%) indicating that they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ still use computerised accounting software if New Zealand was tax-free, the software appears to be an important management information tool for businesses and clearly serves purposes beyond those related to tax. This is particularly the case for larger businesses (small and medium-sized businesses).

Source: Long questionnaire Q24 and Q28 FINAL REPORT PAGE 72 colmar brunton PAYE This section reports on the internal tax compliance costs associated with PAYE. The following table summarises the PAYE compliance costs for all businesses. On average, businesses spend 27.5 hours per year on PAYE compliance. In dollar terms, this equates to $937. The majority of these costs are the result of time spent by owners/partners/directors/trustees.

In the remainder of this section on PAYE, a number of the tables present an analysis by business size (defined in terms of the number of employees). The reader will note that there is a category for those with ‘nil employees’. Respondents were asked how many employees they had at the end of ‘last month’ 18 . Thus, respondents in the ‘nil employees’ category can be regarded as not currently employing staff, but having done so in the last 12 months (as they indicated at Question 1 that they had paid/filed PAYE in the last 12 months). 18 Due to some businesses experiencing marked variability in employee numbers over a year, respondents were asked to estimate the number of employees they had at a particular point in time. FINAL REPORT PAGE 73 colmar brunton The following two tables show that the time businesses spend on PAYE (and the corresponding tax compliance costs) increase as business size increases. Not unexpectedly, in larger businesses, proportionately more time is spent on PAYE compliance by paid employees than owners/partners, compared to smaller businesses, (67% for medium SMEs compared to 25% for Micro).

Source: Long questionnaire Q13b, Q14 and Q20 Method used to process staff wages Employers were asked how their business processes staff wages. The results are presented in Table 5.51. More than half (61%) use a manual system for processing staff wages. This is considerably more common among micro businesses (73%), less common among small businesses (36%) and virtually non existent among medium businesses (3%). In contrast, the larger the business, the greater the use of computerised payroll or accounting software (eg 88% of medium businesses). One quarter (27%) of all SMEs overall use computerised payroll or accounting software with a further 11% using some other FINAL REPORT PAGE 75 colmar brunton computing system to process staff wages.

The respondents that are the subject of the analysis in this section indicated that they had filed at least one return requiring payment within the last 12 months. Respondents who had only filed nil returns have been excluded from the analysis. On average, employers who pay FBT spend 12.8 hours per year within the business on FBT compliance.

Source: Long questionnaire Q13b and Q14 \*The percentages in this column do not add to 100% because the mean compliance costs each have slightly different bases due to the process of trimming outliers. Table 5.60 shows that there is very little difference in the mean compliance costs incurred by micro, small, and medium-sized businesses. However, business size plays a part in terms of who within the business spends time on FBT. Paid employees in larger SMEs spend proportionately more time on FBT than paid employees in smaller businesses. Note that unpaid friends or relatives do not feature in assisting in FBT compliance.

External tax advisor costs This chapter reports on external tax compliance costs, ie payments made for tax services from advisors such as external tax accountants, tax advisors or lawyers. Use of, and payment for, external tax advisor services – business survey data Table 6.1 gives the proportion of businesses that paid for any tax advisors in the last 12 months from an advisor outside the business with a breakdown of tax types to which the payments relate. The reader should note that the percentages are calculated using a base of SMEs that file the particular tax type in question. The table also gives the mean tax-related payments made for external tax advice. The information in this section is provided by SME respondents. Eighty percent of businesses pay for external tax services. Businesses with no employees are less likely to pay for external tax services relating to income tax and more likely for FBT. Medium GST-registered businesses are less likely to pay for external tax services regarding GST compared to other GST- registered businesses. Likewise, medium-sized-employers are less likely to pay for external services regarding PAYE than smaller employers. The mean annual tax related payment is $1465. This calculation (along with the other mean calculations in this table) is based only on businesses that pay for external tax services . Those who do not pay for these services have been excluded from the calculations. Mean payment increases with business size with the exception of medium-sized businesses.

Business size has been sourced from the business questionnaire – Long questionnaire Q4. External compliance costs by tax type Advisor responses tend to be somewhat higher than business survey results. One reason for discrepancies is the mismatch between tax advisor and business views over the extent to which work on annual accounts is tax related (see Table 6.12 later). Table 6.4 and Table 6.5 present external compliance costs by tax type and business size. Imputed data has been used to produce these results (see section on ‘Research Methodology’ for details of the data imputation process). The amounts under each tax type relate to the average payment made for external advice in regard to that tax type among businesses that file that tax type whether or not they pay for external advice . Note, those who do not pay for external tax services relating to that tax type have been allocated a zero value and included in the calculation. The final column is based on all businesses and gives the average payment made for tax services relating to any tax type according to business size. Again, businesses that do not pay for external tax services have been allocated a zero value in the calculation. On average, businesses pay $1022 for external tax services. The mean payment made for any external tax services increases with business size (see last column). This trend is the result of increasing payments for external services in relation to income tax and GST.

Results are presented in Table 6.8. Reaction to this proposition is evenly divided: 44% indicate that they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ still pay their accountant to do their annual accounts if New Zealand was tax-free and 45% indicate that they ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ not do so. Nine percent are unsure. Opinion varies by size of business. Larger businesses (small and medium) appear more definite that they would still use an external accountant.

Data is presented in terms of the number of respondents (not percentages). For example, of the 42 tax advisors who said that their client would ‘definitely’ retain the tax advisor’s services, 15 of their clients also held this view (to this degree of certainty). The data indicates that the views of tax advisors and their clients do not necessarily match. There is a mismatch in views for around a third of tax advisors who believe their clients would retain their services (‘definitely’ or ‘probably’), that is, around a third of these tax advisors’ clients say they would not retain the tax advisor’s services (‘probably’ or ‘definitely’). Interestingly, the mismatch is somewhat higher for tax advisors who believe their clients would not retain their services (well over 40% of these tax advisors’ clients say they ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ would retain the tax advisor’s services).

Payroll services This chapter examines payroll services. Table 7.1 shows the proportion of businesses that use external payroll services and the mean payment made for these services. Seven percent of all businesses that file PAYE have used external payroll services in the last 12 months. Usage is markedly higher among small businesses and to a lesser extent medium-sized businesses compared to micro-sized businesses. On average, businesses spend $1550 on payroll services annually. No clear pattern by business size is evident due to small sample sizes.

Thus, respondents in the ‘nil employees’ category can be regarded as not currently employing staff, but having done so in the last 12 months (as they indicated at Question 1 that they had paid/filed PAYE in the last 12 months). ^The numbers in brackets use unweighted data (ie the actual number of respondents) whereas the % is a weighted value. 21 Due to some businesses experiencing marked variability in employee numbers over a year, respondents were asked to estimate the number of employees they had at a particular point in time. FINAL REPORT PAGE 93 colmar brunton Respondents who use external payroll services were asked to imagine that if New Zealand was tax-free whether they would still use these services. They were asked to assume that the costs would remain the same. Just over half (56%) indicate that they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ still use external payroll services if New Zealand was tax-free. Analysis by business size is limited due to small sample sizes.

Audit This chapter examines SMEs’ experience of tax audits carried out by Inland Revenue in the last 12 months. Costs associated with being audited are reported separately and are not included in the combined compliance cost calculation. There was a concern that a few very large audit-related costs would create extreme values for particular groups of businesses or business types. Also it is not possible to split audit compliance costs across tax types. Inland Revenue administers a risk-based audit programme whereas the results of this survey relate to a random sample. The audit programme is comprised of different types of audit, ranging from single revenue ones to multi-revenue audits, from checks to in-depth investigations. This, plus such factors as the circumstances of the business being audited, determines the time and cost involved in being audited. Information reported in Table 8.1 is the businesses’ self reported estimates of the time and external costs involved in their audits. 3% of the sampled SMEs reported being audited by Inland Revenue in the last 12 months. The incidence of being audited is higher the larger the business (up to 14% for medium-sized businesses). On average, a SME which is audited spends 38.8 hours within the business as a result of the audit. Additionally, a SME who is audited incurs on average $1801 in external costs (for example fees to an external accountant, but excluding any change in tax liability or penalties). Analysis of this data by business size is limited due to small sample sizes. However, there does appear to be a positive correlation between size of business and costs incurred as a result of the audit (both in terms of the number of hours a business spends on audit activities and external costs). However, there is no evidence of any significant variation in costs between small and medium businesses.

Combined costs This chapter presents a summary of the internal time spent on tax compliance as well as combined compliance costs, that is, costs that combine both internal and external costs. Summary of internal time Tables 9.1 and 9.2 summarise the internal time spent on tax activities on an annual basis (using mean values). Note, in order to calculate the figures in the last column of these tables – the mean amount of time spent by a business (covering all tax types) – the calculations of hours relating to each individual tax type have used a base of all SMEs rather than those that pay/file a particular tax type. In practice, this means that those who do not file/pay a particular tax type have been allocated a value of zero for that tax type. This is a different approach to that used in the chapter on ‘internal time and costs’. The calculations in that chapter used a base of businesses that pay/file a particular tax type. The average business spends 76.7 hours per year on tax activities. Business size is a clear determinant of time spent on tax activities with the average number of hours being as low as 51.3 hours for businesses without employees and as high as 204.5 hours for SMEs with at least 20 employees. A similar pattern is evident in relation to turnover. In terms of particular tax types, the average SME spends 28.5 hours on income tax, 33.4 hours on GST, 11.1 hours on PAYE, and 1 hour on FBT. For SMEs with no employees, income tax takes as much time as GST.

Age of business does not have a marked effect on time spent on tax activities with the possible exception of new businesses (those who have been in business less than 12 months). By the time a SME has been operating for 6 or more years, time on tax appears to settle to be slightly less than the early years of a SME.

Note, in order to calculate a combined mean compliance cost for all businesses, the compliance costs relating to each individual tax type have been calculated using a base of all businesses rather than those that pay/file a particular tax type. In practice, this means that those who do not file/pay a particular tax type have been allocated a value of zero. Likewise, the external compliance cost figures are based on all businesses rather than just those who pay for external advice/services. This means that those who do not use an external tax advisor have been allocated a value of zero. This is a different approach to that used in the sections relating to each tax type in the chapter on internal and external compliance costs. Those compliance costs have been calculated using a base of businesses that pay/file a particular tax type. As with the previous tables in this report, the base size is shown in the brackets in the tables. Estimated sampling errors are shown below the base sizes. The average business faces a combined tax compliance cost (incorporating both internal and external costs 22 ) of $4,024. GST-related costs and Income-tax related costs are by far the largest contributors to this. Again, the familiar pattern of increasing costs with business size is evident – from $2,932 for businesses with no employees to $7,649 for businesses with 20 or more employees. A similar pattern is evident in relation to turnover. However, as illustrated in Figure 14, combined compliance costs clearly diminish as a percentage of turnover.

FINAL REPORT PAGE 101 colmar brunton 10. Psychological compliance costs This chapter examines the psychological compliance costs that businesses experience in meeting tax requirements overall. Specifically, they were asked to rate how stressful they found meeting IRD requirements overall during the last 12 months (ignoring finding the money). This chapter also draws together the reported stress levels associated with meeting requirements for each of the individual tax types (as reported in separate sections earlier in this report). Note, however, that the questions relating to individual tax type asked respondents to include any stress involved in finding the money. Therefore, the data pertaining to individual tax types are not purely psychological compliance costs. The psychological costs associated with meeting tax requirements overall (ignoring finding the money) vary widely. Around half (51%) find meeting IRD requirements overall less than moderately stressful (rating of 1 to 3), one quarter (24%) find them moderately stressful, and just under a quarter (23%) find them more than moderately stressful (rating of 5 to 7). Reported levels of stress in dealing with GST and provisional tax are significantly higher than those relating to PAYE and FBT.

The results to this question are in Table 10.3. Owners/partners and managers reported higher stress levels than external tax advisors or clerks/IT staff. Unpaid friends or family members also reported high levels of stress. However, because of the small sample size this is only significantly higher than clerks/IT staff.

External costs based on businesses who use an advisor Table 11.6 presents external compliance costs by tax type and business size. The amounts under each tax type relate to the average payment made for external advice in regard to that tax type among businesses that file that tax type and who pay for external advice. Note, those who do not pay for external tax services relating to that tax type have been excluded from the bases for these calculations. The final column is based on all businesses and gives the average payment made for tax services relating to any tax type according to business size.

Analysis by sector This section provides analyses by sector. SMEs in the Distribution sector tend to spend the most time on tax activities with those in the Business and Finance sector spending the least time. However, this may well be a function of business size with those in the Distribution sector having more employees than those in the Business and Finance sector (see sample profile tables earlier in this report).

Consistent with the pattern identified above (in relation to the data on specific tax activities), the data below shows that businesses in the Distribution sector spend the most time meeting their tax obligations whereas those in the Business and Finance sector spend the least time. As noted earlier, this appears to be a function of business size (defined in terms of the number of employees).

Source: Long questionnaire Q21 and Q25; Short questionnaire Q12 and Q15 Table 11.11 looks at mean internal compliance costs of GST by turnover and sector. Compliance costs of GST increase as turnover increases. Compliance costs of GST vary by industry sector with businesses in the Distribution sector experiencing the highest costs. However, this pattern does not always hold within business size groupings – the higher costs of the Distribution sector is largely due to those Distribution businesses with between $100,000 and $1,299,999 Table 11.11: Mean internal compliance costs of GST by business size (turnover) and sector Primary produce Industrial Distribution Business & Finance Service All Business size (turnover) Mean (trimmed) annual compliance costs Up to $39,999 $1,734 (38) $1,909 (21) $1,475 (18) $1,152 (39) $1,544 (42) $1,528 (158) $40,000 to $99,999 $1,339 (47) $1,430 (47) $1,544 (25) $1,472 (65) $1,632 (62) $1,478 (247) $100,000 to $1,299,999 $2,003 (218) $2,001 (142) $2,753 (172) $1,573 (144) $2,145 (190) $2,083 (869) $1.3 million + $2,853 (25) $2,056 (82) $2,351 (92) $1,955 (23) $2,246 (48) $2,389 (270) All $1,850 (328) $1,922 (292) $2,288 (308) $1,467 (272) $1,897 (342) $1,852 (1546) Base: All respondents who file GST (Q1) excluding missing information and outliers Source: Long questionnaire Q13b, Q14, Q20 and Q21 FINAL REPORT PAGE 122 colmar brunton There are a few variations in the accounting system used for GST by sector (see Table 11.12). SMEs in the Distribution sector are more likely than average to use computerised accounting software. SMEs in Primary produce are more likely than other businesses to rely on an external accountant for GST. And those in the Business & Finance sector are more likely than average to use ‘other computing systems’.

FINAL REPORT PAGE 127 colmar brunton Questionnaire FINAL REPORT PAGE 128 colmar brunton Dear Sir/Madam, This survey will help reduce business tax compliance costs The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) is committed to reducing your tax compliance costs. By tax compliance costs, we mean the time, money and effort your business spends in meeting IRD’s tax requirements. To help IRD reduce these costs, Colmar Brunton has been asked to conduct this very important survey. This will help IRD report to Government on the impact that future initiatives and law changes have on compliance costs. The research will help IRD to do the right things to reduce compliance costs for businesses. Who should complete the survey? The questionnaire should be completed on behalf of the business (or person with business income) to which the envelope is addressed. If the envelope is not addressed to a named person, the person within your business who mostly deals with tax matters should complete the survey. Please ignore all related business entities, such as subsidiaries or holding companies. If your business has more than one site, please ensure your answers include estimates for all sites (in total – you don’t need to provide separate estimates per site). You can answer all the questions without needing to consult tax advisors outside the business. As a small token of appreciation for your help with the survey, we enclose a highlighter pen with Post-it flags. This may also be useful to mark questions if a second person is needed to answer a few of them. Your input is confidential IRD will not know who responded to the survey and only anonymous information will be passed back to IRD. Colmar Brunton is an independent research organisation. We will give you the results We will send you a summary of the research results on completion of the project. Any questions? If you do have any questions about this survey, you can either call Colmar Brunton on freephone 0508 265 627 (and ask to speak to someone on the tax research team), or IRD on 0800 833 445 (this is a special line set up to answer questions about this survey). What to do when you’re finished There is a reply paid envelope enclosed with this questionnaire. Once you have completed your questionnaire, please put it in the envelope and post it back to Colmar Brunton by Friday, 19 November 2004. Thank you very much in anticipation of your input. Yours faithfully The tax research team Colmar Brunton Business Tax Compliance Costs Survey FINAL REPORT PAGE 129 colmar brunton • Many questions ask you to provide information about “the last 12 months”.

Tax compliance cost research
============================

The government has welcomed the findings of research showing tax compliance costs have decreased for small and medium-sized businesses over the last 13 years. The research compares the compliance costs reported in a recent Inland Revenue survey of businesses with those of the 1992 Sandford and Hasseldine survey of business compliance costs.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Red tape radically reduced

Associate Revenue Minister, David Cunliffe, has welcomed research showing a large drop in tax compliance costs.

Tax compliance costs have fallen by a massive 40 percent for small firms since 1992, dropping from $5000 to an average of just $3000 per year in 2004.

Medium-sized firms have saved over 50 percent on their tax compliance, spending an average of $9000 per year in 1992, falling to $4000 in 2004.

"There is a lot of rhetoric and myth when it comes to compliance costs and frankly it's baloney. This research shows clearly that the cost of complying with tax obligations has dropped radically," said Mr Cunliffe.

About 2300 businesses responded to an Inland Revenue survey conducted late last year on the costs of tax compliance. The survey sets a benchmark so that the effects of further moves to cut compliance costs can be measured. The reductions were found when survey findings were compared with earlier, similar work.

"The government sees this as an area for continuous improvement, we are working hard to further reduce costs. We have a package of measures to reduce compliance costs, more is to come," said David Cunliffe.

Further changes coming include:

*   Aligning provisional tax payments with GST due dates. This will reduce the number of payment dates that businesses have to meet.
*   Small businesses will be able to pay provisional tax in six smaller payments a year, rather than the current three large payments.
*   Businesses will be able to base their provisional tax payments on a percentage of their GST turnover. Firms with seasonal income will benefit because their tax payments will be more aligned with their income flow.
*   The government will subsidise the use of payroll agencies for small businesses. This will help employers deduct tax, child support and student loan payments from staff wages.
*   Changes to fringe benefit tax means that work tools like cell phones and laptops will be exempt from tax if they cost less than $5000 and are used primarily for business.

"Making tax easier for small and medium-sized businesses is a high priority on the government’s tax policy agenda" said Mr Cunliffe.

Imputation credit loophole to be closed
=======================================

The government will introduce legislation to prevent abuse of the New Zealand tax rules on dividends and imputation credits by Australasian groups of companies. Changes to be added to the taxation bill currently before Parliament will amend the Income Tax Act to stop companies allocating imputation credits to dividend payments to New Zealand investors if the payments result in tax deductions in Australia. Once enacted, the changes will apply to shares issued from today. The new rules will apply to dividends paid after 1 April 2006 from shares already issued within the same group of companies. Other existing non-group company issues (the public issues) will be allowed to run through to their maturity. For more information see the government's [media statement](/news/2005/2005-07-21-imputation-credit-loophole-be-closed#statement)

Hon Dr Michael Cullen  
Minister of Revenue

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Imputation credit loophole to be closed

The government is closing a loophole to prevent Australasian groups of companies abusing the New Zealand tax rules on dividends and imputation credits, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

Legislation to be tabled in Parliament this week will amend income tax law to prevent companies from allocating imputation credits to dividends paid to New Zealand investors if the payment of the dividends results in tax deductions in Australia.

"The trans-Tasman imputation rules, which came into effect two years ago, were the result of a joint Australia-New Zealand reform to reduce the double taxation of certain trans-Tasman investments," Dr Cullen said.

"They make New Zealand imputation credits available to Australian companies for their New Zealand investors and, correspondingly, Australian franking credits available to New Zealand companies for their Australian investors.

"Some companies appear to be taking advantage of an unforeseen loophole in the rules, however. They are setting up schemes whereby imputation credits are directed away from foreign shareholders, who generally cannot use the imputation credits, and streamed towards a special group of New Zealand investors, who can. At the same time, the payment is deductible as interest in Australia.

"That is a form of imputation credit streaming and is unacceptable. The government is therefore acting to prevent this activity, which ultimately results in a loss to the New Zealand tax base.

"Once enacted, the changes will apply to shares issued from today. The new rules will apply to dividends paid after 1 April 2006 from shares already issued within the same group of companies. Other existing non-group company issues (the public issues) will be allowed to run through to their maturity," Dr Cullen said.

The changes will be introduced by means of a Supplementary Order Paper to the taxation bill currently before Parliament.

### Imputation credit loophole to be closed – technical annex

BACKGROUND

Two years ago New Zealand and Australia each enacted tax legislation called "trans-Tasman imputation" (TTI). The changes allow New Zealand imputation credits to flow through an Australian group of companies and then back to New Zealand shareholders and vice versa.

A simplified example of how it was envisaged that TTI would be used is shown as Figure 1. The Australian listed public company franks its ordinary dividends with Australian credits, but as well it attaches New Zealand imputation credits which benefit its New Zealand shareholders.

ISSUES OF REDEEMABLE PREFERENCE SHARES BY AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES

A few Australasian groups of companies have issued redeemable preference shares (RPS) into the New Zealand retail market by way of prospectus. These issues offer a relatively low cash coupon, enhanced by the addition of imputation credits. Thus a New Zealand investor who pays tax at 33% gets, say, a 5% cash coupon, with 2.5% attached imputation credits giving a tax-paid return of 5% (7.5% gross for non-corporate taxpayers).

There seems to be no direct connection between the proceeds of the issue of the RPSs and investment in the New Zealand tax base.

The New Zealand aspects of this are illustrated in Figure 2.

IMPUTATION CREDIT STREAMING

The imputation credits of an Australasian group of companies are valuable only to New Zealand shareholders who can benefit from them. In these cases the credits should, in theory, be distributed to all the shareholders of the parent company. However, typically, an Australian-based listed group of companies would have fewer than 10%, and probably fewer than 5%, of its ordinary shareholders resident in New Zealand. Thus the New Zealand shareholders will not be influential in determining the Australasian group's dividend and imputation credit policies.

The Australasian group can derive much more benefit from the credits, however, by using them to enhance the return on an RPS-type share issued by an Australian group company into the New Zealand market. This is because the Australian group company can then pay lower cash coupons and use the imputation credits to enhance the New Zealand RPS investors' return.

In essence, the Australian group's imputation credits are streamed back to the New Zealand RPS shareholders, who can benefit from them, rather than being directed to the holders of the ordinary shares in the group, who generally will not be able to use them (because they are not New Zealand resident).

From a policy perspective this sort of streaming of credits is inappropriate. The credits belong to the holders of the ordinary shares in the Australian group, not to the holders of the RPS. In these examples there is no real connection between the use of the RPS issue proceeds and the imputation credits that are attached to the dividends.

The "dividend" on the RPS shares is deductible to the Australian issuer company, as Australian tax law regards such instruments as debt instruments.

RESPONSE

Section ME 6 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will be amended so that issuers of shares will not be allowed to attach imputation credits to their dividends when the dividend results in an Australian tax deductible item.

The amendment will provide that a company cannot attach imputation credits to a dividend from a share that is a "debt interest" under the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Consequential amendments will be made to the benchmark dividend definition and the benchmark dividend rules.

This solution addresses the concern about the lack of connection between the income that results from the issue of the shares and the New Zealand imputation credits.

It also addresses any potential intra-group TTI issues.

APPLICATION DATES

Once enacted, the amendment will apply from announcement to all such shares issued on or after the date of announcement.

The proposed law change will apply to dividends from existing shares from 1 April 2006 except when the holder and the issuer are not part of the same group of companies. Where the holder and the issuer are not part of the same group of companies these issues will be allowed to run through to their maturity.

Child support bill introduced
=============================

A bill introduced today allows a partial write-off of late payment penalties as an incentive for liable parents who have defaulted on child support payments to begin making regular payments. It also gives Inland Revenue the powers to initiate an administrative review when it thinks the amount of child support payable by a liable parent does not accurately reflect the parent's ability to pay. For more information see the government's [media statement](/news/2005/2005-08-05-child-support-bill-introduced#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Child Support Bill to benefit Kiwi Kids

Associate Revenue Minister David Cunliffe today introduced the Child Support Amendment Bill into Parliament.

"This bill will improve the flow of money to the children who need it," said David Cunliffe.

"The bill is part of a balanced package of sticks and carrots that will ensure that liable parents better meet their obligations to their children," said David Cunliffe.

"Getting child support debt down will take a combination of legislative and administrative measures. The changes introduced in the bill offer an incentive for liable parents who have defaulted to get back into the system before it's too late.

"Penalties for late payment can grow quickly, creating a disincentive for some parents who fall far behind to front up to Inland Revenue and meet their obligations. In some cases debt and penalties rise to the point where defaulting parents feel repayment is impossible.

"Much of the increase in child support debt is the result of penalties compounding rather than core debt itself increasing dramatically. The latest figures put core debt of liable parents who default at about $416 million, with unpaid penalties mounting to another $558 million.

"The bill will enable Inland Revenue to work more flexibly with debtors and to remit some of their penalties if they enter into a binding payment arrangement and stick to it.

"Only penalty debt, which goes to the Crown, never the core debt that is owed to the custodial parent, can be remitted." David Cunliffe said.

The bill also gives Inland Revenue greater powers to review the total financial affairs of parents when it suspects they are paying less child support than they should – for example, if it suspects a liable parent is using business structures to mask income.

"Other changes will allow respondents to a child support administrative review the right to appeal to the family court if they are dissatisfied with the outcome, and allow Inland Revenue to accept documentation from other countries as proof of parentage.

"The changes proposed in the bill will work alongside administrative changes designed to tighten the collection system, such as increased border enforcement. The government has increased funding by $14 million for these activities.

"The changes recognize that any approach to reducing debt needs to be a balance between providing incentives for parents to get into the system and meet their obligations, and taking firm action against them if they don't take that opportunity.

"My approach is to do what is needed to get the child support to those families who need it, I am confident this bill will help achieve that," David Cunliffe said.

### Questions and Answers: Child Support Amendment Bill

#### **What does the bill do to encourage people to pay child support?**

It offers an incentive to liable parents who have stopped paying child support to start making regular payments again. If they front up and agree to keep up their payments – and stick to the agreement, some of the late payment penalties they owe will be written off. They will still have to pay all the child support they owe, however.

The idea is that the state gives up some of the penalties to get lapsed parents back into the system so they can begin to make regular child support payments in full and on time.

_**Example – when penalties are written off**_

As at 1 April 2006 Jane has child support debt totalling $1,191. This is made up of:

*   child support assessment $1,000
*   initial late payment (10%) penalties $100
*   incremental penalties (2% of total unpaid amount) $91.

Jane enters into an arrangement with Inland Revenue to pay regular child support plus $21.15 per week towards her total assessment and initial late payment penalties. Six months later Jane has kept to the arrangement and has paid Inland Revenue $550 towards her debt, which is half of the debt. Inland Revenue can write off $45.50 (half) of her incremental penalties. Her total debt will be reduced to $595.50. In a further six months Jane has paid an additional $550 towards her debt and receives another write-off of incremental penalties of $45.50, which clears her child support debt in full.

_**Example – if someone breaks a payment arrangement**_

As at 1 April 2006 Tony has child support debt totalling $1,191. This is made up of:

*   child support assessment $1,000
*   initial late payment penalties $100
*   incremental penalties $91.

Tony enters into an arrangement with Inland Revenue to make regular child support payments plus pay $21.15 per week towards his debt. Six months later Tony has kept to the arrangement and has paid Inland Revenue $550 towards his total assessment and initial late payment penalties, which is half of the debt. Inland Revenue can write off $45.50 (half) of his incremental penalties. His total debt is reduced to $595.50. Three months later Tony defaults on his arrangement and stops making payments. Even though he has complied with the arrangement for a further three months he receives no further write-off until he enters into a new agreement and complies with it for at least six months.

**Who can initiate a review of a liable parent’s financial affairs?**

The bill also allows Inland Revenue itself, not just custodial parents, to initiate reviews of liable parents’ financial affairs when it suspects they are deliberately paying less child support than they should. The change is intended to counter the practice of some parents to structure their financial affairs so as to minimise their child support payments.

_**Example –when Inland Revenue might initiate a review**_

Eric is the director of a profitable company and is paying the minimum amount of child support. Inland Revenue records show that Eric is paying himself an annual income of $25,000, although he also has the use of a house and car owned by the company.

If further Inland Revenue investigations establish that Eric’s liability does not accurately reflect his ability to provide financial support to his children because of his income, earning capacity, property and financial resources, Inland Revenue may initiate a review process by an independent person, a review officer, who is contracted to Inland Revenue. The review officer will consider whether there are special circumstances and whether a change would be fair to both parties and the children. The review officer may then amend Eric’s child support liability to reflect his actual financial resources.

#### How much child support debt is owed at present?

Total child support debt owed was $987 million as at 30 June 2005. Paying parent core debt was $416 million owing, with unpaid penalties amounting to another $558 million. Penalties compound and grow very quickly, so much of the increase in child support debt over recent years is the result of unpaid penalties rather than a dramatic increase in liable parents not paying.

#### How do penalties work?

The bill does not change the way that late payment penalties are imposed.

If the full child support amount is not paid on time, liable parents are charged a penalty of either $5 or 10% of the unpaid amount, whichever is the greater.

A further penalty of 2% (or $1, whichever is the greater) of the total overdue amount, including penalties that have already been incurred, will be added for each month that the amount remains unpaid.

_**Example – how penalties are charged**_

Chris did not pay his monthly assessment for May of $100. He received a $10 penalty (which was 10% of the amount due) on the 20th of June. He now owes $110. If he does not pay this amount in full by 20 July, he will be charged a penalty of 2% of the total overdue amount of $110, making his total amount owed for May $112. (He will probably also owe $100 for June plus 10% penalty $10.)  
If he continues not to pay, within three years the penalties on that late May payment will be greater than the amount of child support itself for the month.

More information on penalties is available from [www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport](http://www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport/)
.

#### Isn't the bill just letting defaulting payers off the hook?

No, the bill requires parents to pay all the child support that is owed to their families, or to the government if the custodian is on a sole parent benefit. Only some of the penalties that have built up on the unpaid amount can be written off. The criteria for write off are strict – defaulting parents must enter into an arrangement to pay off their debt and keep to that arrangement for six months. After that time, penalties can be written off in proportion to the amount paid by the parent. This acts as an incentive for parents to pay off as much as possible in the period – which means more money can be passed on to their families.

#### Isn't letting the non-payers off their penalties unfair to parents who have paid their child support regularly?

Parents who have paid their child support debts have ensured their financial support has already been passed on to their families. The families of parents who do not meet their child support responsibilities are in many cases missing out. The bill aims to bring that group of parents into the child support system so that more families receive the money they are entitled to on a continuing basis. Liable parents who pay in full on time are still better off because they do not incur any penalties.

Only some of the penalties owed can be written off.

These measures, together with improved collection measures (see below), will ensure that those who choose not to pay will not get away with avoiding their responsibilities.

#### Will the changes apply to liable parents who are already paying off their arrears?

Yes, if they keep up their regular payments and repayment of arrears for six months after the changes come into force they will qualify for some write-off of penalties as well.

#### Isn't it unfair to custodians if liable parents have some of their late payment penalties written off?

No, any penalties that are written off will be owed to the state. To qualify for a write-off of some of their late payment penalties, liable parents will have to pay what they owe to custodians for six months.

#### What else is being done to reduce child support debt?

Reducing debt will take two things: giving parents who do not pay incentives to re-enter the child support system, and taking firm action against those who don’t take up that opportunity.

The changes introduced in the bill are being complemented by changes that tighten up the collection system, such as increased border enforcement. For example, Inland Revenue is working with the New Zealand Customs Service and the Police to enforce arrest warrants for parents leaving the country to avoid paying child support, including those who come back to New Zealand for a visit.

Collections of child support resulting from enforcement actions taken through the courts are increasing. Inland Revenue has also received a number of reports of liable parents who are clearing debts or making instalment arrangements to avoid legal action.

#### What about non-paying parents who live overseas?

Inland Revenue works to collect child support from liable parents who live in Australia and who owe money to families in New Zealand, an arrangement managed under the Reciprocal Agreement between Australia and New Zealand. Australian authorities collect from parents living in Australia and pass the money to Inland Revenue for distribution to custodians. Inland Revenue is transferring increasing numbers of cases to Australia – as at 31st March 2005, cases worth $104.6 million had been transferred, and further improvements to the administration are planned.

Work is under way on developing other international agreements to enforce payment of child support by New Zealanders living abroad.

#### What other changes does the bill introduce?

The bill introduces several changes to improve the operation of the child support scheme and, in some cases, increase fairness.

It exempts victims of sex offences from paying child support, on the grounds that they should not be further victimised by having to pay child support for children conceived as a result of the crime.

It also introduces a temporary exemption for liable parents under the age of 16 who are still at school, since they are not usually in a position to earn enough money to meet even the minimum payment. The exemption is only for a limited period and is in the long-term interest of both parents and children.

#### What about young fathers who want to pay child support?

Liable parents under 16 will have to apply for an exemption, so they may continue to pay if they want to. Also, if they get part-time or holiday work they will have to pay at least the minimum amount.

Further information on the proposed changes is available in the commentary on the bill at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz)

David Cunliffe speech to NZICA
==============================

In a speech today to the NZ Institute of Chartered Accountants' tax conference, David Cunliffe, caretaker Associate Revenue Minister, described some of the challenges and early tax policy decisions facing the new government. A busy tax agenda would require the government to focus on priority issues, he said. The government would try to ensure the May 2005 taxation bill was passed by the end of March 2006 – if not, the date of effect of several measures in the bill would have to be reviewed.

SPEECH NOTES

### Speech to Institute of Chartered Accountants

_Rotorua Convention Centre, 1170 Fenton Street, Rotorua_

I am sure I do not need to remind you that we have just had a general election, and a new government is in the process of being formed as a result. My remarks today need to be seen in the context of the conventions of a caretaker government. That is, I will not be announcing any initiatives that have not already been canvassed, although I will be discussing progress on the tax policy programme that was in place prior to the election.

Tax was an important election issue, and if I could venture one comment on the election result it would be that it showed a broad level of comfort with the current balance of taxation and expenditure, in light of the outlook for the economy. The most recent economic data tends to support a conservative fiscal stance.

The Pre-Election Update painted a picture of real economic growth slowing to around 2¼ per cent over the coming year, after averaging in excess of 3½ per cent growth over the past five March years. The drivers of this anticipated slowdown are well known - lagged impact of increases in the exchange rate and interest rates, declining net migration, a fall in house price inflation, and expected declines in New Zealand's terms of trade from record highs.

At the same time, the PREFU highlighted some growing macroeconomic imbalances in the economy, and forecast that these would unwind in a fairly benign manner.

Recent current account data show that the imbalance is widening further, and other partial data to date show no signs that this will narrow in the very near term. We cannot rule out the possibility that the current account deficit will rise above 9 per cent of GDP in the next 12 months. The increases in oil prices due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have not helped, though prices have retreated from their peak of US$70 per barrel. Although the benign adjustment as painted in the Pre-Election Update is still a possible scenario, we must also consider other scenarios that involve more disruptive paths.

It is not possible to be definitive about the factors that could "tip" the economy over onto a less benign/more disruptive adjustment path. However, the risks of a rapid and disruptive adjustment have increased. This is evidenced by the economic imbalance demonstrated by the increasing current account deficit, and the prospect that oil prices and continuing strong domestic demand could push annual CPI inflation towards 4 per cent. These developments, particularly if they are sustained and become built into expectations, increase the risk of sustained below trend growth and rising unemployment.

From a fiscal perspective the PREFU story remains unchanged. There is nothing to date which suggests any on-going change in tax revenue or expenses.

The PREFU forecasts operating balances of around 3 per cent by 2009, which are used to pre-fund future fiscal costs associated with an ageing population and to invest in capital assets. The result is a nominal borrowing requirement of around $1 billion over the forecast horizon to 2009.

Gross debt is forecast to fall as a percentage of GDP to 19.1 per cent by 2009 and to remain relatively flat out to 2015.

This economic picture highlights the importance of the integrity and sustainability of the New Zealand tax base and the need to keep abreast of the challenges that face us. I will touch on both those challenges and the tax policy decisions awaiting the new government in the remainder of this speech.

Turning first to the important policy decisions awaiting the government, what is decided over the next few weeks will shape much of our policy and legislative work in the tax area over the next six months or so. Those immediate decisions will probably involve matters that were in train when Parliament rose for the general election, as well as commitments made in the lead-up to the election.

Historically, tax was fundamental to the development of our democratic institutions. Parliament rightly guards closely its hard won right to approve taxation. Taxation obviously funds the various spending policies that governments are elected to deliver, and tax is itself about the allocation of society's resources – who pays for what.

All this means that a well functioning and reliable tax system is a great asset for a democracy. A system that is regarded as unfair or inefficient undermines a democracy by thwarting a government's ability to deliver on the policy platforms chosen by the electorate.

In New Zealand we are fortunate in having an excellent tax system on which to base our democracy. This has been achieved over a number of years with the active support of many of you.

The tax system does face challenges, as one would expect in a dynamic economy and a changing demography. Both tax policy and tax administration resources are being stretched to deliver all the things that are wanted. This is not a major problem, but still a challenge. It means that the government will need to focus on its priorities to ensure that they are smoothly delivered. This may mean some other issues, perhaps issues of priority to tax practitioners, may have to take a temporary back seat. But with the normal cooperation I am sure that we can work things through to the reasonable satisfaction of all.

An important early step for any new government is the development of a tax policy work programme that gives effect to its revenue strategy. For the last few years the work programme has covered a period of 18 months or so. Once approved, the work programme is usually released publicly, as part of the generic tax policy process.

Tax policy officials report on a recommended work programme, and once approved – and amended by the government in accordance with its priorities, the work programme becomes a detailed tax policy agreement between the government, Inland Revenue and the Treasury. It is possible that we will have an agreed work programme by the end of the year, or we may have to wait until next year – it all depends on the priorities that are set over the next few weeks.

For those reasons there is not a lot of detailed tax policy that I can discuss with you today. What I can do, however, is broadly update you on what I see as emerging issues over the next three years and some of the early priority decisions the government will face.

About 43 per cent of our tax base comes from the income tax paid by individuals. GST makes up a further 19 per cent, and company income tax about 17 per cent. That is about 80 per cent of our tax base. In all three areas there are risks that need to be managed.

New Zealand collects relatively more revenue at the company tax level than many countries do. In 2002, New Zealand's ratio of company tax as a proportion of GDP was just over 4 per cent, the sixth highest in the OECD. By March of this year the percentage of company tax to GDP had risen even higher, to an estimated 5.1 per cent.

Another prominent feature of our company tax base is the extent to which large companies operating in New Zealand are foreign-owned, mostly by Australian companies. This leaves us vulnerable to some risks in relation to source taxation.

Under current tax rules there are incentives for non-resident companies not to pay tax on income generated in New Zealand. There are many ways they can do this, such as borrowing in New Zealand to finance overseas expenditure, and selling back to New Zealand branches the intellectual property that is developed here. The recent introduction of new thin capitalisation rules for foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand is an example of a policy response to what the government saw as rapid erosion of the tax base.

One cannot, of course, consider the company tax system without also considering imputation. The imputation system integrates company tax and personal taxation so that company tax is, in economic substance, a withholding tax, since company tax is a down payment on the ultimate shareholder tax levied on dividends. One of the strengths of imputation is that it encourages New Zealand companies with New Zealand shareholders to pay tax, since company tax paid is a benefit to shareholders.

Protecting the corporate tax base will undoubtedly remain a key aspect of the government's tax policy work programme. The revenue the government collects at the company level is about equivalent to what we spend on health care. If companies push too hard to reduce their tax costs, governments will react to protect that revenue base. This is something companies and tax practitioners do need to take into account.

A recent article in "Tax Notes International" stated that "in this post-Enron, post-Worldcom, post-Parmalat world, there is a new dimension of risk associated with overambitious efforts to lower taxes. Now the actions of the tax department can tarnish a company's public image."

In the United States, the article continues, "PricewaterhouseCoopers has asked corporate tax directors: "How will your CEO react to seeing your tax affairs splashed all over the front page of a national newspaper (or even the inside pages)?"

Tax management is not, therefore, just a matter of lowering tax costs. Society expects corporates to invest back into the society in which they do business by way of taxes.

I think we in New Zealand have developed good practices that enable us to work together to manage our tax system. The recent banking legislation was a good example of that.

As you are aware, a critical feature of the imputation system is that imputation credits have no value to non-resident shareholders. This is a critical design feature of the system. Since New Zealand tax on dividends flowing to non-residents is normally limited to 15 per cent under tax treaties, if we refunded to non-resident shareholders the value of imputation credits, our source-based taxation on non-resident owned companies would be limited to 15 per cent. This is why the government has been concerned about arrangements that might allow non-residents to stream or sell off imputation credits.

In the previous administration the government took or announced three measures to protect the imputation system. They relate to imputation credit shopping, securities lending and trans-Tasman redeemable preference shares.

Each was seen as necessary to ensure that we do not directly or indirectly allow imputation credits on tax that is economically or, in substance, attributable to non-residents to flow to residents who can use them. It is accepted that a more coherent policy framework for this issue is desirable and likely to be a priority on the tax policy work programme.

There are also some emerging pressures in the personal income tax system – namely, incentives to split income and to shelter it in companies and trusts, both of which appear to be on the increase. Inland Revenue has stated its concern about this activity. The government needs to consider whether this issue can be handled by administrative actions by Inland Revenue or whether changes in the law are necessary.

Our GST system is much lauded by the rest of the world for its comprehensiveness and simplicity. It deserves its reputation as a model for a pure GST / VAT system. It is, nevertheless, not without its problems.

I am aware of schemes whose central feature is that one person gets a GST refund, but there is no offsetting output tax.

First, there are schemes whereby input tax refunds are claimed by a purchaser registered on an invoice basis, whereas the offsetting output tax is owed by a vendor registered on a cash basis. The output tax liability is deferred to the never-never.

Second, there are schemes whereby the output tax liability is located in insolvent companies that appear and disappear like phoenixes. Hence they are internationally known as "phoenix schemes", I am told. These problems with GST and VAT systems are worldwide. We are following international developments closely and Inland Revenue is active in challenging them. Again, the issue is whether Inland Revenue's administrative response needs to be backed up with legislative change.

To turn briefly to the international scene, New Zealand tax policy cannot be developed in isolation from the rest of the world. Trade and capital flows are increasing, so what were once largely domestic tax issues are increasingly becoming international issues. The large accounting firms have international connections, as is now increasingly the case with law firms. Just as the private sector is ready to change in this way, so must tax policy makers and administrators.

This is why New Zealand has, over recent years, considerably increased its involvement in the OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs. While the OECD is limited to thirty members, its outreach programme involves most of the world. The Committee on Fiscal Affairs is, therefore, as close as we have to an international tax forum. New Zealand's influence in that body is something of considerable national value.

The OECD's tax committee is working on a number of areas of real importance to New Zealand. First, there is the continuing review of the OECD model treaty upon which New Zealand's network of 29 tax treaties with other countries is largely based,

The OECD is looking at significant issues relating to the ability of countries like New Zealand to protect their rights to tax income at source.

New Zealand is working closely on the OECD's proposals regarding the taxation of permanent establishments. Proposals to apply transfer pricing rules effectively to allocate asset ownership between a parent and its offshore branch would significantly change traditional practice in calculating branch profit taxation. For example, it would allow the branch to deduct notional interest and royalty payments with no offsetting non-resident withholding tax.

New Zealand sees this as creating considerable risk to source-based taxation, and in line with my earlier comments on the importance of this to our tax base, we are working actively with other OECD countries on this issue.

Another issue is thin capitalisation rules. To protect our tax base we have such rules, but their place in tax treaties is uncertain. New Zealand is working to see if greater clarity on the consistency of such rules can be obtained.

The committee is also looking at the tax treatment of funds known as collective investment vehicles. These vehicles do not fit easily into orthodox tax treaties because of their trust-like structure. Determining when the benefits of tax treaties should or should not apply is under critical considered by the OECD. Should it depend on where a vehicle or fund is resident or where its beneficiaries reside? The committee is also looking at whether the current OECD model gives source countries adequate taxing rights for services.

The OECD is also creating a facility to share knowledge about tax avoidance schemes between tax administrations. It is well known that international firms share such ideas, and it seems valuable for the revenue authorities to do likewise.

Finally, New Zealand continues to participate actively in the OECD's harmful tax practices project. In this area we are working especially closely with Australia, which is hosting a Global Forum on harmful tax practices in Melbourne in November which New Zealand will be attending.

Officials have been working very closely with Australia on harmful tax issues, negotiating jointly with them on eight tax information exchange agreements. We are also cooperating with Australia in the Pacific region – encouraging jurisdictions in the area to adopt the standards for international cooperation on tax matters that were advanced in the previous Berlin Global Forum.

The OECD is one example of New Zealand and Australia developing close cooperation on tax matters. This relationship is very important to New Zealand.

On the tax side we want to develop it as far as we can, in a manner that is mutually beneficial. Officials from both countries have discussed the possibility of a revision of the current double tax agreement. It was recognised that since the current Australia–New Zealand DTA was agreed to in 1995, Australia has altered its policy on non-resident withholding tax on interest dividends and royalties. New Zealand agreed to review its policy on non-resident withholding tax to see whether we believe a move along the same lines would be in our national interest.

This review is likely to be a priority, reflecting the seriousness with which New Zealand takes the trans-Tasman relationship.

When Parliament was dissolved in the lead-up to the election, two revenue-related bills were before the House: the May tax bill – the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Child Support Amendment Bill.

The tax bill had its first reading and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee, which called for submissions by 12 August. The Child Support Amendment Bill was introduced in July and was awaiting its first reading when Parliament rose. Both bills lapsed on dissolution

The Child Support Amendment Bill contained important measures to help deal with debt accumulated by liable parents. It is important that the legislation strikes a correct balance so that liable parents do meet their obligations. I envisage legislation along these lines proceeding in the new Parliament.

The tax bill included a number of measures announced in the 2005 Budget. Overall these were business-friendly measures that would reduce compliance costs, reduce tax and increase business efficiency. On that basis it could be expected that, at least in broad terms, the proposed measures will have reasonably wide support in Parliament.

It therefore seems likely that the tax bill will be reinstated. However, there could be some time before such a bill could be enacted. Parliament needs to meet, by law, no later than 18 November.

Every effort will be made to pass the bill by the end of March 2006. If it is not, it is appreciated that this creates some problems with effective dates of:

*   April / May 2005 for depreciation;
*   1 April 2006 for provisional tax and GST date alignment;
*   1 April 2006 for the payroll subsidy; and
*   1 April 2006 for fringe benefit tax – and so on.

All these dates would need to be reviewed in terms of their viability. That means not only their feasibility for taxpayers, but also for Inland Revenue, which has to implement them. The government will be seeking clarity on these matters as early as possible.

The period to the end of this year will be a very busy one. During the election campaign commitments were made to changes to Family Assistance and the Student Loan Scheme, to come into effect on 1 April 2006. For this timetable to be met, policy decisions and legislation will be required quickly. That means the government will need to consider its priorities and what is feasible from a delivery point of view.

If the carbon tax is to come into effect on 1 April 2007, as previously announced, that will require legislation in 2006.

A number of other priority policies will also have to be advanced for announced for timetables to be met. These include KiwiSaver and associated reforms to the taxation of savings entities, which were announced to come into effect on 1 April 2007. This may seem a long way away, but the savings industry requires time to implement any changes, making legislation in 2006 a necessity.

A discussion document on savings entities was released for public comment before the election. Numerous submissions have been received. The most controversial aspect has undoubtedly been the proposed change to the taxation of offshore investment. Commentary and submissions have expressed significant opposition to the proposed changes. They also contain too little acknowledgement of what most who are familiar with this industry publicly or privately admit: that the current rules are not working.

Before the election the government made it clear that it was open to reasonable solutions. The option that submissions seem to favour is taxation limited to dividends. With no capital gains tax and low dividend yields, the result would provide too much incentive to invest offshore. That does not seem to be reasonable.

A priority for the government will be continuing the dialogue that has been started with the private sector to determine whether there is a reasonable and workable solution to what is a difficult and important issue.

All in all this is a very full schedule of issues and legislation. Undoubtedly, the changes that are made will provide plenty of material for your next conference.

Thank you.

New taxation bill to be fast-tracked
====================================

A bill introduced into Parliament today boosts income assistance for working families, removes interest on student loans for most borrowers, and offers an amnesty on student loan penalties for certain borrowers who live overseas. It also fixes the rate of income tax for the 2005-06 tax year, an amendment previously contained in the taxation bill introduced in May. The bill will be fast-tracked through Parliament for passage by mid-December. For more information see the government's [media statement](/news/2005/2005-11-08-new-taxation-bill-be-fast-tracked#statement)
 and the [Taxation (Annual Rates and Urgent Measures) Bill](https://bills.parliament.nz/v/6/5c13b2b6-7625-45ff-951f-964967f8c112?Tab=history)
.

Hon Dr Michael Cullen  
Minister of Finance

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Labour delivers on key election promises

Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders will benefit from legislation tabled in Parliament today honouring Labour’s election promises to make student loans interest free and to expand the Working for Families package.

Finance Minister Michael Cullen said the pledges reflected the government's commitment to a fair and inclusive society that offered its young people the opportunity to achieve their full potential.

"The family tax relief provisions raise the threshold at which family income assistance begins to abate from $27,500 to $35,000 and reduce the abatement rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent.

"This will provide targeted tax relief to 160,000 working families. The size of the tax reduction will depend on family circumstances, including the number of children, but will average around $50 a week," Dr Cullen said.

The bill will be fast-tracked through all its stages before the House rises in mid-December so that the changes can take effect in the year beginning 1 April.

Dr Cullen said the interest free student loan policy would apply to existing and new loans and had been designed both to cut the cost to students of tertiary study and to encourage skilled New Zealanders to invest their skills in the New Zealand economy.

"For this reason, with some important exceptions, people will have to be living in New Zealand to qualify for the interest free loans.

"Borrowers will be deemed to be non-resident when they have been out of the country for more than 183 consecutive days. Short visits \[31 days or less\] back to New Zealand will be counted as if the person had remained overseas.

"New Zealanders returning home will, after 183 days back in the country, have any interest charged on their loan from the first day of their return reversed. Trips overseas of 31 days or less will be counted as if the person had remained resident in New Zealand.

"As a further inducement to encourage people back, non-resident borrowers who are in default for non-repayment of their loans will have their penalties cancelled under a special amnesty if between 1 April next year and 31 March 2007 they agree to keep their current liability up to date for two years.

Inland Revenue will have the discretion to exempt from the residency rule people, and the partners of people, who are overseas:

*   for postgraduate study;
*   in a work posting for a New Zealand-based employer;
*   working on a volunteer basis or for a token payment for a recognised charitable organisation, in which case the exemption will apply for up to two years;
*   on an unplanned period of absence - for example, visiting a sick parent;
*   unavoidably delayed from returning to New Zealand within 183 days due to unexpected circumstances such as illness.

Dr Cullen said that for reasons relating to Inland Revenue's computer system, it would continue in the short term to charge interest during the year and write it off at the end of the year and that this would show on borrowers' statements but that it would be an administrative entry only.

"I recognise that the policies provided for in this bill will create capacity pressures for the IRD. Additional funding will be provided through a special cash injection for the current year and through the budget process for subsequent years," he said.

The bill also fixes the rates of income tax for the 2005-06 tax year. This is an annual requirement under the Income Tax Act and has been incorporated into this measure to ensure passage before 1 April.

Estimates are that the interest free regime will reduce the value of the student loans portfolio held by the Crown by around $1.5 billion. There will be a further impact of around $500 million due to a shift in accounting treatment from book to fair value. Both changes are one-off.

"Provision for this, and the money to fund the interest free loans scheme and the extensions to Working for Families, will be made through an imprest supply bill to be introduced into Parliament later this month," Dr Cullen said.

### Family assistance changes

From 1 April 2006, the level at which abatement of family assistance begins will rise from $27,500 to $35,000, and the rate at which assistance abates for income that is over the new threshold will be lowered from 30 per cent to 20 per cent.

Family assistance includes Family Support and the Child Tax Credit or In-work Payment, Parental Tax Credit and the Family Tax Credit. Family Support is available to all families with dependent children, while all the rest are available only to families in which the principal carer or the spouse or partner of the principal carer is working and not available to families receiving benefits.

Entitlement is based on the number and age of dependent children. The entitlement abates above a certain income level, based on the combined income of the principal carer and spouse or partner (if any).

The changes introduced in the bill add to those already on track to come into effect on 1 April 2006 as part of the Working for Families package – the introduction of a new In-work Payment for working families and increases to the Family Tax Credit (both of which are part of family assistance). The Working for Families package, which began to be implemented in October 2004, also includes changes to Accommodation Supplement and Childcare Assistance, which are delivered by the Ministry of Social Development.

**Who gains?**

The latest enhancements to the threshold for family assistance will result in some 160,000 families being better off by around $50 a week. The amount will vary depending on family circumstances.

For example:

A couple who have two children aged 4 and 16, work 60 hours a week between them and earn $37,440 gross per year could already be better off by $88 per week under the Working for Families package announced last year.

From 1 April 2006 they would have been expecting an additional $55 a week, when the $60 In-work Payment replaces their $30 Child Tax Credit and an additional $25 from the increase to the abatement threshold for family assistance.

The changes introduced in the bill will make the couple better off by an additional $48 per week on top of the $55 they were expecting. They will get a further $20 in Family Support from 1 April 2007, as announced last year.

* * *

### Student loan changes

Changes to the student loan scheme are being introduced to encourage borrowers to contribute to New Zealand's economy and society.

The first of these changes means that no borrower living in New Zealand will pay interest on their loan. The second change provides an amnesty period on penalties for borrowers living overseas who are in arrears with their payments.

**No interest policy**

From 1 April 2006:

*   all borrowers who are studying part-time or full-time will continue to have the interest on their student loans written off; and
*   all borrowers who are not studying, irrespective of whether they have graduated with a qualification, will pay no interest on their student loan provided they are living in New Zealand.

Interest will be charged on student loans when borrowers are away from New Zealand for more than 183 consecutive days. If the borrower has returned to New Zealand for less than 31 days, during a period of 183 consecutive days, the time in New Zealand will be counted as if the borrower had remained overseas.

When a borrower has been overseas for more than 183 consecutive days, interest charges will be backdated to the day after the borrower left New Zealand. Interest will cease to be charged once the borrower has been in New Zealand for more than 183 consecutive days. If the borrower goes overseas for 31 days or less during a period of 183 consecutive days, the time overseas will be counted as if the borrower had remained in New Zealand.

Inland Revenue will also have discretion to grant an exemption to the rules covering time spent overseas if borrowers:

*   are studying full-time at postgraduate level overseas;
*   are government employees;
*   are volunteering or working for a token payment for a charitable organisation – borrowers will continue to be eligible for the no interest policy for up to two years;
*   have an unexpected delay in returning to New Zealand or an unplanned absence overseas;
*   are in employment that requires a significant amount of travel; or
*   are partners of persons that would meet one of the exceptions to the 183-day rule.

**Amnesty on penalties**

The amnesty period for non-resident borrowers will apply from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 and covers:

*   borrowers who are non-resident for income tax purposes, and who have arrears and penalties at the start of the amnesty period (1 April 2006); and
*   borrowers who are overseas at the start of the amnesty period, but who have not advised Inland Revenue of their absence, and who have non-resident arrears and penalties when their correct liability is established during the amnesty period.

The amnesty will not apply to:

*   borrowers who have been non-resident, but who have regained their New Zealand resident status before the amnesty period begins; and
*   borrowers who have always been New Zealand resident.

Only borrowers who are not resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes when the amnesty period begins on 1 April 2006 will be eligible, including those who are non-resident but have failed to advise Inland Revenue of their departure. Borrowers will be required to keep their payments up-to-date for a two-year period. Borrowers returning to New Zealand will have repayment deductions made from their salary and wages. Borrowers remaining overseas must make each quarterly instalment as it falls due. The provisions will include borrowers who have a combination of periods overseas and in New Zealand, provided the relevant liability is kept up-to-date.

The amnesty applies to penalties only. Interest will still be charged, at the rate(s) applying over the period of default, on the underlying debt. This is important to be fair to borrowers who have met their obligations.

Borrowers who do not come within the amnesty will still be able to negotiate a reduction in their compulsory annual repayment if payment would cause serious financial hardship. These borrowers can also be granted a reduction in the penalties charged if they enter into an acceptable repayment arrangement with Inland Revenue.

**Amnesty conditions**

The proposed changes will give amnesty to any borrower who is a non-resident for income tax purposes on 1 April 2006, and who has overdue student loan debt which has been subject to penalties. To qualify, borrowers will be required to meet their current student loan liability for two years as it arises. For borrowers returning to New Zealand this will mean meeting their income-contingent liability, including having repayment deductions made from their salary and wages. For borrowers remaining overseas it will mean making each quarterly instalment as it falls due. A combination of being overseas and in New Zealand will be allowed, provided the relevant liability is kept up-to-date.

**Failure to meet amnesty conditions**

Inland Revenue will monitor borrowers coming within the amnesty for two years. Borrowers will be contacted if any non-compliance is detected and given the opportunity to make the missing payment. Should the conditions continue not to be met, the original underlying debt and penalties suitable to the circumstances of the case may be reinstated.

Briefing to new govt released
=============================

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today released Inland Revenue's briefing to the incoming government. Despite strong revenue flows, the briefing paper says, the robustness of tax rules on foreign investment into New Zealand should be increased, given the importance of the company tax base to revenue flow. It also suggests the government consider measures to make the personal income tax system more robust, to counter increased use of tax sheltering and income splitting.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### IR briefing 'constructive contribution'

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today welcomed the Inland Revenue Department's briefing to the incoming Government as a 'constructive contribution to the government's work on tax issues'.

"The Commissioner of Inland Revenue points out that New Zealand's substantial company tax base is at risk because of our relatively high reliance on corporate tax as a revenue source and the relatively high foreign ownership of companies," he said.

"He also says we have to regain our competitive tax advantage over Australia, which means the future of the trans-Tasman tax relationship needs to be considered as a matter of priority.

"This is entirely consistent with the confidence and supply agreement United Future and Labour signed which says there will be 'a review of the current business taxation regimes with the view of ensuring the system works to give better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia'," said Mr Dunne.

Mr Dunne noted that the latest report from the think tank, the New Zealand Institute, pointed to the need for New Zealand to improve its labour force productivity dramatically if it wishes to rise in the OECD standings and improve living standards.

"The review I am leading will address all these issues," said Mr Dunne.

### Review of corporate tax regime on the agenda

"The concerns raised by the Treasury and Inland Revenue regarding company tax will inform the government's planned review of the business tax regime," Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

He was commenting on the IRD's and the Treasury's briefings to the incoming government.

"The terms for the review are still being drawn up but will reflect the government's commitment to give better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia."

Dr Cullen said that there were tensions within the Treasury paper which seemed to be inviting the government to make large reductions to the top personal tax rates while also reducing the size of future budgets and maintaining a stable debt to GDP ratio.

"This would seem to imply that I simultaneously loosen and tighten fiscal policy while also broadly maintaining current fiscal settings.

"As Treasury itself observes, the ageing population will put pressure on the fiscal position and strong fiscal positions can deteriorate quickly. That is why the manifesto Labour took into the election campaign was the most fiscally responsible of any party and why we will continue to run a prudent and consistent fiscal strategy.

"The government will not be undermining the platform of fiscal stability and strength that we have built up over the past six years. The mission this government has set itself, as spelt out in the Speech from the Throne last week, is to lift the quality of life and standard of living of all New Zealanders.

"To achieve that we need to lift labour productivity, improve the skills base of the workforce, protect environmental values and raise sufficient tax to support quality public health and education services and to provide security in retirement," Dr Cullen said.

More time for tax changes
=========================

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has recommended delaying the 1 April 2006 application date of three small-business changes currently before Parliament – the alignment of GST and provisional tax due dates, basing provisional tax on GST turnover, and the new subsidy for use of PAYE intermediaries.

The proposed legislation was not enacted this year, as originally anticipated, and is not expected to be enacted until late March. Delaying the application dates will give businesses more time to prepare for the reforms once they become law.

### Minister wants later application date for small-business tax changes

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has recommended delaying the 1 April application date of three small-business tax changes in a bill under consideration by Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Committee.

In a letter to the chairman of the committee, Mr Dunne explains that businesses need more time to prepare for the changes, given that the proposed legislation was not enacted this year as originally anticipated, and is not expected to be enacted until March.

The three measures for which he is recommending a deferred application date are the alignment of GST and provisional tax due dates, allowing businesses to base provisional tax payments on GST turnover, and introduction of the new subsidy for use of PAYE intermediaries by small businesses.

LETTER

Mr Shane Jones MP  
Chairman  
Finance and Expenditure Committee  
PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS

Dear Shane

The Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill makes tax easier for small businesses by allowing them to align the provisional tax payment dates with GST due dates, thereby reducing the number of payment dates they have to cope with. A related change allows small businesses to base their provisional tax payments on a percentage of their GST turnover, which will be particularly helpful to those that have mostly seasonal income.

The bill also introduces a subsidy for the voluntary use of PAYE intermediaries by small businesses. Its aim is to encourage employers of up to five staff to outsource their payroll obligations - including making deductions for income tax, student loans and child support - so they have more time to run their business.

The unfortunate delay in the passage of the bill because of the election could adversely affect a variety of taxpayers and businesses subject to these proposals.

Taxpayers who are affected by the proposals will be seeking information on the changes and confirmation that they will be in effect from 1 April 2006. Businesses would normally now begin preparing for legislative changes that apply from 1 April 2006. As the legislation is not expected to be enacted until March 2006, Inland Revenue are unable to provide the necessary information to businesses and confirm the application date of the legislation. Also, any changes made by businesses now will not reflect the changes to the legislation made at the select committee stage or later. Furthermore, a March 2006 enactment date will not provide sufficient lead-in time for Inland Revenue to provide information to businesses and for businesses to make the necessary changes by 1 April 2006. This situation can cause confusion and increase compliance costs for businesses.

For these reasons I have instructed officials to recommend in the officials' report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee that the application dates of the three reforms be delayed. The proposed new application dates are as follows.

*   The first part of the proposal to align provisional tax and GST payment dates is to change the GST due date. I recommend that the Committee consider delaying the change for one year, from 1 April 2006 to 1 April 2007.
*   I also recommend that the Committee consider delaying the application date of the proposal to align the provisional tax payments with GST due dates and to base provisional tax payments on a percentage of GST turnover for a year, from the 2007-08 income year to the 2008-09 income year.
*   With regard to the application date of the proposal to provide a subsidy to employers who engage a payroll agent, I recommend that the Committee consider delaying the proposal for six months, from 1 April 2006 to 1 October 2006.

Delaying these application dates will assist taxpayers in their preparations for changes that come into force when the bill is enacted.

I ask that the Finance and Expenditure Committee consider the changes to these application dates when it considers the bill.

Kind regards

Yours sincerely

Carbon tax not to proceed

Hon David Parker  
Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Carbon tax will not go ahead in 2007

Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues David Parker today announced the government is not proceeding with its proposed carbon tax and will instead consider other ways to ensure New Zealand meets its commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

"The government has decided not to implement a carbon tax, or any other broad based tax, in the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. Officials now advise that the proposed carbon tax would not cut emissions enough to justify its introduction.

"New Zealand is committed to meeting our international obligations under Kyoto and achieving our domestic goal of lowering emissions. The government takes seriously the threat that human-induced climate change poses to our environment, economy, and way of life. We have an obligation to do something about it, and we will."

The decision not to implement the carbon tax follows a whole of government review of climate change policy, which the government called for in June. Mr Parker today released the 460-page review. The government has asked officials to undertake further policy work, in consultation with stakeholder. This is due to be reported back to ministers in March.

"Many of our current policies were developed in the 1990s. Since then, New Zealand's economy has boomed, petrol prices have risen and other factors, such as falling log prices, have changed our situation.

"It is important that we modify climate change policies in light of this. They need to be fair to everyone, from residential consumers and small businesses to major energy users and power generators.

"It is a complex area and all countries are facing increasing costs and risks of climate change such as more flooding and droughts. As a country dependent on agriculture, we are particularly vulnerable."

Mr Parker said some parts of New Zealand's climate change policy, such as Projects to Reduce Emissions (PREs), have been successful. Due to PREs, we now have the lowest-cost wind generation in the world. This is a significant achievement and we need to build on this," Mr Parker said.

"The review also highlighted some forestry, land use and agriculture policies that need refinement to ensure they help cut emissions.

Other policies linked to the carbon tax, such as Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements for major energy users and emitters, are likely to be retained in some form.

Mr Parker said some areas that officials would report back on in March include:

*   Incentivising investment in renewable energy
*   Encouraging new tree planting and reducing deforestation
*   Improving fuel efficiency of the transport fleet
*   Assessing options for a narrow-based carbon tax on major energy users and emitters who do not meet world best practice
*   Improving energy efficiency and conservation.

Mr Parker said the agriculture sector, which accounts for approximately 50 per cent of New Zealand's emissions, would be protected from any broad-based price measure. It is anticipated that some of the money saved by the sector will be reinvested in research and development.

Child Support Amendment Bill Commentary on the Bill Hon David Cunliffe Associate Minister of Revenue First published in August 2005 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Child Support Amendment Bill; Commentary on the Bill. ISBN 0-478-27128-X CONTENTS Overview 1 Write-off of penalty debt 2 Exemptions from liability 5 Determinations initiated by Inland Revenue 9 Appeal rights following an administrative determination 11 Acceptance of overseas birth documents 13 Remedial issues 15 Continuity of administrative determinations 17 Offsetting rules 18 Order of payment application 19 Credit transfers 20 Powers in relation to reciprocal agreements 21 Drafting issues 22 1 OVERVIEW Under the major change proposed in the Child Support Amendment Bill, the government will forgo the collection of some penalties to provide an incentive for non-payers to begin making payments of financial support again. If they do, and if they maintain their payments of both current financial support and an agreed amount of their arrears for a specified period, some of their accumulated penalty debt will be written off. “Financial support” consists of child support and spousal maintenance. Similarly, the term “liable person”, as used here and in the legislation, includes those responsible for paying either form of financial support. The term “liable parent” is used when child support is the only form of financial support involved. Child support is payable to custodians of children or to the Crown when custodians are social welfare beneficiaries, to offset the cost of providing income maintenance. Spousal maintenance is payable to former marriage, civil union and de facto partners. Penalties are payable to the Crown. Also proposed in the bill is a change that will allow Inland Revenue itself, not just custodial parents, to initiate reviews of liable parents’ financial affairs when it suspects they are paying less child support than they should. The change is intended to counter the practice of liable parents structuring their affairs to minimise the child support they have to pay. Two new exemptions from liability for child support are the subject of further amendments. The Child Support Act 1991 already provides an exemption for long- term hospital patients and prisoners, who are not able to earn income. The bill extends the exemption to young people under 16, who are in a similar position, although the exemption will not apply if they undertake part-time or casual employment. The bill also introduces a new, permanent exemption for victims of sex offences. Other significant changes will allow respondents to a child support administrative review the right to appeal to the Family Court if they are dissatisfied with the outcome, and allow Inland Revenue to accept documentation from other countries as proof of parentage. The remaining changes are remedial in nature. They are intended to make the child support scheme work better for all who are involved in it. 2 WRITE-OFF OF PENALTY DEBT (Clause 32) Summary of proposed changes The proposed changes are intended to bring non-payers back into the payment system. When liable persons enter an agreement with Inland Revenue to maintain payments of their current liability and pay off their financial support arrears, their incremental penalties accrued before the date of the agreement will be written off at six-monthly review points if they maintain payments under the agreement. The write-offs are to be based on a pro rata percentage of the core financial support arrears, including 10% penalties that have been paid. For liable persons who default on their payment agreement there is to be no write-off at the next review point. They will have to negotiate and comply with a new agreement before they again qualify for a write-off. Liable persons who are already complying with a payment arrangement for their arrears will also benefit from the changes in respect of payments they make from the time the legislation comes into effect. About 3,000 liable persons currently owe penalty debt only. For them and others who reach that position, Inland Revenue is to have discretion to take a case-by-case approach, with the objective of achieving maximum possible recovery. The exercise of the discretion will involve consideration of whether hardship exists or whether continued attempts at recovery would represent an inefficient use of resources. Application date The amendments will apply to new arrangements entered into from enactment and to payments made on existing arrangements after enactment. Key features The existing provisions relating to penalties have been rewritten to provide a consistent form for the granting of relief from them. The new provisions for relief from penalties are contained in sections 135G, 135J, 135K and 135L. When a liable person has no current or future liability for financial support, all initial 10% penalties have been paid, and all that remain are incremental penalties, section 135G gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to consider writing off those incremental penalties. 3 When there is continuing liability, or arrears still to pay, the write-off of accrued incremental penalties is to be mandatory if the terms of a payment agreement have been complied with. Section 135J provides a formula for the calculation of the amount that is to be written off at 26-weekly review points for new agreements. Background Unpaid financial support penalties exceed outstanding core liabilities, and over half of all liable persons have some arrears of liability to pay. When they fail to pay in full on time, an initial penalty of 10% of the shortfall is imposed, with further incremental penalties of 2% for each month that the amount remains outstanding. Each unpaid monthly instalment compounds at the rate of 36.8% in the first year and thereafter at 26.8% per year. The penalty debt acts as a disincentive to re-enter the child support payment system. The Child Support Act contains provisions for the write-off of the initial late payment penalty when specified conditions are met and of ongoing incremental penalties when payment arrangements are adhered to. However, there is currently no flexibility in respect of the accumulated incremental penalties. Detailed analysis Sections 135 and 135B of the Act are to be repealed and replaced by new sections 135 to 135O, which will incorporate the existing provisions relating to write-off of late payment penalties. Key terms in the new sections are defined in section 135, while section 135A describes the manner in which Inland Revenue may grant relief from penalties. Sections 135B to 135F describe the existing discretionary power available to Inland Revenue to grant relief from penalties, while section 135G introduces the new discretion in relation to residual penalty debt. This new power will be exercised when there is no current or future liability for financial support, all initial 10% penalties have paid, and all that remain are incremental penalties. Inland Revenue must have regard to whether recovery is an inefficient use of resources or whether it would place the liable person in serious hardship as defined in the section. The provisions for mandatory relief in respect of the initial late payment penalty that are currently in section 135A are to be located in new sections 135H and 135I. New section 135J provides for mandatory relief from incremental penalties that were incurred before a payment agreement made between Inland Revenue and the liable person to pay the full current liability, together with an amount towards the recovery of arrears. The relief will be granted when the payment agreement has been complied with for 26 weeks, and at the end of each following 26-week period until the arrears, including related initial late payment penalties, have been paid in full. The proportion of total incremental penalties that will be written off at the end of each period will be equal to the proportion of total arrears that have been repaid in that period. 4 The formula is modified in section 135K in respect of arrangements that are already in place, while section 135L gives Inland Revenue the discretion to disregard failures to make a payment under an agreement in specified circumstances. The mandatory relief from continuing incremental penalties currently in subsection 135(3) will be in new sections 135M and 135N. New section 135O provides for refunds to be made out of a Crown Bank Account and for the new provisions to apply to penalties that are imposed before or after the new legislation comes into force. 5 EXEMPTIONS FROM LIABILITY (Clauses 8, 12,13,14,15, 16 17, 18, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 35, 37, 38, 45, 46, 47, 52 & 53) Summary of proposed changes The bill introduces two new exemptions from liability for child support: • a permanent exemption for victims of sex offences; and • a temporary exemption for liable parents under the age of 16 years. Victims of sexual crimes should not be further victimised by being required to pay child support for a child born as a result of the crime, particularly if the payments are to be made to the offender. The new provision will let victims off any child support obligations permanently once offenders have been convicted. Some young people become liable to pay child support when their attendance at school is compulsory and their primary focus should be on educational achievements rather than on earning an income in order to pay child support. These young people are in a somewhat similar position to prisoners and hospital patients in that their ability to earn an income is limited by matters beyond their control, so they are also to be exempt from liability. If, however, they choose to undertake part-time or casual employment they should make a contribution towards the support of their child, so they will lose the exemption. These new exemptions are incorporated in a new Part 5A. It also restructures the current provisions relating to exemptions, makes some remedial changes to them and includes new provisions for determinations that exemptions be set aside on application from the payee. Application date The amendments will apply from enactment. Key features Victims of sex offences Subpart 4 of new Part 5A provides for exemption of the victim from liability for child support for a child born as a result of an offence under the relevant sections of the Crimes Act 1961. New section 89Z requires Inland Revenue to grant a permanent exemption when satisfied that the requirements for the exemption have been met. 6 Section 89ZA provides for the exemption to be withdrawn if a conviction is overturned on appeal, but allows a new application for exemption in the event of a new conviction at re-trial. Liable parents under age 16 Young people are to be exempt from child support liability until they reach age 16 years, in accordance with new section 89E, subject to the same income criteria that apply to hospital patients and prisoners. That means they cannot have earned income, but they can receive investment income, such as interest on a bank account, up to the level of the current minimum amount of child support. They have three months after they reach age 16 years to apply for an exemption. Remedial changes Hospital patients are to have three months after discharge to apply for an exemption. When an exemption has retrospective effect Inland Revenue will not refund any payments made by the liable person. Such payments will be applied to past or future liability. Background Recent changes to provisions relating to sexual crimes in the Crimes Act 1961 highlighted the potential for victims of sexual crimes to become liable for child support when a child is born as a result. The two most likely scenarios are: • A male who is the victim of abuse by an older female fathers a child as a result of the sexual act. • A female victim of abuse gives birth to a child as a result of the sexual act. She later has the child placed in foster care and becomes a liable parent in relation to the child. In both cases the obligation to pay child support would be likely to add to the trauma already experienced by the victim. Consideration of that specific issue also raised concerns about the consequences for young people in general of becoming liable for child support at a time when their earning ability is limited through compulsory requirements for attendance at school. The reality is that if their parents do not help them to meet their obligations, they are likely to accumulate a debt that could ultimately act as a barrier to their successful transition into the workforce. Allowing an exemption for young people does create some conflict with the rights of their children to receive financial support, particularly if the custodian is also under the age of 16 and consequently not eligible for income assistance. However, the exemption is only for a limited period and is probably in the long-term interests of both young parents and their children. 7 The exemptions will not preclude voluntary payments, nor will it be compulsory to apply for them. Because there are differences in the qualifying criteria, the new Part 5A provides separately for each category of exemption. Detailed analysis The existing sections 73 to 76, relating to exemptions from liability, are to be repealed and a new Part 5A is being inserted. Section 89A outlines the content as a guide to the general scheme and effect of the new part, while definitions specific to the new part are contained in section 89B. In Subpart 2, sections 89C and 89D contain the criteria for the existing exemptions for hospital patients and prisoners. Section 89E provides that a liable person under 16 years may apply for an exemption if his or her income during the period of the exemption will be nil unless it is solely from investments, in which case it must be less than the minimum rate of child support that is current at the time of the exemption. These are the same income criteria that apply to the exemptions for prisoners. The provisions for cessation of an exemption are contained in section 89F, which sets out the rules that apply when the income criteria are not met at any time during a child support year in which an exemption would otherwise be available, and in section 89G. Section 89H sets out the requirements for an application for an exemption that must be met before the Commissioner can give effect to an exemption in accordance with section 89I. Section 89J prevents persons who have been granted an exemption from receiving a refund of any payments they may have made during the entitlement period and contains rules for the allocation of any such payments. Section 89K in subpart 3 allows for determinations to be made by the Commissioner that an exemption does not apply and, in the case of child support payable under a formula assessment, for a departure from the formula. The requirements of an application for a determination under this subpart are set out in section 89L. Section 89M allows the Commissioner to make a determination that an exemption does not apply or ceases to apply so that the amount payable before the granting of the exemption is reinstated, or to confirm that an exemption is to continue. In the case of child support payable under a formula assessment, the Commissioner may, in accordance with section 89N, make a determination to depart from the provisions of the Act in relation to a child. 8 In making these determinations the Commissioner must have regard to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the liable person. The procedural arrangements are set out in sections 89O to 89X. The provisions for the new permanent exemption for victims of sexual offences are contained in subpart 4. Section 89Y sets out the application requirements. In accordance with section 89Z, Inland Revenue must be satisfied that the parent had become liable to pay child support as a result of being the victim of a sex offence under the Crimes Act 1961, and the offender must have been convicted of that offence or the case proven if heard in the Youth Court. In order to minimise the trauma for victims, the section also provides for Inland Revenue to carry out all necessary enquiries of the New Zealand Police or the Ministry of Justice, before granting an exemption. Section 89ZA provides for the exemption to be void if the conviction is quashed or the finding is reversed or set aside, but allows a new application if there is a new conviction at re-trial. The miscellaneous provisions that apply generally to exemptions are contained in subpart 5, sections 89ZB to 89ZD, together with the new provision in section 89ZE that allows an agent to apply for an exemption on behalf of a liable person. A consequential amendment to section 90(1)(i) of the Act allows objections against any decision not to grant an exemption under the new Part 5A. The rules for allocation of payments made during a period when there is entitlement to an exemption may create a repayment requirement for a custodian who is not a beneficiary. Section 152A requires Inland Revenue to write off the whole of a debt that arises in this situation. In a similar manner, an exempted person is prevented from recovering from a payee any amount paid in respect of any exempt period through a provision in new section 89J and an amendment to section 207. 9 DETERMINATIONS INITIATED BY INLAND REVENUE (Clauses 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed changes will allow Inland Revenue to initiate the administrative review process if it considers that the amount of child support payable by a liable parent does not accurately reflect that parent’s ability to provide financial assistance for his or her child(ren). Application date The amendments will apply from enactment. Key features New Part 6B will allow the Commissioner to initiate an administrative review, using the existing administrative review process, if investigation into liable parents’ financial affairs establishes that their child support liability does not accurately reflect their ability to provide financial assistance to their child(ren). Custodians will be able to ask Inland Revenue to discontinue the review if they are (or were) not in receipt of a social security benefit during the period under review. Inland Revenue will supply a statement of what it considers a liable parent’s financial position to be but will not appear before the Review Officer. Inland Revenue will not be able to lodge an appeal against any decision made. Background The child support formula is based on taxable income, which provides an incentive for liable parents who wish to minimise their child support liability to reduce their taxable income. Most liable parents receive a salary, wages or a benefit and thus – apart from exchanging salary for a fringe benefit, such as a car, or employer superannuation contributions, or deliberately giving up or reducing their employment – have limited opportunity to manipulate their income in order to minimise their child support liability. However, the way in which other liable parents, such as business people and those with investment income, can structure their financial affairs means that the amount of child support they pay may not reflect their capacity to pay. The structures they use may be legal for income tax purposes and may have been adopted for legitimate reasons, such as separating business and private assets. Equally, they may have been adopted to minimise child support liabilities. Whatever the reason for the way in which liable parents structure their financial affairs, if they have the effect of reducing their taxable income, and thus their child support liability, the intent of the Child Support Act that parents contribute to their children’s support according to their capacity to pay is defeated. 10 Custodians can already deal with this problem by seeking a departure from an assessment if they consider that special circumstances exist that make the amount payable by the liable parent unfair. The administrative review process is a low-cost, informal process which is carried out by independent people, experienced in law and contracted to Inland Revenue, who follow precedents set by past court cases. However, for a variety of reasons, including a lack of knowledge of the liable parent’s current financial position, custodians may fail to seek a departure. Detailed analysis The new Part allows the Commissioner to initiate a process, in accordance with section 96S, that may lead to a determination that the provisions of the Act be departed from in relation to a child. Section 96Q provides for the Commissioner to make determinations under the new Part and sets out who are the parties to the proceedings. Before making a determination, the Commissioner must be satisfied, in accordance with section 96R, that there are special circumstances that would make it unjust and inequitable not to depart from the Act’s provisions. This will involve consideration of the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of either parent or the child. Sections 96T to 96ZA set out procedural requirements. The determinations that may be made are set out in section 96ZB, but the Commissioner may refuse to make a determination in accordance with section 96ZC. 11 APPEAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING AN ADMINISTRATIVE DETERMINATION (Clauses 25 & 49) Summary of proposed changes The introduction of a new appeal right is intended to provide greater fairness between applicants and respondents following an administrative review. Under current law, unsuccessful applicants can have their case reconsidered by the Family Court, but dissatisfied respondents following a successful administrative review have recourse only through judicial review in the High Court. The new appeal right will allow respondents also to have their case reconsidered in the Family Court. Appeal rights are also needed in respect of the new provisions for determinations in subpart 3 of Part 5A and Part 6B. Application date The amendments will apply from enactment. Key features The provisions in section 103B are intended to produce outcomes for respondents similar to those that are possible for applicants for administrative reviews, who can subsequently pursue an application for departure order in the Family Court. The new rights of appeal under sections 103A and 103C will be available to both applicants and respondents. There will be a two-month time limit on appeals under these new provisions but the Family Court may allow an extension of time. Background The administrative review process that was introduced into the child support scheme in 1994 was intended to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the power to make determinations on the same basis as the Family Court. It was also intended that either party to a review, if unhappy with the outcome of an administrative review hearing, would have the right to apply to the Family Court for a departure order. 12 Despite that intention, a respondent to a successful application for an administrative determination is unable to take an application to the Family Court for a departure order without proving his or her own “special circumstances”. The fact of the administrative determination itself is not considered by the Court to be a special circumstance. The respondent, therefore, is at a greater disadvantage before the Court than is an unsuccessful applicant for a determination, who can apply for a departure order and rely on the same grounds that were rejected by the Commissioner. Detailed analysis New section 103A allows either a payee or a liable person to appeal to a Family Court against a determination made under subpart 3 of Part 5A, while section 103C allows a qualifying custodian or a liable parent to appeal against a determination under new Part 6B. New section 103B allows a right of appeal to the Family Court to respondents (custodians or liable parents) when the outcome of an administrative review has been a determination which departs from the formula assessment (that is, when the determination results in a change to the formula assessment). Section 103D sets out the powers of the Family Court on appeal, while the actions Inland Revenue must take following an order are set out in section 103E. 13 ACCEPTANCE OF OVERSEAS BIRTH DOCUMENTS (Clauses 5, 6, 7 & 44) Summary of proposed changes The proposed changes will allow all countries outside New Zealand to be recognised for the purpose of accepting proof of parentage documents (such as birth certificates) to establish child support liability. Under current law, each overseas country whose documentation Inland Revenue wishes to accept must be individually recognised as a “specified overseas jurisdiction” by an Order in Council. To maintain the integrity of the system, Inland Revenue will have the discretion to decline to accept overseas documentation on a case-by-case basis when its authenticity is in doubt. Application date The amendments will apply from enactment. Key features A definition of “overseas jurisdiction” will be inserted into subsection 2(1). An overseas jurisdiction will include a country, state, territory, province or other part of a country outside New Zealand, and will include the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau. Section 7 defines “parent” for the purposes of the Act. The omission of the word “specified” wherever it occurs, together with the repeal of subsection (5) and subsections 1(a), 1(b) and (2) of section 235, will have the effect of removing the requirement to obtain an Order in Council to recognise each individual country from which documentation is to be accepted. New section 7A will allow the Commissioner the discretion to decline to accept documentation on a case-by-case basis when its authenticity is in doubt. Background The current requirement to recognise countries outside New Zealand by Order in Council before proof of parentage documentation can be accepted is regarded as unnecessarily stringent. If a decision is sought to recognise an additional country, the Order in Council process is such that it may take months for this outcome to be achieved. Similarly, if a country is listed in the regulations and the country’s record-keeping systems are no longer considered to be robust, Inland Revenue would have to keep accepting documentation until the regulations are amended. 14 The recognition of all countries outside New Zealand is a pragmatic response to these problems. Allowing Inland Revenue the discretion to decline to accept documentation on a case-by-case basis when its authenticity is in doubt will ensure the integrity of the system is maintained. Administrative guidelines will be developed to assist delegated staff to determine when documentation is not authentic. 15 Remedial issues 16 17 CONTINUITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE DETERMINATIONS (Clause 20) The administrative review process that was introduced into the child support scheme in 1994 was intended to give Inland Revenue the power to make determinations on the same basis as the Family Court. However, the provisions for administrative determinations do not allow for the continuation of a determination beyond the period of liability. This means that after a temporary break in liability the assessment reverts to the standard formula, even though the circumstances that gave rise to the original administrative determination may still exist. A new application for administrative review must be made. The proposed amendment to section 96D(1) will extend to the Commissioner the powers relating to cessation of orders that are currently available only to the Court. It is to apply from enactment and will allow administrative determinations to continue in force after a temporary break in liability, when the circumstances that gave rise to the original administrative determination are unchanged and the term of the determination has not expired. 18 OFFSETTING RULES (Clauses 10 & 11) The Act provides that when care of a child or children is split or shared between two liable parents, the annual rate of child support payable by one parent may be reduced (offset) by the amount which would be payable by the other parent. Since 1994, offsetting has been available when one parent is a beneficiary, but the non-beneficiary parent must apply for it in writing. When offsetting has been in place and one parent goes on a benefit the automatic offsetting ceases but the non-beneficiary parent is not aware of this until he or she receives a statement showing a higher amount to pay. About a third of non- beneficiary parents do not notice; they pay their usual amount and incur a debt and associated penalty. Under the amendments to sections 34 and 35 that are to apply from enactment Inland Revenue will continue the offsetting of liabilities when one party goes onto a benefit unless the party still entitled to the offset requests that it cease. 19 ORDER OF PAYMENT APPLICATION (Clauses 33 & 34) The Act sets out the rules for how payments are to be allocated to the amounts due from a liable person. The priority order is based on both the type of financial support due and the period the amount applies to. The rules are beneficial to liable parents because they reduce the rate at which penalties accrue on outstanding amounts. However, they mean that custodians sometimes have to wait for payments they are entitled to receive until after payments due to the Crown have been made. Under the proposed amendments to sections 142 and 143, to apply from 1 April 2006, priority is to be given to payments of child support owed to custodians for periods when they were not in receipt of a benefit over payments owed to the Crown. There will be no change to how payments are allocated in the liable parent’s account because to do so would carry a risk that that the liable parent would be confused by statement changes or deduce the beneficiary status of the custodian. 20 CREDIT TRANSFERS (Clauses 41 & 42) Since the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 came into force, on 2 October 2002, it has not been possible to transfer credits of financial support to one’s own tax liability. The limitations have caused problems for liable persons and staff. Under the proposed new sections 216B to 216D, to apply from enactment, it will again be possible for liable persons to transfer credits to meet their own tax liability. They will have the added flexibility, however, of being able to request that the available credit be transferred to meet another person’s tax or financial support liability. It will be possible to transfer the full amount of a credit when a liable person does not have a liability to make further payments of financial support, or, if there is a future liability, the transfer will be limited to the amount that has not been paid to the payee. Once transferred, the amount will be treated as a payment into the account to which it has been credited, and a refund to the person who authorised the transfer. 21 POWERS IN RELATION TO RECIPROCAL AGREEMENTS (Clause 39) A recent report by the Regulations Review Committee found that a number of statutory provisions authorise regulations to override primary legislation for the purposes of implementing international treaties. Following that report, the government decided to amend section 215 of the Act so that it authorises regulations to override only the Child Support Act 1991. The change will apply from enactment. 22 DRAFTING ISSUES (Clauses 9 & 36) The proposed amendments to section 30 arise from the Taxation (Working for Families) Act 2004. They will: • correct a mismatch between the date that amendments made to the Child Support Act 1991 and the Social Security Act 1964 in the Taxation (Working for Families Act) 2004 come into effect; and • correct a minor drafting error relating to the indexation of a liable person’s living allowance. The proposed amendment to section 156 will correct a drafting inconsistency that affects the relationship between the requirements in the Child Support Act for giving copies of deduction notices to liable persons and the provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 relating to deemed receipt of notices. As currently drafted, the law requires copies of deduction notices to be issued to payers of child support but not to payers of spousal maintenance. The change of wording from “liable parent” to “liable person” will reflect the administrative practice of issuing copies of deduction notices to all liable persons, and will apply from enactment.

Application date Most of the amendments will apply from the 2005-06 income year. The exception is the amendment to the low-value asset threshold, which will apply after 19 May 2005. Key features The Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended as follows: • The method for calculating depreciation rates will change so that tax depreciation rates for: – shorter-life plant and equipment will increase, with no change to depreciation rates for longer-life plant and equipment (the diminishing value depreciation rates will increase by up to 57%); – buildings will decrease (the building diminishing value depreciation rates will reduce between 10% and 25%). • The immediate deduction allowed for low-value assets will increase from $200 to $500. A number of consequential amendments are also being made to the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Background In January 2003 the Minister of Finance asked officials to look at whether the present definition of “economic life” accurately reflects commercial reality. An issues paper was released in July 2004 which reviewed the current depreciation rules and set out officials’ goals for depreciation reform. The paper also provided a framework for analysing how depreciation provisions can affect incentives to invest. 4 When taxes distort people’s investment decisions the result is lower growth than otherwise would have occurred. From this starting point officials considered how the current tax depreciation rules might impact upon investment decisions. Their analysis suggests that the current tax depreciation rules can discourage investment in shorter- lived assets. The amendments to the current tax depreciation rules will reduce the effects that the tax depreciation rules can have on investment decisions by dealing with the following concerns: • That current depreciation rates are too fast for buildings and too slow for short- life plant and equipment. This can result in excessive investment in tax- preferred assets and under-investment in others. • That a compliance cost-saving measure introduced in the early 1990s is not as effective as it could be. • There is a minor problem with the tax depreciation rules where it is not clear whether all of an asset’s disposal costs are deductible in full, especially when no consideration is derived. Detailed analysis Economic rate Economic theory suggests that tax depreciation rates should mirror the way an asset declines in value. Tax depreciation rates that mirror economic depreciation help to avoid the situation whereby tax depreciation rates artificially encourage or discourage investment in particular types of assets. The current method of calculating depreciation rates assumes a minimum residual value of 13.5% of an asset’s original cost. Comparing the results of this method of calculating depreciation to international estimates of asset depreciation suggests that New Zealand’s tax depreciation rates are too fast for buildings and too slow for short- life plant and equipment. Section EE 25(6) grandfathers old depreciation rates for plant and equipment acquired before 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired before 19 May 2005. New section EE 25B New section EE 25B sets out how the tax depreciation rate for an item of plant and equipment is calculated: • Subsection (4)(b) introduces a reference to the new schedule 11B, which specifies the new depreciation bands for plant, equipment and structures. Depreciation bands standardise the number of depreciation rates that taxpayers and the Inland Revenue have to manage. New banded rates in column 2 are required to take account of the changes to the methods of calculating plant, equipment and structure depreciation rates. 5 • Subsection (5) introduces the formula for double declining balance (2/estimated useful life) of an asset. This formula creates a depreciation profile that more closely follows estimates of how plant and equipment decline in value over time. Applying the new formula will increase depreciation rates for shorter-life plant and equipment and will not change depreciation rates for longer-life plant and equipment. • Subsection (6) defines the term “estimated useful life” as set out in subsection (5). Estimated useful life will continue to be determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue following the procedure set out in subsection (3). These changes will apply to assets acquired from 1 April 2005, and the new rates will apply from the 2005-06 and subsequent income years. Taxpayers will have the option to continue to depreciate these assets at current depreciation rates or at the new depreciation rates in future years under new section EE 26B. New section EE 25C New section EE 25C sets out how the economic depreciation rate for a building is calculated. The term “building” is not defined in the income tax legislation but does include: portable buildings, fowl houses, grandstands, hothouses, pig houses, shade houses and buildings with framing made from (or a combination of) steel, reinforced concrete, or timber. The amendments in the new EE 25C are: • Subsection (3)(b) introduces a reference to the new schedule 11B, which specifies the new depreciation bands for buildings. Having depreciation bands standardises the number of depreciation rates that taxpayers and Inland Revenue must manage. New banded rates in column 3 are required to take account of the change to the method of calculating building depreciation rates. • Subsection (4) introduces the formula for calculating the straight-line depreciation rate (1/ estimated useful life) of the building. This formula creates a depreciation profile that more closely follows estimates of how buildings are thought to decline in value. Applying the new formula will decrease depreciation rates for buildings. • Subsection (5) defines the term “estimated useful life” as set out in subsection (4). Estimated useful life will continue to be determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue following the procedure in subsection (3). The changes to building depreciation rates will apply to buildings acquired on or from 19 May 2005 and the new rates will come into effect from the 2005-06 and subsequent income years. 6 New section EE 26B New section EE 26B is a compliance cost-saving measure and applies to plant and equipment acquired by a taxpayer between 1 April 2005 and the end of their 2005-06 income year. This section enables taxpayers to make a one-off election, in the 2005- 06 income year, to apply the new depreciation rates (as calculated under section EE 25B) or carry on with the current depreciation rates (as calculated under section EE 25). Taxpayers who elect to move to the new rates will need to revise the depreciation rates in their asset registers. They will need to apply the new depreciation rates from the beginning of the 2005-06 income year. Those who elect to continue to depreciate assets at the current rates will not need to make these adjustments. Low value asset threshold EE 31 and EG 16 Changing section EE 31 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and EG 16 of the Income Tax Act 1994 increases the low value asset threshold from $200 to $500 for assets acquired after 19 May 2005. The bill sets the application date and increases the thresholds from $200 to $500 for the Income Tax Act 2004. Inserting section (1B) in section EG 16 in the Income Tax Act 1994 increases the low value asset threshold for late balance date filers for the 2004-05 income year. Current tax rules generally require taxpayers to capitalise and depreciate assets used in their businesses. The reason for this is that assets may provide economic benefits over a number of years, while the value of assets may decline over this time. This process of capitalising and depreciating virtually all of an enterprise’s assets can, however, impose significant compliance costs on taxpayers. These costs arise because taxpayers must maintain information on all capital assets and track and make adjustments to this information over the life of the asset. Taxpayers can currently write off a low-value asset immediately if its cost does not exceed $200. This threshold was set in 1993, and taxpayers have submitted that it is too low. The proposed increase in the low-value asset and single-supplier thresholds to $500 more than doubles the current level. It also comes at a significant fiscal cost. Consideration for the purposes of EE 37 Inserting subsection (1B) in section EE 38 clarifies that all disposal costs are deductible in full. These costs can be significant if an asset has no scrap value. For example, Resource Management Act consents sometimes require demolition costs to be incurred when the asset is no longer used. Allowing a deduction for the cost of demolition and disposal is the economically correct outcome. Clarifying that this is the case may remove an artificial impediment to more environmentally friendly asset disposal practices. This change applies to asset disposals from the 2005-06 income year. 7 GC 6 Arrangement to defeat the application of depreciation provisions The anti-avoidance provision in section GC 6 is to be broadened to capture arrangements to defeat the depreciation provisions. Replacing specific section references in section GC 6 with the word “if” will address the potential problem that taxpayers have an incentive to sell and re-acquire assets for the benefit of the higher depreciation rates on assets acquired after 1 April 2005. Extending section GC 6 will allow the Commissioner to deny such a deduction if the Commissioner is of the opinion that existing assets have been subject to arrangements for the purpose of having the higher depreciation rates apply to them. Consequential changes Changes to definitions Two changes to the Income Tax Act 2004 take account of the new methods for calculating economic rates of depreciation. The following amendments to definitions are being made: • Section EE 58 is to include references to the new sections EE 25B and EE 25C in the definition of “economic rate”. • In section OB 1 the definition of “finance lease” is to include reference to the new sections EE 25B and EE 25C. New schedule 11B New schedule 11B specifies the new depreciation rate bands (both straight line and diminishing value) for plant, equipment and structures; and buildings. Having depreciation bands standardises the number of depreciation rates that taxpayers and Inland Revenue have to manage. Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 Sections 91AAF and 91AAG are being amended as a consequence of changing the methods for calculating the tax depreciation rates for depreciable assets. Section 91AAF currently allows the Commissioner to set an economic rate of depreciation in a determination having followed the procedure in section EE 25. The section is being amended to require the Commissioner to also have regard to section EE 25B for plant and equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and section EE 25C for buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005. Section 91AAG requires the Commissioner to consider the formula in section EE 25 (4) when deciding whether to issue a special or provisional depreciation rate. It is proposed to amend this section to require the Commissioner to also have regard to section EE 25B for plant and equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and section EE 25C for buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005. 8 9 Changes to the way provisional tax and GST are paid 10 11 CHANGES TO THE WAY PROVISIONAL TAX AND GST ARE PAID (Clauses 59, 79, 83, 84, 88, 99 to 103, 105, 108 to 110, 114 to 118, 120, 142, 143, 152, 155, 160, 161, 171 to 180, 183 to 185, 203, 210 to 217, 219, 221, and Schedules 2 and 3) Summary of the proposed amendments As part of the government’s measures to reduce tax impediments for businesses, changes are being made to the way provisional tax and GST payments are paid and the way provisional tax is calculated. This will be achieved by: • aligning the payment of provisional tax with GST due dates; • changing the due date for both provisional tax and GST to the 28 th of the month; and • providing taxpayers with another method of calculating provisional tax by basing it on a percentage of their GST taxable supplies, known as the ratio method. Application date The provisional tax reforms have a phased implementation: • Those GST-registered taxpayers whose GST taxable periods are not aligned with their income tax balance dates will start being aligned from 1 April 2006. • The due date for payments of GST will change from the last working day of the month to the 28 th of the month, with effect from taxable periods ending on or after 31 March 2006. • Provisional taxpayers will begin paying provisional tax along with their GST payments. They will also be able to base their provisional tax on a percentage of their GST sales with effect from the beginning of the 2007-08 income year. Key features Changing the due date for GST The due date for the payment of provisional tax and GST will change from the 7 th and last working day of the month respectively to the 28 th of the month. Taxpayers will have just one fixed due date to remember instead of separate payment dates. Changes will also be made to the new due date for payment of provisional tax and GST when the due date is the 28 th of December. In this case, the due date will be the 20 th of January. 12 In the case of terminal tax due on the 15 th of January, this will now be payable on the 20 th , in line with provisional tax and GST payments for that month. Aligning GST taxable periods to balance dates To enable provisional tax payments for an income year to be made along with GST payments, taxpayers’ GST taxable periods must be aligned with their balance date. The vast majority of GST taxpayers have their taxable periods aligned, but a small percentage will have to change. Currently there is considerable flexibility around the payment frequency for GST. This flexibility will reduce slightly under these proposals as a result of aligning the new taxable period with the taxpayer’s balance-date month. Provisional tax paid along with GST Provisional tax payments will be paid at the same time as GST payments: • Monthly and two-monthly GST taxpayers will be required to make three compulsory provisional tax payments on their GST due dates and will be able to make three voluntary payments on the remaining GST dates or at any time. • Six-monthly GST taxpayers will make two compulsory provisional tax payments aligned to their two GST payment dates and will be able to make voluntary payments at any time. • Taxpayers who adopt the ratio proposal will pay their provisional tax, together with their GST every two months. • Provisional taxpayers who are not registered for GST will make three compulsory provisional tax payments and will be able to make voluntary payments at any time. Basing provisional tax payments on a percentage of GST taxable supplies The proposal to base provisional tax on a percentage of GST taxable supplies will enable taxpayers to align provisional tax payments with their cashflow. Only taxpayers that pay GST monthly or two-monthly, and whose residual income tax for the prior year is $150,000 or less will qualify to use this option. Background To identify the problems facing small businesses, the government undertook a number of surveys with small and medium-sized enterprises. Two main contributors to tax compliance costs were identified – the time needed to fill out forms and the fact that provisional tax payments were not aligned with cashflow. 13 GST-registered taxpayers account for GST in relation to a taxable period. There are three categories of taxable period that a taxpayer could be assigned to: monthly, two- monthly or six-monthly. Payments of GST are due on the last working day of the month following their taxable period. Provisional taxpayers pay provisional tax three times a year on the 7 th day of the 4 th , 8 th , and 12 th months after balance date. GST payments are not aligned to provisional tax payments. On 17 September 2003 the government released the discussion document Making tax easier for small businesses, which outlined proposals to address the concerns raised by small businesses, namely: • to align the payment of provisional tax with GST payments, which involved most taxpayers making six provisional tax payments per annum linked with GST; and • to base provisional tax payments on a percentage of GST-taxable supplies. However, following submissions and consultation with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand and business representatives, it became clear that for some taxpayers the compliance costs associated with making more frequent payments of provisional tax would not be offset by the benefits of better cashflow management. As a result of this feedback, the provisional tax proposal to align payments of provisional tax with GST payment dates was modified so that most provisional taxpayers will pay only three provisional tax payments and those wanting to pay more frequently can make voluntary tax payments. Detailed analysis The legislative changes are broadly grouped into three areas: • the changes made to section MB of the Income tax Act (which relates to provisional tax); • the changes made to sections 120K of the Tax Administration Act (the interest sections); and • the consequential changes, including those to the GST Act. Owing to the extent of the changes to section MB of the Income Tax Act, this subpart has been rewritten to incorporate the changes. The changes cover the proposals to align provisional tax payments to GST due dates and to base provisional tax payments on a percentage of GST taxable supplies, referred to as the GST ratio in the legislation. The features of each proposal are outlined below: Provisional tax aligned to GST payment dates Provisional taxpayers will pay provisional tax at the same time as GST payments are made, as follows: • Two-monthly GST taxpayers will make three compulsory provisional tax payments aligned to their GST payment dates. 14 • Six-monthly GST taxpayers will make two compulsory provisional tax payments aligned to their GST payment dates. • Taxpayers who are not registered for GST will pay provisional tax on the 5 th , 9 th and 13 th month after their balance date. • Taxpayers who adopt the GST ratio method will pay provisional tax every two months with their GST return. Taxpayers will be able to make a voluntary payment of provisional tax at any time and the GST form will provide a mechanism for voluntary payment in the months when provisional tax is not due. Taxpayers wanting to pay provisional tax as they earn their income can make six payments per annum, whereas those that do not want to pay that frequently can continue with the current three payment dates and not face any additional compliance costs. Taxpayers other than “safe-harboured” taxpayers 1 will be liable for use-of-money interest on the three compulsory provisional tax payment dates (two dates for six- monthly GST taxpayers). They will also receive credit use-of-money interest on voluntary payments made during the year, which will provide an incentive to pay earlier. As is currently the case, all compulsory provisional tax payments will be subject to standard penalties. Voluntary payments will not be subject to penalties. The table below outlines the payment dates for a two-monthly GST-registered taxpayer. New GST/income tax payment dates (Assumes a March balance date taxpayer paying GST two-monthly) 1 st 2 nd 3 rd 4 th 5 th 6 th GST taxable period Apr/May Jun/July Aug/Sept Oct/Nov Dec/Jan Feb/Mar Proposed due date 28 Jun 28 Aug 28 Oct 20 Jan 28 Feb 28 Apr Payments GST and voluntary payments GST and provisional tax GST and voluntary payments GST and provisional tax GST and voluntary payments GST and provisional tax Current provisional tax date Proposed provisional tax date Deferral 7 July 28 Aug 52 days 7 Nov 20 Jan 74 days 7 Mar 28 Apr 52 days Interest Credit Debit Yes No Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Student loans Payment 28 Aug Payment 28 Jan Payment 28 Apr 1 “Safe-harboured” is where a natural person bases their provisional tax liability on 105% of their previous year’s residual income tax liability or if the return for the previous year has not been filed, 110% of the year before the previous year’s residual income tax liability and whose residual income tax for the current year is also less than $35,000. Taxpayers who meet these criteria are not subject to use-of-money interest. 15 This proposal will produce a different treatment for those accounting for GST six- monthly and all other provisional taxpayers. Provisional taxpayers would generally be required to make three provisional tax payments, whereas those registered for GST on a six-monthly basis would make only two payments. This was a consequence of aligning provisional tax payments with GST. Also, paying on two instalment dates is limited to those taxpayers who are registered for GST and whose taxable supplies in the last 12 months were less than $250,000. Provisional tax will be paid on the GST form and taxpayers will be able to offset a GST refund against a provisional tax liability. People with student loans who are liable to make interim repayments will continue to make three interim payments on the same dates as provisional tax is due. However, the new due date for these payments will be later than the current dates, so students will incur additional interest. If they do not want to incur the interest, they can make voluntary payments during the year. When taxpayers change their GST taxable periods the new payment frequency must align with their balance date. The change must also occur on a date that aligns with the new payment frequency. Example 1: Change in GST taxable periods Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr Request change New period 1 st payment 2 nd payment Wendy is registered for GST on a two-monthly basis and has a March balance date for income tax. She also pays provisional tax three times a year, on the 28 th of August, 20 th of January and the 28 th of April. On the 10 th of June Wendy asks to change to a six-monthly taxable period for GST. Wendy cannot change with effect from the end of her current two-monthly period (June/July) as it does not align with her new six-monthly cycle, which starts on 1 October. She must wait until the following two-month period, August/September, when the end of this period aligns with the start of the new six- monthly period. Her provisional tax payments for the year would look like this: – provisional tax instalment payable on old cycle due 28 August – provisional tax instalment payable on the new six-monthly cycle due on 28 April. GST-registered taxpayers who account for GST and provisional tax on a six-monthly basis who cease to be registered for GST will revert back to paying provisional tax three times a year, with effect from the date they ceased GST. 16 Example 2: Ceasing GST – change in provisional tax due dates Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr Cease GST 1 st 2 nd 3 rd payment payment payment Kathryn is registered for GST on a six-monthly basis and has a March balance date for income tax. She pays provisional tax twice a year, on 28 th of October and April. Kathryn ceases being registered on 20 September. From this date onwards she begins to pay provisional tax three times a year. She will continue to make the payment due on 28 October (relating to the six-month period April to October) and will also be liable for provisional tax payments on the 20 th of January and the 28 th of April. Taxpayers who start up a business part-way through a year will not be required to make a provisional tax payment if they do so within the period of 30 days before the instalment date and more than 30 days before the next instalment date. Provisional tax based on GST taxable supplies – ratio option At present, provisional taxpayers calculate provisional tax either by basing their payments on 105% of last year’s residual income tax liability or by estimating their current year’s residual income tax liability. To enable taxpayers to base provisional tax payments on their cashflow, a new provisional tax calculation method is being introduced. It is expected to benefit taxpayers with seasonal income or fluctuating income. Taxpayers who meet the qualifying criteria will be able to base their provisional tax payments on a percentage of GST taxable supplies for each two- monthly taxable period. It was originally proposed that six-monthly GST taxpayers would be eligible to use this proposal. However, it was decided that reducing the number of payments would provide too great a gap between when the income is earned and the calculation and payment of the tax to assist in tax cashflow management. The proposal was therefore limited to monthly and two-monthly GST payers. The measure will be voluntary as it may not benefit all businesses, owing to their circumstances. Taxpayers should seek expert advice or satisfy themselves as to whether they would benefit from using this provisional tax calculation method. Taxpayers will qualify for this proposal if: • they are GST-registered; • they are liable for provisional tax (residual income tax exceeds $2,500) and their prior year’s residual income tax liability is $150,000 or less; • they pay both GST and provisional tax in their own right; 17 • their ratio is between 0% and 100%; and • they pay GST on a two-monthly basis. The ratio is determined by a taxpayer’s residual income tax liability for the previous tax year divided by the previous year’s GST taxable supplies. The resulting ratio is then applied to each two-monthly taxable supplies figure to determine the amount of provisional tax payable. Monthly GST payers will add together their current and previous month’s taxable supplies figure and apply the ratio to this amount to calculate the provisional tax due. A business could adjust for large asset sales of over $1,000 or 5% of its taxable supplies for the last 12 months. The adjustment could apply to the current period’s taxable supplies figure and/or the ratio that applies in the following year. The business would elect to use this option either in writing or by phone at the beginning of the income year, before its first provisional tax payment is due. If a business elects to use the GST ratio option and subsequently elects out before its first provisional tax instalment, it could still be safe harboured. Taxpayers are required to exit the scheme during the year if they: • cease being registered for GST; • fail to maintain the same IRD number for both GST and income tax; or • enter into the scheme and then, following a reassessment of their income tax return, fail to meet the qualification criteria. Taxpayers who exit the scheme part-way through the year will be required to advise the Commissioner in writing or by phone and estimate their provisional tax for the rest of the year. Businesses that adopt the GST ratio method will be treated the same as a safe-harbour provisional taxpayer and will not be subject to use-of-money interest on provisional tax payments while they are using the GST ratio. Taxpayers will not be penalised for underpaying provisional tax if they have correctly used the ratio and GST figures at the time of filing. However, if they exit the GST ratio during the year they will be subject to use-of-money interest on any outstanding balances from the date they cease being in the ratio. This ensures that taxpayers cannot move between the ratio and safe harbour rules in order to reduce their tax liability. Late payment penalties will be imposed for non-payment of provisional tax by the due dates, and shortfall penalties will apply for tax shortfalls that result from not using the correct GST figures or ratio. For taxpayers who fail to file a return and pay, the provisional tax penalties will be calculated on the prior period’s provisional tax liability or, when this is not available, the prior year’s residual income tax figure divided by the number of provisional payments for the current year. 18 Example 3: GST ratio method Adrian sells vintage car parts and is liable for both provisional tax and GST. His tax year finishes on 31 March. He meets all the qualifying criteria to use the ratio calculation method. Adrian is a two- monthly GST payer and decides to base his provisional tax on his GST taxable supplies starting in 2007-2008 income year. Adrian’s residual income tax and taxable supplies figures for the 2006-07 year were $50,000 and $453,000 respectively. By dividing the residual income tax figure by taxable supplies, we get the ratio of 0.11 (50,000/453,000=0.11). This ratio must be applied to each of Adrian’s GST period’s taxable supplies to determine the amount of provisional tax payable. Adrian’s taxable supplies for his first GST period (April and May 2007) amount to $13,000 and his provisional tax liability for that period will be $1,430 (13,000\*0.11=$1,430). His provisional tax payment of $1,430 will be due on 28 June 2007 along with his GST. Adrian must use the same GST ratio to calculate his provisional tax liability for the other five GST periods. The GST ratio method will also apply to consolidated groups provided the group meets the qualifying criteria. If a company joins a group that uses the ratio (assuming the group still qualifies), then the group’s ratio will be adjusted to take account of the prior year’s residual income tax and taxable supplies figures of the new company. If a company leaves the consolidated group part-way through an income year, then the company will have to estimate its provisional tax for the remainder of the year. If a company that uses the GST ratio joins a group that does not use the ratio, the group cannot begin to use the GST ratio part-way through the year. 19 Subsidy for payroll agents 20 21 SUBSIDY FOR PAYROLL AGENTS (Clauses 119, 143(28), (32) and (69), 155(19), (20), and (28), 188, and 189) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces a legislative framework that will enable the government to subsidise the voluntary use of PAYE intermediaries by small businesses. The subsidy will be paid by Inland Revenue to intermediaries acting for small employers 2 once the intermediary files Employer Monthly Schedules, pays tax and social policy deductions, and makes a claim for the subsidy correctly and in the prescribed format. To protect the integrity of the tax system, intermediaries who want to claim the subsidy will need to meet particular administrative standards and have a good record of meeting tax obligations (to become “listed PAYE intermediaries”). Application date The machinery needed to list PAYE intermediaries will come into effect on the date of assent and the subsidy can be paid for pay periods beginning on or after 1 April 2006. Key features The main change is a new subpart NBB in the Income Tax Act 2004 which will outline the: • criteria payroll agents have to meet in order to be eligible for the subsidy; • reasons the Commissioner can revoke listing and the administrative process for doing so; • obligations on listed PAYE intermediaries; • process and conditions for claiming the subsidy; and • consequences of when employers and listed PAYE intermediaries terminate their arrangement with each other. “Listed PAYE intermediary” and “listed PAYE intermediary claim form” will become defined terms in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Amendments are being made to the definition of “tax” and “tax position” in the TAA 1994. Section 185 is being amended to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to pay the subsidy out of a Crown Account, and new sections 185C and 185D establish the account and specify how it should be used. 2 The subsidy will be payable for up to five employees of a small employer. Small employers are employers who are only required to file monthly. 22 Accreditation as listed PAYE intermediary and revocation of accreditation New section NBB 2 sets out the criteria to be used by the Commissioner to list intermediaries eligible to receive a subsidy. Generally, they will have to be an accredited PAYE intermediary and have a good record of meeting their own tax obligations and any PAYE obligations for people they have acted for as agents. They must also have administrative and information technology systems needed to meet their obligations. Those seeking to be listed must also inform employers they contract with that Inland Revenue does not guarantee payments made by them to employees of the employer, nor is Inland Revenue responsible for any services they provide to the employer. The Commissioner will not list an applicant if doing so is inconsistent with the duty to protect the integrity of the tax system. Accreditation will be for a specified period. The criteria and process for revocation are set out in new section NBB 4. Listing will be revoked if an intermediary: • loses PAYE intermediary status; • does not comply with its obligations as a listed PAYE intermediary; • ceases to meet the criteria for listing; or • does not file claim forms correctly. The Commissioner is required to give a 30-day warning before listing can be revoked, setting out the reasons for the intended revocation. If the intermediary does not resolve those matters within that time the Commissioner will give notice of revocation, which will take effect 14 days after the date of that notice. Obligations on listed PAYE intermediaries A new section NBB 3 outlines the obligations on listed PAYE intermediaries. They are required to maintain their status as PAYE intermediaries, meet their obligations as PAYE intermediaries and continue to meet the criteria for listing. In addition, they need to maintain administrative and information technology systems to correctly return claim forms and to keep records so that information on claim forms can be verified. Claiming the subsidy New sections NBB 5 and NBB 6 set out the administrative process for claiming the subsidy and its payment by the Commissioner. The listed PAYE intermediary is required to file a claim form (a PAYE intermediary claim form) in a prescribed format, setting out information needed to calculate the amount of the subsidy. It must be filed within one month of the date of filing the employer monthly schedule to which the claim relates. The Commissioner has powers to amend a claim form and is required to give notice of amendments. Any underpayments or overpayments that arise because a claim form has been amended must be paid within 30 days of the Commissioner’s notice. The Commissioner is required to give intermediaries notice of the subsidy paid and information which can be used to resolve any differences between the amount claimed and what was paid. Such differences could arise, for example, if the intermediary is unaware that the employer is no longer a small employer and therefore is ineligible for the subsidy. 23 To provide flexibility in the way that the subsidy is calculated, the formula will be specified by regulation rather than in legislation. The Commissioner has the power to withhold the subsidy if the intermediary has not met its obligations under the PAYE rules or if the claim form is incorrect. General administrative issues New section NBB 7 sets out the administrative process to be followed when an arrangement between an employer and intermediary is terminated. Fourteen days notice to each other and the Commissioner is required. Funds held by the intermediary are required to be handled as though the arrangement is still in place. Amendments to the definition of “tax” and “tax position” in the Tax Administration Act 1994 mean that the normal rules in relation to audit and record-keeping will apply and that shortfall penalties will apply to the way that claims are calculated. However, late payment and late filing penalties will not apply to the claim, nor will use-of- money interest. Background The amendments are intended to implement the first phase of a compliance cost- reduction measure outlined, in September 2003, in Making tax easier for small businesses by providing a subsidy to payroll agents who meet a variety of payroll obligations imposed by various government agencies on small employers. Its aim is to encourage small employers to outsource their compliance obligations so they can focus their efforts on their businesses. The first phase deals with PAYE-related obligations and, because PAYE obligations form the bulk of payroll-related compliance costs, this is a priority for the government. As well as compliance cost reductions, efficiency benefits are expected to flow from specialisation and greater use of information technology. Administrative benefits include improvements in the quality, timeliness and accuracy of tax returns and payments received by Inland Revenue. 24 25 Fringe benefit tax 26 27 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (Clauses 14 to 16, 24 to 33, 40, 81, 121 to 132, 143, 145, and 148) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 give effect to a set of changes to fringe benefit tax (FBT). The changes arise from a review of FBT and were signalled in the government discussion document, Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits, released in December 2003. They are designed to reduce compliance costs and remove anomalies in the rules while maintaining the objectives of FBT. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2006 or, if an employer pays FBT on an income year basis, from the income year beginning on or after that date. Key features Motor vehicles • The current rules require employers to calculate the benefit from an employer- provided motor vehicle based on its cost. Section ND 1A and Schedule 2 are being amended to allow owners an alternative option of calculating the benefit on the vehicle’s tax value for depreciation purposes (subject to a minimum value). • The current annual valuation rate applying to motor vehicles is 24% of their cost. Amendments to Schedule 2 will reduce this rate to 20% of cost (or from 6% to 5% if FBT is paid quarterly). The equivalent rate under the alternative tax value option will be 36% (or 9% if FBT is paid quarterly). This reduction is in recognition of lower real motoring costs since the rate was set, in the mid-1980s. • Other amendments to Schedule 2 will align the treatment of leased vehicles with that of owned vehicles so that the fringe benefit from a leased vehicle will be based on its cost or tax value, rather than as at present, its market value. This is to ensure that leases are not used to reduce the FBT liability. • Similarly, new section CX 6C will override the “suspension” of vehicle leases so that private use is treated as a fringe benefit. This provision is designed to overcome the problem of shareholder-employees avoiding FBT by leasing their own vehicles to their employers and “suspending” the leases when private use occurs through such arrangements as “nine-to-five” and “flip-flop” leases. • Currently, an FBT day is a calendar day and therefore begins at midnight, which can result in two days’ FBT liability being incurred when a vehicle is taken home overnight. New section ND 1AB will ensure that one day’s FBT is incurred in such instances, by allowing employers to elect the start time for an FBT day. An election will apply to all vehicles and normally last for two years. 28 Other changes • Section ND 1D is being amended to allow employers the additional option of using the relevant market interest rate as the benchmark for valuing the benefit from their loans to employees, in lieu of the current method of using the prescribed rate of interest. This rectifies the problem of the prescribed rate becoming out of date and fringe benefits arising even when the employer is charging an employee the market rate. The market rate is the rate the lender charges to other comparable groups of sufficient size on an arm’s-length basis. • Section ND 1Q is being amended to increase the minimum-value thresholds that have to be exceeded before unclassified fringe benefits are subject to FBT. The employee minimum value threshold is increased to $200 per quarter and the employer minimum value threshold is increased to $15,000 per annum. This change is designed to reduce compliance costs for employers who provide only small miscellaneous fringe benefits by keeping them out of the FBT net. • New section CX 18B will allow the private use of employer-owned or leased business tools to be exempt from FBT when tools are provided primarily for business purposes, as long as the cost price of each tool does not exceed $5,000. This exemption is intended to reduce compliance costs as it is difficult and costly for employers to monitor and value the private use of small items such as laptops and cellphones when they are provided primarily as business tools. • Currently, benefits that might arise as a result of employers carrying out their health and safety obligations (for example, health checks) can fall within the scope of FBT if they are not provided on the premises of the employer. There seems to be no good policy reason for this. New section CX 20B will allow these benefits to be exempt from FBT irrespective of whether the benefits are provided on or off the employer’s premises. • New section DC 15, in conjunction with new sections CE 11 and CX 15B and an amendment to section CE 5, will allow employees to claim an income tax deduction for income protection insurance premiums paid by their employer on their behalf. • Amendments to sections CX 20(1) and (2) extend the “on-premises” exemption to the premises of other companies in the same group when there is 66% or greater common ownership with the employer company. • Section OB 6 is being amended so the Income Tax Act’s general anti-avoidance rule also applies to FBT. • New section CX 27B and an amendment to section ND 1K clarify that FBT should not apply to benefits that arise when an employer secures bulk discounts or provides services to employees, provided the price paid for the goods or services is no less than those available to other comparable-sized groups on an arm’s-length basis unrelated to employment. • Section CX 21 is being amended to specifically exclude the provision of credit cards and other short-term credit facilities from the exemption that charities have from FBT. This will not apply when the aggregate value of the benefits in a year does not exceed 5% of an employee’s salary or wages. 29 • Section CX 17 is being amended to provide an exemption from FBT when an employer pays for a member of an employee’s family to travel to visit the employee. This exemption is limited to the amount that would have been exempt from FBT if the employee had made the visit. • An amendment to section CE 2 will clarify that share options cancelled in exchange for cash are a “disposal” and therefore covered by the employment income provisions of the Act. • Amendments to sections ND 2(3), ND 13 and ND 14 will provide more administrative flexibility in relation to elections to pay FBT on a quarterly, annual or income-year basis. An election to pay FBT quarterly will be able to be made at the time of filing irrespective of whether FBT is actually paid, and an election to change to paying FBT annually or on an income-year basis 3 will be able to be made by telephone rather than having to be in writing. • Another amendment to section ND 14 will ensure that when a small close company with a non-standard balance date chooses to pay FBT on an income- year basis rather than a quarterly basis it is required to undertake the section ND 10 quarterly payment calculation in relation to any incomplete year that arises by virtue of the election. • New section ND 8(3) will allow employers that cease to employ staff during the year, and have no intention of replacing them, the option of applying the 64% FBT rate rather than the multi-rate for their final quarterly return. Background FBT was introduced in 1985 in response to a growing trend in the 1980s to provide in-kind benefits in lieu of cash remuneration. By taxing fringe benefits, FBT was intended to buttress the PAYE system so that all forms of remuneration were taxed equally. Although FBT is in effect a tax on employee benefits, for compliance cost- reduction reasons liability to pay the tax falls on employers. Although there have been specific changes to the FBT rules, the FBT system has remained largely unchanged over the past 20 years. A review began in October 2002 when the government called for taxpayers to identify areas they wished to be addressed, and a discussion document, Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits, was released in December 2003. Over 60 submissions were received, and officials undertook specific consultation with key submitters. The proposed legislative changes are the outcome of this process. Detailed analysis Motor vehicles The issue most frequently raised in submissions concerned the valuation of motor vehicles for FBT. 3 An income basis will differ from an annual basis when the employer has other than a 31 March balance date. 30 Valuation basis A motor vehicle fringe benefit is calculated on a quarterly or annual basis by taking a set percentage (currently 24% per annum), which reflects the costs of motoring, and multiplying it by the original cost of the vehicle. The result is reduced by the number of days in which the vehicle is not available for private use. Some taxpayers perceive this approach to be unfair because the FBT liability remains constant while the vehicle declines in value over time. To overcome this perception problem, subsections ND 1A(1B) and ND 1A(1C) are being added, and Part A of Schedule 2 is being amended. These changes enable employers to use a motor vehicle’s depreciated value (tax value) as the basis for valuing the fringe benefit, but at a higher rate than under the cost price option. A higher rate is needed to produce the same overall tax result as the rate takes into consideration all the costs, including depreciation, over the average period a vehicle is held privately (five years). Expressing these costs as a percentage of a lower base results in a higher percentage. However, the overall FBT liability, while higher in earlier years, will be lower in later years. In particular, the tax value option is useful to those employers who hold vehicles for more than five years, as the current formula tends to over-value the benefit in such cases. There is a minimum tax value ($8,333) to reflect the on-going benefits that an employer-provided vehicle affords even when it has depreciated significantly. This is because the employee still continues to save the costs of running a vehicle. The minimum tax value equates to cost savings of $3,000 per annum given the proposed 36% valuation rate. “Tax value” is defined in relation to subpart EE (depreciation), and is the depreciated value in the relevant quarter or year as determined under that subpart. The valuation rate for motor vehicles The method used in the early 1980s to determine the current valuation rate of 24% was reviewed using current motoring costs and car prices. This showed that in real terms, the cost of motoring had declined significantly over the past 20 years and, therefore, using a rate of 24% of a vehicle’s cost overstates the value of the benefit. Amendments to Schedule 2, Part A(1) reduce the rate to 20%. This reduction, which was signalled in the discussion document and well supported by submissions, should provide employers with a significant saving in FBT. The equivalent percentage that uses tax value as the base is 36% (see Schedule 2). Leased vehicles aligned with owned vehicles FBT on leased vehicles is assessed on the vehicle’s market value at the beginning of the lease. In practice, leasing a vehicle can produce a lower FBT impost because many leases are being structured so that they become renewable each year, resulting in a new (lower) market value annually and a commensurate reduction in FBT. 31 An amendment to Schedule 2, Part A(1) is designed to help ensure that the FBT base is not undermined and that the choice between leasing and owning is not driven by the tax outcome. Schedule 2, Part A(1)(b) provides lessees with the same options as proposed for owners – in other words, a rate of 20% on the cost price or a rate of 36% on the tax value of the vehicle. To reduce compliance costs for lessees, Schedule 2, Part A(7) requires the lessor to disclose to the lessee for FBT purposes the relevant cost price or tax value of the vehicle to the lessor. No transitional arrangements are proposed for leases that are part-way through their term when the legislation is enacted, meaning that the changes will generally apply to such leases from 1 April 2006. There are no transitional arrangements because the proposed reduction in the overall rate to 20% helps to reduce any extra FBT that would have to be paid on these leases and the change has been signalled well in advance. The other change in relation to leases is the new section CX 6C, which further aligns leased vehicles with owned vehicles by addressing “nine-to-five” and “flip-flop” leases. Over the past decade an increasing number of employees (usually shareholder-employees) have entered into arrangements to lease their own vehicles to their employers for business use during specified hours (usually 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) in exchange for a market rental. The objective of the leases is to enable the employees to enjoy private use of the vehicles when they are not being used for business purposes. Because the leases are in effect “suspended” when the private use occurs, the argument is made that there is no FBT liability. Section CX 6C is designed to override this “suspension” for FBT purposes so the employee is deemed to receive a fringe benefit. The outcome is then the same as if the employer had either leased the vehicle from a company specialising in leasing vehicles to businesses, or purchased the vehicle, and in both cases made it available to the employee for their private use with the consequent FBT liability. Employers able to elect start time of an FBT day If a vehicle is available for private use at any time during the day, it is considered to be available for the whole day. This means that if an employee takes a vehicle home at night to take it to another work site the following morning, the vehicle is regarded as being available for private use for two days. New section ND 1AB means an FBT day is now defined as any 24-hour period rather than a calendar day. For example, an employer may choose to begin the FBT day at 6 p.m. – in which case any private travel between 6 p.m. on a particular calendar day and 6 p.m. the following calendar day would be treated as being within the same day. An election applies across all the employer’s vehicles and lasts for two years, although section ND 1AB(6) enables the Commissioner to accept a change if an employer can show that there has been a material change in circumstance. If an employer makes no election, the current treatment of a calendar day would apply. 32 Other issues Loans to employees The value of a fringe benefit arising from an employee loan is the amount by which interest calculated according to the FBT prescribed rate of interest exceeds actual interest paid. The prescribed rate is set by Order in Council before each quarter begins but uses data from the previous quarter. This means the prescribed rate can become out of date, resulting in fringe benefits arising even when current market rates of interest are charged. Accordingly, section ND 1D is being amended to allow employers the option of using market rates rather than the prescribed rates. The market rate is, in effect, the rate that the lender charges other comparable groups of a sufficient size on an arm’s-length basis unrelated to employment. Section ND 1D(1) expresses this in terms of the rate that would apply to a borrower belonging to a group of persons to whom a loan of the kind provided to the employee is offered when the group: • is assessed as having a comparable credit risk to the group to which the employee belongs; • is employed by a person not associated with the employee’s employer; and • is of a sufficient size to ensure a transaction is on an arm’s-length basis. An election lasts for at least two years. Section ND 1D(2) requires employers to give one years’ notice of an intended switch between using the prescribed rate and market rate, to deter “flip-flopping” between the options to get the lowest FBT rate. Minimum thresholds Employers are currently not required to return FBT on miscellaneous fringe benefits that total $75 or less per employee per quarter, provided the total value of these kinds of benefits to all employees does not exceed $450 per quarter. This exemption does not apply to fringe benefits such as motor vehicles and loans, which are specifically listed in sections CX 6 to CX 15B. Section ND 1Q is being amended to substantially increase the employee minimum threshold to $200 per quarter and the employer minimum threshold to $15,000 per annum. The revised employer threshold has been set to effectively exclude miscellaneous fringe benefits provided by small and medium-sized businesses (defined by the Ministry of Economic Development as having 20 employees or less). Raising the thresholds generally will lower compliance costs for employers who provide only small miscellaneous fringe benefits (such as Christmas hampers) as these benefits will then fall out of the FBT net. 33 Business tools It is difficult and costly for employers to monitor and value the private use of small items such as laptops and cellphones when they are provided by employers primarily as business tools. If they are used away from the employer’s premises, the currently available on-premises exemption will not apply. As these tools are mainly for business use, any private benefit will likely be incidental. The difficulty in measuring any private benefits that do arise effectively precludes them from being encompassed in the de minimis thresholds. New section CX 18B specifically exempts the private use (and availability for private use) of business tools from FBT, subject to a limit of $5,000 per tool. A business tool kept at the employee’s home rather than being returned to the employer’s premises will still qualify for the exemption if the employee performs a significant portion of his or her employment duties at home. A business tool is to be defined in section OB 1 as a portable item that is used in the performance by an employee of work duties, and therefore does not include a motor vehicle. Specific exemption of employer health and safety-related benefits Currently, benefits that might arise as a result of an employer carrying out health and safety obligations can fall within the scope of FBT, depending on where they are provided. If they occur on the premises of the employer the benefits are exempt; if not, they may be taxed. There seems to be no good policy reason for basing the exemption on location. Accordingly, new section CX 20B provides a specific exemption for the minor benefits arising from employer health and safety-related obligations, irrespective of where they are provided. To qualify for the exemption, the health and safety-related benefits must arise from responses aimed at eliminating workplace hazards under the Health and Safety in Employment Act. The exemption does not extend to a more general exemption of employer-paid health insurance premiums or gym membership fees. The “on-premises” exemption The exemption from FBT for benefits provided on an employer’s premises does not necessarily extend to premises of another member of a group of companies. This can produce inconsistent outcomes. For example, an employee can be employed by one member company, but receive a benefit on the premises of another member company while on a secondment. This benefit would currently be subject to FBT. In recognition that entities within a group may operate more like a single economic entity, the general “on-premises” exemption in section CX 20 is being extended to include the premises of other companies in the same group who share 66% or greater common ownership with the employer company. 34 Income protection insurance The FBT treatment of income protection insurance policies should put the employee in the same position as if the employer had paid the employee a cash amount, and the employee had then paid the premium directly. Currently this is not the case, because employees who pay the premium directly can be eligible for a deduction for the premium paid, on the basis that it is to ensure future income. Employees do not, however, receive a deduction when the employer is liable to pay the premium on their behalf. To ensure that the overall tax outcome is the same in both cases, new section DC 15 allows employees to claim an income tax deduction for income protection insurance premiums to the extent of their employer’s contribution towards the premium if the employer is liable to pay the contribution. There are several consequential amendments. An amendment to section CE 5 excludes the premium amount paid by the employer from being expenditure on account of an employee; a new section CE 11 clarifies that an amount derived under the policy is income to the employee; and new section CX 15B states that the amount of the premium that the employer is liable to pay is a fringe benefit. Application of general anti-avoidance rule FBT has its own anti-avoidance provision in the Income Tax Act. However, unlike many other specific anti-avoidance rules, it is not also bolstered by the Act’s general anti-avoidance rule (section BG 1), which enables a tax avoidance arrangement to be voided and any associated tax advantage to be counteracted. The omission arises because of the wording in section BG 1, when read in conjunction with section OB 6 (definition of income tax). Section BG 1 voids arrangements for income tax purposes but section OB 6 specifically excludes FBT from the definition of income tax. To rectify this oversight, section OB 6 is being amended to make FBT income tax for the purposes of section BG 1. A consequential change is also being made to the specific FBT anti-avoidance rule. The new section GC 17B will enable the Commissioner to alter a person’s tax liability when an arrangement involving FBT is voided by section BG 1. This change will mean that arrangements that survive the specific anti-avoidance rule on a technicality might still be caught as avoidance. Bulk discounts and services to employees When an employer enters into an arrangement for a third party to provide an employee with a benefit, the employer is still regarded as having provided the benefit and is liable for the FBT on it. It is questionable, however, whether a bulk discount for staff should be a fringe benefit because it is provided to them as employees when a comparable discount could be available to the employees if they were members of some other group unrelated to their employment. 35 Accordingly, new section CX 27B ensures that FBT will not apply to benefits that arise when an employer secures bulk discounts for employees – provided those discounts are available to other groups of a comparable size, who have negotiated the discounts on an arm’s-length basis unrelated to employment. A similar issue has arisen with the valuation of services in terms of what constitutes an arm’s-length price. An amendment to section ND 1K reflects the concept of the price charged to other groups of a comparable size, to whom the services are offered on an arm’s-length basis in this case too. Any price charged below this level would be subject to FBT. 4 Changes to charities exemption Cash remuneration to employees of charitable organisations is taxed through the PAYE system, as for other employees. Non-cash benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations are, however, exempt from FBT, other than when the employees are employed in a charity’s business. New subsection CX 21(2) will further restrict the exemption by specifically excluding credit cards and other short-term credit facilities when the aggregate value of the benefits to an employee in a year from the facilities exceeds 5% of the employee’s salary or wages. This change is designed to reduce the potential for charity employers to exploit the exemption by providing a significant proportion of employees’ remuneration in the form of fringe benefits. This is more likely to occur if a benefit is readily substitutable for cash and a wide range of goods and services can be purchased. Subsection CX 21(3) provides a definition of what constitutes a credit card or short- term credit facility. Basically, the focus is on arrangements that enable an employee to charge non-business related purchases or hire costs to an account that the employer is liable to pay. It does not include employment-related loans under section CX 9. New section ND 1IB indicates that the value of the benefit in these cases would be the cost to the employer of the non-business purchases of goods and services plus any interest incurred in relation to those purchases and, if a credit card is provided solely for non-business use, any account and service fees associated with the card. Employer-paid family travel If an employer pays for an employee to return home from out of town to visit his or her family, this payment may currently be exempt from FBT. This is on the basis that the payment removes a need to pay the employee a reimbursement allowance for additional travel costs the employee incurs because of a temporary change in the employee’s place of work. For example, the employee may have been seconded overseas. If the employer incurs the cost of a family member visiting the employee instead, the FBT outcome should arguably be the same and the benefit should be exempt. 4 This approach is also used in valuing low-interest loans (see earlier discussion). 36 Accordingly, new section CX 17(2) will exempt from FBT the amount paid by an employer for an employee’s spouse/partner or relatives to travel to visit the employee. This exemption is limited to the amount that would have been exempt from FBT if the employee had made the visit, and been eligible for a tax-free reimbursement of travel costs. Section OB 1 is being amended so that paragraph (a) of the definition of “relative” applies to section CX 17. That definition covers blood relatives within the second degree of relationship and those married to them, and adopted children, including those of persons within the first degree of relationship. Share options cancelled in exchange for cash Share options provided to an employee by an employer are treated as employment income, with the value of the benefit being the difference between the value of shares on the date of acquisition – that is, on the exercise of the options – and the amount paid by the employee for them. To avoid double taxation, the FBT rules specifically exclude such benefits (see section CX 4). Doubt has arisen over whether the treatment of options that are cancelled in exchange for cash rather than exercised and converted into shares would be treated as either employment income or a fringe benefit. This is because of an argument that a cancellation does not constitute a disposal. The policy intent is to treat the cancellation of a share option the same as if the share had been disposed of. The reality is that the employee is receiving a payment for some form of benefit in this situation. To rectify this position, an amendment is being made to section CE 2 to clarify that the cancellation of share options in exchange for cash is a disposal of rights in terms of section CE 2(3), and is employment income of the employee. Administrative simplifications to choosing when to pay FBT These remedial changes are aimed at providing greater administrative flexibility and lower compliance costs. An amendment to section ND 2(3) will enable an employer to choose to pay FBT on a quarterly basis at the time of filing irrespective of whether or not FBT has to be paid. Also, through amendments to sections ND 13 and 14, an election to pay FBT annually or on an income year basis rather than quarterly will be able to be made by telephone rather than having to be in writing. Non-standard balance date taxpayers and income year FBT elections Small close companies are allowed to file and pay FBT on an income year basis. A technical issue has been identified concerning such companies with non-standard balance dates who elect to switch from paying FBT on a quarterly to an income year basis. An election should apply from the beginning of the next income year so that all the necessary steps relating to the last year of quarterly payment, including the end-of- year multi-rate square-up, take place before the election applies. It appears possible, however, for a company with a non-standard balance date to switch from a standard tax year to its income year part-way through a year and therefore avoid the end of year square-up, thus paying less FBT than it ought to. The Act does not include any provisions dealing with any partially completed year. 37 To rectify this situation a new subsection ND 14(2)B will require that in the case of a small close company the employer must undertake the section ND 10 final quarterly payment calculation in relation to any incomplete year that arises by virtue of the election. Employers ceasing to employ staff Employers ceasing to employ staff during the year with no intention of replacing them will be given the option of applying the flat rate of 64% in their final return rather than having to undertake the multi-rate calculation. The new section ND 8(3) gives effect to this change. Employers choosing this option will still be required to undertake a square-up in that the 64% rate will be applied to fringe benefits provided from the beginning of the year up to the time staff ceased to be employed (with a credit for FBT already paid during the year). In other words, the 64% rate does not apply to just the last quarter. The difference from the current approach is that the employer will not need to calculate the appropriate multi-rates in relation to the employees. 38 39 Taxation of securities lending transactions 40 41 TAXATION OF SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS (Clauses 13, 18, 35, 36, 39, 48, 50, 51, 63, 64, 67, 82, 91, 93, 104, 105, 107 to 109, 133 to 140, 143, 153, and 157) Summary of proposed amendments The tax treatment of securities lending transactions will be clarified and reformed by: • introducing specific securities lending rules to allow the taxation of “qualifying” share lending transactions on the basis of economic substance; and • strengthening the tax rules to ensure that non-qualifying share lending transactions do not give rise to an unintended fiscal cost. These changes will give greater consistency to the tax treatment of securities lending transactions and the treatment of other commercial transactions such as finance leases and hire-purchase agreements. The amendments will also give taxpayers more certainty about how these transactions should be taxed. Finally, the changes will protect the tax base by preventing taxpayers from using securities lending transactions to trade imputation credits and circumvent the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules. Application date The securities lending amendments will apply for income years beginning on or after the date of enactment. The associated base maintenance amendments will apply from the date that the amending legislation is enacted. Key features The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 will introduce specific securities lending rules to tax “qualifying” share lending transactions on the basis of economic substance rather than legal form. They will also strengthen the imputation and NRWT rules to ensure that non-qualifying share lending transactions do not give rise to an unintended fiscal cost. Share-lending arrangements Returning securities transfers (Taxed as loans) (Subject to the new imputation and NRWT rules) Scope of the proposed securities lending rules 42 The new rules revolve around the definition of a returning securities transfer. A returning securities transfer is an arrangement in which: • a person (the share supplier) disposes of a share which is listed on a recognised exchange or is ordinarily available for subscription or purchase by the public; • the person who obtains the share (the share user) agrees to transfer the original shares or replacement shares back to the share supplier; and • the share user makes replacement payments to pass on the rewards of ownership for any distributions paid on the original shares during the period of the transaction. This can include the value of imputation credits and NRWT which would have otherwise been payable. Returning securities transfers which meet a number of criteria (known as share- lending arrangements) will be taxed on the basis of their economic substance rather than legal form. This means that they will not be treated as a taxable disposal. A “share-lending arrangement” is defined as a returning securities transfer where: • the term of the transaction is no longer than 12 months; • the original shares or replacement shares are transferred back to the share supplier; • the share user maintains an imputation credit account (ICA); • the share user pays withholding tax required under section NF 2(1)(g) in respect of any replacement payment; • the share user transfers to the share supplier any rights and options, or equivalent rights and options, granted or received in relation to the original shares during the period of the transaction; • the terms of the securities lending transaction are ordinary commercial conditions which are consistent with those that would apply between parties negotiating at arm’s length; and • the transaction is entered into in an income year after the new rules take effect. A replacement share is a share received as a replacement for an original share disposed of under a returning securities transfer. It must confer the same rights and impose the same obligations on the holder as the original share. If a share user defaults on a share lending transaction and the lender uses the collateral provided as part of the transaction to purchase identical securities in the market, then these will constitute replacement shares and the transaction will continue to qualify. A replacement payment is a transfer of value (in the form of rights or options or other valuable consideration) under a returning securities transfer. It is intended to be economically equivalent to the value of the distributions which the share supplier would have been entitled to receive had they continued to hold the original share over the term of the returning securities transfer. This includes compensation for imputation credits or for NRWT which would otherwise apply or be paid. 43 Share-lending arrangements will be subject to the ordinary taxpayer record-keeping requirements. In general, this means keeping sufficient records to readily ascertain a taxpayer’s tax position. Inland Revenue allows records to be kept in both paper and electronic form. For the purposes of recording share-lending agreements, it is expected that a copy of the master lending agreement, together with electronic recording of individual transactions would be permitted. Commissioner discretion To ensure that a minor breach of the qualification criteria does not disqualify commercial transactions from the new rules, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be given a discretion with respect to the term of qualifying transactions and what constitutes a replacement share. Treatment of returning securities transfers which are not share-lending arrangements The second key part of the securities lending proposals is the introduction of new imputation and NRWT rules. The securities lending rules are designed to ensure that imputation credits remain with the economic owner of securities and that NRWT cannot be circumvented. However, because the rules only apply to qualifying transactions, taxpayers could structure transactions outside the qualification criteria. Therefore new imputation and NRWT rules are required to bolster the securities lending rules. The rules governing the treatment of returning securities transfers are designed to complement existing anti-avoidance provisions. They will apply to returning securities transfers which do not qualify as share-lending arrangements. The new base maintenance rules will apply where: • A share user receives imputation credits as the holder of an original share acquired under a returning securities transfer. • A share user makes a replacement payment to a non-resident which is intended to be economically equivalent to a reward of ownership which would be taxable in New Zealand if derived by the share supplier. Where the new rules apply, the tax benefit obtained will be cancelled by a debit to the ICA account of the share user (if the tax benefit is in the form of imputation credits), or by denying the deduction for the replacement payment (if the tax benefit relates to the non-payment of NRWT). 44 Background Securities lending involves the lending of securities to another party for a fee and was developed to allow brokers to transact in securities in which they have a shortfall. Securities lending also provides a relatively risk-free way for larger holders of shares, such as banks, insurance companies, and funds managers, to increase their overall portfolio returns. Internationally, securities lending represents a substantial part of the daily settlement value in many transaction systems and can play an important role in facilitating market liquidity. New Zealand does not have an onshore securities lending market, at least in part owing to the current tax treatment of these transactions. New Zealand, unlike many other jurisdictions, does not have special tax rules for securities lending. For New Zealand tax purposes, these transactions are taxed on the basis of legal form (a sale of shares) rather than economic substance (a loan), meaning that entering into a securities lending transaction is a taxable event. There are a number of problems with the current New Zealand tax treatment of securities lending transactions: • It is inconsistent with international trends. • It is inconsistent with the economic and accounting treatment of these transactions. • It is inconsistent with the treatment of other commercial transactions. There are also base maintenance concerns with respect to the current tax treatment of securities lending transactions. There is evidence that securities lending transactions are being used to trade imputation credits, circumvent the NRWT rules and take advantage of the absence of specific tax rules in this area in New Zealand. The income tax rules do already include anti-avoidance provisions which may apply to transactions involving transfers of securities. In particular, the current imputation anti-avoidance rule (section GC 22) was designed to ensure that the imputation credits are allocated consistently between shareholders on a basis that reflects actual rights to company cashflows. It is aimed at arrangements where the predominant underlying purpose is to transfer imputation credits from one party who is unable to use those credits to another party who is able to use them. There is no question that a “tax advantage” arises from an imputation trading arrangement. However, because it can be difficult to determine whether this tax advantage is more than a merely incidental purpose of the arrangement, more certainty is required to protect the tax base. Proposed changes to the tax treatment of securities lending were set out in the government discussion document, Taxing securities lending transactions: substance over form, released in November 2004. Detailed analysis The intention of the proposed securities lending rules is to treat a share-lending arrangement as a loan for tax purposes rather than a taxable disposal. To achieve this, a number of changes are required to the Income Tax Act 2004. 45 Impact of qualifying Under new section CX 44B, consideration received by a share supplier when disposing of a share under a share-lending agreement will be excluded income. Similarly, under new section CX 44C, when the share user returns either the original share or a replacement share, the consideration received by the share user is excluded income. As a result of these amendments a share-lending arrangement should not be a taxable event as would otherwise occur under sections CB 1 to CB 4. “Cost” of borrowed securities A share-lending arrangement would normally be subject to the financial arrangement rules. However, in order to simplify the tax treatment, a change to section EW 5 will mean that a share-lending arrangement is an excepted financial arrangement. A share supplier will continue to be able to claim a tax deduction for the original cost of acquiring the borrowed shares. However, as the share supplier is effectively treated as never having disposed of the shares amendments are required to ensure that a double deduction is not permitted for the cost of the returned securities. New section DB 12B will prevent a second tax deduction being claimed for the cost of reacquiring the original share or a replacement share. The share user will be able to claim a deduction for the cost of a share acquired under a share-lending arrangement. However, when the shares are returned to the share supplier, the share user will derive taxable income equivalent to the cost claimed on acquisition of the original shares (new section CD 44). The cost of any replacement shares will still be deductible (new section DB 12C). These sections ensure that the cost of the borrowed shares to the share user is the cost of the replacement securities. Section CH 1 is being amended to ensure that entering into a share-lending arrangement does not result in a tax adjustment from a change in the value of excepted financial arrangements “on hand”. When a share supplier enters into a share- lending arrangement the disposal of the shares would normally result in a reduction in the value of excepted financial arrangements. This is being countered by allowing the share supplier to include in the closing value of excepted financial arrangements the right to acquire original shares or replacement shares. Section DB 40 is being similarly amended to include the value of a right to acquire an original share or replacement share under a share-lending arrangement in the opening value of excepted financial arrangements. As a result of these changes, section EA 1 is being amended to include a right to acquire an original share or replacement share in the transactions covered by the excepted financial arrangement matching rules. Section ED 1 will be amended to provide that a right to acquire an original share or re-acquire an original share or replacement share under a share-lending arrangement is valued at cost. It is also necessary to switch off any section which would still recognise any of the “excluded” legs under the share-lending arrangement and otherwise apply a market value to these. For example, sections ED 2, EW 32 and GD 1. 46 Finally, new section EW 52B is inserted to ensure that any movement in the value of shares over the term of a share-lending arrangement is not picked up under the financial arrangement rules. Treatment of distributions If a distribution is paid on the original share during the term of the share-lending arrangement, the share supplier must receive a “replacement payment” from the share user. The aim of the replacement payment is to place the share supplier in the same tax position (as far as possible) as if they had received the actual distribution. The entity which issued the securities and any third-party purchaser of the shares should not be affected by the tax treatment of the share-lending arrangement. The replacement payment will, in most cases, be deductible to the share user. This includes the cost of the imputation credits attached to the replacement payment (new section DB 12E). New section CD 43 ensures that the payments will also be taxable to the share supplier. However, if the replacement payment relates to an amount which would not have been a taxable dividend if it had been received by the share supplier, such as a non-taxable bonus issue, the payment will not be taxable (new section CD 43) or tax deductible (new section DB 12D). Under the proposed rules, the share user will be required to maintain an ICA in order to attach credits to replacement payments. The share user can fund these credits either out of credits received on the underlying dividend (new section ME 6B), or where they have not received sufficient credits, by paying withholding tax. This payment will be a final tax made as part of the share user’s resident withholding tax return. It will not give rise to a withholding tax credit for the share supplier (amendment to section LD 3). Instead, it will give rise to a credit attached to the replacement payout (new section NF 8B). Credits received on any underlying dividend and subsequently attached to a replacement payment will not generate a tax credit for the share user (amendment to section LB 2). An amendment is being made to section ME 5 to record a debit to a share user’s ICA where they have received imputation credits on borrowed shares and subsequently attached these to a replacement payment. Credits received by a share supplier on a replacement payment are subject to the same treatment as normal imputation credits. An amendment is therefore being made to section ME 4 to allow credits attached to a replacement payment (either as a result of the share user passing on credits attached to the underlying dividend or from the share user paying withholding tax) to be entered into their ICA. Share users will also need to provide a statement to share suppliers similar to a dividend statement. The requirements for the statement will be set out in new section 30B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The changes for individual ICAs are replicated in the consolidated ICA rules. 47 Example: Fully imputed dividend A share supplier lends a New Zealand share to a share user. While the share user holds the original share a dividend of $67 plus $33 of imputation credits is paid. The share user is taxable on the gross dividend plus imputation credits. They make a replacement payment of $67 and attach $33 of imputation credits. This is fully deductible leaving them in a neutral position for tax purposes with respect to the distribution. No credit is available for the credits received on the underlying dividend and subsequently attached to the replacement payment. The share supplier is taxable on the replacement payment plus imputation credits. However, a tax credit is available for the imputation credit received on the replacement. This means (assuming a tax rate of 33%) that no further tax is payable by the share supplier. Example: Dividend with no imputation credits A share supplier lends a New Zealand share to a share user. The share user sells the share to a third party. During the term of the share-lending arrangement a dividend of $100 (nil imputation credits) is paid. The share user makes a replacement payment of $67 and attaches $33 of imputation credits. As the share user did not receive any credits on the underlying dividend, they are required to pay $33 of withholding tax to pay for these credits. However, the replacement payment and imputation credits are fully deductible, leaving them in a neutral position for tax purposes with respect to the distribution. The share supplier is taxable on the replacement payment plus imputation credits. However, a tax credit is available for the imputation credits received on the replacement payment. This means (assuming a tax rate of 33%) that no further tax is payable by the share supplier. There is no credit for the withholding tax as the share supplier received imputation credits instead. 48 Withholding tax As mentioned above, a share user under a share-lending arrangement is required to attach imputation credits to a replacement payment either by passing on credits received on the underlying dividend or by generating credits through paying withholding tax. To reduce compliance and administration costs, the withholding tax will be part of the resident withholding tax rules. The resident withholding tax rules are therefore being amended to apply to replacement payments made under share-lending arrangements (amendments to sections NF 1 and NF 4). A new formula is being inserted into section NF 2 to calculate the amount of withholding tax payable on share-lending arrangements. The formula will effectively require RWT to be paid for any amount of replacement payment not fully imputed by credits from the underlying dividend. The rate of withholding tax will be 33%. Amendments are being made to sections NF 2A, NF 2B, NF 2D and Schedule 14 to ensure this. Impact of ceasing to qualify Taxpayers will be required to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a share- lending arrangement at the start of a transaction and apply the new tax treatment from commencement. If a taxpayer mistakenly treats a transaction as qualifying for the securities lending rules when they should not have done so, the taxpayer will need to restate the entire tax treatment of the transaction. Use-of-money interest and penalties could apply depending on the particular circumstances that gave rise to an incorrect tax treatment being adopted. Returning securities transfers which are not share-lending arrangements The securities lending rules are designed to ensure that imputation credits remain with the economic owner of securities and that NRWT cannot be circumvented. This includes where transactions qualify as returning securities transfers but are not share- lending arrangements. Where the new rules apply, the tax benefit obtained will be cancelled. When the tax benefit is in the form of additional credits, this will occur by a debit to the ICA account of the share user (amendment to section ME 5). The debit will occur when a share user receives imputation credits on borrowed shares under a returning securities transfer which is not a share-lending arrangement. If the tax benefit relates to the non-payment of NRWT, it will be cancelled by denying a deduction for the replacement payment, as set out in new section DB 12D. The deduction will be denied where: • a share user makes a replacement payment under a returning securities transfer; • the share supplier is non-resident; 49 • the replacement payment is not assessable income of the share supplier; • the replacement payment is intended to be economically equivalent to a reward of ownership in relation to the original share that would be assessable income if derived by the share supplier; and • the transaction is not a share-lending arrangement. This is intended to deny a deduction where a share user makes a payment to a non- resident share supplier to compensate them, in whole or in part, for a dividend which would otherwise be subject to New Zealand NRWT. 50 51 Allocation of research and development tax deductions 52 53 ALLOCATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX DEDUCTIONS (Clauses 37, 38, 52 and 62) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments will allow taxpayers to allocate certain research and development (R&D) tax deductions to income years after the year in which the related expenditure (including a depreciation loss) is incurred. This means that deductions will not be lost if there is a shareholding change between when the expenditure is incurred and when the deduction is recognised by the taxpayer. This tax treatment will be optional. However, those who choose this approach must allocate R&D deductions against income resulting from R&D expenditure. Companies that bring in new equity investors will have better access to tax deductions for R&D expenditure under the proposed amendments. Technology companies, in particular, often have a long lead-in period in which they incur major expenditure before realising income from it. Under current law they can lose R&D tax deductions if they bring in new investors after their initial development stage. The changes will better suit the growth cycle of technology companies and remove a barrier to R&D investment by allowing R&D tax deductions to be matched with related income. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2005-06 income year. Key features The amendments will better match the timing of deductions for R&D expenditure (including depreciation losses) with the timing of income resulting from R&D expenditure. Current tax law can result in deductions for R&D expenditure being inappropriately lost when companies bring in new equity investors. The new treatment will not be affected by changes in shareholding arising from companies bringing in new investors. Amounts qualifying for new allocation treatment Three types of R&D tax deductions will qualify for the new treatment and therefore be able to be allocated to income years after the year in which the related expenditure or depreciation loss is incurred: • Deductions for expenditure covered by the main R&D deduction provision in section DB 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (proposed section DB 26(6B) of the Income Tax Act 2004). 54 • Deductions for depreciation losses under subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 2004 for property used in carrying out R&D (proposed section EE 1(4B) of the Income Tax Act 2004). • Deductions for expenditure incurred on the market development for a product resulting from R&D expenditure. This market development expenditure needs to be incurred before the person first derives assessable income from the use of the product or before the start of commercial production of the product. The deductions for market development expenditure must already be allowed under the Act – for example, under the general permission in section DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (proposed section EJ 20 of the Income Tax Act 2004). The proposed new allocation treatment for R&D expenditure will be optional. Therefore taxpayers who wish to continue to deduct their R&D expenditure or depreciation loss or their market development expenditure in the year it is incurred under section BD 4(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 can do so. Taxpayers can choose how much of a qualifying deduction will be allocated to a future income year. The amount not allocated under the new treatment will be deducted in the year the relevant expenditure or depreciation loss is incurred. The new treatment will be available to all taxpayers with R&D expenditure and not just those whose main activity is R&D. This is because the principle of achieving a better matching of the timing of deductions for R&D expenditure with the timing of income resulting from the expenditure is of general application. R&D expenditure covered by section DB 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004, and therefore by this proposed allocation treatment, includes overhead costs (other than interest) such as rent and power. In the case of a company whose business does not consist solely of R&D it will be necessary for the taxpayer to conduct an apportionment on a reasonable basis of overhead expenses between its R&D function and other functions. Interest expenditure will be excluded from this treatment as a tax base protection measure. The new provisions use the definitions of “research” and “development” contained in Financial Reporting Standard FRS 13: Accounting for Research and Development Activities. These definitions are already used in section DB 26. In the case of a start-up technology company, which typically incurs significant expenditure for a long period before any income is realised, most of its pre-commercial production expenditure would qualify for this new deduction allocation treatment. Allocation of deductions under new treatment Taxpayers may choose to allocate deductions that qualify for the new treatment to an income year after the income year in which they incur the relevant expenditure or depreciation loss. 55 If they choose to use the new allocation treatment they must allocate the deductions in accordance with new section EJ 21. This provision will generally require taxpayers to allocate a deduction to an income year in which they derive assessable income that they would not have derived but for R&D expenditure that gives rise to a deduction that may be allocated under new section EJ 21 (or the use of property for which the taxpayer has a deduction for a depreciation loss that may be allocated under the new treatment). The assessable income referred to in proposed section EJ 21 includes any amount treated as assessable income under the Income Tax Act 2004, for example, depreciation recovery income. The amount of qualifying tax deductions (that is, deductions for R&D expenditure and depreciation losses and market development expenditure) allocated to a particular income year under this new treatment will be the lesser of: • the amount of the assessable income that would not have been derived but for the relevant R&D expenditure (including depreciation loss); and • the amount of the qualifying deductions that has not been allocated to earlier income years. Therefore, taxpayers who choose to use this treatment will be required to allocate the qualifying tax deductions to an income year to the extent of any income derived in that year resulting from the relevant R&D expenditure or depreciation loss. This requirement is necessary as a tax-base protection measure to ensure that taxpayers do not use their R&D tax deductions to shelter their non-R&D income. Accordingly, the relevant R&D tax deductions cannot be deducted against unrelated income. The requirement is also consistent with the policy underlying the new treatment of achieving a better matching of deductions for R&D expenditure with the income resulting from that expenditure. Example A start-up technology company incurs $5 million of expenditure on developing biotechnology products in the first five years of its existence. This amount includes deductions for depreciation losses on equipment used in carrying out the R&D and expenditure on surveys to gauge market interest in these products. The company utilises the new deduction allocation treatment for R&D (including market development) expenditure. At the end of this period the company has developed several innovative products which have significant commercial potential. The company brings on board new investors to fund the next stage of development which would lead to the start of commercial production of the products. Under previous tax laws, introducing new investors in a company could result in deductions for previous R&D expenditure being forfeited. However, under the new deduction allocation treatment for R&D expenditure the company’s tax deductions are preserved until they can be offset against income resulting from the company’s R&D products. 56 Taxpayers will also be able to allocate any deduction to which section EJ 21 applies to the current year if they would have been entitled under Part I of the Income Tax Act 2004 to carry forward to that year a net loss from the year in which they incurred the expenditure (or the depreciation loss arose) to which the deduction relates. In particular, this means that a company must have satisfied for the relevant period the shareholder continuity requirements in section IF 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. This rule ensures that taxpayers do not have less flexibility in using their tax deductions for R&D expenditure than if they had not chosen to use the new allocation treatment. Taxpayers’ decisions on the amount of R&D tax deductions allocated under the new treatment will be reflected in the tax positions they take in their returns of income for each tax year. In line with normal tax treatment, these tax positions are binding on the taxpayer unless disputes procedures are initiated within the applicable response periods. The Commissioner will not consider it appropriate, outside a dispute, to exercise the discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to amend an assessment to adjust the amounts allocated under the new treatment. Background This R&D deduction allocation reform is part of the government’s Growth and Innovation Framework, which emphasises the importance of the technology sector to the country’s economic and social development. Four private-sector taskforces were established as part of the government’s Growth and Innovation Framework to formulate policy initiatives to best develop sectors of the economy seen as key to New Zealand’s future economic performance. They were: the Biotechnology Taskforce, the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Taskforce, the Design Industry Taskforce and the Screen Production Industry Taskforce. As part of their 2003 report, the taskforces made various recommendations, including several on tax-related issues. One tax issue raised by both the Biotechnology and ICT taskforces was the relaxation of the current loss carry-forward rules. The entry of new equity investors can currently result in any accumulated tax deductions (generally tax losses) being lost because of a breach of the shareholder continuity requirements for carrying forward tax losses. The current tax rules broadly provide that a company can carry forward and offset its tax losses only where the tax benefit arising from the offset is obtained by at least 49% of the natural person shareholders who originally bore the loss. The Biotechnology and ICT taskforces recommended that the government consider changing the tax rules to preserve tax losses where business continuity is maintained even though shareholder continuity is lost. 57 The government did not favour a general business continuity test to supplement the shareholder continuity test for the following reasons: • It is contrary to the main policy underlying the loss carry forward rules, which is to prevent the trading of losses between unrelated parties. • It is the experience of other countries that the test is difficult to apply in practice, creating both complexity and uncertainty. • A general business continuity test could potentially lock companies into businesses that are only marginally profitable and do not represent the best use of capital. • A general business continuity test could have significant revenue implications. The government has continued to explore further options to remove any tax barriers to the growth of the technology sector in New Zealand. The amendments in this bill are the outcome of this work. Current R&D tax rules The tax treatment of most R&D expenditure is covered by section DB 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004. That section allows taxpayers a deduction for R&D expenditure if the expenditure does not satisfy all the asset recognition criteria contained in Financial Reporting Standard FRS 13: Accounting for Research and Development Activities. These criteria are designed to approximate the point at which the R&D expenditure gives rise to a valuable asset. Although most R&D expenditure is currently deductible, shareholding changes arising from the normal growth cycle of a technology company can, as outlined above, result in these deductions not being able to be used. Policy issues The amendments are based on achieving a better matching of the timing of tax deductions for R&D expenditure with the timing of income resulting from that expenditure. This treatment recognises that taxpayers in the development period of an R&D project are developing assets for the purpose of earning income in future periods instead of incurring economic losses in the initial development stage. The current tax treatment results in R&D expenditure being recognised too early in relation to when the resulting income is recognised. However, the expenses are better viewed as developmental rather than operational expenses. The current mismatch in the early recognition of expenditure and the later recognition of income means that deductions for R&D expenditure of a company may be inappropriately lost when there is a shareholding change in the company. 58 Current tax rules are problematic for the growth cycle of technology companies because these companies typically have a long lead-in period where significant expenditure is incurred before any income is realised. It is part of the normal financing process for such companies to bring in additional equity investors after the initial development work has been successful. If tax deductions for that development work cannot be used because of shareholding changes it can effectively result in technology companies being taxed on their gross income. This is not an appropriate result given that the purpose of the Income Tax Act 2004 is to tax mainly net income. The proposed treatment will better suit the growth cycle of technology companies as deductions for R&D expenditure will not be affected by changes in shareholding resulting from technology companies bringing in new investors. 59 Corporate migration 60 61 CORPORATE MIGRATION (Clauses 9, 11, 78, 106, 111 to 113, 143(10), 191, 195 to 199, and 200(2)) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces changes announced in March to ensure that migrating companies pay tax on their worldwide income earned while resident in New Zealand. The changes are intended to remove incentives for companies to migrate for tax reasons. The existing tax rules that apply on the liquidation of a New Zealand company will also apply in the event of a company ceasing to be a New Zealand resident. Thus, for tax purposes, a migrating company will be treated as if it had been liquidated and paid a distribution to its shareholders. The distribution will be subject to tax as a dividend under the usual rules. Consequential technical amendments are also being made to the dividend withholding payment and conduit rules. For consistency with current imputation rules, a company that ceases to be resident will also cease to be a dividend withholding payment (DWP) account company and a conduit tax relief (CTR) company. Application date The amendments (apart from the changes to the dividend withholding payment and conduit rules) will apply from 21 March 2005, the date of announcement. The amendments to the dividend withholding payment and conduit rules will apply from 1 April 1997 to remove any potential for taxpayers to claim a refund for any tax paid under the existing legislation. Key features When a company ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident, the company will be treated as if it had been liquidated and paid a distribution to its shareholders. This means that the existing tax rules that apply on the liquidation of a New Zealand company will also apply in the event of a company ceasing to be a New Zealand resident for income tax purposes. The company will first be treated as disposing of its property at market value immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident. Under existing legislation, certain amounts (such as gains in the value of revenue account property and excess depreciation deductions) will be subject to tax. This is consistent with the current treatment of financial arrangements and foreign investment funds when a company ceases to be a New Zealand resident. 62 The company will then be treated as having distributed all shareholder funds (which will include the proceeds of the deemed disposal) to its shareholders. While realised capital reserves will generally be excluded from the distribution, a consequence of alignment with the liquidation rules is that they will be included for non-resident related company shareholders. The amount of the deemed dividend will therefore vary between certain shareholders as shown in the table 1. Table 1: Treatment of shareholder dividends Resident shareholder Non-related non-resident shareholder Related non-resident company shareholder Dividend subject to RWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital and realised capital reserves. Dividend subject to NRWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital and realised capital reserves. Dividend subject to NRWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital. In accordance with the usual tax rules applicable to dividends, a migrating company will be required to withhold tax from a deemed dividend distribution immediately before it ceased to be a New Zealand resident company, under the resident withholding tax (RWT) or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules, as appropriate. Under the current rules, RWT on dividends applies at the rate of 33%. A dividend distribution to a resident shareholder will then be taxed at the shareholder’s marginal tax rate, less imputation credits attached by the company. A dividend distribution to a non-resident shareholder will be taxed at 30% if the shareholder is a resident of a non-treaty country and the dividend is not fully imputed or credited with dividend withholding payments. If the treaty so provides, NRWT at 15% will apply to a dividend distribution to a shareholder from a treaty country or a shareholder from a non-treaty country if the dividend is fully imputed or credited. Property will be treated as being re-acquired by the company at the same market value for which it was treated as being disposed of at the time of migration. For property that continues to be subject to tax in New Zealand after a company’s migration (for example, standing timber situated in New Zealand), this will establish a new cost base to apply in the event of a subsequent disposal. To remove potential double taxation in the event that, subsequent to its migration, a non-resident company pays a dividend to its shareholders, the amount of the distribution deemed to have been paid immediately before the company migrated is added to the company’s available subscribed capital (which can be distributed tax free to shareholders in certain circumstances). 63 Consequential technical amendments If a New Zealand-resident company migrates, it will cease to be a dividend withholding payment company and a conduit tax relief company. Its accounts will close and a debit adjustment made to bring any credit balance to nil. To recover the amount of conduit tax relief provided while the company was resident, a conduit tax relief company will also be required to make an additional dividend withholding payment of the amount of any credit balance in its conduit tax relief account. Background Applying the liquidation rules A company has migrated from New Zealand if it is no longer a resident company for New Zealand income tax purposes. This generally happens when companies transfer their place of incorporation overseas. For New Zealand income tax purposes, a non-resident company: • is not incorporated in New Zealand; • does not have its head office in New Zealand; • does not have its centre of management in New Zealand; and • is not controlled by its directors in New Zealand. 5 A company resident in New Zealand is liable to New Zealand tax on its worldwide income. However, a company is currently able to migrate without having necessarily paid tax on income that was earned while it was resident. For example, any increase in the value of property situated outside New Zealand that accrued when a company was resident in New Zealand is not subject to New Zealand income tax if the company migrates and the property is then sold. 6 Income tax deductions may have been previously allowed in relation to the property on the assumption that there would be a resulting income stream that would be taxable in New Zealand. Similarly, other income generated when a company is resident in New Zealand may not be subject to New Zealand tax until a distribution is made to the company’s shareholders. However, when a company has migrated, distributions made to non- resident shareholders would not be taxed in New Zealand at all as the company is no longer a New Zealand-resident company. Distributions to resident shareholders would still be subject to tax, although offset to some extent by credits for tax paid on the distribution in the company’s new country of residence. 5 Section OE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004. 6 Unless the property is a financial arrangement or a foreign investment fund interest. 64 A company that remains incorporated in New Zealand but moves its place of management to another country could also be treated as resident in the other country. In this type of situation, the company will not be considered to have migrated (because it remains a New Zealand resident company for New Zealand income tax purposes) and the new tax rules will not apply to it. It follows that if a dual resident company is treated as resident in another country under a double tax treaty the new rules will similarly not apply. Company law The Companies Act 1955 required the liquidation and discontinuation of the legal personality of a company before it could be removed from the New Zealand register of companies. Distributions made to shareholders on the liquidation of a New Zealand company are treated as a dividend. In contrast, the Companies Act 1993 allows a company to transfer its place of incorporation offshore and become a non-resident company without the need to liquidate and pay New Zealand income tax. This has created a tax incentive for companies to migrate rather than liquidate. Applying the same tax treatment to both liquidating and migrating companies will remove the existing tax incentive to migrate rather than liquidate, and increase the neutrality of the tax system. Dividend withholding payment and conduit tax relief accounts In most cases, a New Zealand-resident company must have an imputation credit account. When a company ceases to be a New Zealand resident, its imputation credit account must close and a debit adjustment made to bring any credit balance to nil. A New Zealand-resident company may elect to maintain a dividend withholding payment (DWP) account to record credits for the amount of DWP paid by the company on foreign dividends it receives. These DWP credits are available for allocation to its shareholders. The company may also elect to be a conduit tax relief (CTR) company to obtain New Zealand tax relief on its foreign-sourced income to the extent of its foreign shareholding. The company may subsequently elect to cease to be a DWP account company (and a CTR company). An election may not necessarily be made when a company migrates from New Zealand. If an election is made, the company’s DWP accounts will close and a debit adjustment made to bring any credit balance to nil. To recover the amount of CTR provided while the company was resident, a CTR company is also required to pay additional DWP of the amount of any credit balance in its CTR account. If a company ceases to be a New Zealand-resident company it is required to file a DWP account return but does not cease to be a DWP account company or a conduit tax relief (CTR) company. The DWP and conduit rules are being amended to ensure that the same treatment that applies to an imputation credit account company ceasing to be a New Zealand resident will also apply to DWP and CTR companies. Therefore if a company ceases to be a New Zealand-resident company, it will automatically cease to be a DWP account company and a CTR company and may be required to pay additional DWP. These amendments are in line with the policy intent of the DWP and conduit rules, and can be regarded as correcting an anomaly. 65 Detailed analysis Deemed liquidation rules New subpart FCB contains the tax rules for migrating companies. New section FCB 1 is the purpose provision for the subpart. It will apply to a company resident in New Zealand that ceases to be a New Zealand resident for the purposes of New Zealand income tax. The company will be subject to the tax rules that apply when: • a company disposes of its property at market value; • is liquidated; and • distributes shareholder funds (including the deemed disposal proceeds) to its shareholders. Under new section FCB 2 a migrating company is treated as if, immediately before it became a non-resident company, it had paid as a cash dividend to its shareholders, the amount that would be available for distribution if the company had disposed of its property at market value and gone into liquidation. Proposed section CD 18(1) provides that section CD 18 (which defines dividends on liquidation) will also apply if an amount is treated as being paid to shareholders of a migrating company. Therefore the amount in excess of the available subscribed capital per share and the available capital distribution amount will be a dividend. In relation to amounts paid to non-resident related companies, paragraph (c)(ii) of the definition of “dividend” in section OB 1 provides that only the amount in excess of available subscribed capital per share will be a dividend. Under existing section ME 6 a migrating company will be entitled to attach existing imputation credits to distributions made under subpart FCB. Amendments to section ME 6 will allow a company to retrospectively attach imputation credits to a dividend arising from the migration. Tax paid that is attributable to the migration will be treated for imputation purposes as being paid immediately before the company ceases to be a New Zealand resident. For example, a company may have migrated before the new tax rules for migrating companies are enacted. The company will be able to attach the amount of the imputation credits available immediately before the company ceased to be New Zealand resident to a deemed dividend arising under the new legislation. The amount that is treated as being paid to a resident shareholder will be resident withholding income to which the RWT rules in subpart NF apply. The amount that is treated as being paid to a non-resident shareholder will be non- resident withholding income to which the non-resident withholding tax rules in subpart NG apply. The due date for payment of the withholding tax by the company will be no later than the 20 th of the month following the deduction of RWT or NRWT from the withholding income. 66 New section CD 32(15B) removes potential double taxation in the event that a migrating company subsequently pays a dividend to its shareholders. It provides that the amount of the dividend a migrating company is treated as having paid to shareholders immediately before the company migrated from New Zealand is added to the company’s available subscribed capital that may be returned to shareholders tax free in certain circumstances. New section FCB 3 provides that a migrating company is treated as disposing of all property at market value immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident. In that income year, gains in the market value of revenue account property will be subject to tax under existing legislation (for example, section CB 3 or CB 4) and excess depreciation deductions will be recovered under existing section EE 41. The section also treats the company as re-acquiring the property for the same market value for which it was treated as having been disposed of at the time of migration. This will establish a new cost base for property that will continue to be subject to tax in New Zealand. Amendments to the dividing withholding payment and conduit rules New section MG 2(6) provides that a migrating company ceases to be a dividend withholding payment (DWP) account company. New section MG 2(7) provides that the company must furnish a DWP return and pay any further DWP payable under section MG 9. New section MI 2(8) provides that an emigrating company also ceases to be a conduit tax relief company and must furnish an imputation return and, under section MI 10(3), pay DWP of the amount of any credit balance in its conduit tax relief account. Example: Migration of a New Zealand company S Ltd was incorporated in New Zealand in 1995 and issued 140,000 ordinary shares at $2 each to resident shareholders and 60,000 ordinary shares at $2 each to non-resident shareholders (40,000 of those shares are held by related non-resident companies). The shareholders resolve to transfer S Ltd’s place of incorporation and its directorial and managerial functions offshore. S Ltd has a realised capital profit of $150,000 and revenue reserves of $300,000. S Ltd also owns shares held on revenue account in a company that owns commercial rental property in Wellington. The market value of these shares is $500,000. They were purchased for $450,000. S Ltd also owns a New Zealand-registered patent worth $250,000. The cost of the patent was $200,000, and depreciation deductions of $50,000 have been claimed. S Ltd’s imputation credit account has a credit balance of $100,000. 7 Disposal rules Under new section FCB 3, S Ltd will be treated as disposing of all its property at market value immediately before ceasing to be a New Zealand resident. 7 A company could make use of the foreign investor tax credit rules by paying a fully imputed dividend and a supplementary dividend to its non-resident shareholders before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident company. 67 The taxable amount from the disposal of the patent is $100,000 (market value less cost (reduced by the amount of depreciation already claimed)). 8 The taxable amount from the disposal of the shares is $50,000 (market value less cost). 9 Under the proposed amendments, S Ltd’s tax liability on the deemed disposal of its revenue account property is therefore $49,500, and the tax paid is credited to S Ltd’s imputation credit account. The company that owns the commercial property will remain in New Zealand, and the patent is registered in New Zealand. Therefore future income derived from the shares and the patent will continue to be subject to New Zealand tax. 10 Under new section FCB 2, S Ltd will be treated as re-acquiring the shares at $500,000 and the patent at $250,000, which will establish new cost bases for those assets. Liquidation rules Under new section FCB 2, S Ltd will be treated as if it had been liquidated and distributed all available amounts (being shareholder funds and the disposal proceeds) to its shareholders immediately before it became a non-resident company. The total amount deemed to have been distributed by S Ltd to its shareholders is $4.75 per share. 11 In calculating the amount of the dividend paid by S Ltd it is first necessary to exclude capital amounts from total funds. For these purposes, capital amounts comprise the amount of ASC per share and, for shareholders that are not related non-resident companies, the available capital distribution amount. Applying the formulae in the legislation, ASC per share is calculated as $2, and the available capital distribution amount is 75 cents. Therefore the tax-free capital component of the amount distributed by S Ltd in respect of each share held by a shareholder that is not a related non-resident company is $2.75, and the remaining $2 per share (representing revenue reserves) is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. S Ltd may attach imputation credits of 70 cents per share 12 to dividends paid to its shareholders. Resident shareholders The total amount received per share by resident shareholders on S Ltd’s migration is $4.75, of which $2.75 (being $2 + $0.75) is tax-free. The remaining $2 per share is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. The attached imputation credits of 70 cents per share can be used to satisfy the shareholder’s income tax liability. S Ltd is required to withhold resident withholding tax (RWT) from the dividends paid to resident shareholders. S Ltd’s RWT amount per share is 19 cents. 13 S Ltd’s total RWT amount is $26,600. 14 Under new section CD 32(15B), the amount of the distribution treated as a dividend is included in the subscriptions amount that S Ltd could return to shareholders tax-free. 8 See section CB 26, DB 29 and DB 31. 9 See section CB 1. 10 Assuming that there are no DTA implications. 11 (400,000 + 150,000 +300,000 +150,000 - 49,500)/200,000. Note that all figures in this example have been rounded to two decimal places. 12 Existing imputation credit rules require the same imputation credit ratio to apply to all distributions within an income year. Applying this rule to the total imputation credit account balance of 149,500 allows dividends to resident shareholders to have 70 cents per share of imputation credits attached. 13 ((2+.70) x .33) - .70 14 .19 x 140,000 68 Non-related non-resident shareholders The total amount received per share by non-related non-resident shareholders on S Ltd’s migration is $4.75, of which $2.75 (being $2 + $0.75) is tax-free. The remaining $2 per share is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. S Ltd is required to withhold NRWT from dividends paid to non-related non-resident shareholders. S Ltd’s NRWT amount per share held by these shareholders is 30 cents. 15 S Ltd’s total NRWT amount in relation to these shareholders is $6,000. 16 Related company non-resident shareholders The amount of the dividend to the related non-resident company shareholders subject to NRWT is the amount paid in excess of ASC per share. The total amount paid to related non-resident company shareholders on S Ltd’s migration is $4.75, of which $2 is tax-free. The remaining $2.75 (representing revenue reserves and capital profits) is taxable to the company shareholder as a dividend subject to NRWT. S Ltd’s NRWT amount per share held by these shareholders is 41 cents. 17 S Ltd’s total NRWT amount in relation to these shareholders is $16,400. 18 These calculations are summarised in table 2.

A two-tiered exemption will be introduced. The first tier proposes a five-year exemption for employees and the second tier a three-year exemption for all new migrants. In both cases the exemption will be from all foreign income except dividends, interest, employment income and business income relating to the supply of services. To qualify, an individual must not have been tax resident in New Zealand for at least 10 years. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2006 for people arriving in New Zealand on or after this date, with application from the 2005-06 income year and subsequent income years. Key features New part 5B in the Tax Administration Act 1994 deals with the certification requirements. Certified residents and certificates New section 91K allows for people who have been non-tax resident for 10 tax years to qualify as a certified resident and eligible for a resident certificate. It defines who is eligible for the employment resident certificate, the general resident certificate and the dependent resident certificate. Applying for a new-resident certificate A new section 91L details who may apply for a new-resident certificate and the conditions that need to be satisfied in the application. Issuing a certificate Section 91M allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue a new-resident certificate and states what is required on the certificate. 72 Change in situation Section 91N requires individuals to notify the Commissioner in writing of any changes in circumstances that may affect the eligibility of the individual. Withdrawal or surrender of certificate Section 91O allows the Commissioner to withdraw a resident certificate if satisfied that the certificate is incorrect. Furthermore, the holder of a certificate may surrender the certificate at any time by returning it to the Commissioner. Other changes Section 61 will be amended so that certified residents do not have to disclose any interests in a foreign company and foreign investment fund. The Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended as follows: Definitions Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will be amended to include definitions relevant to these changes. A certified resident is a person who holds a relevant new- resident certificate. The definitions are replicated in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Types of income exempt Foreign sourced income A new section will be included in subpart CW that allows certified residents to be exempt from all foreign-sourced income except dividends, interest, employment income, and business income relating to the supply of services. CFC rules Certified residents will be exempt from the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. Section CQ 2 is amended so attributed CFC income does not arise if the individual holding an interest in the foreign company is a certified resident. Section DN 2 will also be amended so CFC losses do not arise if an individual holding the interest in a foreign company is a certified resident. FIF rules Certified residents will be exempt from the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. Section CQ 5 will be amended so FIF income does not arise if an individual holding an interest in a foreign fund is a certified resident. Section DN 6 will also be amended so that FIF losses do not arise if an individual holding an interest in a foreign fund is a certified resident. 73 Accrual rules Part EW will be amended so that the accrual rules do not apply to foreign financial arrangements of certified residents. Share options Section CE 2 will be amended so that if a certified resident derives an employee share option while non-resident and exercises the option while a certified resident, then the value of any benefit will be zero. Trusts Section HH 2 is being amended to provide that a trust is deemed a foreign trust for the duration of the exemption if the settlor is a certified resident. This means that the 12- month period for an election for a foreign trust to become a qualifying trust will begin on the date that the individual is no longer a certified resident. Section HH 4 is also being amended to provide that if the settlor is a certified resident, the trustee will not be subject to tax on income derived from outside New Zealand. NRWT An addition will be made to section NG 2(1)(b) to remove the requirement of certified residents to withhold NRWT on foreign mortgages. Other changes The definition of “qualifying person” in section KD 3 and in section OB 1 will be amended to exclude certified residents and their spouses. The effect will be that certified residents will not be eligible for any form of family assistance. Background People coming to New Zealand from overseas may face extra tax costs compared with what they would face at home or in other countries. Often these extra tax costs are passed on to New Zealand businesses who recruit these people or who use their services. This occurs because the individual often negotiates higher remuneration to compensate for the extra tax burden. In 2001 the Tax Review recommended, in its Final Report, that individuals with no previous connection to New Zealand who are resident for tax purposes should be taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income for the first seven years. The government discussion document, Reducing tax barriers to international recruitment to New Zealand, was released in November 2003. It proposed that an exemption be provided for new migrants and expatriates who come to work in New Zealand. The central aim of the proposal is to reduce the costs to New Zealand businesses associated with recruiting highly skilled, mobile, individuals. 74 The discussion document advanced two potential options for an exemption for migrant employees: • A seven-year exemption from the most comprehensive aspects of our international tax rules, including the controlled foreign company rules (CFC), the foreign investment fund rules (FIF), accrual rules, non-resident withholding tax and the approved issuer levy, and possibly trust rules and share option rules (the narrow option). • A three-year exemption from all foreign income of any description (the broad option). Fifteen submissions were received on the proposals in the discussion document. Most welcomed the proposal. The policy decisions are designed to reflect the concerns raised by submitters. Detailed analysis Scope of the exemption The narrow option ensures that individuals are not disadvantaged by choosing to come to New Zealand rather than go to other countries. The broad option offers a tax incentive. The scope of the proposed amendment lies between the narrow and broad option. The exemption is from tax on all foreign income except dividends, interest, employment income and business income relating to services performed offshore. It includes: • controlled foreign company income that is attributed under our CFC rules; • foreign investment fund income that is attributed under our FIF rules (including foreign superannuation); • non-resident withholding tax on foreign mortgages; • approved issuer levy on foreign mortgages; • taxation arising from the exercise of employee share options; • accrual income (from foreign financial arrangements); • income from foreign trusts; • rental income derived offshore; • royalties derived offshore; • gains on the sale of property derived offshore (held on revenue account); and • offshore business income (that is not related to the performance of services). This would eliminate those taxes that are generally passed on to New Zealand employers and temporarily relieve migrants of the most compliance-cost intensive aspects of returning foreign income in New Zealand. Those eligible would continue to be taxed on New Zealand-sourced income. 75 The reason for continuing to tax dividends and interest is because people in most countries expect to pay tax on these items. The reason for continuing to tax employment income and business income relating to services performed offshore is to prevent New Zealand-sourced income from being re-characterised as foreign-sourced income. Eligibility The amendments will apply to new and returning residents who are natural persons and have not been tax-resident for at least 10 tax years. Returning New Zealanders can be as sensitive to New Zealand taxes as new migrants in making their decision about where to seek future employment. The 10-year non-residence rule is required to target those New Zealanders who have emigrated from New Zealand on a permanent basis and have, therefore, become as sensitive as a new migrant to New Zealand’s taxes on foreign-sourced income. Applying for a new-resident certificate The new section 91L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that an individual can apply for a new-resident certificate if the application is made before the end of the tax year. The application must: • be in the prescribed form; • specify the tax file number of the person or be accompanied by an application by the person for a tax file number; • be signed by the person making the application; • specify the type of certificate sought; • specify the period for which the certificate is sought; • provide all the facts relevant to the application; • specify all assumptions that are relevant to the application; and • provide all other information required by the Commissioner. The employed resident certificate The employed resident certificate lasts for five tax years. The majority of migrant employees take up employment contracts with a time span of three to five years. This view is supported by data collected by the Department of Labour (New Zealand Immigration Service) Longitudinal Immigration Survey: New Zealand (LisNZ) pilot survey. 19 19 LisNZ has collected data on the experiences of migrants in New Zealand. In terms of employment and income, the LisNZ pilot survey reveals that of Skilled/Business Stream principal applicants surveyed 18 months after taking up residence in New Zealand, 52% had only one job in New Zealand. The Department of Labour advises that applicants for residence under the new Skilled Migrant Category, for example, are expected to hold a job offer for “ongoing employment”. (This is defined as employment with a single employer for at least 12 months; or a contract basis where the applicant has one or more contracts totalling at least 12 months and has provided evidence of an employment history that includes at least two years of contract work.) For persons on a temporary permit, the maximum period of time for which they may be granted a temporary work visa or permit is three years. Renewals for a further period of time are possible, depending on the circumstances. 76 It is important to keep the threshold reasonably high to ensure the exemption is targeted at genuine employment cases. The concern is that if the threshold were lowered the employee exemption would be much more widely available than intended. Ensuring this boundary is robust is important to maintain the integrity of the reform. Also, it recognises the wider availability of the three-year general exemption. To be eligible for the employed resident certificate an individual must either be: • engaged in full-time employment 94% of the time. This rule gives employees three weeks to find a job once they arrive, or allows them three weeks between jobs. Full-time work is defined as 37.5 hours per week; or • must be engaged in part-time employment earning a minimum of $70,000 (pro- rata) per annum. A further requirement is that the individual is not associated with the employer. 20 This should ensure that people who are effectively self-employed or are in retirement are not eligible for the employed resident certificate. However, these individuals may still be eligible for the general resident certificate If an individual ceases to be an employee they must let the Commissioner know immediately in writing. They may be eligible for the general resident certificate. The general resident certificate Independent contractors are widely used in New Zealand, especially where specialist skills are not available locally. Consequently, drawing a line between employees and non-employees is arbitrary. Some independent contractors in contractual relationships that are broadly analogous to employment also explicitly (or implicitly) gross up their fee to compensate for New Zealand taxes on foreign-sourced income. This results in the New Zealand business having to pay more for the services provided by the contractor. Furthermore, some independent contractors will be deterred from working in New Zealand because of the tax impost and the associated compliance costs of New Zealand’s comprehensive rules. In these cases, New Zealand business may end up with the second-best candidate, which also represents a cost to those businesses. On the other hand, other independent contractors or entrepreneurs, particularly those in the business of providing services to multiple clients (such as consultants and professionals), may not gross up for these New Zealand taxes because they are exploiting a local opportunity, extracting economic rents, and are consequently less sensitive to New Zealand taxes on foreign income. 20 In the tax context “association” refers to family connections and companies controlled by the relevant party. 77 The problem is that it is very difficult to target only those independent contractors who are analogous to employees. In order to include independent contractors within the ambit of the exemption, the amendments will extend the proposal to all new migrants. The exemption is for three years for all new migrants who have not been resident in New Zealand for at least 10 years (as long as they meet immigration criteria). This would provide genuine independent contractors with relief from our international tax rules for the period they are in the country. (A shorter period is justified because the term of independent contractors’ contracts will generally be shorter than that of an employment contract.) However, the exemption will also be available to migrants and returning New Zealanders who are outside the target group of highly skilled migrants. An individual who becomes an employee will not be eligible for the employed resident certificate. The dependent resident certificate The amendments provide that a dependant of a person entitled to an exemption can receive the same exemption if the dependant is: • a natural person; • less than 20 years of age; • financially dependent on a person who at the time is a certified resident; and • is being maintained as a member of the family of the certified resident. Therefore, dependants are entitled for the exemption only if they are under 20 years of age. It will be up to the individual to decide if it is more beneficial for them to apply for an exemption on their own right. Other specifics of the new-resident certificate Individuals are required to notify the Commissioner in writing of any changes in circumstances that may affect their eligibility. Furthermore, the Commissioner may withdraw a new-resident certificate if satisfied that the certificate is incorrect. In addition, the holder of a certificate may surrender the certificate at any time by returning it to the Commissioner. Exclusion from Family Support Family assistance entitlements are determined by a modified form of net income. If individuals derive offshore income that is exempted under the amendments their net income is reduced. Potentially, individuals deriving exempt offshore income could receive family assistance payments that they would not otherwise be entitled to, or receive higher payments than they would otherwise be entitled to, if this income was not exempt. 78 An individual should be able to claim a tax exemption on the one hand, and at the same time be receiving financial help from the government in the form of family assistance payments. Any assistance should be based on the family’s total income. For this reason there will be an amendment to the definition of “qualifying person” in sections OB 1 and KD 3. The effect of these amendments will be that an individual who has a new-resident certificate will be ineligible to receive family assistance payments. The exemption will apply only once in a person’s lifetime A multiple exemption rule may adversely affect public perceptions of equity. It also gives rise to concerns that skilled individuals would leave New Zealand to keep refreshing their exemption. 79 Foreign trusts – information reporting and record-keeping requirements 80 81 FOREIGN TRUSTS – INFORMATION REPORTING AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS (Clauses 87, 155(2), (12), and (14), 156, 162 and 182) Summary of proposed amendments New information reporting and record-keeping requirements will be introduced for New Zealand resident trustees of foreign trusts. 21 New Zealand resident trustees will be required to disclose limited information to Inland Revenue and keep financial records relating to each foreign trust for New Zealand tax purposes. These new requirements are being introduced to ensure that New Zealand can meet its international obligations, such as satisfying requests for information from countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. New Zealand resident trustees will be required to provide tax information relating to foreign trusts to Inland Revenue, if requested. Failure to comply with these new requirements may result in a New Zealand-resident trustee being subject to sanctions, such as prosecution for failure to keep or provide information. In certain circumstances, the foreign trust may be treated as being taxable in New Zealand on its worldwide income. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2006. Key features The new rules to introduce information reporting and record-keeping requirements for New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts will amend both the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004. A new section 59B of the Tax Administration Act will require New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts to provide information to Inland Revenue upon their appointment, or the enactment of the legislation in relation to existing appointments. This requirement will not apply for a two-year period to trustees who satisfy the conditions set out in new section 59B(3). Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act will be amended to impose record-keeping requirements on New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts and specify the records that trustees are required to keep in New Zealand. 21 A “foreign trust” is a trust that has had no New Zealand-resident settlor from the later of 17 December 1987 or the date that the first settlement was made to the trust. For the purposes of the new rules, a “New Zealand-resident trustee” is an individual or corporate trustee of a foreign trust who is resident in New Zealand under section OE 1 or 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004. 82 The onus will be on New Zealand-resident trustees to keep the records required under section 22, maintain them in New Zealand and provide them to Inland Revenue if requested. To provide assurance to Inland Revenue that a trustee has the necessary expertise and incentives to maintain records of the required standard and will comply with the law, at least one New Zealand-resident trustee of each foreign trust will need to satisfy the new definition of “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act. To satisfy the definition, a New Zealand-resident trustee or a New Zealand-resident director or manager of a New Zealand-resident trustee company, will need to be a member of an“approved organisation”. An “approved organisation” will be an organisation that is approved by Inland Revenue, whose members are subject to a code of conduct and a disciplinary process intended to enforce compliance with the code, and who typically provide trustee services in the course of their business activities. Organisations that are likely to be approved will include the New Zealand Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, and similar overseas bodies. The records required to be kept under the amendments to section 22 of the Tax Administration Act will be required to be provided to Inland Revenue by the New Zealand-resident trustee, if requested. Such requests will be made periodically in respect of foreign trusts that have an Australian-resident settlor, and on a case-by-case basis if a valid request for information is received from another country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. The sanctions for failing to comply with the new information reporting and record- keeping requirements will be as follows: • If a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee does not disclose information or keep or provide records as required by law, the trustee will commit an offence under section 143 or 143A of the Tax Administration Act and, if convicted, will be subject to a monetary fine. • If a New Zealand-resident trustee is not a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee, the trustee will commit an offence under new section 143(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act and, if convicted, will be subject to a monetary fine. Furthermore, under new section HH 4(3BB)(a) of the Income Tax Act, if the trustee does not become a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee (or have a co-trustee appointed who satisfies this requirement) within 30 days of receiving notice that Inland Revenue intends to prosecute for the above offence, the foreign trust will become taxable in New Zealand on its worldwide income. • If a New Zealand-resident trustee is not a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee and records requested by Inland Revenue are not produced, new section HH 4(3BB)(b) will treat the foreign trust as being taxable in New Zealand on its worldwide income for the income years in which records cannot be produced. The New Zealand-resident trustee may also be prosecuted for failure to keep or provide records under section 143 or 143A of the Tax Administration Act, or for failure to be a qualifying New Zealand- resident trustee under new section 143(1)(d). 83 Background Under current tax law, a New Zealand-resident trustee of a foreign trust that receives no New Zealand-sourced income is not required to provide information to Inland Revenue or keep records for New Zealand tax purposes. Information relating to foreign trusts may be requested by foreign tax authorities under the exchange of information provisions in New Zealand’s double tax agreements. As some foreign trusts are not required to provide information to Inland Revenue, there is a risk that New Zealand may be unable to provide foreign tax authorities with information relating to certain trusts, if requested. If a foreign trust distributes property to its beneficiaries and ceases to exist or the New Zealand- resident trustee moves offshore, there may be no way of obtaining information relating to its earlier activities. Failure to provide information could impact negatively on New Zealand’s relationship with its double tax agreement signatory countries. Australian authorities, in particular, are concerned that foreign trusts could be established in New Zealand for the purpose of channelling funds through to tax havens. The new rules for foreign trusts are intended to ensure that New Zealand can meet its international obligations, such as satisfying requests for information from its double tax agreement partners. The intention is also to maintain and further develop favourable relationships with Australia, while allowing for the continuation and development of the foreign trust industry in New Zealand. Detailed analysis Application of the rules The new foreign trust rules will apply to all New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts, including foreign trusts that receive no New Zealand-sourced income. Disclosure of trust information to Inland Revenue Section 59B will impose a disclosure requirement on New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts. New Zealand-resident trustees appointed on or after 1 April 2006 will be required to provide limited information to Inland Revenue within 30 days of their appointment. New Zealand-resident trustees appointed before this date will have 60 days to comply from 1 April 2006. The following information will be required for each foreign trust that a trustee acts for: • the name or other identifying features of each trust (such as the date of settlement); • the name and contact details of the New Zealand-resident trustee(s); • whether a settlor is resident in Australia; and • the name of the approved organisation to which the New Zealand-resident trustee belongs. 84 A New Zealand-resident trustee who becomes aware that any of the information provided has changed will be required to advise Inland Revenue of the change within 30 days. The collection of this information will assist Inland Revenue to identify the appropriate trustee(s) when information about a foreign trust is requested by one of New Zealand’s double tax agreement partners. Inland Revenue will automatically provide the Australian Taxation Office with information relating to foreign trusts that have a New Zealand resident trustee and an Australian-resident settlor. The requirement to inform Inland Revenue if a settlor of a foreign trust is an Australian resident is intended to ensure that Inland Revenue is in a position to provide this information. Australia is the only country to which New Zealand is currently proposing to provide information on an automatic basis. Other countries may be added by legislation in the future, where appropriate. New Zealand-resident trustees who fail to disclose the required information to Inland Revenue will commit an offence under section 143 or 143A of the Tax Administration Act. Keeping financial records Section 22(2) of the Tax Administration Act imposes an obligation on certain persons to maintain financial records in New Zealand for at least seven years after the end of the income year to which they relate. New sections 22(2)(fb) and (m) will extend this obligation to New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts. The definition of “records” in section 22(7) will be amended to require New Zealand- resident trustees of foreign trusts to keep the following records: • evidence of the creation and constitution of a trust (trust deed or similar); • details of settlements made on, and by a trust, and distributions to beneficiaries, including the name and address (if known) of settlors and beneficiaries; • accurate descriptions of the assets and liabilities of a trust, and details of all sums of money expended and received by a trustee in relation to a trust; and • the charts and codes of accounts, accounting instruction manuals and the programme documentation which describes the accounting system used in the administration of a trust. Section 22(2) provides that a person who is required to keep records may apply to the Commissioner for permission to keep records offshore, or in a language other than English. If a New Zealand-resident trustee does not personally hold information relating to a foreign trust’s offshore interests, the trustee may apply to the Inland Revenue under this provision and the department may exercise its discretion to allow records to be kept offshore. If records are kept offshore, a trustee will be expected to provide records to Inland Revenue within a reasonable timeframe, if requested. 85 New Zealand resident trustees who fail to keep the required records or provide them if requested by Inland Revenue will commit an offence under section 143 or 143A. Foreign trusts that have a non-qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee who fails to provide records requested by Inland Revenue, may also be liable to tax in New Zealand. This is described in the following section. Failure to be a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee Under the new rules, the onus will be on New Zealand-resident trustees to maintain financial records and provide them to Inland Revenue, if requested. If at least one New Zealand-resident trustee of a foreign trust is a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee, this will provide assurance to Inland Revenue that a trustee has the necessary expertise and incentive to maintain records of the required standard and will comply with the law. If Inland Revenue requests information on a foreign trust and the trust does not have a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee, the non-qualifying trustee will commit an offence under new section 143(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act, unless the two- year exemption applies as explained on page 86. If a New Zealand-resident trustee fails to become qualifying (or have a co-trustee appointed who satisfies this requirement) within 30 days of receiving notice from Inland Revenue of its intention to prosecute for this above offence, the worldwide income of the foreign trust will be taxed in New Zealand under new section HH 4(3BB)(a) of the Income Tax Act. This tax treatment will be applied on a prospective basis. Under new section HH 4(3BB)(b), a foreign trust will be taxed on its worldwide income for any income year (from 1 April 2006) for which the trust had no qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee and financial records requested by Inland Revenue are not provided. If the non-qualifying trustee subsequently provides the information requested, the taxing provision will cease to apply. The intention is not to tax foreign trusts on their worldwide income but, rather, to provide the necessary incentive for New Zealand-resident trustees to become qualifying, and keep and provide the required financial records. If the worldwide income of a foreign trust becomes liable to tax in New Zealand, the New Zealand- resident trustee will be required to file an income tax return on that basis. The tax return will provide Inland Revenue with information that it can provide to New Zealand’s double tax agreement partners, if requested. 86 Temporary exemption from the requirements Section 59B(3) will provide a temporary exemption from the information-reporting and record-keeping requirements for eligible New Zealand-resident trustees who are new migrants and for those who have not been resident in New Zealand for a period of at least five years before becoming a New Zealand resident. To be eligible, a trustee will need to be appointed as trustee of a foreign trust before becoming a New Zealand resident. Trustee companies and sole or joint trustees who are in the business of providing trustee services will not be eligible for the exemption. The exemption will apply for two years from the date that an eligible trustee becomes a New Zealand resident. A trustee who is still resident in New Zealand at the end of the exemption period will be required to disclose the required information to Inland Revenue and satisfy the approved organisation membership requirement within 30 days, and start keeping records for New Zealand tax purposes. Requests for information about trusts from other countries When a New Zealand-resident trustee indicates that a settlor of a foreign trust is an Australian resident, Inland Revenue will periodically request additional information about the trust (such as financial records, details of distributions to beneficiaries and the identity of the settlor) and automatically provide this information to the Australian Taxation Office. Information will be provided to other double tax agreement signatory countries on a case-by-case request basis, when Inland Revenue considers that there are valid grounds for requesting the information. Inland Revenue will not entertain general “fishing expeditions” from tax treaty partners for information on foreign trusts, or satisfy requests for information from countries that do not have a double tax agreement or a tax information exchange agreement with New Zealand. When a valid request for information is received, Inland Revenue will request additional information from the appropriate New Zealand-resident trustee. Inland Revenue is permitted to require information to be provided under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act. That section imposes an obligation on persons to provide information that Inland Revenue considers necessary for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts, or any other lawful function of the Commissioner. Any information provided by a trustee will be subject to the existing tax secrecy laws. Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act prevents Inland Revenue from providing information to a foreign jurisdiction except as permitted by section 88 – under a reciprocal law, double tax agreement. 87 Other changes to the Income Tax Act 88 89 CLARIFYING THE SCOPE OF OVERRIDING PROVISIONS RELATING TO DOUBLE TAX TREATIES (Clause 5) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will narrow the overriding effect of double tax agreements in relation to domestic legislation so they override only the Inland Revenue Acts, the Privacy Act 1993 and the Official Information Act 1982. The amendment clarifies which enactments are overridden by double tax agreements which have entered into force under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The key amendment replaces the reference to “any enactment” in section BH 1(4) with a reference to “any other Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993”. Background In March 2002, the Regulations Review Committee issued a report concerning overriding provisions such as section BH 1. Overriding provisions allow regulations to be made which override all domestic legislation. The report recommended that, among other sections, section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (the predecessor to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004) be reviewed in the light of the recommendations in the Committee’s report. The government agreed to review the section in its response to the report. The amendment specifically identifies enactments that double tax agreements override – namely the Inland Revenue Acts, the Privacy Act 1993 and the Official Information Act 1982. 90 DEDUCTIBLE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM CO-OPERATIVES (Clauses 10, 47, and 220) Summary of proposed amendments To remove an uncertainty in the treatment of payouts from co-operatives to members, an amendment ensures that payouts are deductible to the co-operative and taxable in the hands of members at their marginal tax rate. The amendment achieves this by specifically excluding such payouts from the definition of “dividend” and including them as an allowable deduction in the Income Tax Act 2004. To be deductible, however, the payout must be in relation to the supply of trading stock sold to the co- operative by the member or vice versa. Application date The exclusion of payouts from the definition of a dividend will apply from the 2006-07 and subsequent income years. Key features New section CD 24B in the Income Tax Act 2004 will exclude payouts by co-operatives to members from the definition of a dividend. A new section DV 10B will ensure that, if a payout from a co-operative meets the criteria outlined in section CD 24B, it will be considered deductible expenditure to the co-operative. The amendment, however, will apply only to: • shareholders that supply or receive trading stock to, or from, a co-operative which is tangible property (excluding intangibles such as intellectual property and marketing rights); • current trading stock that is not sold as part of the disposal of a business; • New Zealand-resident co-operatives or wholly owned subsidiaries of resident co-operatives; and • members whose income is sourced in New Zealand. Under the current mutuality provisions contained in section HF 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004, it is clear that co-operatives can already adopt this tax treatment, but only for the distribution of profits arising from transactions with members of the co- operative. Under the general deductibility provisions, however, it is not clear whether co-operatives can treat profits from activities not associated with members (for example, investment activities that do not relate to the purchase or supply of product to or from the member) in the same manner. The amendment effectively extends the existing treatment of payouts of profits from member transactions to non-member transactions so that they are deductible to the co-operative and taxable in the hands of the member shareholders at their marginal rate. 91 The deductible treatment of payouts will apply to most types of co-operatives, including those that receive payments from member shareholders and purchase product on their behalf (such as trading co-operatives). This ensures the equal treatment of payouts between different types of co-operatives. Discounts received by members on the price of product purchased on their behalf by the co-operative are economically equivalent to payments in cash received by members. Therefore both are to be treated the same. The proposal also has some important limitations. For the payout to be deductible, it must be connected to the supply of trading stock traded between the co-operative and the member. This ties any payout from the co- operative to the member to the sale or receipt of goods. The principal purpose of holding any shares in a co-operative must be for the trade in a product with the co- operative. This is to prevent the deductibility of payouts to shareholders that do not trade with the co-operative from receiving a payout that is clearly a dividend. Payouts relating to the sale of intangibles, such as services and financing, will not be allowed to be deducted as trading stock by the co-operative. This is because it would allow businesses to re-structure as a co-operative in order to take advantage of the deductibility of payouts. Otherwise, there is a risk that co-operatives would be set up to finance investments and receive distributions that would be taxed at their personal marginal tax rate. Payouts from co-operatives to charities and exempt taxpayers will receive the same treatment as taxpaying shareholders. This means that payouts to exempt taxpayers will not be taxed. This treatment is in line with the policy objective of not taxing such organisations. Background Co-operatives contract with their member shareholders for the supply of product to the co-operative, particularly in the agricultural sector. In some cases, this payout exceeds the market price for the product because the payout also includes a return on additional activities, such as processing, that add value to the product purchased from the member. The payout might also include profits from investment activities undertaken by the co- operative. This “value added” component of the payout arises from business activities that do not involve transactions with members of the co-operative. It is unclear, however, whether the value-added component of the payout should be treated as a dividend distributed to the member or as an expense to be deducted by the co-operative. Section CD 4(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 generally treats as a dividend any consideration above market value for the provision of goods and services by a person to a company. In this case, the co-operative would not be able to deduct the value-added component of the payout. The co-operative would pay tax on it and pass on the tax paid as imputation credits to its shareholders when it paid the dividend (in other words, the value-added component of the payout). Such treatment is the norm for companies. 92 In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish the value-added component of the payout from the cost of the purchase of the product. Indeed, often the level of the payout varies in relation to the amount of product sold by the member to the co-operative. The amendment therefore clarified the legislation and confirmed that payouts from co-operatives, including the value-added component from non-member transactions, are deductible to the co-operative. 93 ACC ATTENDANT CARE (Clauses 17, 144, 158, and 159) Summary of proposed amendment The Income Tax Act 2004 and Tax Administration Act 1994 are being amended to put in place a legislative framework to facilitate regulatory change that requires the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) to withhold tax at source on ACC attendant care payments when an independent caregiver is used. ACC withholding tax at source will move tax compliance obligations away from claimants to a more efficient party. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2006. Key features • Section CF 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended to explicitly include attendant care payments made to ACC claimants that are not then used to obtain attendant care services as income of the claimant. • Section OB 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended to prevent double taxation when a claimant pays a caregiver for attendant care services if tax has already been deducted by ACC. • Section 33A(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to remove the requirement on claimants to file a tax return in respect of income from attendant care payments if tax has already been deducted by ACC. • A new section, 33C, is being inserted in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to remove the requirement on caregivers to file a tax return in respect of income from providing attendant care services if tax has already been deducted by ACC. This only applies to caregivers who earn less than $9,500 for providing attendant care services. Background Attendant care payments are made by ACC to injured claimants so they can obtain personal care from a caregiver (or caregivers). ACC claimants may use ACC- contracted caregivers or independent caregivers. Taxation in the ACC-contracted industry works well. The amendments in the bill are aimed at independent caregivers. 94 Under current administrative practice, claimants are generally considered to be the employers of the independent caregivers that care for them. This means that claimants must meet all employer PAYE obligations. (Although if a caregiver works less than 20 hours per week, they are required to meet the PAYE obligations themselves.) This includes calculating and deducting tax from payments made to caregivers, and completing and filing monthly returns with Inland Revenue. The amendments facilitate, rather than require, ACC to withhold tax at source on attendant care payments. Future regulatory change will be necessary to require ACC to do this. Requiring ACC to withhold tax at source would remove the employer PAYE obligations that are currently faced by claimants. It will also increase certainty surrounding tax treatment for the industry and reduce non-compliance. 95 FOREIGN VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT ALONGSIDE THE VIF (Clause 21) Summary of proposed amendments The bill removes an impediment to New Zealand companies gaining access to offshore venture capital. The amendments exempt non-resident investors from tax on the sale of shares in companies that they have invested alongside the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Limited (VIF). Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features A new section CW 11C is being added to the Income Tax Act 2004. Its purpose is to provide an exemption from tax for non-resident investors that have invested alongside the VIF on any realised gains on the sale of shares in New Zealand investee companies. The exemption applies to non-resident investors for investments in which the VIF has invested in, or committed to invest in, on or before 31 March 2008. For the exemption to apply, it will be necessary for the non-resident to invest through a venture capital manager that purchases the shares on behalf of the non-resident in accordance with an agreement with the VIF. The current dividend rules will continue to apply to dividends that non-residents derive from the investee companies. Background The amendments complement reforms included in the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 that were aimed at removing tax barriers to international venture capital investment in New Zealand. Broadly, the recently enacted rules provide an exemption for certain non-residents on realised gains from the sale of shares in New Zealand unlisted companies and are available to non- residents that are tax exempt in their own country. The rules are restricted to non- resident investors that are resident in, or established in, a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement with the exception of Switzerland (because Switzerland does not engage in the exchange of information). 96 International venture capital investments in New Zealand can be made through countries with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement. These non- resident investors that make investments through those countries are not eligible for the recently-enacted exemption. The amendments extend the exemption from tax on realised gains to all non- resident investors, regardless of their country of residence or their home country tax status, on venture capital investments made alongside the VIF. The VIF is a Crown-owned company that invests alongside private-sector co-investors into New Zealand venture capital. The exemption applies to non-resident investors for investments in which the VIF has invested in, or committed to invest in, on or before 31 March 2008. 97 GAMING TRUSTS (Clause 23) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment provides a separate tax exemption for the gaming-machine income of licensed non-casino gaming-machine operators (gaming trusts). This removes concerns that the Charities Act may have provided an incentive for gaming trusts to give disproportionately to amateur sport by claiming exemptions under the Income Tax Act to avoid registering with the Charities Commission. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features A new provision will be inserted into section CW 40B of the Income Tax Act 2004 to provide a separate tax exemption for the gaming machine income of gaming trusts. This exemption will apply only to those licensed operators who apply or distribute that income as required by the Gambling Act 2003. Background During the select committee stage of the Charities Bill (now the Charities Act 2005) an issue was raised concerning the impact of new legislation on gaming trusts. Specifically, gaming trusts which are already subject to a regulatory regime imposed by the Department of Internal Affairs (under the Gaming Act 2003) would be subject to a second tier of supervision by the Charities Commission, and would be statutorily influenced in terms of their funding decisions. The amendment in this bill removes these concerns. The Charities Act amends section CB4 (1)(c) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which provides income tax exemptions for charitable purposes. Organisations that want to claim a tax exemption under those paragraphs will be able to do so only if they have registered with the Commission. At present, gaming trusts that give to amateur sports groups rely on section CB 4(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 2004. That section provides a tax exemption for a non- profit organisation that has been established substantially or primarily for the purpose of promoting any amateur game or sport, provided that the sport or game is conducted for the recreation or entertainment of the general public. 98 The requirement for organisations claiming an income tax exemption under section CB 4(1)(c) or (e) to register with the Commission may have created an incentive for a gaming trust to give more money to the promotion of amateur sport than to any other authorised purpose. “Authorised purpose” includes a charitable purpose, a non- commercial purpose that is beneficial to the whole or a section of the community, or promoting, controlling and conducting race meetings under the Racing Act 2003, including the payment of stakes. This is because gaming trusts would be likely to rely on the sports exemption in section CB 4(1)(h), enabling them to receive an income tax exemption without registering with the Commission. 99 TAX CONSEQUENCES OF NATURAL DISASTERS (Clauses 34, 42, 49, 60, 61, 82, 98, 143(43) and (59), 186, 187, and 192) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces solutions to four technical problems that came to light as a result of the floods in the Lower North Island and the Bay of Plenty last year. The amendments provide that: • Deductions for expenditure for which a restorative grant is made under the Agricultural Recovery Programme will not have to be reduced in the income year in which the expenditure was incurred; instead the grant will be deemed to be income in the year in which it is received. • Livestock donated because of a self-assessed adverse event will be treated as leaving the donor’s business at zero-value and entering the recipient’s business at zero-value. • Those affected by a self-assessed adverse event will be able to make late estimates of provisional tax. • Applications for remission of late payment and late filing penalties will no longer need to be in writing. Application date The amendments to the trading stock rules, penalty provisions and provisional tax provisions apply from the 2005-06 income year. The amendments in relation to the restorative grants apply retrospectively from the 2003-04 income year, so that they apply to those affected by the floods in February 2004 and in the Bay of Plenty in July 2004. Key features Restorative grants The government is making restorative grants as part of the Agriculture Recovery Programme for those affected by the storms in the Lower North Island and Bay of Plenty in 2004. Unexpected use-of-money interest consequences can arise because of the way that section DC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 requires deductions for expenditure, for which a grant is subsequently made, to be reduced. Therefore section DC 1 is being amended so that it no longer applies to grants made under the Agriculture Recovery Programme. While the deductions will not have to be reduced, the grant will no longer be deemed not to be gross income. As a result, the grant will be subject to the general rules that define income. 100 Section DC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been re-written into sections CX 41 and DF 1 in the Income Tax Act 2004. Section CX 41(3) is being replaced so that a restorative grant made under the Agriculture Recovery Programme is assessable income. A new paragraph is being added to section DF 1(1) to prevent the deduction, for expenditure for which the grant is given from being disallowed. If the expenditure is incurred after the grant is received the grant will be excluded income, but no deductions will be allowed. Trading stock A number of amendments are being made to deal with stock that is donated for use in farming, agricultural, or fishing businesses that are affected by a self-assessed adverse event. Section GD 1(4)(b) is being replaced so that the anti-avoidance provision does not apply to such stock. A new section EC 5B is being inserted into the livestock rules to set the values that are to be used when livestock are donated to someone affected by a self-assessed adverse event. Stock donated or supplied for consideration worth less than market value is to be treated as having: • to the donor, no value or the value of the consideration provided by the recipient; and • to the recipient, no value or the value of the consideration provided by the recipient. The amendment will mean that once closing value is determined at the end of the year, income arises with the recipient rather than the donor. The separate definitions of “self-assessed adverse event” in sections EH 36 and EH 63 have been replaced with a definition in section OB 1. Late election of provisional tax Section MB 3B of the Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended so that taxpayers with a farming, agricultural or fishing business affected by a self-assessed adverse event can request the Commissioner to accept a late estimate of provisional tax. Currently the provision only applies to those affected by a qualifying event. Remission of late filing and late payment penalties Section 183H of the Tax Administration Act is being amended to remove the requirement for applications for remission of late filing and late payment penalties to be in writing. The amendments to section 183ABA are consequential amendments. 101 Background The proposed changes address a number of issues that arose out of the February and July floods last year. While short-term solutions were put in place by the Taxation (Disaster Relief) Act 2004 and the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, long-term solutions are needed. These changes address four high-priority issues. Another issue, in relation to the destruction of buildings, is being addressed as part of the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill introduced to parliament in November 2004. Any remaining issues will be addressed in subsequent legislation. 102 TAXATION OF FOREIGN HYBRIDS AND FOREIGN TAX CREDIT RULES (Clauses 8, 70, 71, 74, 75, 92, and 94 to 97) Summary of proposed amendments The law is being clarified to allow people who invest in “foreign hybrids” to receive “grey list” treatment and foreign tax credits for tax they pay overseas on income earned by a foreign hybrid. The changes will apply to foreign hybrids that are either a controlled foreign company (CFC) or a branch-equivalent foreign investment fund (FIF). A foreign hybrid is an entity that has the characteristics of both a company and a partnership. It is treated as a company for New Zealand tax purposes, but is treated like a partnership (with “flow-through” tax treatment) under another country’s tax system. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2006 for the 2006-07 tax year and subsequent tax years. Key features The Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended as follows: • The grey list exemptions in sections EX 24 (CFCs) and EX 33 (FIFs) will be amended to allow taxpayers to receive a grey list exemption for investments in foreign hybrids. • The CFC tax crediting provision in section LC 4(1) will allow shareholders with investments in foreign hybrids that are CFCs or branch-equivalent FIFs to receive tax credits for the foreign tax paid by the shareholder. • The underlying foreign tax credit rules in subpart LF will allow corporate shareholders to receive these credits to offset their foreign dividend withholding payment for tax paid in respect of the foreign hybrid. New section CD 10B will reduce the amount of a dividend received from a foreign hybrid if the New Zealand shareholder has paid foreign tax on income earned by the hybrid. Similarly, there will be changes to the definition of “costs” in sections EX 44 (comparative value method) and EX 45 (deemed rate of return method) to take into account the foreign tax paid by the New Zealand shareholder on income earned by the hybrid. 103 Background Under New Zealand’s domestic tax legislation, an interest in a foreign hybrid entity is treated as an interest in a “company” and taxed as such. An investment by a New Zealand-resident in a foreign company will usually be treated as an investment in a CFC or a FIF. An investor in a CFC (or FIF) can usually claim a foreign tax credit for tax paid on its foreign income. Uncertainty arises, however, as to whether New Zealand members of a foreign hybrid entity can claim a foreign tax credit against their New Zealand income tax liabilities under the current tax credit provisions in the Act. The uncertainty arises because, under the CFC credit provision, a credit is given only for foreign tax paid by the CFC. Yet a foreign hybrid, that is a CFC, does not actually pay the tax because the tax is paid by its members. A further technical problem is that it is uncertain whether a foreign hybrid cannot qualify for the grey list exemption from the CFC or FIF rules because of the flow- through tax treatment in the foreign jurisdiction. 104 EXEMPTION FOR INTERESTS IN EMPLOYMENT-RELATED FOREIGN SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES (Clause 73) Summary of proposed amendments The exemption for interests in employment-related foreign superannuation schemes, contained in section EX 36 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will be extended to apply to returning residents. It will be made permanent for all interests that were acquired in the first five years of each new period of New Zealand residence. The measure will improve the tax treatment of new migrants and returning residents who hold interests in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme, and increase the overall level of exemption for these interests under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. It is also consistent with and builds on proposals for the temporary exemption from tax on foreign income for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2006 for people arriving in New Zealand on or after this date, with application from the 2005-06 income year and subsequent income years. Key features The exemption for interests in employment-related foreign superannuation schemes in section EX 36 of the Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended to: • apply to returning residents – currently the exemption applies to new migrants only; • provide a permanent exemption for all superannuation interests acquired within the first five years of New Zealand residence – currently the exemption applies to interests acquired by a person before they first became a New Zealand resident for tax purposes; and • apply after any period of non-residence. Background The measure is part of the wider policy initiative to resolve problems associated with the New Zealand tax treatment of accrued entitlements in foreign superannuation schemes. The issue was raised in the context of Australia’s Superannuation Guarantee Scheme at last year’s Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum. 105 Individuals working in Australia generally have compulsory contributions made on their behalf by their employers into an Australian superannuation fund. In general, Australian and New Zealand citizens cannot access these superannuation interests until they reach retirement age. If they migrate or return to New Zealand they could be subject to tax on those interests, under New Zealand’s FIF rules. The FIF rules currently tax the income earned by a foreign entity (such as a foreign superannuation scheme) on the interests held by New Zealand residents. They ensure that foreign income earned by a foreign superannuation scheme on behalf of New Zealand residents is subject to New Zealand tax. An “interest” includes an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme. Consultation with the private sector has indicated that people with Australian superannuation interests may not be complying correctly with their tax obligations under the FIF rules and, indeed, may not even be aware that they have to account for tax. It is likely that this non-compliance is not unique to people with Australian superannuation interests. For those people who are aware of their tax responsibilities, determining whether they are required to pay tax under the FIF rules can involve high compliance costs. Although the current exemptions provide some relief from the rules, the difficulty is determining which exemption applies and how to meet the continuing requirements of the exemption if a person wants to continue to contribute to a foreign superannuation scheme after moving to New Zealand. An inconsistency has also been identified in the way new migrants and returning residents to New Zealand are treated under the rules. There are more exemptions available to new migrants than for returning residents, giving rise to concerns about equity and consistency. For example, the current exemption for interests in employment-related foreign superannuation schemes applies to new migrants only and to interests acquired while the person concerned was not a resident of New Zealand. The proposed amendment specifically addresses the inconsistency in the FIF treatment of new migrants and returning residents and increases the level of exemption for interests in employment-related superannuation schemes. Therefore, the amendment will improve the overall equity of the FIF rules and decrease the tax burden and the associated compliance costs for those people affected. Proposal under consideration In his speech to the International Fiscal Association on 29 April 2005, the Minister of Finance and Revenue signalled the government’s intention to amend the FIF rules to exempt interests in specified Australian superannuation schemes, subject to further work by officials. The change will apply to new migrants and returning residents to New Zealand who hold interests in an employment-related superannuation scheme in which the entitlements under the scheme are generally locked in until retirement. 106 Further work on the exemption is required to determine the appropriate scope of the exemption. This work will consider whether the exemption should be extended to all Australian superannuation scheme interests and, if so, whether the extension will resolve the longstanding compliance issues or remove the disincentive for people to take up long-term or permanent employment in New Zealand. The government hopes to be in a position to make decisions on this matter so that any amending legislation can be included in the first taxation bill to be introduced next year. Consultation on the proposal will be undertaken as part of the generic tax policy process. Detailed analysis Scope of the exemption The exemption applies to new migrants and returning residents to New Zealand who hold employment-related foreign superannuation scheme interests. It will permanently exempt from the FIF rules interests that they acquired when they were not residents of New Zealand and interests acquired up to the end of the fifth year of New Zealand residence following each period of non-residence. If a new migrant or returning resident continues to contribute to the scheme after five years of New Zealand residence, the current “de minimis” exemption 22 would then apply to interests acquired from day one of the sixth year – provided the total cost of the superannuation interests (and other FIF interests) at all times in the income year is $50,000 or less. Thus, they would need to disclose their interests and calculate FIF income on those interests only if they continue to make contributions after the fifth year of residence and the cost of those interests (and other FIF interests) exceeds $50,000. Scope of the exemption Exempt/taxable Interests acquired while non-resident Exempt Interests acquired in the first five years of New Zealand residence Exempt Interests acquired after the fifth year of New Zealand residence Income related to those interests is taxable if the cost of these interests, together with other FIF interests, total more than $50,000 22 If the aggregate cost of all interests held by a person at all times in the income year is $50,000 or less, those interests are exempt. This exemption is referred to as the “de minimis exemption”. In determining whether the $50,000 threshold has been met, exempt interests are ignored but all other interests are taken into account. 107 Relationship to the temporary exemption from tax on foreign income Under the temporary exemption from tax on foreign income, employees who have not been resident in New Zealand for at least ten years would be entitled to a five-year exemption from tax on all foreign-sourced income, including any FIF interests (except dividends, interest, employment income and business income relating to services performed offshore). If the new migrant or returning New Zealander is not an employee, that person would be entitled to a three-year exemption. If these people continue to reside in New Zealand they could be subject to the FIF rules on all interests that they hold at the end of the prescribed time periods. The employment-related foreign superannuation exemption gives further relief by providing a permanent exemption for any employment-related foreign superannuation scheme interests acquired when the person involved was not a resident of New Zealand or that were acquired in the first five years of New Zealand residence. There are two key differences between the temporary exemption for foreign income and the exemption for interests in employment-related foreign superannuation schemes. First, the temporary exemption from tax for foreign income will apply to individuals who were non-resident for at least ten years. However, the employment-related foreign superannuation scheme exemption applies to returning residents after any period of non-residence. The reason for this difference is that people working overseas for even short periods are often required to take out superannuation (as opposed to acquiring other forms of FIF interests). Accordingly, an exemption should be available for returning residents who have been non-resident for any period. Secondly, the temporary exemption from tax for foreign income applies only once in a person’s lifetime. There is no such limitation on the exemption for interests in employment-related foreign superannuation schemes. 108 ROLLOVER OF EXEMPTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN LISTED CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES (Clause 77) Summary of proposed amendments The statutory life of a provision exempting investments into certain controlled foreign companies (CFCs) that are listed on a recognised stock exchange will be extended by several years. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment and will apply up to and including the 2010-11 tax year. Key features The statutory life of the exemption from the CFC rules, currently contained in section EZ 29 of the Income Tax Act 2004, is being extended so that it applies up to and including the 2010-11 tax year. Background Section EZ 29 of the Income Tax Act 2004 provides an exemption from the CFC rules in certain circumstances if the CFC is resident in a “grey list” country and the company is listed on a recognised exchange in that country. (The grey list consists of Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Norway.) The exemption applies if, by virtue of the grey list country’s stock exchange listing rules, the New Zealand resident holding the CFC interest cannot obtain sufficient information to calculate income under the CFC rules. The exemption will apply if the stock exchange listing rules of the grey list country: • prevent the CFC from providing sufficient information for the person to calculate CFC income; or • provide that, if the CFC gives sufficient information for the person to calculate CFC income, the CFC is required to make a further disclosure of information that would be harmful to the CFC’s commercial interests. The exemption currently applies to the 2001-02 to 2005-06 income years. The amendment will extend the application of this provision up to and including the 2010- 11 tax year. 109 INCREASE IN THE CHILD REBATE (Clause 89) Summary of proposed amendments The maximum child rebate payable will increase from $156 to $351 a year. This will allow an eligible child to earn income (less interest and dividends) up to $2,340 per annum, tax-free. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2006-07 income year. Key features Section KC 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will be amended to increase the maximum child rebate payable from $156 to $351 per annum. Background The child rebate was introduced in 1978 to avoid the need for children to pay tax on small amounts of income. As the child rebate has not been increased since 1983, its real value has eroded over time. Consequently, an increasing number of children are earning income which exceeds the current rebate threshold. This is problematic as some child taxpayers incur compliance costs in relation to small amounts of income earned, while others fail to meet their tax obligations. When children comply, administrative costs associated with collecting and processing small amounts of tax can exceed the revenue collected. Following the increase in the child rebate, some eligible children will no longer be required to deduct tax or meet other tax obligations for the income they earn. All eligible children whose annual income exceeds $1,040 (less interest and dividends) will benefit from the increase. Children who are under the age of 15, or under the age of 18 and attending primary or secondary school, or who turned 18 in the preceding income year and are still at school, are eligible to receive the rebate. 110 REVERSE TAKEOVERS AND CONTINUITY RULES (Clauses 143(25), (26) and (27), 146 and 147) Summary of proposed amendments The concessionary continuity rules, which apply to carrying forward losses and imputation credits when there is a change in a company’s shareholding, are being extended to recognise that continuity can be maintained through reverse takeovers or mergers. The new rules apply when both of the companies involved in the takeover or merger are widely held or listed companies. Application date The new rules will apply from the date of enactment. Key features A new section OD 5AA is being inserted into the Income Tax Act 2004 to provide a new ownership tracing rule for reverse takeovers. The new rule will apply to a “changeover” in a limited attribution company (the initial parent) which is treated as holding ownership interests in another company (the subsidiary). A “changeover” can be a change in ownership, or a situation where the initial parent ceases to exist because of an amalgamation. Continuity will not be lost if: • immediately before the changeover the initial parent is treated as holding all the ownership interests in the subsidiary; and • immediately after the changeover another limited attribution company (the new parent) is treated as holding all the ownership interests in the subsidiary; and • immediately after the changeover all or part of the ownership interests in the new parent are treated as being held by the persons who were treated as shareholders of the initial parent (the initial shareholders) immediately before the changeover; and • there is commonality (49% for the carry forward of losses, or 66% for the carry forward of imputation and dividend withholding payment credits) in: – the ownership interests in the initial company that are treated as being held by the initial shareholders immediately before the changeover; and – the ownership interests in the new parent that are treated as being held by the initial shareholders immediately after the changeover. The definition of “limited attribution company” has been redrafted and moved to section OB 1 but, in effect, remains the same: 111 A “limited attribution company” is a: (a) building society (b) co-operative company (c) listed company (d) widely held company; and (e) foreign company that is not closely held. Background Normally a company must have a continuity of shareholding of 49% to enable it to carry forward its tax losses for New Zealand income tax purposes. In relation to imputation credits, the required continuity percentage is 66%. These continuity rules are premised on tracing shareholding through groups of companies back to non- corporate shareholders. Concessionary continuity rules allow for the fact that this is not practical in a number of circumstances. The concessionary continuity rules do not currently provide continuity when a smaller widely-held listed company takes over or merges with a larger one. However, at least conceptually, the takeover or merger itself might not cause a breach of the continuity rules. Such a takeover or merger should not result in the forfeiture of tax losses or imputation credits when the continuity of shareholding thresholds of at least 49% or 66% are satisfied. 112 INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendments The bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2005-06 tax year. Application date The provision will apply for the 2005-06 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2005-06 tax year will be set at the rates specified in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The rates in Schedule 1 that apply for the 2005-06 year are those that applied for the 2004-05 year. Background The Income Tax Act 2004 provides that income tax is imposed on taxable income, at the rate or rates of tax fixed by an annual taxing Act. 113 ADDITION OF SPAIN TO THE GREY LIST (Clause 149) Summary of proposed amendments Spain is being added to the “grey list” of countries to which the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules do not generally apply. However, investments in CFCs that take advantage of certain concessionary rules in Spain will not receive the advantage of the grey list exemption. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2006-07 tax year. Key features Part A of Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (the grey list) will be amended to include Spain. Part B of Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 is also being amended to include certain corporate income tax regimes in the Canary Islands, Ceuta, Melilla, Alava, Guipúzcoa, Vizcaya and Navarra. Investments in CFCs that take advantage of regimes in these regions are not eligible for the grey list exemption. Background The grey list is the list of countries contained in Part A of Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004. To be included on the grey list, a country’s tax system must meet certain Cabinet-agreed criteria. Spain meets these criteria. Spain has a number of concessionary regimes that would present tax minimisation and deferral opportunities in New Zealand. Such regimes in grey list countries are listed in Part B of Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Under the new rules, CFC investments taking advantage of these regimes will not receive grey list treatment. 114 FARM CONVERSIONS (Clauses 45, 46, 143(12), 143(47), 150, 193, 200(4), 200(5), and 201) Summary of proposed amendments The bill clarifies the extent to which regrassing and fertilising expenditure that is associated with a significant capital activity, such as a farm conversion, is to be treated on capital account. The amendments will also provide that in all other circumstances, regrassing and fertilising expenditure will be fully deductible in the year incurred. The capital account treatment will be updated to provide faster amortisation of expenditure to reflect modern farming practices involving shorter pasture rotation cycles. Provision will also be made for the amortisation rates for farming and agricultural expenditure to be updated in future by Order in Council. Application date The amendments will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 2004. Key features • Capital account treatment: To the extent that regrassing and fertilising expenditure is incurred in connection with a significant capital activity, such as a farm conversion, it will be amortised at 45% of the diminished value of that expenditure each year. Schedule 7 to both the Income Tax Acts 1994 and 2004 will be amended to achieve this while retaining the current 6% amortisation rate for expenditure incurred when preparing land for farming or agriculture. • Specific limitations: The two limitations provided to further clarify the boundary between capital and revenue account will exclude from capital account treatment expenditure that is associated with: – pasture that has an estimated useful life of one year or less because it would ordinarily be deductible under ordinary principles (see the amendments to section DO 3 of the 1994 Act and section DO 1 of the 2004 Act); and – changes in the intensity of farming activities. This could include, for example, moving from eight (low intensity) to 12 (high intensity) sheep or other stock units per hectare. The change will provide consistency regardless of any debate that could support different tax positions such as whether the change occurs in one year, more gradually over a number of years, or as a result of changes in the general technology of farming practices (see the amendments to section OB 1 that define “significant capital activity”). 115 • Revenue account treatment: Regrassing and fertilising expenditure will be fully deductible in the year it is incurred unless it is required to be treated on capital account and amortised. Section DO 3 of the 1994 Act and section DO 1 of the 2004 Act will be amended to provide for this. Background Inland Revenue published guidelines (Operational Statement 007) in July 2004 on the treatment of expenditure in converting farms from one agricultural purpose to another. These guidelines set out Inland Revenue’s position on the treatment of regrassing and fertiliser expenditure – that it should be treated on capital account and amortised over time. Reaction from accountants and farmers questioned the appropriateness of the result in light of modern farming practices and particularly because any regrassing and fertilising expenditure not considered to be fully and immediately deductible would be required to be amortised at a rate of 6% a year. The amendments were developed in consultation with these groups to update the income tax rules in response to the concerns raised. 116 117 Other changes to the GST Act 118 119 GST ON GOODS AND SERVICES SUPPLIED TO SECURITY HOLDERS (Clauses 203(2) and (6), 204, 205(2) and (4), 206, 207(2) and (5), and 209) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments clarify the application of GST to supplies of financial services following a recent Court of Appeal decision, Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Gulf Harbour Development Limited. 23 They also respond to concerns raised in the discussion document, GST and financial services regarding the definition of “financial services”. 24 The amendments: • protect the integrity of the tax base by ensuring that the consumption of goods and services in New Zealand remains subject to GST even though the rights to consume those goods and services were purchased using a GST-exempt debt, equity or participatory security; • achieve this objective through rules that will require supplies of normally taxable goods and services that are made as part of a supply of financial services to persons in the form of debt, equity or participatory securities to be treated in a similar way as supplies between “associated persons”; and • clarify the extent to which supplies can be treated as exempt supplies of financial services in this situation. Application date The amendments, unless otherwise specified below, will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The key changes to the GST Act are: • A new term, “associated supply”, will be inserted into section 2. An “associated supply” includes: – supplies of goods and services for which the supplier and the recipient are associated persons; and/or – the supply of a right, under a debt security, equity security or participatory security, to a supply of goods and services which may be for a consideration that is other than at open market value. 23 See Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Gulf Harbour Development Limited, CA 5 November 2004, CA 135/03. 24 See GST and financial services; a government discussion document, released October 2002, page 40. 120 • The meaning of the term “supply” will be amended by inserting new section 5(14B). Section 5(14B) will apply if part of a supply of a debt, equity, or participatory security involves an “associated supply”. The section treats the “associated supply” as separate from the debt security, equity security or participatory security. Section 5(14B) will apply to securities that are supplied on and after the date of enactment. • The application of section 14(1)(a), which exempts the supply of financial services, will be modified. Existing sections 14(1)(a)(i) and (ii) will be moved to section 14(1B)(a) and (c) respectively. Section 14(1B) also includes a new paragraph (b) (which will apply to financial services supplied on and after the date of enactment) that excludes from the financial services exemption supplies that come within paragraph (b) of the definition of “associated supply” – that is, the supply of rights to goods and services under a debt, equity or participatory security. Other changes include: • Section 10(3), which treats transactions between associated persons as made at “open market value”, will be amended to extend to transactions covered by the definition of “associated supply”. • Section 9(2)(a), which determines the time of supply involving transactions between “associated persons”, will be amended to extend to all transactions covered by the definition of “associated supply”. The time of supply for “associated supply” transactions will be the earlier of when: – an invoice is issued; – payment is made in respect of the supply; – the goods are removed by the recipient or made available to the recipient; – the services are performed. • Section 3(3)(b), which removes from the definition of “financial services” debt, equity and participatory securities to the extent that they include an interest in land, will be repealed as the exclusion for these securities will be covered by the definition of “associated supply” section 5(14B) and section 14(1B)(b). The repeal of this section will apply to securities that are supplied on and after the date of enactment. Background Since its enactment in 1985, the GST Act has contained a number of measures that address the substitution of otherwise taxable goods and services for GST-exempt financial services. Examples of these measures include the exclusions that remove from the definition of “financial services” transactions involving real property and shares in the capital of flat or office-owning companies. These measures are designed to prevent consumer preferences from being distorted as a result of otherwise taxable goods and services being repackaged as exempt financial services. Concerns that similar repackaging could occur for non-land transactions were raised by the government in the discussion document GST and financial services in the context of “participatory securities”. However, as the recent Court of Appeal decision, Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Gulf Harbour Development Limited, has highlighted, the problem of substitution using the definition of “financial services” also applies to equity securities. Similar substitution could occur with debt securities. 121 In the Gulf Harbour case, the taxpayer group of companies entered into an arrangement to provide equity securities which gave the holder access to the facilities of a country club and were redeemable at the end of 75 years for $1. The issue concerned whether the supply should be treated as a taxable supply (club membership) or an exempt financial service. The Court confirmed the principle that as GST is a tax on the supply of goods and services its imposition should be determined by reference to the contractual arrangements between the supplier and the recipient. The Court of Appeal concluded that the redeemable nature of the securities meant that they were “equity securities” as they represented participation in the capital of a body corporate. The supply was therefore exempt from GST. For the most part, determining the GST treatment of a transaction according to its form produces the most efficient tax outcome. This outcome, however, needs to be balanced against the effect that substitution can have on consumer behaviour because of its potential tax advantages. If, in the absence of suitable anti-avoidance measures, a product can be offered without GST, consumers will have an obvious preference for this product over an identical product that is subject to GST, as in the example below. Example 1: Substitution arrangement Alpha Club provides health-club facilities, including gymnasium and aerobic facilities. Membership to Alpha Club costs $1,350 per annum including GST. Alpha Club requires $1,200 (net of GST) from each member per annum to operate. Beta Club, Alpha Club’s competitor, offers comparable facilities and also requires $1,200 (net of GST) per annum from each member to operate. Alpha Club Beta Club Instead of annual membership subscriptions, Beta Club’s members are offered shares in Beta Club’s holding company Beta I Ltd for $11,600. see note The shares are redeemable for $1 in 10 years and permit access to the Beta Club’s facilities which are held by Beta II Ltd. Beta I Ltd treats the supply of the membership share as a GST-exempt supply of financial services. Beta II Ltd charges shareholder members an annual fee of $45 (including GST) to cover maintenance associated costs. The GST consequences arising from the different pricing structures between the competing facilities are as follows: Note: The value of the share is determined by subtracting the nominal annual charge ($40 excluding GST) from the amount required each year from the members ($1,200). Therefore $1,200 - $40 = $1,160. $1,160 x 10 years = $11,600. Alpha Ltd Member MembershipFee $ Beta II Ltd Member SuppliesNominal Fee $ Beta I Ltd Membership share $ Alpha Club Beta Club Taxable supplies $1,350 Exempt supplies $1,160 (allocated per annum) GST collected ($150) Taxable supplies $45 Net amount $1,200 GST collected ($5) Net amount $1,200 GST savings $145 per year 122 Detailed analysis General application The amendments are directed at arrangements involving supplies of goods and services to final consumers with either or both the following features: • The supplies would be taxable supplies but for the terms of the debt security, equity security or participatory security. • The supplies are for a consideration other than market value, which the recipient has a right to receive because of the terms of the debt security, equity security or participatory security. Paragraph (b) of the definition of “associated supply” and section 10(3) will require the supply of a right under a debt, equity or participatory security to be valued at market if it allows the security holder or another person to receive, for no consideration or a consideration less than the open market value, a supply of goods and services. These provisions, in combination with sections 5(14B) and 14(1B), attempt to remove any GST advantages that may arise as a result of: • substituting the supply of otherwise taxable goods and services for a supply of GST exempt financial services; or • substituting the consideration that would otherwise be payable for a supply of taxable goods and services for the consideration payable for the supply of GST- exempt financial services. The GST advantages are removed as the supplier of the debt, equity or participatory security will be required to attribute the consideration received for a GST-exempt security to the supply of the goods and services to the extent of the open market value of those goods and services. Example 2: Marina berth Travis pays $59,000 for a GST-exempt security offered by a company, Construction Ltd, who is constructing a new marina. Once the marina is completed, the security entitles Travis to berth a yacht at the facility. Travis is not required to make any further payments for using the marina facilities. Under the new rules the supplier of the marina will, as a result of paragraph (b) of the definition of “associated supply”, have to attribute (under section 10(3) and section 5(14B)), to the extent of the open market value, some or all of the $59,000 received for the GST-exempt security to the marina berth. 123 Example 3: Company shareholder Maude purchases shares in a company for $20,000. The shares entitle Maude to dividends and supplies of goods and services. Under the new rules the company will, as a result of paragraph (b) of the definition of “associated supply”, have to recognise (under section 10(3) and section 5(14B)), a liability for GST on the market value of the goods and services supplied to Maude if those goods and services are supplied under the rights given by the shares. Limits to the term “associated supply” There are two exclusions from paragraph (b) of the definition of “associated supply”. The exclusions apply if the debt, equity or participatory security: • gives a right to exempt supplies of goods and services, such as bonus share issues or residential accommodation; or • provides rights in relation to the control of the issuer, such as voting rights. These exclusions attempt to remove rights that would be exempt from GST or that are inherently associated with shares from the definition of “associated supply”. Market value The objective of the amendments is to ensure that GST correctly applies to supplies of taxable goods and services that arise as a result of a final consumer holding a debt, equity or participatory security. Although the amendments apply to “associated supplies” to both consumer and business security holders, the valuation rules in sections 10(3) and 10(3A) mean that the requirement to value at open market value goods and services treated as separately supplied under section 5(14B) at open market value generally arises only in respect of final consumers. Specifically, “associated supplies” acquired by recipients for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and who are entitled to deduct input tax on that supply are excluded from the open market value requirement. This exclusion reflects the fact that the transaction between the supplier and the recipient is effectively GST-neutral because the GST liability on the supplier would be offset by a corresponding deduction of input tax of equal value by the recipient. The open market value rules also do not apply if the consideration for the “associated supply” equals or is greater than the open market value of the supply. Section 4, which defines “open market value”, uses a “willing buyer/willing seller” test to determine the open market value of a supply. Inland Revenue has made a number of observations about the terms used in the definition of “open market value”. 25 The terms “similar circumstances” and “freely offered” in section 4 are particularly relevant for the treatment of goods and services that are supplied to the security holder for a discount. 25 See Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 6, Number 14 (June 1995), pages 6 to 8. 124 If an “associated supply” arises as a result of a discount, because a security holder holds a security in the GST-registered person supplying the goods and services, whether the discounted price may be treated as the open market value will depend on the circumstances under which the discount is offered. The discounted price could equate to open market value if, for example, it was comparable to a discount offered to an arm’s-length third-party or to the general public. Example 4: Company shareholder Cally pays $11,000 for a parcel (5,000) of shares in Global Retail Ltd. The shares allow shareholders to vote at shareholder meetings and receive dividends. Shareholders of Global Retail Ltd are also entitled to acquire goods and services from Global Retail’s subsidiary company Local Retail Ltd for a discounted amount. The discount is 5% and is equivalent to discounts offered under Local Retail’s frequent shopper programme once the shopper has spent more than $500 in three months. The membership security is GST-exempt when supplied. However, if Cally purchases goods from Local Retail Ltd for a discount, consideration should be given at the time of supply as to whether GST should be returned on the full purchase price of the goods rather that the discounted price. As the discount offered by Local Retail Ltd is comparable to the discount it offers its customers under its frequent shopper programme, Local Retail is not required to return GST on the full price. 125 GST AND INTERNATIONAL POSTAGE STAMPS (Clauses 205(1) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment GST pricing advantages for postal operators who are not required to register under the Postal Services Act 1998, and therefore are arguably not required to pay GST on international outbound mail delivery, will be removed. The GST Act definition of “postage stamp” is linked to the Postal Services Act. The imposition of GST on postage stamps for international outbound mail is based on whether a person is registered under the Postal Services Act rather than on the nature of the postal services supplied. The differential GST treatment between registered and non- registered postal operators should be removed. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Key features The amendment will remove from the GST Act the reference to the definition of “postage stamp” as contained in the Postal Services Act and replace it with a generic definition of “postage stamp” in section 5(11I)(a) of the GST Act. The amendment clarifies that all postage stamps supplied in New Zealand are subject to GST, irrespective of whether the stamps are used to send mail overseas and irrespective of whether the seller is registered under the Postal Services Act. Background The sale or issue of the token, stamp or voucher is the supply for GST purposes. A supplier may treat as the supply the redemption of a token, stamp or voucher instead of the issue or sale if it is not practical to treat the issue or sale as the supply. If the supply occurs on redemption it can arguably be zero-rated as a transport of goods, as the “goods” are being transported at the time of redemption. However, this is not the case if the supply occurs on sale or issue. The GST Act provides that the ability to treat the supply as occurring on redemption – and therefore zero-rated – does not apply to a “postage stamp” as defined in the Postal Services Act. This means that postal operators registered under the Postal Services Act have to charge GST on sale or issue of the stamp, whereas postal operators not regulated by the Postal Services Act can, arguably, zero-rate stamps issued for international mail. 126 Ensuring that GST applies to the supply in New Zealand of postage stamps for international mail is consistent with the general policy of taxing services that are consumed in New Zealand at the single rate of 12.5%. The New Zealand-based sender of the mail is considered to receive the benefit of having it sent to another person and therefore as having consumed the postal services in New Zealand. 127 GST AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM A TRUST MADE FOR NO CONSIDERATION BETWEEN ASSOCIATED REGISTERED PERSONS (Clauses 207(1) and (3) to (4)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment to the GST Act clarifies that distributions from a testamentary trust or by way of a gift between associated registered persons are revenue neutral. The proposed amendment ensures that the market valuation rule does not apply if the supply is made for no consideration and the registered recipient applies the goods and services in a taxable activity from the time of supply. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Key feature Section 10 of the GST Act 1985 is being amended to preserve the intended revenue- neutral effect of a supply of goods and services between two registered associated persons when the goods or services are applied in the recipient’s taxable activity from the time of supply. Background The distribution of property to a beneficiary under a testamentary trust on the death of a registered person, or as a gift, is a supply for GST purposes. Such supplies will generally be between associated persons. Supplies for no consideration between associated persons are valued for GST purposes at the open market value of the supply under section 10(3) of the GST Act. This rule applies when the supply is made to an unregistered beneficiary, or a registered beneficiary receives goods or services in their private capacity. This valuation rule does not apply if the supply was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and the associated supplier and recipient are both registered for GST purposes: section 10(3A) of the GST Act. In this situation the value of the supply is treated as the amount actually paid, which in the case of a distribution under a trust is nil, the rationale being that with two registered associates the result is tax neutral whatever valuation is used. 128 In the case of a supply made under a testamentary trust or as a gift between two GST- registered persons, the recipient could be regarded as merely receiving the goods as a beneficiary. The recipient has no purpose of acquisition. Therefore output tax would be charged at the open market value. The beneficiary would be denied an input tax deduction because the goods were not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The transaction would no longer be tax neutral as intended by section 10(3A). The amendment seeks to remove this anomaly. 129 GST ON GOODS OUTSIDE NEW ZEALAND AT THE TIME OF SUPPLY (Clause 208) Summary of proposed amendments An amendment confirms that goods such as motor vehicles that are contracted for and consumed in New Zealand but located outside New Zealand at the time of supply are charged at the standard rate of GST. It is a revenue base protection measure designed to prevent the attempted avoidance of GST by using third parties to import goods that were offshore at the time of supply. A second amendment deals with the possibility of the first amendment giving rise to double taxation when GST is payable on the supply of goods under the contract and again payable (but not able to be claimed back by way of input tax credit) on importation of the goods. Application date The amendments will apply to supplies made on or after the date of introduction of the bill. Key features Section 11(1)(j) of the Goods and Services Act 1985 (the GST Act) is being amended to allow zero-rating of goods outside New Zealand only if the goods are not in New Zealand at the time of delivery to the recipient. This confirms that the standard rate of GST should apply to goods consumed in New Zealand. A specific rule is also being included to eliminate the possibility of consequential double taxation by allowing the supply to be zero-rated if the recipient pays GST on the import to the New Zealand Customs Service. Double taxation could arise if the recipient is unregistered and imports the goods but is unable to claim an input tax credit on the GST paid on import. By allowing the supply to be zero-rated the double impost is avoided but GST is still collected at the border. Background The amendments confirm the principle that GST should be applied to goods consumed in New Zealand. Section 11(1)(j) is intended to allow a zero-rate of GST to be applied to a supply of goods not consumed in New Zealand that would otherwise attract the standard rate of GST. 130 For example, a New Zealand-resident car dealer contracts with a recipient to provide a vehicle that, at the time of supply, is in Australia (possibly held in an Australian branch or warehouse). Rather than using the vehicle in New Zealand the recipient retains the vehicle in Australia to use in its Australian operations. In the absence of section 11(1)(j), the vehicle would be considered to be supplied in New Zealand and GST would be required to be applied at the standard rate. However, section 11(1)(j) overcomes this by zero-rating the supply if the vehicle is not going to be used in New Zealand. The main amendment removes the incentive to insert third parties to perform importing functions in an attempt to avoid GST, This is achieved in the amendment by focusing on the physical delivery of the goods to the recipient. The related amendment includes a specific rule to deal with double taxation occurring in some situations. This may occur where the New Zealand recipient is unregistered and assumes responsibility for importing the goods contracted for with the New Zealand retailer. Without the additional specific rule, the consumer would be required to pay GST to the New Zealand retailer on the supply and on the importation of the goods. The specific rule zero-rates the supply, thereby eliminating the double impost and instead relies on GST being collected on importation. The outcome is that GST is paid, albeit at a different collection point. 131 Other changes to the Tax Administration Act 132 133 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 (TAA) (Clauses 155(17) and (23), 164, 165, 166, and 167) A number of minor remedial amendments are required following enactment of the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 (the amending Act) which made changes to the disputes resolution process contained in the Tax Administration Act (TAA) 1994. Two-month response period to a notice of disputable decision Section 3 contains a definition of “response period” within which parties to a dispute must produce the relevant document. The two-month response period for taxpayers to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to their self-assessment or the Commissioner’s assessment was changed in the amending Act to four months. However, the response period for a taxpayer to issue a NOPA to a disputable decision that is not a notice of assessment remains at two months. For consistency, the two-month period for a taxpayer to issue a NOPA to a notice of disputable decision should also be changed to four months. The amendment applies from 1 April 2005, the date the new disputes rules took effect. Commissioner may issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA Section 89C allows the Commissioner to issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA in certain circumstances. Section 89C(db), introduced in the amending Act, provides for a new circumstance where the assessment is made in respect of the facts and law which are identical to a previous assessment of the taxpayer “...for another income year...”. The amendment ensures that this exclusion also applies to previous GST return periods as well as income years. The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Suspension of the dispute in a test case The amending Act introduced a new section 89O to allow for the suspension of a dispute following the outcome of a test case. The suspension may be agreed in relation to a dispute between the Commissioner and a taxpayer if the Commissioner has designated a case involving another taxpayer as a test case. Any applicable time bars are stayed until the outcome of the test case. 134 The period of the suspension starts from the date of the agreement and ends on the earliest of: • the date of the court’s decision in the test case: or • the date on which the test case or the dispute is otherwise resolved. A further provision describes the period of time within which the Commissioner must make the assessment. The period could require the Commissioner to issue the assessment on the date of the relevant decision. Practically, it will not be possible to issue the assessment if the period from the application to the time bar is not included in the time allowed for the suspension. The amendment clarifies that the period starting on the date of the agreement (made within the time bar) is in addition to the period within which the Commissioner must make the assessment (the four-year time bar). If the agreement to suspend the dispute is reached shortly before the application of the time bar, the amendment allows a further 60 days to issue the assessment. The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Application to High Court to issue an assessment without completing the disputes process Section 89N applies in situations where the Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to allow more time to complete the disputes process, or issue an assessment without completion of the disputes process. The period of time is the total of the four-year time bar, and the period of time that starts on the date of the application (made within the time bar) and ends on the earliest of the date of the Court’s decision, the date on which the application or dispute is otherwise resolved. The period could require that the Commissioner issue the assessment on the date the relevant decision is made, rather than also allowing the time from the date of the application to the time bar to be included in the total time of the suspension. The proposed amendment clarifies that the period starting on the date of the application is in addition to the period within which the Commissioner must make the assessment (the four-year time bar). The amendment applies from the date of enactment. 135 Request for information under a statute Section 89N(1)(c)(vi) enables the Commissioner to issue an assessment without completing the disputes process where the disputant has failed to comply with an information request. The provision of information is generally required by the Commissioner under the TAA. Therefore the proposed amendment replaces all references to the word “request” in the provision allowing the Commissioner to issue an assessment without completing the disputes process with the word “require”. The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Cross reference correction Section 89D(2C) provides that if the Commissioner has made a GST assessment for a taxpayer, the taxpayer can dispute the assessment only if they provide a return for the relevant GST-return period. The proposed amendment provides that the general requirement in section 16(3) of the GST Act for a return to contain a notice of assessment does not apply in this case. The amendment applies from the date of enactment.
Implementing the carbon tax A government consultation paper Hon Dr Michael Cullen Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Hon Pete Hodgson Convenor, Ministerial Group on Climate Change First published in May 2005 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Implementing the carbon tax – a government consultation paper. ISBN 0-478-27125-5 FOREWORD Climate change is one of the biggest environmental challenges facing the world today. It is a global problem that needs a global solution. In ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, New Zealand has joined more than 140 other countries in making a strong commitment to begin controlling emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. The Kyoto Protocol is designed to begin a long-term global economic transition to a future in which limits will increasingly be put on emissions. It does this by attaching a price to greenhouse gas emissions. That price is determined through the international trading of emissions units, with each unit representing one tonne of carbon dioxide or equivalent. Under Kyoto, the price of fossil fuels better reflects the environmental costs of using them , and business and consumer choices will begin to take these environmental costs into account. Following extensive consultation, in 2002 the government announced a package of policies that New Zealand will implement in responding to climate change. As part of that package, it was decided that the international price of emissions should initially be reflected in our economy through a carbon tax, approximating the international price of emissions but capped at NZ$25/tonne for the first Kyoto commitment period, 2008 to 2012. Carbon tax revenue will not be used to improve the Crown’s fiscal position: it will be recycled into the economy through the tax system. We view the carbon tax as a transitional path toward full or partial emissions trading, which may become a better option as world markets develop. This consultation paper provides further implementation details on the carbon tax, and seeks views on its proposed operation. It is a technical paper, and will primarily be of interest to industries that will be directly involved in its implementation, such as fuel suppliers and firms that carry out certain industrial processes. Most New Zealand consumers and businesses will not pay the tax directly. Rather, they will see changes in the relative prices of different sources of energy, transport options, and other products. Even though the flow-on effects of the carbon tax will not affect most household budgets by more than a few dollars a week, it will make a significant contribution to our adjustment to a world in which the environmental costs of our choices can no longer be avoided. Tackling climate change will not be easy, but it is our obligation to future generations to try. The New Zealand government is proud to be part of the global effort that is taking the first step.

They are increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in the Earth heating up at an accelerated rate. Weather patterns and climatic conditions are changing in the process. This is known as climate change. Unless global action is taken to curb the emission of greenhouse gases, the impacts of climate change are expected to become increasingly severe. 1.2 New Zealand and over 140 other countries are working to begin to reduce emissions through the Kyoto Protocol. The Protocol is designed to be the first step in a transition to a future in which limits will increasingly be put on greenhouse gas emissions. The key mechanism for achieving reductions is a “cap and trade” system of emissions allocations – each country receives a capped allowance of emissions, then trading is allowed between countries to encourage least-cost abatement. Trading establishes an international price for greenhouse gas emissions. 1.3 In 2002 the government consulted on, then confirmed, a package of domestic policies for responding to climate change. As part of that package, it was decided that the international price of emissions should be introduced to the New Zealand economy through a carbon tax, approximating the international price of emissions but capped at NZ$25/tonne for the first Kyoto commitment period, 2008 to 2012. 1.4 Revenue from the carbon tax will be “recycled” by reducing other taxes by the amount expected to be collected. How this will be achieved will be announced in the 2005 Budget. 1.5 This consultation paper provides further detail and seeks comments on the proposed implementation of the carbon tax. It will primarily be of interest to industries that will be directly involved in implementation of the tax, such as fuel suppliers and firms involved in certain industrial processes. Feedback is sought on how it will apply to specific industries, and whether the detailed design proposals in this paper can be improved. 1.6 Most New Zealand consumers and businesses will not pay the tax directly. Rather, they will see changes in the relative prices of different sources of energy, transport options, and other products. These price changes will provide an incentive to switch to cleaner energy sources and make better use of energy. More information on the implications of the carbon tax for consumers and businesses is available on the Climate Change Office website, www.climatechange.govt.nz . 2 1.7 The carbon tax is to be applied to production and importation of various products known to result in emissions to the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, methane, and certain other greenhouse gases when used. The tax will also apply to some other human-induced emissions of these gases. 1.8 A consistent price will be put on these emissions, initially set at $15 a tonne of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent. The rate of the tax will not be changed in the first commitment period unless it diverges significantly and on a sustained basis from the international price, nor will it exceed $25 a tonne. 1.9 The carbon tax will come into effect on 1 April 2007. Starting on 1 April 2007 will help to ensure that progress on reducing emissions begins early, enabling a more gradual transition to an economy with lower emissions. 1.10 The design of the tax aims to minimise the administrative costs of government and the compliance costs of those liable to pay the tax or eligible to claim rebates. 1.11 The tax is intended to affect only emissions for which New Zealand is responsible under the Kyoto Protocol, 1 which limits it to emissions occurring within New Zealand. If a fossil fuel that has been taxed is exported or the greenhouse gases from it are permanently embedded or sequestered (other than in biomass), rebates will be available. Rebates will also be available to firms with Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements, to ensure that New Zealand remains internationally competitive. 1.12 Legislation giving effect to the tax will be introduced late this year or early next year, and is expected to be enacted by the third quarter of 2006. 1.13 The Inland Revenue Department and the Customs Service will administer the carbon tax. The following types of firms are likely to be required to file regular returns with Inland Revenue: • firms that mine petroleum products 2 except for crude oil that is sold in its raw state; • firms that mine coal; • oil refineries, in regard to production of emissions in the course of their activities; • firms that supply jet fuel to a domestic flight of a domestic airline; • firms that use geothermal energy for process heat or electricity generation; 1 For further information on the Kyoto Protocol and the government’s climate change policies, refer to www.climatechange.govt.nz . 2 Generally petroleum mining permit holders. 3 • firms that carry out certain industrial processes (such as calcination of limestone for cement) that result in emissions; and • firms that seek rebates of the tax, except for the export of most petroleum products. 1.14 Rather than filing regular returns, the following types of firms are likely to be required to pay the tax to the Customs Service, together with any tariff or excise duty and/or GST: • importers of coal, coal products, gas, and refined petroleum products (except crude oil imported through a refinery and jet fuel); • oil refineries, with regard to their refined products (other than jet fuel and non-emitting products); and • importers of carbon anodes, carbon pitch and carbon black. 1.15 Firms seeking rebates for the export of most petroleum products would claim a “drawback” from the Customs Service. 1.16 The carbon tax will apply from 1 April 2007 and continue until the end of the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period, on 31 December 2012. Policy for the second commitment period will be developed before the end of the first commitment period. 1.17 The government is open to the possibility that the carbon tax will be replaced by an emissions trading system when the international carbon market has developed sufficiently. Submissions 1.18 The government welcomes submissions on the proposed approach to implementing proposals in this document. Submissions need not be limited to the suggested submission points. 1.19 Submissions should be addressed to: Carbon Tax C/- The Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Carbon tax” in the subject line. 1.20 The closing date for submissions is 8 July 2005. 4 1.21 Please note that submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982.

Each country starts with an allocation of emissions units equal to its target – in New Zealand’s case, this is 1990 emissions levels. If a country reduces emissions below its target level, it will have surplus emissions units that it is able to sell. Conversely, countries that choose not to cut emissions to their target level will need to buy additional emission units to cover the excess. This trading of units between countries allows cuts to be made where they are most cost-effective and establishes an international price for emissions. 2.3 Putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions is a fundamental element of the Kyoto Protocol. It means that the price of fossil fuels will better reflect the environmental costs of using them, and that business and consumer choices will begin to take these environmental costs into account. 2.4 The carbon tax will signal to investors and consumers that they should reduce emissions when the cost of doing so is less than the cost of the tax. Over time, the broad awareness that there is, and will continue to be, an emissions price will mean lower emissions than would have been the case without a carbon tax. 2.5 Moreover, as international agreements become increasingly challenging beyond 2012, countries that have already integrated a price for emissions into their economies will see a growing competitive advantage over those countries that delay and need to act more abruptly. Coverage 2.6 The carbon tax aims to price all major greenhouse gas emissions, other than methane and nitrous oxide from the agricultural sector, according to their global warming impact, when doing so is feasible and cost-effective. 2.7 Although farming emissions 4 of methane and nitrous oxide are exempt from the tax in the first commitment period, farming groups are contributing to research to help reduce these emissions. 3 Emissions within New Zealand’s National Inventory under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 4 That result from animals and soil. 6 2.8 The tax will apply to New Zealand’s emissions from fossil-fuel based energy supply and use, industrial process emissions, and fugitive energy emissions 5 of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. It will also include perfluorocarbons (PFCs) that result from industrial processes. 2.9 For the present, the government is not considering applying the carbon tax to sources of emissions that will be covered by other policies. They include emissions of synthetic gases, other than PFCs, from process emissions and methane from the waste sector. Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements and business adjustment assistance 2.10 The government has introduced Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements (NGAs) to reduce the risk of economic activity moving from New Zealand to countries with less stringent climate change policies. This “carbon leakage” could occur if the carbon tax reduced the international competitiveness of some firms or industries relative to producers in other countries that do not have similar climate change policies. 2.11 In return for reducing emissions intensity to World’s Best Practice (WBP) levels, eligible firms that successfully negotiate an NGA will receive either a partial or full exemption from the carbon tax. WBP will be determined with reference to the performance of the applicant’s international peers. 2.12 The government has also agreed on policy to assist energy-intensive small to medium-sized enterprises adjust to a carbon tax, and will be working directly with energy-intensive sectors on its implementation. Further details are available at www.climatechange.govt.nz . Expected impacts of the carbon tax 2.13 With the introduction of the carbon tax, consumption and investment are expected to shift to less carbon-intensive goods and services. Responses to the tax could take a wide variety of forms, ranging from investment in more fuel-efficient technology, to improved logistical planning, to substitution of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. Investors and firms involved in carbon-intensive activities may invest in forest sinks 6 or the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme 7 to manage their exposure to the price of greenhouse gas emissions. 5 Fugitive energy emissions are those that leak or are vented during production and use of sources of energy, such as flaring at oil and gas production sites, leaks from gas distribution lines and methane emissions from coal mines. 6 Through the government’s Permanent Forest Sink Initiative – http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/policy-initiatives/sink- credits.html. 7 Under the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme, the government awards internationally tradable emission units to firms undertaking projects that would not otherwise be viable and that will achieve additional reductions in emissions. Further details on Projects can be found on the Climate Change Office website at www.climatechange.govt.nz . 7 2.14 The tax is expected to lead to a one-off increase in some prices. There will be some costs to the economy as a result of the carbon tax, but these are a necessary consequence of New Zealand playing its part in reducing global emissions. However, there will also be offsetting benefits to the economy from the business tax reforms that will be financed by the carbon tax. 2.15 Overall, estimates of the macroeconomic impact vary, although a small but negative impact on economic activity (measured by GDP) is expected. Depending on the international emissions price, GDP in 2010 is likely to be in the order of 0.03% lower than it would otherwise have been. 8 2.16 The effect of a $15 a tonne carbon tax on household budgets is difficult to predict precisely. The complex nature of the electricity supply industry makes a key element, the expected increase in electricity prices, difficult to pin down, and households have a wide range of patterns of energy use. From a current residential price of around 17 cents per kWh, electricity could increase in price anywhere between 0.7 cents and 1.1 cents per kWh. The cost of a $15 a tonne CO 2 tax to a typical household is estimated to total in the order of $4 a week for electricity, petrol and other fuels, assuming average energy usage. 2.17 The table sets out a range of specific energy price increases that could result from the carbon tax, assuming a tax rate of $15 a tonne of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gas and that all of the cost of the tax is passed on to customers, and the wholesalers and retailers do not price to retain their margins (in percentage terms).

Report to DPMC, May 2003. 9 Over 90% of coal used in New Zealand is of the “sub-bituminous” rank. 10 Ignores tax on emissions during gas processing. 8 Fiscal matters 2.18 The revenue from carbon tax will not be used to improve the Crown’s net fiscal position, but will be recycled through the tax system. Tax changes will be announced in the 2005 Budget. 2.19 The carbon tax is also expected to have a number of incidental effects on the government’s fiscal position. Renewable electricity generators, many of which are state-owned, are likely to benefit. The government’s own energy costs will increase. Some forms of income support are also expected to increase as price rises caused by the tax flow through to the Consumer Price Index. These incidental effects will be managed through the normal budget process. The climate change policy package 2.20 In October 2002, following extensive consultation, the New Zealand government confirmed the policies that will assist it to achieve its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. Among these policies are a number of price-based measures that are designed to provide financial incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They include the carbon tax, Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements and the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme. 2.21 Policies have also been developed for specific sectors such as agriculture, forestry, small to medium-sized businesses and local government. 2.22 Other foundation policies which have been in existence for some time and will assist New Zealand to achieve emission reductions include: • the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy, or NEECS, which promotes energy efficiency and conservation and renewable energy through establishment of energy efficiency and renewable energy targets, research, education and some financial support; • the New Zealand Transport Strategy, which guides use of transport services and infrastructure, including support for public transport; • the New Zealand Waste Strategy, which manages waste streams and has contributed to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from landfills; • the government’s Growth and Innovation Framework, since there is a strong relationship between growth in output, energy and CO 2 emissions; • public funding, through the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, of research into energy technologies, including those enabling greater use of renewable energy; • a programme of raising awareness of greenhouse gas emissions and what the public can do about them, run by the Climate Change Office – for example, the “4 million careful owners” campaign; and 9 • the Sustainable Energy Framework work programme, led by the Ministry of Economic Development, which examines longer-term energy options from a sustainability perspective, of which climate change is a major component. 2.23 The policy package is built around commitments made by New Zealand when it ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1993, signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, and ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2002. These commitments signal New Zealand’s commitment to working with the international community to address the global problem of climate change, and allow New Zealand entities to take advantage of the international demand for Kyoto Protocol-compliant emission units. 2.24 Under the Protocol, New Zealand has agreed to limit its greenhouse gas emissions in the first commitment period (2008 to 2012) to 1990 levels or take responsibility for emissions over this target. The long-term goal is to achieve lasting reductions in human-caused emissions. 2.25 See www.climatechange.govt.nz for more details about the government’s climate change policy package. International approaches to incorporating the price of carbon in domestic economies 2.26 Countries such as Denmark, Norway, the UK and the Netherlands have implemented climate change-related taxes 11 (such as a duty on CO 2 in the Netherlands) and Switzerland has recently decided to do so. 2.27 Although developing countries and some economies in transition do not have legally binding emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol some are implementing emission reduction initiatives. In some cases they are doing this in co-operation with developed countries using the Kyoto Protocol’s “Clean Development” mechanism. 12 2.28 Emissions trading has begun in the European Union and in Norway, and is planned to begin in Canada from 2008. 2.29 Japan is considering possible emission pricing instruments. 2.30 Although the USA and Australia have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, they have a number of national and state policies aimed at greenhouse gas emissions (such as Australia’s Mandatory Renewable Energy Target scheme) as well as some voluntary regimes. 11 Some of these may be superseded or modified as a result of participation in the EU ETS. 12 This mechanism allows developed countries to meet their target emissions through emission reduction projects in other countries. 10 Chapter 3 PUTTING A PRICE ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 3.1 Producers and importers of fossil fuels and firms that carry out certain industrial activities that produce greenhouse gas emissions will be responsible for paying the carbon tax. 13 It is expected that they will pass on most of the cost of the tax to their customers. 3.2 Many aspects of the detailed administration of the tax are based on existing systems, such as those for collecting excise duty, GST and the Energy Resources Levy. Minimising the number of points of obligation 3.3 It is not feasible to measure greenhouse gas emissions directly from their countless individual sources. Instead, quantities of products such as coal, gas and oil 14 will be taxed in place of the emissions they are expected to produce when used. Applying a carbon tax in this way is common practice for similar taxes internationally, and was supported by the McLeod Review. 15 3.4 Products will generally be taxed as early in the supply chain as possible, since this will usually result in the smallest number of liable parties, ensure comprehensive coverage and minimise the administration and compliance costs of the tax. 3.5 For example, coal will be levied as the miner sells it (other than for export) or uses it, or as it is imported. There are relatively few coal miners and importers compared with the number of users. A user of coal “downstream” from the miner or the importer would see the impact of the tax indirectly, through the price paid to its supplier. 3.6 Some products will not be taxed at the first point in the supply chain because of the difficulty of measuring quantities or emission factors at that point, or for administrative reasons. For example, crude oil going to an oil refinery will not be taxed; instead the products made by refining crude oil will be taxed. 16 Jet fuel, discussed later, is the other major exception. 3.7 Beyond these administrative benefits, the point of obligation for the tax should generally have little economic effect as long as pricing agreements allow for full or partial pass-through of the price increase to customers. 13 This approach to the design of the tax is based on the April 1997 Treasury Working Paper, The design of a possible low-level carbon tax for New Zealand. 14 Appendix 1 lists products likely to be subject to the tax. Biofuels such as wood will not be taxed, but the fossil fuel component of composite fuels will be taxed. 15 Tax Review 2001, Final Report, October 2001, page 119. 16 Combustion of crude oil will also be subject to the tax unless an NGA provides an exemption. 11 Setting the price of emissions 3.8 The rate of the tax is intended to approximate the price of carbon dioxide- equivalent emission units on international markets in the first commitment period. This is consistent with Kyoto principles, which aim to promote abatement around the world at least cost. 3.9 The international price for the first commitment period is difficult to forecast and, given that the market is relatively “immature”, may be relatively volatile. Further, there are various “markets” (or types of emission units) that could be referred to. It will take some time for these markets to settle down and for reliable trends of prices, price differences and volumes to become evident. For this reason, the government cannot specify at this stage the basis on which prices might be adjusted. 3.10 The government is aware that changing the rate frequently would create its own administrative and compliance costs, as well as cause business uncertainty. 3.11 The government has decided that the carbon tax legislation will initially set the tax at NZ$15 a tonne CO 2 -equivalent emissions. The rate will be amended only if it diverges significantly and on a sustained basis from the long-term trends in the international price, but it will not exceed $25 a tonne of CO 2 during the first commitment period. 3.12 The government will develop a method for setting and changing the rate of the carbon tax as the various markets and information about those markets develop further. It will be the subject of public consultation once market information is more readily available. Applying the price consistently 3.13 To apply the tax consistently to a given product or stream of production emissions, the quantity of each liable product will be multiplied by an “emission factor” and then by the rate of the tax, according to the formula: )charge of rate()factoremission ()product ofquantity (×× Example: (1,000 GJ bituminous coal sold in period) × (0.09 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions per GJ of coal) × $15 = $1,350 12 3.14 Emission factors are used to calculate the tonnes of carbon dioxide- equivalent (“tCO 2 -e”) emissions expected as a result of the use of one unit of the product (such as a litre of petrol). This takes account of the “global warming potential” (GWP) of a product’s greenhouse gas emissions relative to the effect of one tonne of carbon dioxide. 3.15 For example, the GWP of methane is 21, 17 meaning that one tonne of methane has a similar impact over 100 years to 21 tonnes of CO 2 . If pure methane leaks or is vented without being burned, its emission factor (in terms of mass) is 21 tonnes CO 2 -e per tonne of methane. If it is burned, methane reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, so methane supplied as fuel has a much lower emission factor than vented methane. The emission factor for a mixture of gases such as natural gas takes account of the GWP of each constituent. 3.16 Emission factors can be expressed in terms of any convenient unit of product quantity, and convenience has been the main criterion for the units proposed for the carbon tax (see Appendix 1). For fossil fuels this is often an amount of energy (such as tCO 2 -e /GJ) rather than mass (such as tCO 2 -e/t). 3.17 The necessity of applying the tax consistently with respect to a product’s global warming impact must be balanced against the importance of limiting the associated administrative and compliance costs to an acceptable level. Calculating and verifying emission factors for a large number of products that are sold only in small quantities would be costly relative to the environmental gain achieved. 3.18 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has established default emission factors for a large number of goods in a large number of uses. However, individual nations are encouraged to set their own emission factors when this can improve accuracy. The IPCC sets out methods of doing this, although it has not developed them for all products. 3.19 An emission factor for each product will be specified in New Zealand’s carbon tax legislation, based on the emission factors used by the New Zealand Inventory Agency (as named by the Climate Change Response Act) where suitable. Changes to reflect new knowledge of emissions or new products or uses can be made by regulation. 3.20 Some products, such as refined oil products and standard gas products, have relatively little variation in their carbon content and, for practical purposes, have a constant emission factor. 17 This is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1995 100 year GWP for CH 4 . Parties to the UNFCCC used the IPCC 1995 GWPs in 1997 when establishing national emission targets for the first commitment period. They are therefore used for determining compliance with those targets, and will be used for calculating the carbon tax. Increased scientific understanding suggests that the “true” global warming potential of methane in the atmosphere is higher than 21, and this may lead to a higher number being used in agreements relating to later periods. 13 3.21 In the consultation carried out to date, industry representatives have highlighted that precise emission factors for fossil fuels depend on a product’s physical source. Most fossil fuels are expected to be charged using a default emission factor, but there will also be provision for “specific” emission factors to be used in certain cases. For example, a specific emission factor could be used for coal from a particular mine if a laboratory approved by the Climate Change Office verified that it was more than 2% below that indicated by the relevant default emission factor. Any independent laboratory recognised by the industry as having the expertise for this task would be likely to be approved. Some firms will already be aware of specific emission factors that will still be relevant in 2007. 3.22 In some cases, laboratory testing of products with specific emission factors may not be required. For example, firms sometimes blend products with known emission factors, or products that are to be subject to the tax with products that are not. Firms paying the tax would be permitted to calculate the emission factor for the blended product without verification, provided that they took reasonable care to do so accurately. Alternatively, they could account separately for the components of the blend. 3.23 In cases of separation of a product into two other products, appropriately qualified experts would be able to calculate a specific emission factor. It could be based on the known emission factor of the source (say, a gas stream), the quantity and emission factor of a product removed from that stream (say, carbon dioxide), or the quantity of the remaining product. 3.24 Default emission factors for products for which specific emission factors can be used would generally be set towards the upper end of the range of emission factors observed for each product type. Setting the default emission factor at an average of the actual emission factors for a product would tend to result in undertaxing emissions. 3.25 The likely default emission factors for a number of products are shown in Appendix 2. It lists products for which firms will be able to seek a specific emission factor. Pass-through of the tax 3.26 The intended effect of the tax on relative prices will generally flow through the supply chain, depending on supply and demand elasticities at the time. 3.27 If the New Zealand price of the product does not tend to increase when New Zealand demand increases (as is likely to be the case for liquid petroleum products) there will generally be a presumption that the carbon tax has passed in full through the supply chain to the emitter. There is some uncertainty as to whether there will be 100 percent pass-through of the carbon tax on natural gas and some coal, and the impact on the electricity price of taxing fossil fuel and geothermal energy used in electricity generation is particularly difficult to predict. 14 3.28 Further analysis of these issues is being carried out and affected parties will have further opportunities for consultation on the matter. Existing contracts 3.29 Given that a carbon tax has been contemplated since at least 1997, it is expected that most energy supply contracts applying in 2007 will allow the tax to be reflected in the energy price. However, it is possible that some, particularly older, contracts have not taken account of the likelihood that the carbon tax will be introduced. 3.30 Re-negotiating contracts before they are due for review or renewal is costly. Until these contracts run their course or are renegotiated, they will restrict the ability of suppliers to pass on the tax to energy consumers. In some cases, this could delay the intended effect of the carbon tax on fossil fuel consumption and be costly for suppliers. A number of industry participants have expressed concerns about this. 3.31 As a general principle, the government is reluctant to override commercial contracts negotiated in good faith between willing parties. However, given the concerns of some industry participants, the government will consider any submissions that the carbon tax legislation should include a provision similar to section 78 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, to allow the pass- through of the tax, and any changes in its rate, in certain cases. Another precedent for such an override can be found in the Energy Resources Levy Act 1975. 3.32 Any override would not affect contracts that allow pass-through or expressly deal with the impact of the tax. Stockpiles of coal and petroleum products 3.33 There are two potential problems in applying the carbon tax to stockpiles. One relates to the transition on introduction, and the other to the carrying cost of the tax on some of the very large stockpiles that consumers hold (as opposed to producers). Transitional stockpiles 3.34 Some firms, particularly some electricity generators, are able to store large stocks of untaxed fuel at the introduction date. This is most likely to happen in the case of coal users, because of the ease of storage, and least likely for gas users, because there is little available storage for gas. Storage capacity for liquid petroleum products is limited, but some stockpiling is possible. 15 3.35 Given that the carbon tax will apply from 1 April 2007, and there is a risk of unintended disparities of the initial impact of the tax on the different fuels, it follows that users’ coal and liquid fuel stockpiles that would otherwise not be taxed should be taxed on that date. Obviously, there is a question of scale here, and it would be sensible to limit the tax to larger stockpiles. Carrying cost of the tax on large stockpiles 3.36 One firm has raised the question of the carrying cost of the carbon tax on its potentially very large stockpile of coal. It correctly pointed out that greenhouse gases will be released only when the stockpile is used. 3.37 For reasons of compliance and administrative simplicity, the tax will be levied at the earliest practical point in the supply chain. In the government’s view, the mere existence of a stockpile is not sufficient reason to overturn the principle. However, if the stockpile is very large and therefore the carrying cost of the carbon tax is also large, relief could be offered by some form of stock-on-hand adjustment. The government is interested in hearing from those who might have very large stockpiles that may be held for longer periods of time about whether some form of relief would be necessary. Submission points The government welcomes submissions on the issues discussed in this chapter and, in particular: • To what extent, if any, should the carbon tax legislation override existing contracts for the supply of energy resources to allow pass-through of the tax, and what would the consequences of this be? • For what energy sources might a contractual override be necessary? • Is there a need to tax transitional stockpiles if they are very large? • Is there a need to consider the carrying cost of the tax on very large users’ stock- piles? 16 Chapter 4 HOW THE TAX WILL WORK 4.1 The administration of the carbon tax, exemptions, rebates and refunds will largely be modelled on existing systems for tariffs, excise duties and GST. Administrative roles of government agencies Inland Revenue Department 4.2 Inland Revenue will be the lead administrative agency for the carbon tax. It will administer all points of obligation to pay the tax other than imports and removals from oil refineries, and all rebates except those administered by the Customs Service. 4.3 The standard Inland Revenue rules for handling tax will apply to its carbon tax mechanisms. New Zealand Customs Service 4.4 The New Zealand Customs Service will collect the tax on products that are subject to the tax at the point of importation or when removed from a refinery, except for jet fuel – discussed later. The tax will be integrated with existing revenue collection systems. 4.5 Customs will also pay rebates to exporters of liquid petroleum products, except for those derived from compressing gas. 4.6 The standard Customs rules for payment of excise duty, excise-equivalent duty, tariff duty and GST will apply to the carbon tax. 4.7 As happens with GST, the Customs Service and Inland Revenue will exchange information to support the administration of the tax. For example, before the tax is implemented, Inland Revenue and the Customs Service will identify and contact firms that are likely to be required to register. The New Zealand Climate Change Office 4.8 The New Zealand Climate Change Office (CCO), based in the Ministry for the Environment, is the lead agency with respect to climate change policy and technical matters. On many policy and technical issues CCO works collaboratively with other government agencies that have a major interest or relevant expertise – such as the Treasury, Inland Revenue, Customs Service, Ministry of Agriculture and Forests, and Ministry of Economic Development. 17 4.9 The CCO will be involved in non-collection aspects of the administration of the tax where appropriate. For example, it is responsible for negotiating NGAs, is the lead agency with respect to setting emission factors, and works with the Treasury and other agencies on setting the rate of the tax. It will keep Inland Revenue and the Customs Service informed of any details needed to enforce the carbon tax and to deliver rebates and exemptions. 4.10 Appropriate information exchange protocols will be set up between the CCO and Inland Revenue so that each agency can properly fulfil its carbon tax obligations. Inland Revenue registration and filing requirements 4.11 Because the tax must be paid at the point of supply, many aspects of the administration of the tax will be modelled on existing GST legislation. Indeed, the carbon tax legislation is likely to use the term “supply”, as used in this paper, rather than “sale”. 4.12 The “time of supply (or sale)” will generally mean the earlier of the date of payment and the date of invoice. There will be a transitional rule on introduction to modify the more usual time-of-supply rule – the time of supply for product invoiced or paid for, but not delivered at the introduction date, will be the actual delivery date. 4.13 Firms liable to pay the tax directly and NGA firms will be required to file regular returns to Inland Revenue. Other firms claiming rebates of the tax (for example, a firm that buys coal and then exports it, becoming eligible for an export rebate) will do so in relation to one or more tax periods, but will not have to file regular returns. One-off returns are necessary to allow for casual exports. 4.14 Return filing will generally be electronic. Liable firms’ filing obligations will fall due when their GST return filing obligations fall due, albeit in a separate return. A firm required to file a carbon tax return but not registered for GST will be required to file six-monthly, unless it has elected to file two- monthly or monthly. 4.15 The administrative rules for amounts payable and for refunds will generally be the same as for GST, including rules for when payments are due and use- of-money interest on late payments. Firms eligible for a refund will be able to elect to transfer any payment due to them from Inland Revenue to meet tax obligations such as GST, and Inland Revenue will be able to use such amounts to reduce any amount the firm owes, such as outstanding income tax. 18 4.16 Normal rules for dealing with errors in GST returns and payments and for failures to meet GST obligations will apply to the tax. The disputes process with respect to obligations to Inland Revenue will be largely the same as for GST and income tax, but some technical issues, notably relating to product classifications and emission factors, will be determined by the CCO. Estimation issues 4.17 The amount of the tax payable, and the amount of any rebates, will depend on the quantities and emission factors of each taxable product. 4.18 The CCO will provide guidance on what constitutes a “reasonable” level of accuracy, and declarations by independent experts may be needed in certain situations. 4.19 The units of measurement for each broad category of products and emissions (such as “liquid fuels”) will be defined in legislation. The likely emission factors for some key products are presented in Appendix 2. They are intended to be expressed in units widely used by the industry paying the tax. 4.20 When specific emission factors are used the cost of any scientific tests that are required will be at the expense of the firms involved, except when commissioned by Inland Revenue or the Customs Service, as part of an audit. Exemptions, rebates and refunds 4.21 Relief from the tax, in the form of a rebate or exemption, will be provided: • under the terms of Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements; • on export of fossil fuels; and • when carbon is permanently embedded or sequestered, other than in biomass. 4.22 Exemptions mean that a firm that would otherwise have an obligation to pay the carbon tax is not required to pay it for a particular product or activity. Rebates are subtracted from any carbon tax on the firm’s outputs to determine whether it is eligible for a net refund from the Crown (which will generally be the case for an NGA firm) or has a net liability to pay the tax. 4.23 The administrative and compliance costs of measuring emissions from some sources mean that it is not likely to be cost-effective to apply the tax to all producers. 19 4.24 A minimum threshold of $2,000 worth of emissions a year, calculated as if the charge was being applied, is proposed for application of the carbon tax to any taxpayer. A firm will be required to register to pay tax only if its carbon tax liability for the past year, had the carbon tax applied, or its expected carbon tax for the coming year, had the carbon tax applied, exceeded this amount. This rule will be modelled on the GST minimum threshold for registration. 4.25 Coal miners will not be required to pay the carbon tax on coal if the value of the coal they supplied or used in the past 12 months, and the expected value of the coal in the next 12 months, is less than $2,000. This is intended to provide a simple way of excluding from the carbon tax a number of landowners for whom coal production is a minor incidental activity, avoiding the need to calculate their potential carbon tax liability. 4.26 The standard Customs Service $50 minimum threshold will apply to total Customs Service levies and taxes, including the carbon tax on imported products. Calculating rebates and refunds 4.27 Amounts of rebates will be calculated using the same formula as amounts of the tax, subject to a weighting reflecting an assessment of how much of the tax has been passed through 18 to the firm claiming the rebate, and reflecting any “partial rebate” agreed in an NGA: (quantity of product) × (emission factor) × (rate of charge) × (weighting) Example: Firm that buys and exports bituminous coal (assumes 100% pass-through) (1,000 GJ bituminous coal purchased and exported in period) × (0.09 tonnes of carbon dioxide- equivalent emissions per GJ) × $15 × 100% = Rebate of $1,350 The refund is the sum of the rebates in this case because the firm has no direct liability for the tax. 4.28 The emission factor used to calculate rebates will generally be the one that applied to the input when the tax was levied on it. For products with only one emission factor, such as “spec gas”, this will be straightforward. However, determining the “rebate” emission factor will be more complex when a “specific emission factor” is required. This will arise for export of coal other than by the miner, for embedding of carbon from coal, and for rebates to NGA firms. 18 As noted in chapter 3, work on a method to determine how much of the tax will be passed downstream from fossil fuel producers and importers is in progress. 20 4.29 It would be unusual for firms to be able to gain a rebate for fossil fuel purchases as well as be liable for the tax on their use or sale of fossil fuel. Even so, some will be in this position, and their net liability or refund will be calculated as shown in the example below. Example: Firm that mines lignite for local use and buys and exports bituminous coal (assumes 100% pass-through) Amount of tax \[(600 GJ lignite from own mine sold within New Zealand in period) × (0.095 GJ of carbon dioxide- equivalent emissions) × $15 = $855\] - Amount of rebates \[(1,000 GJ bituminous coal purchased and exported in period) × (0.09 GJ of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions) × $15 × 100% = $1,350\] = \[Refund of $495\] Timing of rebates and refunds 4.30 The timing of refunds of the tax to registered firms will be the same as that of refunds of excess GST input tax credits. Inland Revenue must refund any excess GST input tax by the fifteenth working day after the return is furnished (but typically makes the refund sooner), or the working day after a determination by the Commissioner of the amount payable. If the refund is not paid within this timeframe, interest is payable by Inland Revenue (subject to a right to withhold payment under certain circumstances). 4.31 The tax period in which eligibility for a rebate arises as a result of purchase of a product will be the date of “supply” of the product to the eligible firm. 4.32 As with GST input credits, rebates will be claimed at the end of each charging period. In particular, it is anticipated that occasional exporters will file as required, and “nil” returns will not be required from them. 4.33 Rebates administered by the Customs Service will be subject to the standard conditions that apply to duty drawback under the Customs and Excise Act 1996. Evidence of emission factors 4.34 Firms seeking a rebate of the carbon tax will often be able to apply a standard emission factor. This will apply to standard products such as “spec gas”, but for products with many possible emission factors, such as coal, will require a different treatment. In these cases, firms will have to be able to support any claim for a rebate with information from the supplier to verify the emission factor used to calculate the rebate. 19 19 If this is impossible for some reason (for example, because the supplier is unknown) there may also be an option to have the product tested, or use a standard emission factor. 21 4.35 An option being considered is whether suppliers of fossil fuels should be required to supply emission factors if requested to do so by customers. Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements 4.36 NGAs provide relief from the carbon tax on emissions arising from a firm’s production activities. NGAs do not affect obligations to pay the tax on fossil fuels sold by NGA firms. NGA firms will have both exemptions from obligations to pay the carbon tax directly, and rebates of the tax as reflected in the prices of their inputs. 4.37 The Climate Change Office is analysing the likely price pass-through for electricity, natural gas, and coal, to identify a standard pass-through weighting for each relevant source of emissions. NGA firms have been and will be consulted as part of this process. It is anticipated that standard weightings for each product will be set in the legislation or by regulation. 4.38 Other than for electricity, NGA rebates will not cover a “second-round price increase”. For the purposes of calculating NGA rebates, the phrase “second round price increase” refers to an increase in the price of a product or service that does not result from application of the tax to the input itself, but rather from application of the carbon tax to a substitute product. (For example, charcoal made from wood is a renewable substitute for coal and may increase in value as a result of the tax on coal.) 4.39 Although Inland Revenue is responsible for administering relief under NGAs, the scope and level of relief will be determined as a part of the agreement. Exported products 4.40 Exporters of emitting products will be entitled to relief from the impact of the tax because the emissions will occur outside New Zealand. The required documentation will be the same as currently required to justify zero-rating for GST on exported goods or for claiming duty drawback under the Customs and Excise Act 1996. 4.41 For some exported emitting products, exemption will be achieved automatically because the product will not pass the point of obligation – first sale or use in New Zealand. Embedded or sequestered carbon 4.42 When carbon that has been or would normally be subject to the tax is embedded in a product or permanently contained (for example, in a spent gas field) so that it will not be released into the atmosphere, relief from the tax will normally be available. Sequestration of CO 2 in forests or other biomass will not qualify for this form of relief. 22 4.43 Embedding of fossil fuel into products that emit greenhouse gases only in very small amounts, very slowly or in exceptional circumstances will generally be treated as permanent embedding. Examples include tyres, tar and plastic. This reflects both the small quantity of these emissions and the cost of charging for them. However, if it becomes the norm for the product to be used as a fuel the tax may be applied at some point. (See discussion of the burning of embedded carbon from fossil sources in chapter 5.) 4.44 When possible, uses of fossil fuels that do not result in emissions will be dealt with by not imposing the tax at the normal point of obligation. For example, a New Zealand refinery will not be taxed for the sale of tar, which does not release CO 2 (and releases only minimal amounts of other greenhouse gases) during its normal lifetime. 4.45 To ensure that the scale of embedding by a firm justifies the administrative costs of providing a rebate, the Climate Change Office will approve the firms entitled to receive rebates for embedding and the rebates available to each approved firm. Once the approval is in place, a rebate can be claimed from Inland Revenue. On-selling of rebated products 4.46 A firm that has claimed a rebate for a product will be required to pay carbon tax if it on-sells the product in New Zealand or uses it for a purpose outside the scope of the firm’s NGA. The emission factor to be applied will generally be the one that applied when the rebate was calculated. Other tax consequences 4.47 As with fringe benefit tax and excise and tariff duties, normal income tax rules will determine when the tax is deductible from income. The treatment of refunds (for example, in relation to an NGA or an exported product) will follow normal income tax principles in that the expenditure it relates to will be reduced by the amount of the refund. Thus the tax will generally be deductible for businesses, and any rebates will reduce the deduction. 4.48 Final consumers bear the cost of GST and, to ensure this, GST must apply at all points of the supply chain. The tax is expected to increase the price at which affected products are sold by producers and importers, and GST is taxable on the full value of the goods and services supplied. Therefore GST will apply to the part of that value attributable to the tax. Payment of the carbon tax itself will not be treated as payment for a supply. 23 Submission points The government welcomes submissions on the issues discussed in this chapter and, in particular: • How can the cost of filing returns be kept to a minimum while ensuring the integrity and fairness of the tax? • Are the proposed units for product quantities and emission factors convenient and sufficiently precise? • Are the proposed timing rules for payment and rebates of the tax reasonable? • Would firms claiming rebates face difficulties obtaining evidence of specific emission factors? • Under what circumstances should a firm in your industry be required or permitted to re-assess a specific emission factor (for example, because of changes in the product being mined)? • What evidence that the tax has been paid on a product should a firm claiming a rebate be required to have? 24 Chapter 5 ISSUES FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES 5.1 Points of obligation to pay the carbon tax, as well as some of the rules relating to emission factors will vary from industry to industry. Petroleum oil and oil products 5.2 The tax will apply to imported oil products other than those delivered directly to a New Zealand refinery, and to most emitting products of New Zealand oil refineries. It will be collected at these points by the Customs Service, as part of the existing excise system. Process emissions from a refinery will also be subject to the tax, which will be payable to Inland Revenue. 20 5.3 This approach is intended to minimise the compliance and administration costs of the tax, using relatively few points of obligation and relatively few emission factors for the bulk of the oil product sold. 5.4 Emission factors for crude oil vary with each shipment, and even within the hold of an oil tanker. Determining emission factors for crude oil could therefore be imprecise, costly or a poor compromise, so the focus is on the refined products produced from it. 5.5 It is possible to burn unrefined crude oil to produce useful energy, although this does not appear to be occurring in New Zealand at present. In such cases the carbon tax would be applied, so appropriate emission factors would be needed. Fossil-derived lubricating oils 5.6 In contrast to oil used as fuel, there are many varieties of lubricating oil, some of which are imported in small quantities. It is unlikely to be cost- effective to calculate emission factors for all of these products. However, lubricating oils contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and should, in principle, be subject to the tax. 5.7 Emissions from lubricating oil arise in a number of different situations, such as when oil used to lubricate an engine is burned, or when used oil is collected and burned as a fuel. This happens on a reasonably large scale, notably in greenhouses and in cement plants. Most lubricating oils that are not burned for fuel break down within a relatively short period of time, ultimately increasing greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. 20 As with other emission sources, this is subject to any exemption applicable as a result of an NGA or export of the product. 25 5.8 Applying the tax to lubricating oils when they are burned would risk creating an incentive for illegal disposal. Such disposal would create additional environmental problems. Furthermore, there are a large number of locations where burning might occur. Therefore, to ensure full coverage, minimise administrative and compliance costs and avoid unwanted environmental effects, the carbon tax should apply to lubricating oils when they are removed from a refinery or imported. 5.9 Because there are many lubricating oils 21 with many emission factors, new products are introduced frequently, and lubricating oils make a relatively small contribution to New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions, it would not be cost-effective to apply a different emission factor to every product. Therefore the government intends to establish default emission factors for, say, three broad categories of lubricating oil, such as “heavy engine oil”, “light engine oil” and “other lubricating oils”. 5.10 Specific emission factors will not be permitted for lubricating oils, as this would add significantly to the costs of administering and complying with the tax. Competing firms would face pressures to identify specific emission factors for each of their products adding costs to the industry as a whole. 5.11 As discussed later with respect to jet and marine fuels, special constraints affect the application of the tax to the use of lubricating oils in these industries. The government is considering how to deal with these applications of lubricating fuels, and whether an exemption or rebate approach would be appropriate for lubricating oils used on international journeys. Aviation fuel sold for domestic use 5.12 Individual nations are not responsible, under the Kyoto Protocol, for emissions from international transport. Therefore jet fuel used on international flights is outside the scope of the tax. About 90 percent of jet fuel sold in New Zealand is used on international flights. 5.13 A potential constraint on applying the tax to fuel used on domestic flights is that New Zealand is bound by international air services agreements that do not allow taxation of consumables used on domestic legs of international flights by airlines claiming “cabotage” 22 rights. However, the government understands that no airline is currently exercising such rights. 5.14 Because of the small proportion of the jet fuel sold in New Zealand that will be covered by the tax, it will apply to jet fuel further down the supply chain than it will for most other fossil fuel products. Jet fuel will therefore not be taxed when removed from New Zealand oil refineries or imported. 21 According to an industry source, there are over 1,000 different lubricating oils on the New Zealand market. 22 The term “cabotage” is used to refer to the carriage of cargo or passengers on a domestic leg of an international service. 26 5.15 Instead, the tax will be payable by a firm, generally an oil company, when it supplies jet fuel to “domestic airlines”, including foreign-owned domestic airlines, for domestic flights. International airlines and international flights by domestic airlines will not be taxed. 5.16 Domestic and international flights can be distinguished by their flight numbers. Moreover, it is rare for an aircraft to carry more fuel than is required to reach its next destination safely, owing to the cost of carrying excess fuel. Therefore the proposed treatment of jet fuel will be unlikely to result in charging fuel used outside New Zealand airspace. 5.17 The government is considering what unintended risks the proposed approach might pose and how such risks might be mitigated. 5.18 The government understands that most “avgas” sold in New Zealand is used domestically. Therefore avgas will be subject to the tax when imported or removed from a refinery, and a rebate will be available if it is used on an international flight. Transport by sea 5.19 New Zealand is not treated under the Kyoto Protocol as being responsible for emissions from international transport, although these emissions are noted as a memorandum item in the national inventory. 5.20 New Zealand’s national inventory includes emissions from fuel supplied to ships in New Zealand, except when supplied for international transport. 5.21 Most fuel purchased in New Zealand is used in New Zealand. Therefore the tax will apply to fuel used in shipping when it is imported or removed from a refinery. A rebate will be available to a ship purchasing fuel for international transport. 5.22 Where fuel is sold to a ship carrying coastal cargo while transiting between New Zealand ports as part of an international journey, the domestic leg uses a small proportion of the total fuel used on the journey. It is proposed that the whole trip be considered international. This would slightly increase the cost margin between domestic operators of coastal shipping services and international operators carrying coastal cargo while in transit. There would, however, be similar treatment of domestic shipping operators and other domestic transport modes. Fishing 5.23 Under the Kyoto Protocol, New Zealand is responsible for emissions from fishing operations when vessels refuel in New Zealand, regardless of where the fishing occurs. The tax will be applied to all fuel used in fishing when it is imported or removed from a refinery, with no rebate available to fishing vessels except if available under a Negotiated Greenhouse Agreement. 27 Gas and gas products 5.24 The carbon tax will be applied to gas when first sold or used by the holder of the petroleum permit under which the gas was produced. Flaring or venting by the permit holder will be treated as “own-use”. Oil products removed from the gas stream before the first point of sale (the point at which the product is first supplied by a producer to another person) will be taxed under the rules for oil products (for example, taxed when refined, if sent to a refinery). 5.25 At the first point of sale, a standard emission factor based on energy content (but assuming a standard carbon dioxide content) will apply to each standard gas product, such as “spec gas”, LPG and LNG. If such products were burned rather than sold, the same emission factors will apply. 5.26 If the gas sold or burned is not a standard product and does not meet specification, a specific emission factor, verified by an approved laboratory, will be required. Specific emission factors could also be calculated by the firm for gas streams that are blended in fixed proportions from other gases with approved emission factors. 5.27 If a petroleum permit holder sells or vents carbon dioxide in a gas stream containing too little hydrocarbon content to be burned, the tax will apply to the tonnage of carbon dioxide. This will avoid applying an energy-based emission factor to a gas stream with only a trace amount of combustible gas. 5.28 Except in the case of venting by the petroleum permit holder, emission factors will be based on the assumption that the hydrocarbons in the gas, when used, will be burned and thereby converted into carbon dioxide. 5.29 Natural gas leaking from transmission and distribution pipelines is primarily in the form of methane (CH 4 ). The 2004 national inventory 23 estimated that less than two percent of the gas entering the distribution system is leaked in this way. This estimate is based on assumptions about the metering error component of distribution companies’ unaccounted-for gas. 5.30 Given the technical difficulty of measuring these emissions and the existing incentives to minimise leakage, no adjustment will be made with respect to the methane that is leaked from gas lines rather than burned after being supplied, despite methane having a higher emission factor than carbon dioxide. 5.31 The tax will also apply to imported gas products and be collected by the Customs Service. Emissions from imported gas will be calculated on the same basis as emissions from gas produced by petroleum permit holders. 23 Page 18, New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory, Ministry for the Environment/New Zealand Climate Change Office, April 2004. 28 Coal and coal products 5.32 Coal will be subject to the tax when first imported, or sold or used by the coal miner, including in the manufacture of briquettes or other energy products. 5.33 Processed coal products such as briquettes will be subject to the tax when imported, but the tax will already have applied to the coal used in making coal products in New Zealand. 5.34 A default emission factor will be provided for each coal rank. It will be a rounded average of the range within that coal rank. Emission factors are likely to be close to those indicated in the table of products in Appendix 1, but require some further research. 5.35 Using an “energy-based” emission factor eliminates much of the natural variation that is found in emission factors based on product weight. However, coal from some mines may have unusually high or low emissions relative to energy – for example, owing to differences in hydrogen content. The government is likely to accept the risk that some coal will have above average emissions, but allow coal miners and importers to obtain and use a specific emission factor. This would need to be verified by a laboratory approved by the New Zealand Climate Change Office and, to avoid adding to administrative and compliance costs in relation to very small differences, to be at least two percent less than the relevant default emission factor. 5.36 Coal miners and importers will also be permitted to calculate specific emission factors from the default or specific emission factors of coal blended in fixed proportions, or when proportions of particular consignments are adequately recorded. Coal-seam gas emissions 5.37 Coal-seam gas can either be vented or burned. It must be reduced to a safe level in the course of underground coal mining, but it quickly escapes to the open air from open-cast mines. Although some emissions of coal-seam gas occur naturally, the emissions increase as a result of human activity (mining or extraction). The increase in emissions should, in principle, be subject to the tax. 5.38 The National Inventory records coal-seam gas (CH 4 ) emissions as 315 kt CO 2 -e for 2003, or 0.86% of New Zealand’s total emissions from energy. This is less than 0.5% of New Zealand's total greenhouse gas emissions. These estimates are based on measurements of coal production and assumed emission factors; the emissions are not measured directly. 29 5.39 If coal-seam gas is extracted for use as a source of energy (generally before the coal is mined), the carbon tax will apply to the petroleum permit holder, 24 using the same rules as for petroleum permit holders generally. (See paragraph 5.24 on gas and gas products.) This is intended to ensure that the tax applies equitably to all fossil sources of gas used for energy. 5.40 The impact of coal mining on coal-seam gas emissions varies significantly between coal fields, locations within coalfields, and over time. For the purpose of reporting emissions in the National Inventory, the Ministry of Economic Development has chosen two “release factors” for all underground mines, one for bituminous coal and one for sub-bituminous coal. These indicate an average level of coal-seam gas emissions for a given quantity of coal removed from these mines, and are useful for the purpose of calculating New Zealand’s overall greenhouse gas emissions. However, these average release factors would not be sufficiently accurate for the carbon tax: they would result in over-taxing some mines and under-taxing others relative to the true level of coal-seam gas emissions. On the other hand, attempting to accurately measure the increased emissions associated with the mining of coal from each location within each mine would be costly. 5.41 The quantity of coal-seam gas that is vented during the course of coal mining is a very small proportion of New Zealand’s total emissions from energy. There is no straightforward way of applying the tax accurately to coal-seam gas, and some of the gas must be vented for health and safety reasons. For these reasons it is proposed that coal-seam gas that is vented during the course of coal mining not be included within the scope of the tax. If it is collected and burned for energy, sold, or converted to another energy product, the tax will be applied. Geothermal energy 5.42 Geothermal resources are used for electricity generation, industrial process heat and various other commercial and domestic applications. CO 2 and CH 4 are released from developed geothermal fields into the atmosphere at a much faster rate than would occur naturally. The National Inventory records emissions from this source as 367 kt CO 2 -e for 2002, or about one percent of New Zealand’s total emissions from energy. 5.43 This percentage is expected to increase in the medium term as more geothermal development takes place. To ensure that the incentives are correct, the sector should be subject to the carbon tax, even though the current take from geothermal resources is not large. 24 Under Crown Minerals rules, only a petroleum permit holder can make full commercial use of this gas. 30 5.44 Application of the tax to geothermal emissions is complicated by variations in emissions between fields, within fields over time – particularly in the first five years of using a new well, and according to the technology used. However, large geothermal field operators do carry out routine measurements that provide a basis for calculating greenhouse gas emissions. Their estimates, based on monitored levels of geothermal fluid flows and sampled gas concentrations, are provided annually to the Ministry of Economic Development. 5.45 The government proposes to use this data as the basis for levying the tax on major geothermal energy users. Normal requirements for taxpayers to take reasonable care in calculating their tax liabilities will apply. The possibility of an Inland Revenue audit will also ensure that there are clear incentives to revise the estimated gas concentration – for example, if there is reason to believe that it is no longer accurate – say, because a new well has been introduced to the system. 5.46 Because the cost of measurement would be excessive for small users, it is proposed that the tax apply only to firms using geothermal energy for electricity generation or industrial process heat, and not to retail operations such as motels or public baths. (This could change if a company supplied such operations with energy from a geothermal source on a large scale.) Emissions from down-hole heat exchangers are minimal, so these, too, will be excluded from the tax. 5.47 Further work is needed to establish the precise point of obligation, but it is anticipated that the large geothermal field operators or users, rather than owners, will be the appropriate place. Industrial process emissions 5.48 Emissions from limestone during calcination and gold processing are examples of “industrial process emissions”. Limestone 5.49 Limestone (calcium carbonate) differs from fossil fuels in that a significant proportion of it is used in ways that do not emit greenhouse gases. Rather than levy the tax on all limestone and provide relief for non-emitting uses, 25 the government intends to levy the tax only when the use of the limestone results in emissions. 25 Non-emitting uses include any use of limestone in its natural state, such as a building or roading material or when applied to the soil without undergoing calcination. 31 5.50 The major industrial process that causes limestone to emit carbon dioxide is calcination. This process is a key part of manufacturing cement and burnt (quick) and hydrated (slaked) lime. Burnt lime is used in gold processing, steel manufacture, road stabilisation and paper manufacture, while hydrated lime is used primarily for water treatment, building materials, sugar refining and leather tanning. 5.51 “Clinker” is an intermediate product that is created when limestone is calcinated for the purposes of making cement. Further processing of clinker is required to make cement. The tax would be imposed on the amount of clinker made by cement manufacturers. 5.52 Lime fertiliser manufacturers will not be liable for the tax. Although application of lime fertiliser does result in emissions, applying the tax to lime might encourage farmers to increase use of nitrogenous fertilisers, emissions of which are not covered by the tax. The tax is not intended to apply to nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture, and nitrous oxide is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Furthermore, nitrogenous fertilisers have other detrimental environmental effects. 5.53 As with coal and gas, the legislation will set a default emission factor, and cement manufacturers will be able to use a specific emission factor verified by an approved laboratory. Specific emission factors will need to be re- verified if the manufacturer changes its processes or input in a manner likely to increase the emissions per tonne of clinker produced. 5.54 Limestone also emits carbon dioxide when used as a catalyst in the processing of fine metal ores. These emissions will be subject to the tax according to the amount of limestone used in this way. 5.55 Emissions from limestone for purely educational or scientific purposes will not be subject to the tax, since the wide dispersion and small quantity of these emissions means that it is not cost-effective to apply the tax to them. Soda ash 5.56 Soda ash (sodium carbonate) is used in the manufacture of glass, and carbon dioxide is emitted as part of that process. The tax will be applied to soda ash used in glass manufacture. The legislation will set a default emission factor, and manufacturers will be able to use a different emission factor if they obtain a figure verified by an approved laboratory. Synthetic greenhouse gases 5.57 The “synthetic greenhouse gases”, or SGGs, include sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) and the groups of chemicals known collectively as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). 32 5.58 PFCs are emitted during the production of aluminium and are also used in the refrigeration industry as refrigerant gases, usually as part of mixtures also containing HFCs. 5.59 SF 6 is used in New Zealand primarily in the electricity industry as an insulating gas in high-voltage electrical equipment. HFCs are used in a wide range of applications where the ozone-depleting CFCs were once used – mainly in the refrigeration and air-conditioning industry, although there are many other uses. 5.60 The tax will apply to the emissions of PFCs during the production of aluminium. Other policy mechanisms will apply to emissions from SGGs that are imported into New Zealand. Carbon pitch and carbon black 5.61 Carbon pitch, carbon black and related products release CO 2 when used in metal production. These products will be subject to the tax when imported or when removed from a refinery using mass-based emission factors. Petroleum products used as feedstock 5.62 There are a number of processes in which petroleum products are used as a feedstock and CO 2 is emitted – such as the manufacture of methanol, hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide and steel. Complexity could arise in charging some of these products because some of the carbon in the petroleum product may be embedded in a final product that does not emit greenhouse gases covered by the tax. 5.63 Natural gas is the feedstock for the production of ammonia-urea. Some of the carbon from the gas is embedded in ammonia-urea but is released when the ammonia-urea is applied as a fertiliser. Nitrous oxide, another and more potent greenhouse gas, is also released, but nitrous oxide from agriculture is not within the scope of the tax in the first commitment period. Nitrous oxide is also released from other fertilisers, along with other detrimental environmental effects, and applying the tax to ammonia-urea alone could increase the use of these alternatives. 5.64 In the absence of comprehensive and consistent application of the tax to fertilisers, the government proposes that it not be applied to the emissions from ammonia-urea. The natural gas used as a feedstock in the manufacture of ammonia-urea will not be subject to the tax: the manufacturer will therefore be eligible for a rebate of the tax on this gas, as if it were being embedded in a non-emitting product. 33 Burning of embedded carbon from fossil sources 5.65 Products such as tyres and plastics contain embedded carbon from fossil sources. Such products can be used as a source of energy, either by burning them directly or, in the case of plastics, converting them to diesel first. If they are used as a source of energy they will release CO 2 to the atmosphere. Whether to apply the tax in such cases, and how to do so, will need to be considered if serious proposals of this kind emerge. 5.66 At present, there is interest in New Zealand in burning end-of-life tyres, in a suitably controlled environment, as a source of energy. This could play a role in reducing the scale of another environmental problem – that of disposing of waste tyres, and may displace other fuels with higher greenhouse gas emissions per unit of useful energy. 5.67 If there is a proposal to burn tyres on a significant scale, the government will then decide whether to apply the tax to new tyres and provide rebates for non-emitting uses of used tyres; apply the tax to used tyres burned for energy in controlled settings; or exclude tyres from the tax. Products from biological sources 5.68 Biofuels and other products made purely from biomass will not be subject to the tax. They include wood, charcoal made from wood, ethanol made from dairy products, and diesel made from tallow or sugar. Carbon dioxide from these sources is considered carbon-neutral because it is renewable. (Carbon is re-absorbed within a relatively short period of time.) 5.69 Fossil fuels blended with bio-fuels will be subject to the tax in the usual way and at the usual point of obligation, since blending with a bio-fuel does not reduce the emissions from the fossil fuel when it is burned. Submission points • Do the proposed methods for establishing emission factors achieve an appropriate balance between accuracy and simplicity? • Does the proposed approach make appropriate use of existing information flows in your industry? • What would be the most convenient and appropriate unit on which to base the emission factor for each product? For example, should coal emission factors be based on energy content or on mass? • What easily identified categories of lubricating oils would provide adequate precision in terms of applying appropriate emission factors but not lead to undue costs in calculating emission factors? • What impacts would the proposed approach have on airlines? 34 • What impacts would the proposed approach have on the domestic shipping and fishing industries? • The proposal is to have four default emission factors for coal – one for each rank. Is this too many, too few, or about right? • Does the proposal not to apply the tax to coal-seam gas appropriately balance the interests involved? • How can the tax be collected from geothermal energy users to a reasonable degree of accuracy but without imposing excessive compliance costs? • What would be the best way of applying the tax to industrial process emissions, particularly those where some carbon is embedded, or providing relief from the tax where appropriate? 35 Appendix 1 GLOSSARY Many of the definitions have been sourced from the GHG Protocol Initiative’s glossary, which can be found at: http://www.ghgprotocol.org/glossary.htm .

The first commitment period is 2008-2012. The targets are set relative to greenhouse gas emissions in the year 1990, multiplied by 5. Competitiveness-at-risk group This group includes sectors of the economy and particular industries that would find adjustment difficult if expected to make the transition to a direct price on emissions in the first commitment period. For these companies, it may be a choice of closing, changing location to a country with no or weaker controls on emissions (‘carbon leakage’), or reducing staff or production in the short-term to compensate for the increased costs.

New Zealand is unusual for an OECD country in having such a large portion of its emissions associated with agriculture. The energy sector had the fastest growth in emissions, with transport and electricity generation being the sub-sectors of highest growth. Figure 1 does not include the effects of land use change.

Under the current tax rules, for example, an investor who buys shares directly is taxed differently from an individual who buys them indirectly through an investment manager, such as a unit trust. Similarly, income from investments made in New Zealand are treated differently from those made offshore. 1.3 The proposals outlined in this discussion document aim to resolve these inconsistencies and the distorting effect they have on investor decision- making. The proposals are the culmination of a series of reviews of the tax rules for investment income, specifically focusing on the rules for investment via collective investment vehicles (CIVs), and for offshore portfolio investment in shares. 1 The most recent of these reviews, completed in 2004 by Craig Stobo, identified several significant tax problems and put forward recommendations for reform. The proposals in this discussion document build on the valuable work undertaken by Mr Stobo. 1.4 The key tax problems identified in the Stobo review were that different tax outcomes can arise depending on: • whether an investor invests directly or through a collective vehicle; and • whether the investment is in a New Zealand company or a foreign one. 1.5 When New Zealanders invest directly in a company, they are generally taxed only on dividends received from that company. When they pool together to make investments or have their monies managed by a professional, they will usually pay more tax. This is because dividends and capital gains are taxable for those in the business of investing, with most professional funds managers falling into this category. 1.6 In a pooled or collective fund, the tax treatment is based on the character of the fund and not on the nature of the individual investing into that fund. From the perspective of individual investors, this often results in over- taxation, because if they were to make similar investments directly, they would typically not pay tax on those capital gains. 1 The term Collective Investment Vehicle (CIV) is used to refer generically to vehicles that pool the capital of different investors. The term Qualifying Collective Investment Vehicle (QCIV) is used to refer to entities that will qualify for the new tax rules. 2 1.7 The government proposes to adopt rules so that the tax treatment of pooled funds better reflects the treatment of individuals who invest in those funds. 1.8 Problems also arise in relation to different tax rules applying to different types of pooled vehicles, such as unit trusts or superannuation schemes. The government proposes to provide rules allowing these different structures to be treated similarly. 1.9 For offshore investments, special tax rules, known as the “grey list” exemption, apply to investments in entities resident in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. Investments in those countries can be taxed more favourably than comparable investment in New Zealand or countries that are not on the grey list. 1.10 The unintended effect is that incentives are created to invest directly and in offshore assets for tax purposes. This can disproportionately affect lower and middle-income savers because they are unlikely to have sufficient funds to invest directly and get diversified returns. 1.11 Balancing onshore and offshore taxation of investment is complicated. One reason is that New Zealanders pay tax on their domestic investments through the tax payments of companies that they invest in (though, often, people do not think about the tax paid by companies in this way). The company tax system levies tax on the earnings of companies even if they do not pay dividends, which provides a measure of tax on investments, even though rises in share price may not be directly taxable. In other countries, some companies pay a similar level of tax, while others pay little to no tax. Further, some offshore investments pay regular dividends, as most New Zealand companies do, while others rarely if ever do so. As a result, finding one tax treatment that suits all offshore investments and does not leave some offshore investments significantly under-taxed is a challenge. 1.12 The proposals outlined here are aimed at better aligning the tax treatment of direct and indirect investment in New Zealand shares, and ensuring that a reasonable level of tax is payable on offshore portfolio share investments. 1.13 The proposals also have wider links with other government initiatives being undertaken in the area of savings and investment. The main link is with the KiwiSaver proposal announced in the 2005 Budget, which aims to encourage employees to save through work-based savings schemes. It is important that if employees are encouraged to save through work-based savings, that the earnings from such investments are taxed consistently and fairly. 3 1.14 The proposals contained in this document are designed to achieve this, and have been developed in consultation with a number of stakeholders, including the Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, the Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, and various other financial industry and tax experts. This consultation has been very constructive and the government welcomes further input from these and other interested groups. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS New tax rules for collective investment vehicles • From 1 April 2007, a pooled fund that qualifies as a qualifying collective investment vehicle (QCIV) would be able to elect a new set of tax rules. • Under the new tax rules for QCIVs, assessable income would generally exclude realised domestic share gains, although certain domestic share gains that are close debt substitutes would continue to be taxable. • To qualify as a QCIV, a pooled vehicle would need to meet a number of criteria. These include that the vehicle’s principal activities are in the nature of savings and investment; it is sufficiently widely held; investors in the vehicle are “portfolio” investors; and the vehicle is itself a “portfolio” investor. • Under the new tax rules for QCIVs, assessable income would be required to be “flowed through” to investors, with the QCIV deducting tax at investors’ elected tax rates. • Under the flow-through model, to the extent possible, investors’ income would need to be attributed and taxed on a regular basis. • Investors in QCIVs would generally need to elect a tax rate for QCIV income, based on the previous year’s total assessable income from all sources. For individuals, the rate elected would generally be a final withholding tax and would not affect family assistance or child support and student loan obligations. Companies and other non-individual investors would elect their statutory rate. The tax deducted on behalf of these entities would not be a final withholding tax. • If the QCIV incurs a tax loss, the loss can be carried forward and used by the QCIV to offset assessable income in future years, or can be allocated to investors’ accounts. • Tax credits received by the QCIV, such as imputation credits, will be available to offset assessable income derived via the QCIV. Proposals to change the tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares • Tax rules for offshore investment in shares where the investor owns 10% or less of the foreign entity invested into (“portfolio” investment) will change. 4 • The grey list, which allows for concessionary tax treatment of investments into seven countries, will be removed for portfolio investments. • QCIVs and other non-individual investors will, broadly, use the change in an offshore asset’s value over the tax year to calculate their assessable income for that asset. This method will apply to assets for which there is a readily verifiable market value. • Individuals will also base their assessable income on an offshore asset’s change in value over the tax year. However, the tax paid will generally be spread over a number of years to reflect the investor’s cashflow. This method will apply to assets for which there is a readily verifiable market value. • Assessable income on assets that do not have a readily verifiable market value will be calculated under a simplified deemed rate of return approach. • The new rules would not apply to individuals’ investments below $50,000 (total cost of investments) into companies listed on a recognised stock exchange in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. 1.15 Submissions on any aspect of this discussion document are welcome and can be mailed to: Taxation of Investment Income C/- The Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON 1.16 Alternatively, submissions may be made in electronic form to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Please put “Taxation of Investment Income” in the subject line for electronic submissions. 1.17 Submissions should be made by 30 September 2005 and should contain a brief summary of the main points and recommendations.

Like all economically valuable inputs, capital is scarce relative to the uses it could be put to, so it is important that this capital is allocated to its most productive use. 2.2 The current tax rules for investment distort the productive allocation of capital and can generate widely varying tax results for similar types of investment. They also provide an incentive for New Zealanders to invest offshore to seek after-tax returns in just a few countries, when better overall returns may be available in New Zealand or in countries that do not receive concessionary tax treatments. 2.3 The taxation of investment income is a long-standing, complex and controversial issue. It has been the subject of many reviews, the most recent being: • The Tax Review 2001, which looked at the structure of New Zealand’s tax system, including those for investment, and recommended the government consider changes to the tax rules for portfolio offshore investment in shares. The proposal put forward for taxing offshore investment was a risk-free return method (RFRM) which would tax deemed income. • A review of the tax rules for offshore investment in shares by tax policy officials, which culminated in an issues paper released in late 2003. This document outlined two options for reform – a method based on a deemed rate and a method based on taxing actual changes in value. Submissions on this document overwhelmingly favoured considering tax problems relating to domestic savings vehicles at the same time as any changes to the offshore rules. • A review of the tax rules for investment income by Craig Stobo, the former CEO of BT Funds Management, in late 2004. It looked at both the vexatious issue of offshore investment, and the tax issues facing investment in New Zealand shares undertaken via a savings vehicle such as a managed fund. 2.4 These reviews and, most notably, the Stobo review have clearly revealed the extent of tax problems in this sector and put forward different options for mitigating various distortions that arise. These distortions are discussed in more detail later, together with the recommendations made for reform in the Stobo report. 6 Scope of the problem 2.5 Under the current tax rules for investment income, different tax outcomes can arise depending on whether an investor invests directly or through a savings vehicle such as a unit trust or superannuation fund. Equally, different tax outcomes can arise depending on whether the investment is in a New Zealand-based company or a foreign one, with different tax rules also applying to different investments offshore depending on whether the investment is in a grey list country. The grey list exemption applies to investments in entities resident in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. Finally, problems arise owing to the lack of integration, in certain cases, between an individual’s marginal tax rate and the tax rate applying to the savings vehicle being invested into. 2.6 In light of these concerns, Craig Stobo was appointed by the government last year to look at the structure of the tax rules for investment income. His role was to consult with the various stakeholders in the New Zealand savings industry, and make recommendations for reform that were consistent with industry consensus. 2.7 The scope of the review included the taxation treatment of New Zealand- resident savings vehicles on their domestic investments in shares and the tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares by both savings vehicles and other investors. Direct investment by New Zealanders in domestic shares was not part of the terms of reference for the review. This was to ensure that the review of the taxation rules for investment income was feasible within the review’s timeframe, from July to October 2004. It was also recognised that encompassing all aspects of the taxation of investment income, including investment in debt and other non-equity investments, would not have been possible without significantly delaying consideration of key areas such as the tax rules for savings vehicles and offshore investment. 2.8 The review provided a detailed summary of the existing tax boundaries for investment. One of the main distortions identified for domestic investment was the inequity in tax treatment depending on whether an investor acquires an ownership interest in a New Zealand company directly or via an investment vehicle. In most cases, a direct investment in a New Zealand company will be treated as being held, for tax purposes, on capital account. This means that only dividends, not increases in share value, are taxable. On the other hand, if the investment were made via an investment manager, most investment vehicles would hold investments on revenue account, with tax payable on realised gains as well as on dividends. This is because such vehicles are usually in the business of dealing in shares, which requires trustees or fund managers to maintain equity amongst current and future investors. This revenue account treatment occurs despite the fact that the investor may hold the investment in the CIV on capital account. The fact that the investor’s capital account status is generally not reflected when he or she invests through a fund manager creates a disincentive for individuals to invest domestically using financial intermediaries. 7 2.9 A secondary issue considered was the non-alignment of investors’ marginal tax rates and the tax rate applying to the savings vehicle invested into. Under the company tax model, imputation allows alignment of company and shareholder tax rates on payment of dividends and other distributions. However, for other entities, alignment of tax rates is either inefficient or absent altogether. An example of this is the tax treatment of superannuation funds where income is taxed to the fund at the rate of 33% but distributions are tax exempt. This creates alignment problems for taxpayers on marginal tax rates of 21% and 39% because the latter are under-taxed in a superannuation fund and the former are over-taxed. The tax treatment of income from unit trusts, superannuation funds and life insurance also varies. 2.10 The other major tax problem identified in the Stobo report was the different tax treatment that applies to investments made in New Zealand or offshore. 2.11 Under the current grey list exemption, non-controlled investment on capital account in companies resident in grey list countries is taxable only on distributions. While similar investment in domestic companies is also taxable on distributions, the company invested into is required to pay tax at 33% each year on its assessable income. Clearly, New Zealand does not have the power to tax offshore companies that New Zealanders invest into. The grey list effectively deems the tax paid by the foreign company in the foreign jurisdiction to be equivalent to New Zealand tax. It operates on the assumption that the entity resident in the grey list pays a similar level of tax to what would have been paid if the investment was made into a New Zealand company. When this level of tax is not paid offshore, the grey list creates an investment distortion in favour of investing offshore. 2.12 Finally, even with the grey list exemption, a different treatment applies depending on whether the offshore investment into a grey list country is made directly or via a New Zealand-resident CIV. That is because the domestic capital/revenue boundary applies on grey list investments. This means that a direct investor will generally hold grey list investments on capital account, whereas active investment managers will typically be deemed to hold an equivalent investment on revenue account, in the same way that domestic shares are treated as being held on revenue account. As with non-controlled investment in New Zealand shares, this creates a disadvantage for an investor when using savings vehicles to hold offshore investments. Intermediation 2.13 The government is concerned about the tax distortions to investment identified by the Stobo review for several reasons. 8 2.14 One is the unintended inequity resulting from the current rules. The tax barrier to investing via savings vehicles may disproportionately affect lower and middle-income savers as these groups are unlikely to have sufficient funds and expertise to invest directly in a diversified portfolio of assets. For them, savings and investment vehicles may be an important source of portfolio diversification, but one that is currently tax-disadvantaged. 2.15 Another cause for concern is the effect of tax distortions on the financial system. The pooling of investment and its reallocation generates a broader range of investments than individuals would generally be able to undertake on their own, providing benefits both to investors and to the economy. Work carried out by the Treasury has highlighted the economic importance of the system of financial intermediation, including its role as a key source of finance for certain types of firms. The existing tax distortions impede the productive use of capital and misallocate investment by discouraging intermediation. 2.16 The tax distortion favouring direct investment may naturally lead to investment into larger, more established firms at the cost of investment in financial intermediaries, which affects the investments those intermediaries would make. This is because investors are likely to have incentives to invest directly in established companies. These companies are likely to pay a reasonable level of dividend, providing a greater level of comfort to an individual investor that the investment would be treated on capital account. That could limit access to external finance for some firms or investment types that are better serviced by the pooling of investment through financial intermediaries. Those more likely to be affected include newer firms, those with novel business plans or for whom intellectual property is a large portion of assets, smaller firms or those entering the export sector. 2.17 Discouraging the use of financial intermediaries can have broader costs on the financial system as well. Institutional investors may also play an important role in the efficient functioning of financial markets because investors rely on them, to some degree, to evaluate the governance of firms. Taxation of offshore investments 2.18 The viability of the grey list as the basis for New Zealand’s tax rules for offshore non-controlled investment in shares is increasingly under strain because of various investment entities that result in little or no tax paid in the grey list jurisdiction. Examples include Australian unit trusts (AUTs) and United Kingdom open-ended investment companies (OEICs). 2.19 In relation to Australian unit trusts, when the investment income is non- Australian sourced and derived immediately by non-residents, the AUT is not subject to tax on that income in Australia. Until recently, AUTs were able to pass through tax-free gains to New Zealand resident investors. Open- ended investment companies are slightly different in that they pay tax in the United Kingdom on dividends and other income, but not on capital gains. 9 2.20 The grey list also assumes that investments into grey list countries actually represent investments into “bricks and mortar” in those countries. The experience with AUTs and OEICs demonstrates that investments into grey list countries often flow through into other countries, where the assumption of adequate taxation is even less likely to hold. The popularity of AUTs and OEICs suggests strongly that the grey list will be unsustainable in the long- term. 2.21 By taxing grey list investments only on their distributions, the tax rules encourage New Zealanders to make overseas investments that do not distribute much of their income. Even when the grey list investment actually pays little or no tax overseas, the New Zealand tax rules deem them to have paid sufficient overseas tax. In effect, this exposes the New Zealand tax base to loopholes in the tax bases of the world’s largest economies. 2.22 The assumptions underpinning the grey list increasingly no longer hold credibility, particularly for portfolio investment. Retention of these concessionary tax rules results in an increasingly significant incentive to invest offshore, and in a small number of countries, at the expense of investment in New Zealand or non-grey list countries which would offer diversification and growth opportunities for investors. 2.23 While direct portfolio investment by an individual in a company that is resident in a grey list country is typically taxable only on distributions from the company, investments in non-grey list companies can be taxed on an accrued basis. This typically occurs on unrealised changes in value, under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. The difference in tax treatment has created a real incentive for individuals directly investing offshore to invest in the grey list rather than lower-tax jurisdictions and certain high-growth non- grey list countries. That does not make sound economic sense. 2.24 Finally, the grey list retains the same distortion between direct and indirect investment for offshore investment that occurs domestically. New Zealanders are discouraged from using domestic investment vehicles in favour of overseas vehicles, which undermines the viability of investment vehicles based in New Zealand. If New Zealand-based investment vehicles are important economically for domestic investment, or for effectively managing overseas investments of New Zealanders, this is an undesirable outcome. Stobo report’s options for dealing with tax boundary concerns 2.25 The Stobo report proposed a number of options for resolving the identified concerns with the tax treatment of investment income: • To resolve the non-alignment of personal and entity tax rates when investing via a managed fund and the different tax treatment across entities, it was recommended that qualifying savings vehicles, known as “qualifying collective investment vehicles” (QCIVs), be given flow- 10 through treatment. Under a flow-through model, the vehicle would be transparent for tax purposes. The underlying income would be treated as being derived directly by the investors, with tax withheld at investors’ marginal tax rates. QCIVs would simply operate as a withholding agent for tax purposes. • To resolve concerns in relation to the inequity in tax treatment depending on whether an investor invests in domestic shares directly or via a QCIV, two options were provided: – Option (1): exempting from taxation realised gains on domestic shares made via a QCIV. – Option (2): taxing domestic shares held through a QCIV using a deemed rate approach (an investment and savings tax, a variant of the risk-free return method or RFRM). • To resolve concerns in relation to the current tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares (the grey list and non-grey list distinction), the report recommended replacement of the grey list and FIF rules with an investment and savings tax. 2.26 In consulting on the tax boundaries and options to mitigate the impact of these on investment decisions, about 70 parties were consulted with as part of the review. They included individual fund managers, financial planners, tax advisors, consumer advocates and industry associations such as the Investment, Savings and Insurance Association, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, the Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand, the New Zealand Law Society and the Corporate Taxpayers Group. 2.27 The Stobo report necessarily evaluated any options for the resolution of the identified tax distortions at a high level, noting that the options needed to be developed in more detail, with relevant stakeholders. The report provides a sound basis for discussions with key stakeholders on detailed design issues around the options identified. These discussions have framed the proposals for change that are outlined in this document. Some proposals are different from those recommended by the Stobo report. Reasons for these differences are outlined later in this chapter, with greater detail included in the next few chapters. Evaluation of options from the Stobo report 2.28 The options for changing the tax rules for savings vehicles put forward in the Stobo report were aimed at providing greater neutrality between the tax treatment of direct and indirect investment in onshore and offshore investment in shares. According to stakeholders consulted during the review, the distortion between direct and indirect investment (both offshore and onshore) was the key issue. 11 Domestic investment 2.29 As noted earlier, realised profits on New Zealand shares that are held directly are not taxed, while those made via a CIV generally are taxed. The current treatment therefore creates a distortion in favour of holding domestic shares directly, rather than through managed funds. 2.30 The Stobo report suggested that an investment and savings tax should replace the current rules that tax managed funds on their realised profits from shares held in New Zealand companies. Under this approach, assessable income would be calculated by deeming the value of a fund’s share portfolio to have a return equivalent to the government stock rate. While such an approach is arguably better than the status quo, it would not provide sufficiently similar treatment to direct investment. 2.31 Of the two domestic reform options identified in the report, the option to exempt from tax most realised equity gains derived via a QCIV would bring the taxation of this income into alignment with that of direct investment better than an investment and savings tax would. As this was a key objective of the review, the option to exempt most domestic share gains would seem to be desirable from both an equity and efficiency perspective and is therefore the government’s preferred option for reform. This was also the preferred option of most stakeholders consulted and is discussed in more detail in chapter 4. 2.32 Stakeholders consulted during the review also broadly supported a flow- through of assessable income to investors via QCIVs on the basis that this would allow for better alignment with investor tax rates and reduce the tax risks for QCIVs. While some concern was expressed over the cost required to change systems to accommodate the new approach, most stakeholders accepted that there were benefits in such an approach. 2.33 A flow-through model for QCIVs should result in taxpayers’ personal tax rates applying to their investment income derived via a QCIV and should better align with the treatment of direct investment. The government therefore supports this option, which is discussed in greater detail in chapter 4. Offshore investment 2.34 For the taxation of offshore investments, the option put forward by the Stobo report would remove the current grey/non-grey list distinction for portfolio investments, resulting in investment decisions being less influenced by the tax system. The government supports the removal of the grey/non-grey list distinction as this should remove tax biases in favour of investment in some countries and should encourage New Zealanders to invest in other countries based on after-foreign tax returns. 12 2.35 The report also recommended that an investment and savings tax replace the current tax rules on share gains derived via a QCIV, largely because it would remove the onshore/offshore boundary for QCIVs. However, the boundary would remain for non-QCIV investors, because the investment and savings tax would apply to their offshore direct holdings, whereas the current rules would apply to domestic shares. Under the Stobo recommendation, the onshore/offshore tax boundary would remain for direct portfolio investment in shares. 2.36 An investment and savings tax, although conceptually simple, is also relatively complex to apply. The complexity arises when investors make adjustments to their portfolio of offshore assets during a year – in other words, buys certain shares and sells others. 2.37 Under an investment and savings tax, if these “part-year” adjustments are not accounted for, a situation could arise where a taxpayer could be under-taxed or over-taxed. Investors would be under-taxed when they did not hold any assets at, say, the beginning of the year and they acquired assets during the year, because the investment and savings tax would calculate tax on an opening value of zero. They would be over-taxed when they held some offshore shares at the start of a year, but sold a portion of their holding during the year. If no adjustment were made to account for the fact that the holding at the beginning of the year was not retained for the entire year, tax would be paid as if none of the shares had been sold. Likewise, calculating tax on a full year’s worth of income would occur on shares that were held for as little as one day. 2.38 Mechanisms exist for accounting for such portfolio adjustments. Officials developed such a method for shares held in a non-business context. (See the issues paper, Taxation of non-controlled offshore investment in equity, released in December 2003.) Funds could manage such adjustments relatively easily by simply calculating investment and savings tax on daily unit prices. However, the method developed for non-business investors is much more difficult. 2.39 While it would be possible to further simplify the investment and savings tax income calculation mechanism for smaller investors, the government does not consider that the simplification benefits are likely to be significant. Such a measure would still result in high compliance costs for investors, and any simplicity would come at the cost of greater inaccuracy in the income calculation measure. The potential for abuse of such a measure could easily outweigh the benefits. 2.40 The government is also concerned that an investment and savings tax would result in New Zealanders having to pay tax even when the value of their investment declined. While the assumptions underlying an investment and savings tax would support such a proposition, in practical terms, this could result in tax having to be paid on an offshore share, even when there is no cashflow, such as a dividend to meet the tax liability. 13 2.41 Finally, it is not clear that an investment and savings tax (or an RFRM) is the appropriate mechanism for taxing offshore portfolio investment in shares. Other options appear to be more suitable for dealing with the tax boundaries raised in the Stobo report. One such alternative, developed in consultation with stakeholders and which the government considers addresses many of the boundary issues identified in the Stobo report more comprehensively than an investment and savings tax/RFRM, is discussed in more detail in chapter 5. 14 Chapter 3 NEW TAX RULES FOR COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT VEHICLES 3.1 This chapter and chapter 4 outline a new set of tax rules for the calculation of assessable income derived through qualifying savings vehicles (termed qualifying collective investment vehicles or QCIVs) on their investments in domestic shares. It is envisaged that savings vehicles that meet the definition of QCIV will be able to elect into the rules from 1 April 2007. This will allow those vehicles that meet the QCIV definitional requirements to remain under the existing tax rules until they are able to make the transition. Whether the new rules remain elective will be reviewed in the future. 3.2 The aim of the proposals outlined in this chapter is to create a set of tax rules that allow investment vehicles to overcome the tax distortions discussed in the previous chapter. The proposals must therefore ensure that investors in QCIVs have their investment income taxed appropriately. The starting point for this is articulating which entities are eligible to use the new rules. 3.3 The current company tax rules generally tax distributions from companies even when the distributions were not taxed at the company level. While this treatment is being relaxed for QCIVs (on the basis that they are effectively operating as an investment decision-maker for their investors) it is important to note that these proposals do not aim to relax the rules outside this limited area. Definition of a collective investment vehicle 3.4 To achieve the policy objectives described in chapter 2, it is necessary to define the nature of the vehicles that will qualify for the relaxation of income tax on certain share gains derived. Accordingly, the term “QCIV” needs to be defined, and difficult boundary issues will need to be resolved. The government aims to ensure that the boundary is appropriately defined to enable valid savings and investment vehicles to access the rules, while maintaining the tax base and preventing abuse of the rules. It is envisaged that the rules will be elective to prevent other entities from inadvertently falling within them and being subject to the associated QCIV tax obligations. Features of a qualifying collective investment vehicle 3.5 Given the main policy objectives of the review, it is the government’s view that an entity seeking QCIV status should have these key features to qualify for the proposed special tax treatment: 15 • Its principal activities should be in the nature of savings and investment. • It should be sufficiently widely held. • It does not issue units of different classes to its investors. • Its investors should be “portfolio” investors. • It should itself be a “portfolio” investor. • It should be resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. Principal activity of savings and investment 3.6 One of the key aims of the proposed rules is to remove a significant tax barrier to diversified portfolio investment faced by those investing via savings and investment vehicles. The government therefore considers that a QCIV should be a vehicle whose principal activity is the pooling and allocation of capital for the purposes of diversified saving and investment, and from which investors will be provided with investment returns. It is envisaged that this would involve the provision of facilities by the entity to enable many non-associated investors (such as subscribers, purchasers, or contributors) to come together and pool monetary capital, invest the pooled capital in a diversified manner, and share in the investment income and gains. 3.7 This requirement would aim to ensure that only genuinely diversified savings and investment vehicles were eligible to access the special tax QCIV rules. Entities with principal activities that are other than that of savings and investment, such as manufacturing firms, would therefore not be eligible. The meaning of “principal” should reflect the underlying objective that virtually all of the activities of the entity should be of a savings and investment nature. 3.8 The government welcomes submissions on this proposal. Sufficiently widely held by portfolio investors 3.9 The government considers that a QCIV should be a sufficiently “widely held” savings and investment vehicle. This leads to the conclusion that the definition of QCIV should require that: • The entity has a reasonable minimum number of non-associated persons investing into it. • The entity’s investors are “portfolio” investors only. 16 Minimum number of investors 3.10 The absence of a formal capital gains tax in New Zealand is driven by practical considerations rather than the application of theoretical economic principles in defining the appropriate tax base. However, in a country without a capital gains tax, there are sound reasons why a government would still seek to tax certain forms of capital gains – for example, when there is a significant degree of substitutability between non-taxable gains and gains that would otherwise form part of assessable income. With respect to the definition of a QCIV, substitutability with the taxable labour income of individuals is a key concern. Not taxing genuine labour income could undermine the tax system and reduce the tax base that provides the revenue necessary to fund critical public services. 3.11 To be consistent with the policy objectives of the special tax QCIV rules, a critical requirement of the definition of QCIV would be that the savings and investment entity has a reasonable number of non-associated investors holding an ownership (or equivalent) interest in that entity. The rationale for this requirement is to reduce the potential for abuse by ensuring that the rules are not accessed by “closely held” entities, or the widespread use of entities by individuals seeking to shelter their investment-trading labour income from tax. 3.12 The government seeks to determine a minimum number of investors that will ensure QCIVs are sufficiently widely held, while allowing genuine savings and investment vehicles to access the new rules. It is also important to ensure that vehicles specialising in greenfields investments and investments in unlisted companies are able to access the new rules where practical. This is considered important because there is the potential for these investments to significantly contribute to a sustainable increase in New Zealand’s long-term economic growth, as well as lead to a greater diversification of investment portfolios. What constitutes a “sufficient number” of investors to be generally regarded as “widely held” is clearly a subjective issue, and it is acknowledged that any number used will ultimately be a question of judgement. 3.13 In seeking guidance for an appropriate minimum number of investors, current income tax legislation defines “widely held company” for certain purposes as essentially being a company that has at least 25 non-associated shareholders. In addition, the definition of “qualifying unit trust” in the income tax legislation requires a unit trust to have at least 100 non-associated unit holders (investors) in order to be treated as the same notional single person and prevent breaches of the shareholder continuity rules. Accordingly, there is some range in the current income tax legislation concerning the minimum number of investors typically required in a widely held context. When considering the minimum number of investors required for an entity to access the special tax QCIV rules, the government considers that the need to ensure that a QCIV is genuinely widely held should be balanced against not excluding funds that invest in unlisted New Zealand companies. Requirements on minimum investor numbers are relevant for 17 greenfields investments and investments in unlisted companies, as often these funds have a limited number of investors. 3.14 Given the policy objectives of the proposals, the concern over abuse and tax avoidance in a “closely held” context, and the importance of facilitating access to the special tax QCIV rules for greenfields investments and investments in unlisted companies, the government considers at this stage that the minimum number of non-associated investors required for an entity to qualify as a QCIV should be 20. While this requirement would not accommodate all greenfields investments and investments in unlisted companies, it would facilitate access to the rules for those that are genuinely widely held. 3.15 If a QCIV invests into another QCIV, the minimum number of investors would automatically be met, although non-QCIV investors would still be limited to a portfolio interest. The rationale behind this exception would be to accommodate the common commercial situation in the funds management industry whereby retail investment funds achieve efficiencies and diversification through the use of diversified wholesale investment funds. 3.16 Submissions are welcomed on these issues. Owners are portfolio investors 3.17 Given that the new rules are designed to apply to widely held entities that pool capital for many investors, the government considers that it is appropriate for there to be a requirement that the owners of the entity seeking QCIV status should be portfolio investors. This requirement supplements the constraint outlined earlier in relation to the minimum number of investors. However, this requirement raises boundary concerns about the precise meaning of the term “portfolio investor”. The current taxation of offshore investment income rules – for example, the underlying foreign tax credit rules – and international norms on the taxation of portfolio investment, suggest that a “portfolio investor” is typically one holding equal to or less than a 10% actual ownership interest in any given asset or investment, taking into account any situation where there is a “market value circumstance”. 2 While the government considers that this is a reasonable and generally accepted concept of portfolio investment, submissions are welcome on this point. 3.18 As QCIVs are themselves widely held, however, an exception to the “portfolio investor” rule is proposed to allow a QCIV to have a greater than 10% interest in another QCIV. 2 A “market value circumstance” exists when a person’s actual ownership interest in an entity does not accurately reflect the person’s economic interest in that entity. 18 3.19 It is also proposed that exceptions to the “portfolio investor” rule be allowed in “unusual or temporary breaches” such as the insertion of seed capital or when a fund is winding down. Such rules are a feature of the current definition of “qualifying unit trust”. 3.20 Submissions are welcome on developing workable “unusual or temporary breach” rules that do not give rise to significant tax base maintenance concerns and administration difficulties. Entity seeking QCIV status must be a portfolio investor 3.21 To reduce tax barriers to portfolio investors accessing diversified investment portfolios, the government considers that the definition of QCIV should require the savings and investment vehicle seeking QCIV status to itself be a portfolio investor. The aim of this requirement would be to restrict access to the rules to those widely held entities that have pooled investors’ resources and invested into a diversified range of investments. 3.22 In principle, the 10% portfolio requirement would seem an appropriate starting point for determining the maximum actual ownership interest a QCIV could have in any given asset or investment. However, when considering the maximum actual ownership interest a QCIV should be allowed to have in a particular investment under the new rules, the ability to access greenfields investments and investments in unlisted companies is an important consideration. 3.23 By their nature, these investments are typically owned by a small number of investors in the early-growth stages of investment. Consequently, maximum actual ownership interest rules that are too restrictive may exclude such investments. Further, the government understands that it is common and prudent practice in the funds management industry for certain diversified investment portfolios to contain investments in which the fund has a 100% interest – such as commercial property investments, for example. While this would not generally be consistent with a “portfolio investor” principle, the government considers it may be appropriate to accommodate these situations by modifying the maximum actual ownership interest tests as they would apply to a QCIV’s outward investment. 3.24 To deal with these considerations, the government proposes two options in relation to the maximum actual ownership interest restrictions. Option 1 3.25 Under this option, entities seeking QCIV status would generally be restricted to a maximum actual ownership interest of 10% in any given non-QCIV investment. That is consistent with international norms of what constitutes portfolio investment. However, the government acknowledges that the 10% portfolio investment requirement may significantly restrict access by investment funds designed to facilitate access to greenfields investments and investments in unlisted companies. 19 Option 2 3.26 Under option two, entities seeking QCIV status would generally be restricted to a maximum actual ownership interest of 25% in any given non-QCIV investment. Although that represents a departure from international norms in terms of the meaning of portfolio investment, it reflects a balance in order to ensure flexibility is provided to access certain types of investments, while ensuring QCIVs maintain diversified investment portfolios. 3.27 An additional requirement may be appropriate under this option to combat abuse of the rules. Specifically, an entity seeking QCIV status, that is not a registered superannuation scheme, would have a mechanism to ensure that investors could access their investments at an estimated market value (a “buy-back” mechanism). 3.28 The rationale for requiring a buy-back mechanism is to ensure that an investor in a QCIV is effectively in the same position as a direct investor – that is, the investor is able to redeem the investment at an estimated market value. While it is not proposed that such access would be available to investors on a daily basis (as this would preclude legitimate situations where investment lock-in was required by investors), the buy-back mechanism would need to be available to investors at a minimum of every five years. Non-portfolio investment 3.29 Whether a portfolio interest is deemed to be 10% or 25% for a particular CIV, an exception could be provided for some non-portfolio investments. A QCIV could hold up to a 100% actual ownership interest in any particular non-QCIV investment, with the proviso that the aggregate value of all QCIV investments in which the QCIV has a non-portfolio interest do not represent more than 10% of the value of the entity’s total investment portfolio during the entire period that the particular investment is held. 3.30 The rationale behind this requirement is to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility within the rules to allow a QCIV to hold a significant interest in investments that are part of a genuine diversified investment portfolio. This would accommodate diversified investments that are both passive – such as investments that derive rental, interest, dividend, and royalty income – and those that are active in nature, such as income derived from manufacturing activities, while ensuring that the vehicle is still in itself a portfolio investor. 3.31 It is acknowledged that these rules may preclude certain property trusts from accessing the new QCIV rules (as they may breach the suggested maximum 10% non-QCIV investment threshold). The government seeks submissions on this point 20 3.32 The government appreciates that each option has its merits and drawbacks. It also acknowledges that these maximum actual ownership interest restrictions may involve some compliance costs for taxpayers in terms of investment-level monitoring activities, notwithstanding the extra flexibility being proposed. Accordingly, submissions on ways to minimise compliance costs while guarding against potential abuse and circumvention of the rules are welcomed. 3.33 Under both options a QCIV can hold real property directly, provided the property is not more than 10% of the value of the QCIV’s total underlying assets. To the extent that real property is held on revenue account, that could pose problems for QCIVs in flowing through unrealised taxable amounts to underlying investors. This would suggest that QCIVs holding real property on revenue account should have the option of accounting for tax on the change in value of that property. 3.34 Submissions are invited on how difficult it would be to require flow-through of unrealised taxable amounts to underlying investors. One class of unit on issue 3.35 A key aim of the proposals is to ensure that the correct amount of income is taxed at the correct rate. To achieve this it is necessary to be able to calculate each investor’s share of the underlying assets. If an entity issued different classes of unit – for example, Class A units which entitled investors to income and Class B units which entitled investors to capital appreciation – it would not be feasible to calculate each investor’s share. In addition, allowing different classes of units to be issued could give rise to tax integrity concerns. For example, it could be possible for a class of unit to be issued that would provide investors on high marginal tax rates with an entitlement to non-taxable capital gains, while a different class of units, giving an entitlement to assessable income, could be provided to low marginal tax rate investors. 3.36 The government therefore proposes a requirement that to meet the QCIV definition, the entity issues only one class of unit for each fund it operates. This measure is not intended to stop QCIVs that consist of several different funds, such as a balanced fund, conservative fund or growth fund, from offering different units for the different funds. This is current commercial practice. Rather, it is meant to stop the development of products designed to stream different classes of income to different investors, depending on the tax benefits involved. QCIVs that do not offer units such as defined benefit superannuation schemes would not be subject to the requirement as they do not operate on a unit basis. 21 QCIV must be New Zealand-resident for tax purposes 3.37 An entity granted QCIV status will be required to discharge certain tax obligations, as outlined in the next chapter. Among these obligations is the requirement to calculate, deduct and forward tax payments to Inland Revenue on behalf of investors for the taxable investment income they derive. 3.38 To ensure that these obligations can be adequately monitored and enforced, QCIVs should have a fixed New Zealand presence. It is envisaged that this presence would take the form of a New Zealand-resident entity through which tax calculation and tax payment activities are performed. In principle, it is an appropriate tax policy result to allow non-resident portfolio investors access to the rules as well as resident investors, thereby allowing non- resident investors the same exemption from income tax for domestic share gains as that provided to resident investors. The proposed withholding tax rate that would be applicable to distributions by the QCIV to non-resident investors is discussed in the next chapter. 3.39 Submissions are welcome on the issue of whether there should be a requirement that an entity seeking QCIV status should be resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. Breach of QCIV criteria 3.40 Only entities meeting and continuing to meet the QCIV definitional requirements should have access to, and continue to have access to, the special tax QCIV rules. Rules will need to be developed to address situations where breaches occur that are not of an unusual or temporary nature. 3.41 Given that existing tax rules would continue to apply to non-QCIV entities after the implementation date of the new rules, it follows that those breaching the QCIV definitional requirements would generally revert back to the tax treatment applying under those existing rules. However, there is a concern that this approach would allow some entities with QCIV status to change between the two sets of rules when it suited them, in clear conflict with the policy intent of the new rules. To prevent this kind of activity, the following consequences are proposed when an entity breaches the QCIV definitional requirements as a result of a situation that is not regarded as unusual or temporary: • The flow-through status of investment income would be lost. • The entity would revert to taxation under the tax rules existing for non- QCIVs from the beginning of the income year of breach. This may result in provisional tax liabilities arising and the imposition of tax penalties and use-of-money interest. • There would be a deemed disposition and acquisition of all investments at market value at the time the breach first occurred. 22 • Domestic share gains would become taxable. • Losses arising in relation to domestic shares would be available to offset against gains from domestic shares in the year of the breach. Any residual losses would be extinguished. • The entity would forfeit its ability to become a QCIV in future. 3.42 The aim of these restrictions is to provide a significant disincentive for taxpayers to be in permanent breach, defeating the policy intent of the new rules. Submissions are welcomed on the nature and details of rules that should apply to permanent breaches of QCIV definitional requirements. 3.43 A question arises in respect of how to treat tax previously deducted and paid to Inland Revenue by the QCIV on behalf of investors before the time of breach. It is also relevant to the issue of how this tax would factor into any provisional tax payable by the entity in breach. Submissions on any problematic aspects of the proposed rules are invited. QCIV a taxable entity 3.44 To ensure that the investment management fees derived by QCIVs from investors are declared and appropriately taxed, QCIVs would be taxable entities in relation to their investment management-fee income. The income subject to tax would be the net income derived by the QCIV from its investment management activities, which would generally consist of its fee income less any deductible expenses. QCIVs would therefore be required to file annual income tax returns. 3.45 A key exception to the portfolio investment rules would enable QCIVs to acquire a 100% ownership interest in business assets necessary to provide their investment management services. This would enable them to wholly own business assets such as a business premises from which investment management and administration activities are carried out; furniture and fittings; information technology and communications equipment. QCIVs would also be able to employ personnel to carry out and provide investment management services. 3.46 The government recognises that the proposal may not be a perfect fit with how CIVs are currently structured. Submissions on practical problems the proposal may give rise to are welcomed. Application 3.47 The special QCIV tax rules would be elective to prevent savings and investment entities from inadvertently falling within the rules and being unknowingly exposed to the associated QCIV tax obligations. Accordingly, the current taxation of investment income rules would apply unless an entity specifically elected into the rules. While it is appreciated that this proposal would involve the operation of two sets of rules concurrently and therefore result in greater complexity, it would preserve the special status of the new 23 rules by ensuring that only those meeting the definition of QCIV are exempt from income tax on domestic share gains. However, it is expected that the voluntary nature of the rules would be reviewed in future. 3.48 To combat possible abuse of the new rules by entities electing into the rules one year and out the next, the government considers it is necessary for elections into the new rules to be irrevocable. The new rules would cease to apply only on cessation and winding up of the particular entity, or in the case of a breach of the QCIV definitional requirements. Points for submission The government welcomes submissions on any points raised in this discussion document, with specific comment welcomed on the following: • Whether the entity’s principal activities should be in the nature of savings and investment, and the meaning of “principal”. • The appropriate minimum number of investors a QCIV should have in order to be sufficiently widely held. • The concept that QCIV investors should be portfolio investors and the maximum investment that any one investor should be allowed to have in the QCIV. • Whether workable “unusual or temporary breach” rules can be developed, and the nature of these rules. • Whether the QCIV should itself be a portfolio investor and the maximum actual ownership interest a QCIV should be allowed to have in any given asset or investment. • Whether there should be a requirement that an entity seeking QCIV status should be resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. • The consequences of breaches of the QCIV definitional requirements when the breaches are not “unusual or temporary”, and the nature and detail of any rules to deal with such situations. • The practical problems associated with the QCIV being able to have 100% ownership in business assets necessary to conduct investment management and administrative functions. 24 Chapter 4 PROPOSALS TO ACHIEVE NEUTRALITY AND ALIGN MARGINAL TAX RATES Proposal 1: A new definition of assessable income for QCIVs 4.1 To achieve broad neutrality between direct investment in New Zealand shares and investment via a QCIV, the definition of “assessable income” for QCIVs should be the same as under the current rules, except that realised gains on domestic shares will generally no longer be taxed. 4.2 The realised gains on most direct investments by individuals in shares are not taxed. The reason is the difficulty in demonstrating that the taxing provisions have been met for many individual direct investments in shares. These tests rely on factors such as the presence of a business, which can be hard to show for individuals, or a demonstration that the investor had a subjective dominant purpose of resale when the investment was purchased. 4.3 In contrast, the tests can be met more easily by a managed fund, because the fund will often, unambiguously, be in the business of trading in equities, and conservative trustees often err on the side of caution when deciding whether share gains should be returned for tax purposes. This difference in treatments creates clear disincentives, both anecdotally and practically, to use a managed fund to invest in shares. Changes to the capital/revenue boundary for domestic share gains derived via QCIVs 4.4 Most savings vehicles that would qualify as QCIVs pay tax on domestic share gains – largely because they are treated as a separate entity from their underlying investors and because of uncertainty over the application of the capital/revenue boundary. 4.5 One effect of this uncertainty is that trustees of QCIVs do not know during the life of the investment whether the investment is taxable on realisation. They must treat it as if it were taxable to ensure that investors present at the time of realisation are not treated less favourably (by having to pay the tax) than investors who have already departed. 4.6 In terms of the capital/revenue boundary, sections CA 1(2), CB 1, CB 2, CB 3 and 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (sections CD 3, 4 and 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994) apply in determining whether share gains are taxable on realisation. 25 4.7 Section CB 1 of the 2004 Act (section CD 3 of the 1994 Act) deems the gross income of any person to include any amount derived from any business. For savings vehicles, it is very likely that section CB 1 will apply as such a vehicle is in the business of making investments – that is, buying and selling shares in order to make share gains. This provision, combined with the conservative nature of fund trustees, means that it is very likely that it would apply to tax share profits derived through QCIVs. 4.8 One option considered was removing the application of the “business” test for QCIVs. However, this alone would not deal with the issue of domestic share gains derived via QCIVs being taxable, as sections CB 2, 3 and 4 of the 2004 Act (sections CD 4 and 5 of the 1994 Act) could also apply to tax them. 4.9 Section CB 3 (the second limb of section CD 4 of the 1994 Act) taxes any gains from the sale of personal property such as shares if the property was acquired for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it. This is what is known as the “purpose” test. 4.10 The “purpose” test is subjective, requiring consideration of the state of mind of the purchaser at the time of acquisition. If there is more than one purpose, then, typically, the test is whether the dominant purpose at the time of acquisition is one of sale or other disposition. There is a significant risk that even if domestic share gains derived via a QCIV are not taxable under the “business” test they would be taxed, in most instances, under the “purpose” test. Depending on the QCIV’s pattern of investment, conservative trustees of funds are likely to want to avoid situations where Inland Revenue could challenge (perhaps in later years) that an investment had not been purchased with a dominant purpose of resale. This risk may well result in trustees returning such profits for tax purposes. Consequently, an amendment is proposed to ensure that section CB 3 does not apply to tax realised gains on domestic equity derived via a QCIV. 4.11 Sections CB 2 and CB 4 (the first and third limbs of CD 4 of the 1994 Act) tax the profits from shares if the person’s business comprises dealing in shares, and when the profits of shares relate to the carrying on of an undertaking or scheme devised for the purpose of making a profit. Section CA 1(2) (CD 5 of the 1994 Act) taxes share gains if those gains are “income under ordinary concepts”. 4.12 For similar reasons to those described earlier, there is a risk that trustees of funds could return, for tax purposes, gains on domestic shares as a result of the application of these provisions. Therefore these provisions should not apply to domestic equity gains derived via a QCIV. 4.13 This does not mean that certain domestic equity gains derived via QCIVs would not be subject to tax. It is proposed to continue to tax certain equity gains derived via QCIVs, that are akin to debt. 26 Gains on equity investment that would still be taxable 4.14 While the government proposes to exempt gains from equity investment from taxation the current debt treatment for such funds would be maintained. That is because the QCIV model is designed to proxy the tax treatment of individuals. With debt, there is currently no difference in the tax treatment between individuals and managed funds, as all taxpayers are subject to the financial arrangement rules relating to debt instruments. 3 4.15 The capital gains exemption is also intended to apply only when the QCIV has full equity risk associated with the investment. The nature of equity risk is that the return is uncertain. While there may be a capital gain over time, there is also a real possibility of capital loss. 4.16 The government is concerned that in exempting capital gains for equity to proxy the tax outcomes for direct individual investors, this exemption becomes effectively extended to debt substitutes or to situations where the equity risk is removed through the use of derivatives. 4.17 One option is to broaden the dividend rules to include situations where a taxable return such as a dividend is converted into a non-taxable return – a capital gain. Examples include situations where dividends are deferred until redemption or a share is sold before a dividend is paid. 4.18 To ensure that any rules in this area are as clear and certain as possible, fixed rate shares, and shares that provide no dividend and are redeemable for a set price – provided that the price is equal to or greater than the cost to the QCIV of acquiring the share – would be treated as revenue account property by the QCIV. Strengthening the dividend rules to deal with debt substitutes held through QCIVs would not appear to give the necessary certainty to QCIVs or the government. However, submissions on this point are welcomed. 4.19 To ensure that capital gains are exempted only to the extent the QCIV was subject to the underlying equity risk, all costs relating to derivatives that would reduce equity risk generally would not be deductible. This ensures that only the portion of the return that reflects the equity risk is not subject to tax and reflects the tax treatment of an individual who holds shares on revenue account buying an equity option. 3 It is accepted, however, that there is a timing difference and individuals may be cash-basis holders and so not return any discounts or deduct any premiums until the instrument matures or is sold. 27 Other assessable income and treatment of tax credits and deductibility of expenses 4.20 The new definition of “assessable income” for QCIVs would continue to include dividends, interest, and other returns, which are currently taxable. The only changes will be to the taxation of domestic share gains and the definition of “assessable income” in relation to portfolio investment in offshore shares by QCIVs. The latter is discussed in more detail in the next chapter. Tax credits such as imputation credits attached to dividends and resident withholding tax deducted on interest would continue to be available for use. The use of these credits is discussed further in the following section, on the proposed flow-through tax treatment for QCIVs. 4.21 Fees incurred by investors in investing via a QCIV will be able to be deducted against assessable income derived via a QCIV. Fees incurred that relate to the purchase of domestic shares will be deductible in the same way as if they had been incurred directly by an individual passive investor. Inland Revenue’s Interpretation Statement IS0044 – Financial planning fees: income tax deductibility is helpful in providing guidance on the circumstances when such fees are deductible. The statement categorises financial planning fees and indicates that administration, monitoring, evaluation, re-planning and switching fees will be deductible for tax purposes. Key question: would direct active investment in New Zealand shares be tax-disadvantaged relative to investment via a QCIV under the proposed changes? One of the questions that arises from not taxing domestic share gains made via a QCIV is whether it would create a tax disadvantage for direct investment in New Zealand. That is because the “business” and “purpose” tests would continue to apply to individual investors on their direct holdings. Taxpayers who are share traders, for example, would continue to be taxed on realised share gains, whereas if the investments were via a QCIV, the activities of the QCIV would not render taxable the domestic share gains. Individual investors would still be subject to tax on any share gains from trading as this is the correct tax base for these taxpayers. Not taxing these gains would create an incentive for taxpayers to substitute other employment activities (when income in the form of salary and wages is taxed) to this type of activity (when what is effectively the income from labour would not be taxed). This would create tax integrity concerns, because a form of labour income – exerted in trading in capital assets – would not be in the tax base. It should be noted that under the new rules, if investors actively trade their interest in a QCIV, any gains from this activity will be subject to the capital/revenue boundary, as it exists currently. In other words, if an investor owns an interest in a QCIV and actively trades this interest, so that the “purpose” (or “business”) test is met, any gains will continue to be taxable. In this context, the interest in the QCIV will be treated as any other share investment held directly by the individual investor. The question of the appropriate tax base when a taxpayer invests through a QCIV is different. While the QCIV may actively trade shares on behalf of the taxpayer, under the proposed definition of a QCIV, the taxpayer will effectively give up control over the management of the investment. One of the key principles for qualifying as a QCIV is that the investor has a non-controlled or portfolio investment in the QCIV and the QCIV is itself a portfolio investor. When an investor has given up investment decision-making control, one concern about the substitutability of taxable labour activity with non- taxable activity no longer applies – the substitutability between QCIV income and labour income. 28 As the investor should not be able to influence the investment strategy of the QCIV, the question is then whether the gains made by the QCIV on the investor’s behalf should be taxable as a proxy for the investor. It can be argued that they should not, because the investor pays a fee to the QCIV to undertake investments on his or her behalf. When a QCIV appropriates a higher fee for generating higher return – for example, with certain foreign hedge funds, taxing the fee would be the appropriate tax policy response rather than separately taxing the gain. This should capture the extra value added by the QCIV. In theory, the fee should proxy the implicit salary or wage income an individual share trader would receive from undertaking this activity. In summary, the key difference between an individual making active direct investments or making them through a QCIV is that in the latter case the individual cedes control over investment decisions to the QCIV. Investing through a QCIV will also result in a fee being paid by the investor, which is taxable to the QCIV. In theory, this should reflect the value added by the QCIV. Key question: what would occur in relation to passive funds? “Passive” is the term given to investment funds with a ruling from Inland Revenue that they are not in the “business” of actively trading investments. These funds typically track the movements of foreign indices, such as the Morgan Stanley Capital Index, with buy-sell decisions contingent on these movements and changes to the composition of the index. The effect of the Inland Revenue ruling is to deem these investments to be held on capital account, and they are marketed as such. Anecdotally, it has been suggested that most passive funds track offshore indices, although there is evidence that some track New Zealand indices. Under the proposed changes, savings vehicles that qualify as QCIVs and actively undertake domestic share investments would not be disadvantaged relative to passive funds that track domestic indices. The rulings that currently give passive funds a more favourable tax treatment are a tax distortion and influence investment behaviour in a particular way. The removal of this distortion for domestic investment should ensure that investment decisions are undertaken for commercial rather than tax reasons and are based on the returns and fees of the QCIV concerned. Proposal 2: Flowing through assessable income to investors with tax deducted at marginal tax rates 4.22 While the definition of income is important, of equal importance is how this income will be taxed. As noted earlier, there is a significant non-alignment between personal and entity tax rates, depending on the savings vehicle being invested into. Changes are proposed to better align the tax treatment of investment via a QCIV with that of a direct investor. 4.23 It is proposed that QCIVs electing into the new rules must allocate to investors any assessable income derived in a year that relates to each investor’s share of the underlying assets. The allocated income would be deemed to be derived by the investors, and QCIVs will withhold tax at investors’ marginal tax rates. The tax would be deducted by the QCIV and remitted to Inland Revenue each year. The obligations on QCIVs would be similar to the current resident withholding tax requirements for banks and other large interest payers. 29 4.24 A key change for QCIVs is that they would act as a tax calculation and withholding tax agent on behalf of their investors. This has been broadly termed as the flow-through tax treatment for QCIVs. Why is the government allowing QCIVs to flow through income? 4.25 Alignment of tax rates is important to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid by an investor. Under current rules, alignment is limited to those entities that are subject to the company tax rules, such as unit trusts, or the qualifying trust rules, which include, for example, certain group investment funds. Even in these instances alignment can be partial. 4.26 One of the key distortions is the myriad of tax results that can arise depending on the entity structure of the QCIV, even though the product on offer may be identical. This can result in investor behaviour being driven by tax considerations. This occurs because there would be an incentive for taxpayers on a marginal tax rate of 39% to invest in superannuation schemes (with the final tax being 33%). Conversely, taxpayers on marginal rates of less than 33% might be discouraged from investing in these vehicles. 4.27 The proposed flow-through method is designed to remove many of the tax distinctions between the entities. Some distinctions will still remain, however, as there are certain QCIVs for whom flow-through is not possible for practical reasons. The tax rules will need to make allowances for these products and providers. These entities are likely to be a minority. The flow- through tax rules are designed to ensure that, as far as possible, tax rates do not disadvantage investors from investing via a QCIV rather than on their own account or in different QCIVs. 4.28 One of the key issues noted in the Stobo report on applying flow-through tax treatment for QCIVs was the potential cost to New Zealand QCIVs of updating their systems. One of the options considered by the report, was retaining the current entity tax rules for QCIVs but with a mechanism for aligning the QCIV tax rate with investors’ marginal tax rates using a tax credit system. This option was later discarded because it would result in significant complexity for QCIVs. 4.29 The New Zealand savings industry is broadly supportive of the flow-through option. It also generally recognises that whatever changes are made will involve some cost to the industry resulting from the transition to a system that acts as a proxy for direct investors. Background 4.30 The concept of mechanisms to align entity and investor tax rates is not new. In the context of managed funds, it was considered by the Taxation of Life Insurance and Superannuation (TOLIS) Review in the late 1990s. TOLIS recommended a tax-credit system for managed funds, a proposal that was not implemented because of technology and cost concerns at the time. 30 4.31 The current tax rules also contain various alignment mechanisms, most notably imputation rules applying to companies which allow a wash-up at investors’ marginal tax rates on distributions from companies. Another is the tax treatment of qualifying trusts, where distributions of income within six months of the end of the tax year in which the income is derived are taxed at the marginal tax rates of beneficiaries. 4.32 As part of his consultation process, Craig Stobo considered a tax treatment for QCIVs that would remove the entity tax model and would push income derived via a QCIV into the hands of the ultimate beneficiaries – investors, to be taxed at their marginal tax rates. This flow-through approach was considered to have several benefits. They included a closer tax rate alignment than would happen under a tax-credit system and reduced risks for QCIVs because they would no longer be a taxpayer in respect of income derived on behalf of their investors. It was also considered that the issues that affected TOLIS were not as significant in the current environment because of advances in technology. 4.33 A flow-through model would generally apply to investment vehicles that elect to be QCIVs. There will be certain exceptions, which are discussed later. 4.34 It is recognised that not all QCIVs will be in a position to flow through income to their investors on 1 April 2007. Those entities will still be able to use the existing entity tax treatment until they are in a position to make the transition to the new rules. It should be noted, however, that the new definition of “assessable income” for a QCIV would (with the exception of defined benefit superannuation schemes) be tied to its ability to administer the flow-through model. In other words, if the existing rules apply for tax being paid at the entity level, the current definition of “income” for a QCIV would also apply. How the flow-through model would work in practice 4.35 It is envisaged that the flow-through model would be feasible for a majority of vehicles that qualify as QCIVs. Vehicles such as widely held unit trusts (for example, qualifying unit trusts) and defined contribution superannuation schemes or other vehicles where the underlying investments can be allocated to investors in proportion to their contributions should be in a position to consider flow-through. The treatment for situations where it is not possible for investment income to be allocated to individual investors (for example, defined benefit superannuation schemes) is discussed later. 4.36 For the flow-through model to work, QCIVs would generally need to operate a system of accounts for each investor whereby the investor’s share of assessable income is recorded and updated regularly. The account would also record the investor’s share of any tax credits and tax deductible investment-management fees. Unit trusts will have unit registry systems for recording investor-specific information, although modifications are likely to be needed. For superannuation schemes that are defined contribution 31 schemes, it is also likely that some system of investor accounts will exist. Again, modifications to these systems may be needed. 4.37 How a flow-through model would operate in practice would depend on the commercial arrangements surrounding the relevant QCIV. For example, a QCIV may wish to allocate income to investors’ accounts on a regular basis or less frequently depending on how its systems operate. Allocations of income from which tax is deducted (attributions) may be less frequent. 4.38 An attribution would not require a physical distribution of income to investors, but rather just a record that the income is derived by a particular investor. Instead, investment income would typically be reinvested in the QCIV to generate further returns for investors. Under such an attribution event, there would be a requirement for tax to be withheld from assessable income and remitted to Inland Revenue. The post-tax return would be available to be re-invested by the QCIV, if that was desired by individual investors. The aim of this exercise is that the investors will continue to be largely unaffected by what occurs within an investment vehicle, subject to the election of correct withholding tax rates, which is discussed later in this document. 4.39 The payment of tax by the QCIV on behalf of investors may require the cancellation of some of an investor’s interest in a QCIV – such as units in a unit trust. Such a cancellation may be contrary to the current trust deeds of funds. If this is the case, it may be necessary to introduce legislation that would validate certain cancellations that are inconsistent with trust deeds. The government invites submissions on whether such legislative enablement is necessary. 4.40 The key for the new tax rules is that there is at least one attribution of income each year to investors’ accounts (an allocation from which tax is deducted), as well as an attribution when an investor exits a fund. 4.41 An attribution on exit will include instances where only part of an investment in a QCIV is realised – for example, when a few units in a unit trust are redeemed. The attribution would be for the exiting investor’s share of the income derived by the QCIV up to the date of exit, and would include all forms of assessable income, including dividends, interest, income from offshore investments and any gains that may still be taxable. This may also necessitate the QCIV having to deduct the exiting investor’s share of the tax on any unrealised gains that, on realisation, would be taxable. 4.42 Example 1 outlines how the flow-through process would work in a situation where a QCIV does an annual attribution to all investors with separate attributions on exit. 32 Example 1: Flow-through on annual and exit attributions John and Emma invest in a widely held unit trust that is a QCIV. They contribute $10,000 each, with John electing a 19.5% tax rate and Emma a 39% tax rate. The QCIV has 98 other investors who have each contributed $10,000. The total funds under management is $1,000,000 and John and Emma’s interest in the QCIV is 1% each. They enter the QCIV on 1 April 2007. John leaves the QCIV on 1 October 2007 while Emma stays for the duration of the year. On John’s exit, a new investor enters the QCIV, so the existing investors’ ownership levels are unaffected. The general attribution date is 31 March 2008. During the year the investment gains derived via the QCIV comprise dividends of $50,000 (no imputation credits) paid on 1 June 2007, interest of $40,000 (no resident withholding tax deducted) paid on 1 November 2007 and a gain on the sale of New Zealand shares of $10,000 on 1 January 2008. If the QCIV were to attribute income annually to all investors with separate attributions on exit, John’s share of the income would be 1% of $50,000 = $500. On his exit, he would pay tax on $500 at 19.5% = $97.50, which would be deducted by the QCIV on his behalf. Emma’s share of the income would be 1% of $100,000 = $1,000, as she remains for the duration of the year. However, her assessable income would be only $900 (her share of the $50,000 dividend + $40,000 interest). She would pay tax on $900 at 39% = $351 at the yearly attribution date, which again would be deducted by the QCIV on her behalf. 4.43 From a tax administration viewpoint, an attribution on exit is required to prevent incorrect taxation (including over-taxation) and abuse of the rules. In other words, if a general attribution occurs only yearly, and there are no specific attributions when an investor cashes-out, there will be incentives for investors to leave the QCIV just before to the general attribution date to avoid paying tax altogether. Alternatively, QCIVs could be structured in such a way that the only investors on the attribution date are tax-exempt entities such as charities or other low-tax rate investors. While it is unlikely that such abuse would occur in practice, the exit of investors before attribution date would, without an attribution on exit, result in investor-equity concerns. 4.44 While an attribution on exit would assist in minimising opportunities for avoidance and would ensure a level of investor equity, alternatively, if there were regular enough attributions during the year to all investors, this too would address the concerns raised. If a QCIV were unable to attribute income to investors on exit (or partial exit) from the QCIV, quarterly attributions of income to all investors would be required. Under this approach, income allocated to investors’ accounts in a quarter would be cleared out on the attribution date for that quarter. 4.45 This option would be less precise than having an attribution on exit, particularly as it could result in taxpayers other than those who have derived the assessable income having to pay the tax (for example, if an investor leaves between attribution dates). Example 2 outlines how the flow-through model would work when a QCIV makes quarterly attributions to all investors, although there are several ways that funds could do this in practice. 33 Example 2: Flow-through on quarterly attributions Gary and Jane invest in a widely held unit trust that is a QCIV. They contribute $20,000 each, with Gary electing a 19.5% tax rate and Jane a 39% tax rate. The QCIV has 98 other investors who have contributed $20,000 each. The total funds under management are $2,000,000, and Gary and Jane’s interest in the QCIV is 1% each. They enter the QCIV on 1 April 2007. Gary sells his entire interest in the QCIV on 5 September 2007, while Jane stays for the duration of the year. On Gary’s exit, a new investor enters the QCIV, so the existing investors’ ownership levels are unaffected. The quarterly attribution dates are 30 June, 30 September, 31 December and 31 March. During the year the investment gains derived via the QCIV are dividends of $25,000 (no imputation credits) paid on 1 June 2007, interest of $60,000 (no resident withholding tax deducted) paid on 1 September 2007, further dividends of $35,000 (no credits) paid on 1 February 2008 and a gain on the sale of New Zealand shares of $25,000 on 1 March 2008. If the QCIV were to attribute income quarterly to all investors, the attributions at the end of each quarter would be: Period Gary Jane 1 April – 30 June 1% x $25,000 = $250 1% x $25,000 = $250 1 July – 30 Sept - 1% x $60,000 = $600 1 Oct – 31 Dec - 1% x $35,000 = $350 1 Jan – 31 March - 1% x $25,000 = $250 As Gary is only present on the first attribution date, his assessable income would be only $250. Tax on this ($250 at 19.5% = $48.75) would be deducted on the first attribution date (30 June). However, Gary would still receive his share of the $60,000 of interest when he exits the QCIV (by way of a higher unit price) even though he will not end up paying any tax on it. That is because Gary would not be present on the next attribution date of 30 September. Consequently, if no adjustment is made to the price Gary receives on exit from the QCIV, to reflect the share of the tax owing on the income derived in the period, investors who will be present on the next attribution date will be required to make up the shortfall. Should Gary continue to enter and exit the fund, however, his interest in the fund may be on revenue account. For Jane, who remains in the fund for the duration of the year, tax of $97.50 ($250 at 39%) would be deducted at the first attribution date; tax of $234 ($600 at 39%) at the second date; tax of $136.50 ($350 at 39%) at the third date; and no tax would be deducted on the last attribution date because the income is a tax free gain. 4.46 QCIVs that chose to do quarterly (or more regular) attributions would need to manage investor equity concerns. In principle, quarterly attributions to all investors would seem to reduce incentives for taxpayers to exit an investment in a QCIV just before to a general attribution date and enter after the attribution. 4.47 The government therefore considers that QCIVs should have the choice of making: • a single attribution to all investors at the end of an income year, together with attributions when investors sell their interest, or part of their interest, in a QCIV; or • an attribution to all investors each quarter – for example, at the end of June, September, December and March. 34 Who can invest in a QCIV? 4.48 The government considers that the opportunity to invest in a QCIV should not be limited to individuals. Therefore entities such as companies and other types of taxpayers such as partnerships and trusts should be allowed to invest in a QCIV. If a company invests in a QCIV and the QCIV derives tax-free capital gains on the company’s behalf, these gains would, like other capital gains, be available to the company to be distributed tax-free on liquidation, as under the current rules. Payment of tax withheld by QCIVs to Inland Revenue 4.49 Depending on the frequency of attributions – whether a yearly attribution to all investors in the QCIV and attributions on exit, or quarterly attributions to all investors – the profile of tax payments to Inland Revenue will change. 4.50 When a QCIV chooses to do an annual general attribution and attributions on investor redemption, the tax deducted would need to be remitted to Inland Revenue by the 20th of the following month. Therefore if the annual attribution is on 31 March, the tax would need to be paid to Inland Revenue by 20 April. Similarly, for attributions when interests in a QCIV are redeemed, the tax would need to be remitted by the 20th of the month following the month in which the interest or part of the interest was cashed- out. For quarterly or more regular attributions, similar rules would apply. 4.51 At the end of the year the QCIV would, for reconciliation purposes, need to provide Inland Revenue electronically with a statement outlining each investor who was present in the fund during the year, the investor’s share of investment income, tax deducted, tax deductible expenses and tax credits. This would be similar to the reconciliation requirements for interest payers and, as will be discussed later, is necessary for the matching of investor information. 4.52 The proposed process for remitting the tax withheld will have use-of-money implications for both the government and QCIVs. Currently, QCIVs are provisional taxpayers, meaning that they pay tax in three instalments during the year. Under an attribution on exit approach, there is likely to be a single tax payment at the end of the year, with smaller tax payments through the year when some investors exit. Under such an approach, the government would be adversely affected, as it would receive tax revenue later than it otherwise would. Under a quarterly attribution approach, the frequency of tax payments to Inland Revenue would increase, which would mean that QCIVs would be negatively affected as they would be required to remit tax revenue earlier than they otherwise would. 4.53 The options put forward are not driven by use-of-money concerns associated with tax payments. The aim of the flow-through model is to ensure that, broadly, the correct amount of tax is paid, by the correct investor. The level of precision will depend on the approach adopted by QCIVs for various reasons, such as investor equity. 35 Anti-avoidance rules 4.54 It will be necessary to develop certain rules that guard against tax-driven behaviour. One such rule is a “wash-sale” provision, which would effectively deem a sale and subsequent re-purchase of an interest in a QCIV to give rise to a taxable event (the sale) if the two parts of this transaction are carried out within, say, 30 days of each other. This is on the basis that such an arrangement is likely to have little commercial rationale. It is more likely to be tax-driven with the purpose of minimising tax payable. An instance where such a rule would be useful is if an investor in a QCIV who holds that interest on capital account were able to sell the interest to a revenue account investor just before the attribution of income by the QCIV (for example, payment of a dividend to the QCIV by a New Zealand company) and re- acquire it after the attribution is made. 4.55 In this scenario, the sale price would be the pre-attribution price. The revenue account investor would have tax deducted on attributed income, with the value of the investment falling to reflect the attribution. The revenue account investor would then sell the interest back to the capital account investor at the post-attribution price. The revenue account investor would receive a deductible loss on the transaction (to offset the tax payable on the attribution by the QCIV), while the capital account investor would receive a real gain (on the difference between what the investor sold the interest for and the price at which it was reacquired). In this scenario, the arrangement is structured in such a way that no tax is payable on the dividend. 4.56 Such an arrangement could also work if the QCIV sells an interest in a New Zealand company, before the company pays a dividend, to a revenue account taxpayer and re-purchases the interest after the dividend is paid. The QCIV would not be taxable on the sale because of the domestic capital gains carve- out. 4.57 A “wash-sale” rule would cover both scenarios by taxing any gains made by the capital account investor on the sale of the interest in the QCIV and taxing the QCIV on the sale of the interest in the New Zealand company. When the flow-through model may not be feasible 4.58 There will be some funds that cannot allocate all of their income to their investors because the underlying value of their assets cannot be linked to contributions by or for specific individuals. 4.59 In defined benefit superannuation schemes, the benefits that are ultimately payable cannot readily be linked to what investors have contributed. That makes it difficult to determine, at any given point in time, what each investor’s share of the underlying assets is. Also, defined benefit schemes have certain triggering events for payment of benefits, such as payment after a certain age or event. When a contributor exits a scheme, there may be a forfeiture of contributions or repayment of these contributions, but at a significant discount (calculated actuarially). 36 4.60 Furthermore, defined benefit superannuation schemes typically require a top- up to investor contributions to make up any shortfalls between contributions and eventual payouts. This makes it difficult to allocate fund assets to investors if contributions are being “topped up” by the scheme or employers in the case of employer-based defined benefit superannuation schemes. Defined benefit schemes represent a significant, though declining, part of the superannuation and savings landscape. 4.61 Schemes that offer a capital guarantee may also be unable to allocate all income to investors. It may be prudent to leave some income unallocated so that, if the scheme generates poor returns in the future, the unallocated income can then be used to provide the promised minimum rate of return. 4.62 Another instance when income cannot be fully allocated arises with “unvested” amounts. Unvested amounts can arise in the context of both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes when an employer, for example, matches or “tops up” contributions made by an investor. A key feature of the employer contributions is that unless certain criteria are met, such as length of service, the amounts do not vest with the employee. Unvested amounts typically flow back into the schemes and are redistributed among remaining policyholders, or can revert back to the employer. As vesting periods can, in certain cases be significant, in instances where there are unvested amounts it can be difficult to tax income relating to these amounts at the marginal tax rates of investors to whom these amounts may or may not eventually belong. 4.63 A fund that cannot completely allocate income to individuals would be unable to fully apply flow-through tax treatment. As such, unless a special provision were designed, such funds would be denied access to the proposed tax treatment of domestic capital gains. This would motivate a significant shift in investment away from such funds, which would represent a tax-generated distortion of investment behaviour. Consequently, special rules are required to deal with these types of funds. 4.64 Schemes with “unallocated” amounts should still have the option of electing into the new rules and receiving the benefit of the exemption on domestic share gains. There are three options to achieve this. The final approach taken by the government will take consideration of views expressed in submissions. 4.65 The first option is to continue to tax unallocated amounts at 33%. This approach would create incentives for funds managed on behalf of 39% rate taxpayers not to allocate income. 4.66 The second option would also tax unallocated income at 33%. It would involve a fund with unallocated income being allowed to access the proposed tax treatment for domestic capital gains only if it is a registered superannuation scheme operating as a defined benefit scheme as of 27 June 2005. This mechanism would discourage the establishment of new registered superannuation schemes with unallocated amounts. This 37 limitation could be revisited if required. There may also be difficulties in appropriately defining “defined benefit” schemes. 4.67 Both options would allow schemes with unallocated amounts to obtain the same tax treatment of capital gains as other funds, but they limit the ability of such funds to access a valuable aspect of the reform, the ability to attribute the correct tax rate to their members. However, the requirement to apply marginal tax rates would apply only to the extent they are practically able to attribute income. 4.68 The third option would allow schemes to attribute income earned by the fund, when possible, to participating savers so that earnings so attributed could be taxed at their correct marginal rate. This would be allowed to the extent possible, with remaining earnings that could not be allocated taxed at 33%. The attribution could be based on current filing requirements to the Government Actuary, who reviews the filings of each registered superannuation scheme every three years. The reporting requirements would attempt to limit changes required from current reporting when possible. Funds could be allowed to attribute, or required to make a best effort to attribute at correct marginal rates when possible. Individuals would elect their marginal rates in the same manner as with other schemes. 4.69 To the extent that marginal tax rates can be applied, the income would be taxed at the fund level and not to the individual investors. This is because in the case of, say, unvested amounts, the employer contribution to which the income relates does not belong to the investor, so, technically, neither does the income until the amount is vested. Consequently, it would be inequitable for the income to be deemed to have been derived by investors, as this could trigger other obligations. 4.70 This approach would limit unallocated amounts within a scheme to an acceptable reserve level. It would also seek to ensure that attribution to lower rate taxpayers was made on an actuarially appropriate basis. It would provide a practical limit on vesting, capital protection reserves and general reserves of such schemes. 4.71 Excess amounts allocated to taxpayers on rates below 39% or excess reserves could be taxed at 39% at the discretion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This approach would place additional requirements on the Government Actuary, and on Inland Revenue. Further, it could increase compliance costs for funds. It would provide funds with members having marginal tax rates of less than 33% a valuable advantage however. The government would welcome submissions indicating whether an approach such as the third option is considered valuable enough to justify incurring these costs. 38 Flowing through income, tax credits and losses 4.72 All assessable income will need to be flowed through to investors. Equally, any tax credits such as imputation credits and resident withholding tax on New Zealand interest and any foreign tax credits such as foreign non-resident withholding tax on dividends will need to be flowed through in proportion to each person’s investment in the QCIV. These tax credits can be used to offset the tax that is deducted by the QCIV on behalf of individual investors. Similarly, tax deductible investment expenses can be offset against assessable income derived via the QCIV. Tax losses, for example, from any realised revenue account assets will also be available for use. 4.73 The ability of QCIVs to flow through foreign tax credits for non-resident withholding tax provides greater consistency with the treatment for direct non-controlled investment in offshore shares. Currently an investor in a managed fund such as a unit trust would not gain the benefit of the foreign tax credit if the fund pays a dividend because the foreign tax credit would have been used to offset assessable income at the fund level. 4.74 The availability of credits, expenses and losses raises the issue of the correct treatment of excess amounts, whether excess credits or losses. This would arise when the deductions or credits available exceed the assessable income in the QCIV. It could arise, for example, when a QCIV derives only fully imputed dividend income and has tax deductible expenses or investors on the lower marginal tax rates. Should these amounts be refundable, available to be claimed as a loss in the current year against non-QCIV income, or carried forward within the QCIV? 4.75 As a general rule, under imputation, excess imputation credits are not refunded, although excess resident withholding tax is. Theoretically, under a flow-through model, the different credits and income to which those credits relate should retain their character. This means that excess imputation credits available should be carried forward, while resident withholding tax credits should be refundable. This would provide better consistency with the tax treatment of an individual direct investor. The ability of investors in QCIVs to get value for these credits is discussed below. 4.76 It should be noted that as QCIVs are not flow-through entities at present – it is the QCIV and not the investors who explicitly receive tax credits. A similar situation arises relating to tax losses and deductible expenses. Consequently, excess tax losses or credits are generally quarantined at the fund level, with excess credits carried forward and offset against future fund income. 4.77 One method that would give investors value for excess tax losses and credits would be for QCIVs to flow them through to individual investors each year, as part of the general annual attribution to all investors. However, to gain the benefit of such excess losses or credits, investors would need to file a tax return. This would result in a large number of investors who have no other reason to file a tax return having to do so or risk losing the credits. The 39 compliance cost of requiring investors to file a return to get value for their credits would, however, be onerous, especially if the value of any excess losses or credits is small and the return triggers other obligations. The broader implications for investors are discussed in more detail later. 4.78 A better mechanism for providing investors with value for excess tax credits, tax losses and expenses that cannot be used is for QCIVs to carry forward these amounts to be offset against the future assessable income of the investor, to be derived via the QCIV. This would preclude the need for investors having to file a return automatically each year to claim any excess amounts. It is likely that technology solutions are available to achieve this, which is the approach favoured by the government. 4.79 When investors redeem their interest (or part of their interest) in a QCIV during a year, they should have the option of filing a return to get the benefit of excess tax credits or losses in proportion to the amount realised. Claiming excess tax losses and credits in this way could result, however, in other obligations arising. These are discussed in greater detail later. 4.80 Alternatively, QCIVs could offset any tax losses and tax credits against assessable income before allocating income to investors’ individual accounts. Under this arrangement, net income would be allocated to investors rather than gross income and tax losses and credits. Any excess tax losses or tax credits would be carried forward in the value of the QCIV. That approach is similar to what happens in managed funds today – where a fund has excess tax losses, they may be provided for in the fund’s price by way of a higher unit price. While not as accurate as carrying forward the excess in individual accounts, it may result in less complexity for certain QCIVs. Therefore the government also considers that it would be an acceptable approach for dealing with excess losses and credits and envisions that the new rules would include both options. 4.81 One of the key issues is the ability of QCIVs to determine accurately what percentage of their tax losses are likely to be useable going forward, and therefore able to be included in the fund’s price on the balance sheet. This issue would remain if tax losses were able to be offset on a gross income basis, with any excess losses carried forward in a fund’s unit price. However, it would allow QCIVs to give value to investors for excess tax losses and credits via a higher price which is redeemable on exit from the QCIV. Implications for investors in QCIVs 4.82 The tax rate applied by QCIVs when assessable income is attributed to investors will be the tax rate elected by the investor. Taxpayers will be able to elect a rate based on their marginal tax rate of 19.5%, 33% or 39%. Investors would need to provide this tax rate at the start of the year or when they enter a QCIV for the first time. If an investor fails to elect a rate, the QCIV will be required to deduct tax at the highest marginal tax rate of 39%. 40 4.83 Under the proposed flow-through model for QCIVs, any income derived via a QCIV will be treated in the same way as an investor’s, if income from direct investments forms part of a direct holder’s assessable income in a year. Currently, if an investor is a direct holder, any income including dividends and taxable equity gains must be returned each year, by filing a tax return, if the amount of assessable income is greater than $200. The time requirement applies at present to investments in managed funds such as unit trusts if the fund pays a dividend greater than $200 or if any gain on the sale of an interest in the fund is taxable. However, if any gains made by the fund are not distributed, or if an investor holding an investment on revenue account does not realise the interest in the QCIV, no taxable event is triggered for the investor. Consequently, a tax return is usually not required to be filed. 4.84 The flow-through model aims, as much as possible, to put investors who invest via a QCIV on a similar footing to individuals who invest directly. Absolute consistency between investors in a QCIV and direct investors would mean that to the extent individual direct investors are required to return income each year on their investments, the same rule should apply to investors in a QCIV. However, for investors in QCIVs this would impose compliance costs above the current level. 4.85 In particular, it should be noted that the proposed KiwiSaver scheme announced in this year’s Budget will result, over time, in a large number of taxpayers having investments in vehicles that may qualify as QCIVs. The requirement for these taxpayers to file tax returns each year, when they currently are not required to, would result in significant compliance costs. 4.86 More importantly, the requirement for investors in a QCIV to file a return would also affect a number of social policy initiatives that are delivered or collected through the tax system. They include: • payment of family assistance; • collection of child support payments (from liable parents); and • student loan repayments (from borrowers). 4.87 Currently, a taxpayer’s assessable income generally determines entitlements and payment obligations. Under the proposed flow-through model for QCIVs, investment income derived via a QCIV would be the income of the individual investor, which in the absence of any changes to the contrary, would affect that person’s entitlement to family assistance and payment obligations for child support and student loans. 4.88 Requiring taxpayers to declare investment income derived via a QCIV would affect entitlements under the Working for Families scheme. The package can result in access to assistance for families with fairly significant income levels, and there is a risk that those benefits might be clawed back in cases where a family saves via a QCIV. That would be inconsistent with both the aim of the Working for Families scheme and the broader intention to encourage more saving by New Zealanders. 41 4.89 Under the current rules, depending on the entity being invested into, investment income derived through that entity may not affect family assistance and other social policy initiatives. For example, for investments made via a registered superannuation scheme, a claw-back of family assistance would be a significant change to the existing tax treatment as the investment is taxed at the scheme level of 33% and does not affect family assistance, child support or student loans. An investment in a unit trust would claw-back family assistance only when the unit trust makes a taxable distribution such as a dividend over $200 or on the realisation of the investment for a revenue account taxpayer. 4.90 Given the current rules and the fact that for certain investments such as superannuation schemes investments may be locked in, it would not be appropriate to require claw-back of family assistance. Different problems arise in relation to the impact of investment income on any liability to pay child support, however. Investment income derived via a QCIV should not affect a liable parent’s child support obligations if it reduces the level of child support received by the custodial parent. 4.91 That can occur at present if a liable parent invests through a registered superannuation scheme. Importantly, there are administrative mechanisms for dealing with this “excluded” income for child support purposes. Even if investment income derived via a QCIV is excluded from a taxpayer’s gross income figure for the year, custodial parents can still apply for an administrative review for consideration of whether the excluded amount should be included in the calculation of a liable parent’s capacity to pay child support. Consequently, it is proposed that income flowed through to investors in a QCIV would not give rise to re-assessments of child support obligations. 4.92 To prevent income derived by an investor via a QCIV requiring a tax return to be filed, and affecting family assistance entitlements, child support and student loan repayment obligations of investors, tax on investment income derived via a QCIV and deducted and paid by the QCIV on an investor’s behalf would be a final withholding tax for most investors. 4.93 Here a distinction is being drawn between individuals and non-individuals (such as companies) who are investors in QCIVs. The tax deducted by the QCIV would be a final withholding tax for individuals, unless certain criteria were breached. It would not be a final withholding tax for non-individual investors. That is because a key reason for deeming tax withheld by a QCIV to be a final withholding tax is to prevent investors having to file returns when they otherwise would not have to. Non-individual investors such as companies are already required to file returns, so there is no need for the tax withheld by a QCIV to be a final tax. This distinction is discussed in more detail later. 42 Individuals investing in QCIVs 4.94 For individuals, a final withholding tax would operate based on the rate that is elected by the investor at the start of the year or when an investor enters a QCIV for the first time. Individual investors would elect the relevant marginal tax rate based on their previous year’s income. Such a model would work as follows: • If total assessable income from all sources in the previous year is below $48,000, an investor must elect a rate not lower than 19.5%. • If total assessable income from all sources in the previous year is between $48,000 and $70,000, the investor must elect a rate not lower than 33%. • If total assessable income from all sources in the previous year is greater than $70,000, the investor must elect a rate of 39%. 4.95 Under these rules, taxpayers would not be required to file a return in respect of QCIV income, or include this income in the return if they are required to file for other reasons. The thresholds above are greater than the thresholds for income tax to reflect the fact that investment income derived via a QCIV may result in a higher tax rate applying at the margin. 4.96 For example, if a taxpayer derived $35,000 of wage and salary income in the previous income year and $5,000 of QCIV income, the marginal tax rate on the next dollar of income would be 33%. However, strictly speaking, only $2,000 of the QCIV income should be taxed at 33%, with $3,000 taxed at 21%. In the following year, assuming that salary and wage income is not subject to significant inflation, electing a 33% tax rate on QCIV income would result in over-taxation. While it would be possible to require some apportionment based on different tax rates, such a mechanism would be difficult to apply in practice for individuals and QCIVs. Consequently, the government proposes to build in a $10,000 buffer into the income thresholds to ensure that investment income derived through a QCIV is not over-taxed. While this could result in certain income derived via a QCIV being under- taxed – for example, when salary and wage income is $38,000 and QCIV income is $5,000, the marginal rate on the QCIV income should be 33% – the proposed approach should result in the right outcome for most individual investors without imposing undue compliance costs. 4.97 The approach outlined here would impose a statutory requirement on taxpayers to elect a tax rate based on the previous year’s income. To ensure compliance with these rules, Inland Revenue would undertake selected matching of the tax rates elected. If a taxpayer did not elect the correct rate based on the previous year’s income, together with the thresholds discussed earlier, Inland Revenue would collect any shortfall plus use-of-money interest and penalties. 43 4.98 Taxpayers who have elected too high a tax rate on their QCIV income for the current year would be able to file a return to receive a refund. However, that would require including income derived via a QCIV in an investor’s tax return, which would trigger the claw-back of any family assistance and child support and student loan obligations. 4.99 An additional rule would require individuals who have significant QCIV income of over $15,000 a year to file a tax return if the tax rate they have elected (based on the previous year’s total assessable income from all sources) is incorrect for the current year. That is necessary because when an individual derives a significant level of QCIV income that results in a higher marginal tax rate for the current year than the previous year, an election based on the previous year’s income is clearly not the correct result. In such cases, taxpayers would be required to reconcile their tax rate on the QCIV income at the end of the year by filing a tax return. While this would result in QCIV income counting towards family assistance, child support and student loans, taxpayers would have the option of electing a higher rate at the start of a year. The thresholds discussed earlier specify a minimum tax rate that must be applied. Electing a higher rate would remove them from the application of the reconciliation rule. 4.100 A number of questions arise in relation to using the previous year’s total assessable income from all sources as the method for electing the tax rate on QCIV income in the current year. 4.101 First, there is a timing question relating to when investors know their total income for the previous year. For those earning salary and wages, the necessary information should be available before 1 April. If they also have investment income such as interest or QCIV income in the previous year, notification of total income earned will take longer. This would make it difficult for investors to elect a tax rate and provide it to a QCIV at the start of an income year. In turn, not having a valid tax rate could affect a QCIV’s ability to make attributions to its investors. 4.102 For QCIVs that choose to make a general attribution at the end of the year, with smaller attributions on investor redemption, not having a tax rate election at the start of the year should not generally be a problem. For QCIVs that choose quarterly or more frequent attributions, the first attribution may be affected. When a valid tax rate is not received by the QCIV before an attribution date, the QCIV should use the tax rate elected by the investor for the previous year. Or, if the investor is new to the QCIV, the 39% rate should be used, with a square-up on future attribution dates. 4.103 A second question concerns the information that must be provided to investors in relation to their QCIV income. Under the proposed final withholding tax approach, QCIVs would need to provide investors with notification of the level of QCIV income and tax deducted (after credits and losses) for an income year so that investors can elect the correct tax rate for the next income year. As the income year for individual investors is 1 April to 31 March, this information would need to be provided promptly after the 44 end of an income year. This means that QCIVs with non-standard balance dates would need to move to a standard income year for their withholding tax obligations. That would allow QCIVs to provide income and tax withholding details to investors for a standard income year. Under a flow- through model for QCIVs, balance dates should not be a significant issue, although submissions are welcomed on the issue. 4.104 Another question that arises concerns the income measure in the previous year that should apply to individual investors that have business income such as self-employed taxpayers or other non-wage and salary taxpayers. They may not have the requisite income information if, for example, the return for a previous year has not yet been filed. In this case, it may be possible to require taxpayers to base their rate elections for the current year on total assessable income from all sources from two years ago (for which the information should be available). Submissions are invited on this issue. Non-individual investors investing in a QCIV 4.105 The statutory rule for non-individual investors in QCIVs would generally be the withholding rate. (Investors holding an RWT exemption certificate would qualify for withholding at the appropriate rate.) This would be irrespective of the income of the investor in the previous year. Non- individual investors would also be required to return QCIV income in their tax return at the end of a year, which would allow any losses or excess tax credits allocated to the company by the QCIV to be claimed. It would also reconcile investors’ tax position in respect of QCIV income with their other business income. 4.106 Tax-exempt entities with a resident withholding tax exemption certificate would be able to elect a 0% withholding tax rate. Summary of a QCIV’s withholding obligations Step 1: Investor provides withholding rate to QCIV. If no rate is provided, a default rate of 39% will be used. Step 2: The QCIV calculates assessable investment income for the investor. If this is negative, the result is an investor net loss, which is carried forward by the QCIV. Step 3: The QCIV deducts expenses from assessable investment income for the investor. This results in investment income after expenses. Step 4: Investment income after expenses is reduced by the: (a) investor’s share of the QCIV’s transitional net loss carry forward, if any. This loss could have arisen only before the new tax rules for QCIVs applied and on the deemed wind-up on transition; (b) investor’s net loss carried forward from prior years, if any. The result is net investment income. If the investor has a net loss and is redeeming some or all of the interest in the QCIV, the investor net loss (or a portion thereof if only a partial redemption is made) flows through to the investor and may be claimed on a tax return. 45 Step 5: Net investment income multiplied by the investor’s selected withholding tax rate is the investor’s gross tax liability. Step 6: The investor’s gross tax liability is reduced by the investor’s share of available foreign tax credits. The result is the investor’s adjusted tax liability. The investor’s share of available foreign tax credits is the lesser of: (a) the investor’s share of foreign taxes paid by the QCIV (generally NRWT withheld on interest and dividends paid to the QCIV); (b) the investor’s gross tax liability; or (c) the investor’s share of net foreign-sourced income multiplied by their withholding tax rate. As under current law, excess foreign tax credits are not carried forward or refunded. Step 7: The investor’s adjusted tax liability is reduced by the investor’s allocated share of imputation credits, received or carried forward by the QCIV. This results in the investor’s net tax liability. To the extent that an investor’s share of imputation credits exceeds the adjusted tax liability, they are carried forward and may reduce tax deducted on behalf of the investor in future years. In the year an investor redeems the interest in a QCIV, any excess imputation credits (in proportion to the share of the interest that is redeemed) may be claimed if the investor elects to file a tax return. Step 8: The investor’s net tax liability is reduced by the allocated share of source RWT on interest and dividends paid to the QCIV. QCIVs should generally be able to get an RWT exemption certificate, so there should be minimal source RWT deducted. To the extent source RWT exceeds an investor’s net tax liability, the QCIV may have this refunded and paid out to (or included in the account of) the investor. To the extent an investor’s net tax liability exceeds source RWT, the QCIV must deduct and pay additional withholding tax to Inland Revenue in satisfaction of the investor’s net tax liability. Non-resident investors in a QCIV 4.107 If an investor in a QCIV is a non-resident, the QCIV would withhold tax on any income derived via the QCIV at the rate that would have applied if the investor had invested directly. For example, if the assessable income relates to a dividend received from a New Zealand company – and the investor is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement – a 15% withholding rate would apply. 4.108 To the extent that a QCIV derives fully imputed dividend income, no tax would need to be deducted on attribution to non-resident investors. Such income would effectively be exempt. This approximates the result that would have occurred under the foreign investor tax credit rules if the non- resident investor had received the dividend directly from the New Zealand company. 4.109 This approach maintains the flow-through treatment in relation to non- resident investors and requires QCIVs to track different types of income for their non-resident investors and withhold tax at the applicable rate. 46 4.110 The government welcomes submissions on whether any problems arise as a result of this approach. Flow-through when a QCIV invests in another QCIV 4.111 One of the key questions is how the flow-through model would operate in an environment where a QCIV invests in another QCIV that may then on-invest into another QCIV. 4.112 An example is a retail QCIV that invests in a wholesale QCIV, which is a common investment structure in the financial services industry. At present, the retail and wholesale QCIVs are treated as taxpayers in their own right. Under the flow-through model, the wholesale QCIV would effectively need to pass through income (in a notional sense) to the retail QCIV, which in turn would need to attribute the income to their investors. In practice, this will typically mean that on attribution date, the retail QCIV will need to know what income has been derived in the attribution period from the wholesale QCIV and withhold tax, at investors’ marginal tax rates, based on that amount. This may require the retail QCIV either to realise some of its assets in the wholesale QCIV or maintain a pool of cash to fund any liability. 4.113 To the extent the wholesale QCIV can provide the information to the retail QCIV, the wholesale QCIV will be exempt from deducting tax on behalf of the retail fund. This is not to say that the wholesale fund will be altogether exempt from the withholding obligations. For example, if the wholesale QCIV has another retail client that is not a QCIV – for example, an individual who has a large interest – it will still be required to withhold tax. This would be similar to the resident withholding tax exemption certificate rules when there are multiple tiers of investors. Key question: should the top withholding tax rate be capped at 33% under a flow-through model to encourage saving? It is possible that some high-income taxpayers may view as unfavourable the prospect of being taxed at 39% on investment income derived through a QCIV, given that they may currently be taxed at a lower rate on certain investments (for example, 33% for investment in a registered superannuation scheme). To these taxpayers a flow-through model could be seen as disadvantageous. Capping the withholding tax rate applying to income derived via a QCIV at 33% (regardless of the investor’s actual marginal tax rate) is a possible option to address this issue. Such an approach would, however, effectively constitute a tax incentive to invest through a QCIV, rather than as a direct investment. This is because a direct investor would be taxed at their correct marginal tax rate while investment in a QCIV would be taxed at a maximum rate of 33%. This would retain a key distortion which the flow-through proposal is designed to remove. Also, it is not clear that removal of the 6% differential would result in investors on the highest marginal tax rate being worse off. This is because the benefits of not having New Zealand share gains taxed, when investing via a QCIV should, in most cases, outweigh the benefit of the current tax rate differential for high income taxpayers. 47 Points for submission The government welcomes submissions on any points raised in the discussion document, with specific comment welcomed on the following: • Whether the suggested scope of the equity gains that would remain taxable under the new rules is appropriate. • Whether legislation is required to allow QCIVs to cancel units in certain situations to allow tax to be paid. • Whether the rules governing when a QCIV should make attributions to investors give QCIVs the appropriate choice of methods, and whether these methods would be workable. • Whether the options proposed for defined benefit schemes are workable. • Whether the proposed rules for carrying forward and offsetting tax losses and tax credits are appropriate. • Whether the non-alignment of withholding tax obligations and income years for QCIVs would cause significant compliance costs. • Whether the assessable income measure for establishing a withholding tax rate that should apply to self-employed individual taxpayers or other non-wage and salary taxpayers could be based on the assessable income from all sources from two years ago. • Whether the flow-through model which requires QCIVs to track different types of income and apply the correct withholding rate for their non-resident investors is a workable approach. 48 Chapter 5 NEW TAX RULES FOR OFFSHORE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN SHARES 5.1 The government proposes to update and modify the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules so that income attributable to investment in foreign portfolio equity is appropriately taxed. In doing so, it is important that the rules have regard to the level of tax levied on an equivalent New Zealand investment. Practical limitations and a lack of information prevent this from being done perfectly, however, so a proxy measure of the underlying income attributable to the interest must be used. 5.2 One objective of the reform is to align the taxation of investment in domestic assets and foreign assets. This is one of several competing objectives, however, and must be weighed against other objectives, such as ensuring that the underlying income from foreign investments in which New Zealanders invest is subject to New Zealand tax. 5.3 Taxpayers have raised concerns about the current FIF calculations and, in particular, that the income recognised could be highly volatile, especially when there are large fluctuations in the exchange rate. They may also have a tax liability without the cashflow (distribution of income) to satisfy the liability. A new FIF calculation method is therefore proposed, one that achieves the underlying objectives while dealing with volatility and cashflow concerns. 5.4 Other objectives of the reform include: • neutralising the differences in taxation of foreign portfolio equity held directly or through a QCIV; • ensuring there is no tax incentive to invest offshore instead of in New Zealand; and • ensuring there is no tax incentive or disincentive to invest in different countries. Practical constraints to offshore options 5.5 The proposals described in this chapter have been developed in light of a number of key constraints. Given that the majority of QCIVs will be taxed under a flow-through model, any calculation method for offshore income must allow QCIVs that use the flow-through model to attribute assessable income to their investors on a regular basis. The practical reality of flow- through, therefore, would rule out any option for taxing offshore income on a realisation basis. That is because it would be extremely difficult to allocate accurately, and track over time, each investor’s share of unrealised assessable 49 gains. Also, for individuals with reasonably sized portfolios, a realisation- based system is too open to abuse and quickly becomes complicated. 5.6 Given this constraint, just two options appear feasible for taxing QCIVs using the flow-through model on their offshore income. The first of these would be to exempt QCIVs on their offshore equity income. As is discussed later, this option is not favoured as it is inconsistent with New Zealand’s interests. The second option is to tax QCIVs on their offshore income on an accrued basis. The government proposes the latter approach. 5.7 It is also necessary to ensure that people who invest directly offshore are taxed in a manner that is broadly similar to the way they would be taxed if they invested via a QCIV. That is to ensure that the tax rules do not create incentives to invest offshore in one form over another. Therefore the rules proposed for individuals investing offshore are designed to be as similar as possible to the rules for QCIVs, taking into account their ability to manage investment risks. Background Foreign investment fund rules 5.8 Investment in offshore portfolio equity outside countries included in the grey list is generally subject to the FIF rules. That provides a number of income calculation options, but the method most commonly used is comparative value (CV). It generally treats as income the increase in market value of the interest, plus any dividends paid. If the market value of the interest cannot be determined, the taxpayer can use the deemed rate of return method, which calculates assessable income by multiplying the opening book value of the interest by a deemed rate of return. 5.9 Taxpayers who have access to sufficient information are also allowed to use the branch-equivalent method. It is a more exact calculation of a company’s assessable income using New Zealand tax rules. 5.10 Another calculation option that is less accurate than the branch-equivalent method, but potentially more accurate than the comparative value method, is the accounting profits method. It calculates the investor’s assessable income by taking the after-foreign tax accounting income of the foreign entity and apportioning it by the investor’s ownership interest. 5.11 Taxpayers have complained about some of the practical implications of the calculation methods. In particular, under the CV method, the assessable income may be highly volatile, especially when there are large fluctuations in the exchange rate. Also, because an increase in value of the interest may result in a tax liability, even when the interest has not paid much in dividends, the taxpayer may have insufficient cashflow to fund the tax. 50 Grey list and foreign investment fund rules 5.12 A significant exception to application of the FIF rules is the grey list exemption. Taxpayers are not subject to the FIF rules for investments in companies resident in a grey list country: Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. Over 70% of outbound portfolio investment goes into grey list resident entities, so the FIF rules do not apply to a significant amount of foreign investment. The assessable income of individual direct portfolio investors in foreign companies resident in grey list countries would generally equal the dividends paid to them. Minimum threshold 5.13 A minimum threshold exemption also applies to individuals. Individuals are subject to FIF rules only if the cost of all of their FIF interests (which do not include equity in grey list resident companies) exceeds $50,000. Collective investment vehicles 5.14 QCIVs are subject to the FIF rules as all resident taxpayers are. That applies to the tax treatment of QCIVs and individuals investing directly in countries outside of the grey list. However, for investments made in grey list countries, QCIVs are generally taxable on their trading income, while individuals are not (unless they are dealers in shares). This results in a disincentive for investors to invest in grey list entities through a QCIV. Economic and policy issues Economic efficiency 5.15 The primary policy objective behind taxing income from offshore investments is economic efficiency. Ideally, investments that maximise New Zealanders’ personal returns should also maximise the return to New Zealand. The return to New Zealand consists of both the return to the resident investor and the return to the New Zealand government as tax revenue. Thus investors should consider the post-foreign tax return of a foreign investment on an equivalent basis as the pre-New Zealand tax return of a domestic investment. This can be illustrated by the example in table 1 of returns from a domestic and foreign investment, assuming the foreign investment is not subject to New Zealand tax. 51 Table 1: Domestic and foreign investment returns DomesticForeign Pre-all tax return 10%12% Foreign tax (33%) -(4%) Pre-NZ tax return 10%8% NZ tax (33%) (3.3%)EXEMPT Return to investor 6.7%8% Return to NZ 10%8% 5.16 In the example in table 1, the investor would choose the foreign investment because it yields the higher return to the individual (8%). However, New Zealand as a whole would be better off if the investment were made domestically. 5.17 The example in table 2 illustrates how the incentives change if New Zealand taxes the post-foreign tax return. Table 2: Tax on foreign investment returns DomesticForeign Pre-all tax return 10%12% Foreign tax (33%) -(4%) Pre-NZ tax return 10%8% NZ tax (33%) (3.3%)(2.6%) Return to investor 6.7%5.4% Return to NZ 10%8% 5.18 In the table 2 example, the investor would choose the domestic investment because it yields the highest return to the investor and to New Zealand. 5.19 Investing offshore may provide benefits for portfolio diversification to reduce the risk associated with a narrow range of investments or investing in just one economy. Some consider that this justifies favourable tax treatment for offshore investments. However, the risk diversification benefit is generally taken into account by investors when they choose their investments. It would therefore be distortionary for the government to provide further incentives for investors to choose offshore investments by providing favourable tax treatments for them. 5.20 In the case of domestic investments, New Zealand tax on the income earned by the company is imposed by New Zealand company tax, which is integrated with the investor’s tax through the imputation system. New Zealand does not separately tax the capital gain on the increase in share values for domestic companies because tax on the company’s income is satisfied by the New Zealand company tax. 52 5.21 New Zealand company tax does not apply to the income earned from investment into non-resident companies. Therefore another mechanism is necessary to ensure that New Zealand tax applies to income earned by non- resident companies in which New Zealand residents invest. 5.22 When implementing this framework, a key consideration is that excessive taxes on foreign portfolio equity investment could discourage individuals from migrating to New Zealand or encourage high net-wealth New Zealanders to emigrate. Therefore, particularly for individual investors, it is necessary that this factor is considered when designing tax rules for offshore investment. The grey list and controlled foreign company rules 5.23 The grey list exemption is a New Zealand tax exemption on income accumulated in companies resident in seven countries. The origin of the exemption was an intention to reduce compliance costs under the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. 5.24 The grey list consists of countries with fairly robust tax rules where the government is satisfied that, in most cases, companies resident there will pay a similar level of tax in that country as New Zealand companies do in New Zealand. The exemption was established for the CFC rules because they provide for an underlying foreign tax credit. It was thought that in most cases, application of the foreign tax credit would mean that little or no New Zealand tax would be imposed on CFCs resident in those countries. The grey list exemption was therefore established as a compliance-savings measure. It has also applied to FIFs to extend to them the same exemption as for CFCs. 5.25 The rationale for the grey list exemption, however, does not apply to FIFs, as FIFs generally do not qualify for an underlying foreign tax credit. This has resulted in a distortion when investors have an incentive to invest in FIFs in grey list countries (which are generally high-tax), even when that investment does not maximise the return to New Zealand. In other words, investors investing in grey list FIFs face the incentives illustrated in table 1, while investors in non-grey list FIFs face the incentives illustrated in table 2. This has led to an inefficient allocation of offshore investments from New Zealand’s perspective. 5.26 Some may think it is fair or equitable to give an exemption or foreign tax credit on offshore investments since they have paid foreign tax. However, from a New Zealand perspective, foreign tax is simply another expense of the foreign company, and the expense should not be given special tax treatment, in the same way that there is no special tax treatment for other company expenses such as wages or rent. Further, the international tax environment New Zealand operates in has no expectation that a country must provide an exemption or underlying foreign tax credit for foreign portfolio investments. That is because it is simply not possible to expect portfolio investors to know the foreign tax paid on their investment. 53 5.27 The foreign tax credits granted for direct investment are made in the context of multilateral practice. Most countries give credits for underlying New Zealand tax on direct investment here, and New Zealand also gives credits for taxes on direct investments offshore. However, countries generally do not give credits for underlying New Zealand tax on portfolio investments made here. Giving credits for underlying taxes on portfolio investments may be more feasible under a bilateral arrangement where credit for New Zealand taxes is also granted by another country. That would be done only if it were clearly in New Zealand’s interest. 5.28 Unlike a foreign tax credit, an exemption for foreign income does not maximise world wealth. Therefore the international tax environment, which generally expects countries to provide underlying foreign tax credits for offshore direct investments, does not encourage countries to exempt foreign portfolio income from taxation. National welfare maximisation and world welfare maximisation National welfare maximisation is the idea that policy settings should align investors’ interests (the post-all tax return) with the national interest (the post-foreign tax and pre-domestic tax return). That is achieved by providing that domestic tax applies to foreign-sourced income with a deduction and not a credit for foreign taxes. World welfare maximisation is the idea that policy settings should align investors’ interests (the post-all tax return) with the world interest (the pre-all tax return), achieved by providing a credit for foreign taxes. That is the reason foreign tax credits are the norm in the international tax environment and are a standard provision in almost all tax treaties. The two concepts are illustrated here: Table 3: Results of deduction, credit and exemption Domestic Foreign with Foreign with Foreign with deduction credit exemption (NWM) (WWM) Pre-all tax return (return to world) 10% 12% 11% 9.5% Foreign tax (20%) - (2.4%) (2.2%) (1.9%) Pre-NZ tax return (return to NZ) 10% 9.6% 8.8% 7.6% NZ tax (33%) (3.3%) (3.2%) (1.4%) - Return to investor 6.7% 6.4% 7.4% 7.6% 54 continued from page 53 World wealth is maximised when investors choose to make investments with the highest returns before all tax (top row). National wealth is maximised when investors choose to make investments that maximise the return before domestic taxes (after deducting foreign taxes). Investors obviously choose to maximise their post-all tax returns. The table illustrates a combination of different policy settings with different pre-tax rates of return and how the ultimate return to investors is distorted. In this example, the investor would choose the 9.5% pre-all tax return with an exemption for foreign income, even though this would provide the lowest return to the world and to New Zealand. A foreign income exemption is neither national welfare-maximising nor world welfare-maximising. 5.29 Another major problem with the grey list is that it assumes that a level of tax is paid in the grey list country that is broadly equivalent to that paid if the entity were resident in New Zealand. This is not so for a number of offshore vehicles resident in grey list countries. Examples of this include Australian unit trusts and United Kingdom open ended investment companies. As noted in chapter 2, the proliferation of vehicles of this nature is making the grey list unsustainable. 5.30 A further problem with the grey list is determining where companies invested into actually reside. For example, New Zealand investors can purchase an interest in a company on the Australian Stock Exchange that is resident, say, in The Netherlands without knowing that the company is resident outside the grey list. This results in compliance costs and uncertainty for taxpayers. Accommodating QCIVs that flow through income 5.31 It is necessary that the proposed grey list reforms for QCIVs should reflect how they operate in a flow-through environment. QCIVs that flow through must attribute assessable income to their investors regularly. Therefore it is highly desirable that the calculation of offshore income for QCIVs does not contain a deferred tax liability that must be provisioned for by investors. It suggests strongly that assessable income should be calculated on an accrued basis and rules out a tax based on realisation. Parity between investing in CIVs and investing directly 5.32 A key objective of the reform to the taxation of investment is to ensure that individual investors are not disadvantaged by investing in a CIV rather than directly. An investment in a CIV has the advantage of providing small savers the benefit of diversification. However, it has had the disadvantage of being taxed on its trading income while most individual savers would not be taxed on income from selling shares. 55 5.33 At present, there is parity between the taxation of direct ownership of foreign equities and ownership through CIVs to the extent those equities are in entities resident outside the grey list. However, most foreign equities in which New Zealanders invest are resident in the grey list. For investment in grey list equities, there is a disadvantage in investing through a CIV compared with investing directly. A CIV is taxed on its trading income, while an individual saver would not be. Proposal 1: Repeal grey list FIF exemption for portfolio investments 5.34 The government proposes to repeal the grey list exemption as it applies to the FIF rules for portfolio investments. The rationale for the grey list exemption as it applies to CFC rules does not apply to the FIF rules, because the FIF rules do not provide an underlying foreign tax credit (unless the branch- equivalent calculation option is selected). This option would remain under the proposed amendments. 5.35 The grey list exemption would remain for non-portfolio investments that own more than 10% of the entity invested into. This aligns with accepted world norms, which generally require an underlying foreign tax credit. Therefore applying the high-tax presumption of the grey list is appropriate for these investments. 5.36 All offshore investments held by a QCIV, regardless of the size of the holding, will be treated as a FIF and the grey list exemption will not apply. That is because the QCIV would be holding them on behalf of its investors, and the investments would be classed as portfolio from the perspective of the QCIV’s investors. 5.37 Repealing the grey list exemption would eliminate the current distortion which favours investing in the relatively high-taxed grey list countries over investing in low-tax countries. It would also largely eliminate the tax disadvantage from investing in a grey list country through a QCIV rather than investing directly. This should improve the efficiency of New Zealanders’ savings and investments. 5.38 An example of the deficiencies of the grey list exemption was recently discussed in an article published in The New Zealand Herald. 4 According to the article, if a New Zealand investor bought shares in Dell 10 years ago, the investment would have multiplied more than 50 times. However, no New Zealand tax would have been payable because Dell has never paid a dividend and is resident in a grey list country. 4 Brian Gaynor, The New Zealand Herald, 21 May 2005, Business page 2. 56 Practical problems with the FIF rules 5.39 Application of the FIF rules has raised some problems in practice. The most common income calculation method used is the CV method, which has required income from a FIF interest to be calculated using the following formula: (A + B) – (C + D) Where: A is the market value of the interest at the end of the income year; B is the aggregate of all gains derived from holding or disposing of the interest during the income year, including any foreign withholding tax that the holder is allowed to credit; C is the market value of the interest at the end of the previous income year; and D is the total expenditure incurred by the holder during the income year in acquiring or increasing the interest. 5.40 When the variables in the formula are denominated in a foreign currency, they must be translated into New Zealand currency either using the exchange rate on the day of the transaction or valuation, or using a 12-month average exchange rate. Given the high fluctuation of the New Zealand dollar over the last few years, it has made the outcome of this calculation highly volatile. 5.41 Another problem with the CV method is that because tax is imposed on the increase in value of shares and not just on dividends, a tax liability could arise even though the interest has not paid much in dividends and there is little cashflow to pay the tax. 5.42 For FIF interests which do not have a readily ascertainable market value, the deemed rate of return method is available. Assessable income on the interest is calculated by multiplying the cost of the interest by a set rate of return. However, this calculation can be complicated in cases where the interest is acquired or disposed of during the year, as daily apportionment is required. Also, the rate of return that must be used may be higher than the actual rate of return of the interest in some cases. Proposal 2: FIF calculation method – comparative value 5.43 As stated earlier, it is important that New Zealand investors in foreign equities face an equivalent New Zealand tax impost on the underlying income earned on this investment as they would if investing in domestic equities. It is impossible to determine this directly, so a proxy must be used. The government has considered a number of proxy measures, including a risk-free return method, and a partial comparative value. It considers the best method to be comparative value, with some modifications to alleviate cashflow and income volatility concerns for individual investors. 57 5.44 It is proposed that a comparative value approach with no modification to the income calculation will apply to QCIVs and investments by non-individual investors. This method would apply to offshore portfolio share investments that have a readily verifiable market value. The fact that the comparative value approach taxes on an accrued basis should make it relatively easy to apply for QCIVs that flow through income. 5.45 This method should not represent a significant increase in the tax liability for funds that currently trade actively as these vehicles are likely to turn over their offshore share investments regularly and currently pay tax on realised share profits. 5.46 Given that income will be taxed on an accrued basis under a comparative value method, it is appropriate to allow a deduction for accrued losses. Accrued losses would be available to be offset against any assessable income derived via the QCIV. What level of comparative value income should be taxed? 5.47 Income earned and retained by a company should affect its share value, as the company would have more net assets. This makes CV a useful proxy for the underlying income. Obviously, other factors affect a company’s share price, including the general trend of the sharemarket, the general trend of the industry the company is in, and investors’ perceptions of future income and growth prospects for the company. 5.48 The effect of this measure would be to capture the “external” capital gain in the share price as income, and not just the underlying income earned by the company. In this way, the taxation of the foreign investment would differ from taxation of the domestic investment when external gains are not taxed. While this is undesirable, the government is not aware of any superior method that captures the underlying income of the company. 5.49 It may be possible, for example, to tax a percentage – say, 70% – of a company’s change in share price as suggested in the 2003 issues paper Taxation of non-controlled offshore investment in equity. The underlying assumption is that 70% of a company’s change in share price over a year results from an increase in retained earnings, and 30% from an increase in goodwill (the excess of a company’s total share value over its net asset value). However, there is no magic number that provides the right percentage. When there may be such a percentage, it differs wildly from company to company, market to market, and from year to year. Any percentage used would be inherently arbitrary. 5.50 In addition, the calculation of assessable income using a percentage of the change in an asset’s value is likely to give rise to tax integrity concerns. That could occur if an investment were made in a country that does not impose any tax on the investment. In such cases it would clearly be inappropriate for New Zealand to tax only a percentage of the income derived. 58 5.51 By using the total change in share value as the proxy for the underlying income, it would at least ensure that the income earned at the investor level is taxed. Using a percentage would most likely mean that the amount taxed does not equate to actual underlying income at either the company or the investor level. 5.52 Another possible approach would be to give some partial credit for foreign taxes as long as there is a way to measure them or have a good proxy for them. It would be a mid-way approach between world wealth maximisation and national wealth maximisation criteria. Modified CV with volatility cap 5.53 QCIVs and other commercial operations such as companies should be able to manage the risks associated with the volatility of offshore share investments, be they real or exchange-rate related. The government believes that individual investors are not as well placed to manage these risks – particularly where a large tax liability arises but the investor has no cashflow to meet the liability. For these investors, the government is proposing a modified CV with a volatility cap. 5.54 Under the proposed approach for taxing individuals on their offshore portfolio equity investment, before tax is calculated for the income year it would be necessary to determine the amount that is “available to tax”. The “available to tax” amount can be represented as follows: (A + B) – (C + D) + E Where: A is the market value of the pool of offshore assets at the end of the income year; B is the aggregate cash receipts derived in the income year (from dividends and also any receipts from the sale of any asset in the pool), including foreign tax allowed as a credit and imputation credits attached; C is the market value of the pool at the beginning of the income year; D is the aggregate of expenditure incurred on acquiring any assets during the income year; and E is the “available to tax” amount carried forward (from the previous year). 5.55 The amount that is actually taxable (the “deemed taxable” amount) would be the greater of dividends, plus realisations during the year or a deemed percentage (6%) of the total amount that is invested. The “deemed taxable” amount in a year would be capped by the amount that is “available to tax”. Where the “available to tax” amount is greater than the “deemed taxable amount”, the difference would be carried forward to the next income year (and added to the “available to tax” amount calculated for that year). 59 Pooling of FIF interests 5.56 A question arises as to whether taxpayers should be allowed to pool all FIF interests together in applying the formula, or whether a separate calculation should be required for each FIF investment. 5.57 Pooling should result in simpler tax compliance. One consequence of pooling, however, would be to allow a de facto rollover of gain when a taxpayer sells FIF interests by investing them into another FIF. In other words, the gain from selling the interest reflected in item B in the formula is offset by a higher item D in the formula when the taxpayer reinvests the proceeds in another FIF. That would allow the taxpayer to defer the income until proceeds from the sale of FIF interests are repatriated rather than reinvested, but could have the negative consequence of discouraging repatriations. 5.58 The government considers that the risks of allowing pooling are partly offset by having a higher income cap percentage. It is therefore proposed that the income cap percentage be 6%, with rollover relief so that tax is payable on the sale of offshore assets only on repatriation. The higher the income cap percentage, the lower the tax deferral amounts carrying forward will be and the less likely there would be a “lock-in” effect discouraging repatriations. The government’s willingness to accept the rollover provision is directly related to the 6% rate. Submissions on this question are welcomed. Treatment of foreign tax credits and imputation credits 5.59 Under the proposed approach, foreign non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) deducted on foreign dividends would continue to be allowed as a tax credit. Foreign NRWT credits would be included in the “available to tax” amount calculation (in part B of the formula), as under the comparative value approach used at present. No credit would be allowed on underlying foreign taxes, as the proposed approach deals with portfolio investment. Imputation credits attached to dividends paid by Australian companies would be treated in a similar manner. Treatment of losses 5.60 Losses would be allowed under the proposed approach. A loss would arise if the “available to tax” amount were negative. The government proposes to allow a loss up to the deemed percentage that would have been taxable (again, 6%) if a gain had been made instead. Also, when the proposed approach applies in the context of a pool of offshore assets, and a portion of the assets is realised, any negative “available to tax“ amount would be available as a loss in proportion to the ratio of the realisation to the market value of the pool at the time. The full loss would be allowed when the pool is realised. 5.61 Example 1 outlines how the proposed method would work. For simplicity, the example assumes that an investor holds only one offshore asset. 60 Example 1: Readily attainable market value Jo purchases 100 F Co shares for $2 per share halfway through income year 1. Later in that same income year she derives a $10 gross dividend on her interest in F Co. The F Co shares have a market value of $3.20 per share at the end of income year 1. Halfway through income year 2 Jo purchases 50 additional F Co shares for $3.20 per share. Later in that same income year she derives a $10 gross dividend on her interest in F Co. The F Co shares have a market value of $3.40 per share at the end of income year 2. A quarter of the way into income year 3 Jo sells her entire portfolio of F Co shares for $3.60 per share. Jo does not purchase any other qualifying offshore equity in income year 3. Assessable income (in NZ dollars): Year 1 “Available to tax” calculation: ($320 + $10) – ($0 + $200) = $130 “Deemed assessable income” calculation: Higher of $10 (dividend) and $0 (the deemed 6% tax does not apply as Jo does not hold the interest in F Co at the beginning of the income year) = $10 “Available to tax” amount carried forward = $130 – $10 = $120 Year 2 “Available to tax” calculation: ($510 + $10) – ($320 + $160) + $120 = $160 “Deemed assessable income” calculation: Higher of $10 (dividend) or $19.20 ($320 x 6%) = $19.20 Available to tax carried forward = $160 – $19.20 = $140.80 Year 3 “Available to tax” calculation ($0 + $540) – ($510 + $0) + $140.80 = $170.80 “Deemed assessable income” calculation: Higher of $170.80 ($540 gross revenue from sale capped to “available to tax” amount) and $30.60 ($510 x 6%) = $170.80 “Available to tax” amount carried forward = $170.80 – $170.80 = $0 Investments without a readily attainable market value – simplified standard rate of return 5.62 It will be necessary to provide investors with a method for calculating income on offshore assets for which it is not possible or practical to obtain market values. Currently, the deemed rate of return method in the foreign investment fund rules caters for such assets, although it is very complex to apply and uses a high rate. 5.63 A simplified version of the standard rate of return method has been developed as follows. 61 Method 5.64 An investor would be taxable on the following two aspects: • on accrual – the higher of 6% or any dividends derived; and • on realisation – the difference between the asset’s cost base and the realisation value. Accrual component 5.65 The first aspect, a simplified standard return approach, would consist of the following components: • Cost base: the cost base would be an investor’s entry price into the investment. It would also include all subsequent additions to the interest. • Standard return rate of 6%: this is the deemed rate of return that would apply on the cost base at the start of the year. 5.66 In the year in which the investor enters an investment (for example, part-way through the year), the investor will have no cost base in that year. The investment would become part of the cost base only in the second year. As a general rule, any additions to the investment would be rolled into the cost base only in the following year. 5.67 In the first year of an investment, an investor will have no cost base and therefore the investor’s income under a standard return will be zero. Consequently, in that first year, if the investor receives a dividend from that asset the dividend will be taxable because it would be higher than assessable income under the standard return. Similarly, in the year the investment is fully realised, any dividends received would be taxable. 5.68 In the second year, the investor’s cost base would include any acquisitions in the previous year, plus assessable income for the previous year (in dividends) less any dividends derived in that year. Rolling up assessable income on accrual (at the standard return rate or on dividends) into the cost base in the following year will preclude the need for investors to keep track of how much income has been recognised on a year-by-year basis. 5.69 That is important when considering the implications for the tax wash-up when an asset or portion of an asset is sold. The assessable income in the previous year, when rolled up into the cost base, would also proxy for “investment growth”. So, in the third year, the investor’s cost base would be the cost base in the second year, plus any acquisitions in the second year, plus assessable income recognised in the second year (proxying for “investment growth” in that previous year) and less dividends derived in the second year. This will be the formula for calculating the cost base in each subsequent year. 62 Wash-up 5.70 For investments that are realised in a year, the difference between the cost base-value of those investments and their sale price will be taxable. Because the assessable income each year is rolled up into the cost base, any tax paid in each year before realisation (for example, on the dividend or at the standard return rate) will be available to offset the tax payable on realisation. 5.71 If the asset is realised in the first year (the year of purchase), as there will be no cost base, the difference between the purchase price and the sale price will be taxable. 5.72 When only a portion of an investment is realised, the cost base will need to be updated. An investor will need first to value the portion of the cost base that the realisation represents. The methods for determining which portion of an interest has been realised include FIFO (first in first out); LIFO (last in first out); and average cost. 5.73 It would seem preferable to use an average cost basis for valuing realisations as it does not require investors to keep track of the cost of acquisitions. Instead, the average cost would simply be the cost base value at the start of the year, divided by the number of units of the asset held (pre-realisation). The difference between the sale value and the portion of the cost base realised would be taxable. 5.74 Once the portion of the cost base that the realisation represents is valued, the difference between it and the cost base at the start of the year would be the updated cost base in that year (for working out tax paid on accrual) and would also carry over to the following year. 5.75 This method for calculating assessable income would result in the following formulas for calculating assessable income: Year of acquisition (Year 1) Cost base = 0 Any dividends received taxable Year 2 Cost base = purchases in Year 1 – distributions derived in Year 1 (for example, dividends) + assessable income in Year 1 Higher of dividends and standard return income taxable Standard return income in Year 2 = cost base x standard return rate 63 Year 3 Cost base = cost base in Year 2 – distributions derived in Year 2 (for example, dividends) + assessable income in Year 2 Higher of dividends and standard return income taxable Standard return income in Year 3 = cost base x standard return rate Year n Cost base = cost base in Year n-1 – distributions in Year n-1 + assessable income in Year n-1 Higher of dividends and standard return income taxable Standard return income in Year n = cost base x standard return rate Sale of asset (or portion of asset) Proportion of cost base realised = no of units realised x average cost Average cost = cost base in year of realisation/no of units held Gain or loss on realisation (taxable) = sale value – proportion of cost base realised Updated cost base = cost base in year of realisation – proportion of cost base realised Assessable income on accrual: higher of dividends or standard return income (standard return income = updated cost base x standard return rate) Cost base in year post-realisation (n+1) = Updated cost base (year n) – distributions in year n + assessable income in year n 64 Example 2: No readily attainable market value – Joe buys 10,000 shares in A Co on the 25th of September, 2007. The cost of these shares is $1.50 each. On the 29th of January, 2008 he buys 4,000 shares in A Co @ $1.75. – In the following year (2008-09) Joe continues to hold 14,000 shares in A Co but purchases another 2,000 shares @ $1.77 on the 15th of October, 2008. – In the third year (2009-10), on the 15th of March, 2010 he sells 7,000 shares in A Co @ $1.80. – In the fourth year (2010-11), on the 20th of September, 2010 he sells the remaining 9,000 shares @ $2.00. – In each year, except the last, on the 1st of February, Joe receives a dividend of $0.05 per share. Year 1 (2007-08) Cost base = $0 Assessable income is dividend of $700 (as this is higher than standard return income of $0) Year 2 (2008-09) Cost base = $15,000 + $7,000 (acquisitions in year 1) – $700 (distributions in year 1) + $700 (assessable income in year 1) = $22,000 Assessable income is $1,320 (the standard return of 6% on $22,000) as this is higher than the dividend of $700 (the actual dividend received in the current year is $800 but $100 of this, relating to the acquisition of 2,000 shares, has been carved out). Year 3 (2009-10) Cost base = $22,000 (cost base in previous year) + $3,540 (acquisition in previous year) – $800 (dividend in previous year) + $1,320 (assessable income in previous year) = $26,060 Realisation Assuming average cost is used, average cost of share is $1.63 ($26,060/16,000). The cost base for the realisation is $11,401 ($1.63 x 7,000). The value of the realisation is $12,600. The difference between the value of the realisation and the cost base for the realisation – $1,199 – is taxable. The updated cost base is $26,060 – $11,401 = $14,659 Assessable income is $880 (the standard return of 6% on $14,659) as this is higher than the dividend of $800 paid in the year. Year 4 (2010-11) Cost base = $14,659 (updated cost base from previous year) – $800 (dividend in previous year) + $880 (assessable income in previous year but not from realisation) = $14,739 Realisation The cost base for realisation is $14,739 (as the interest is realised in full). The value of the realisation is $18,000. The difference – $3,261 – is taxable. No tax is payable on accrual as the interest has been fully realised. Minimum threshold 5.76 The current FIF rules provide for a minimum threshold of $50,000 (total cost of FIF interests) before the rules apply to individuals. Here, an investor would generally only be taxed on dividends. With the repeal of the grey list exemption, many more individuals are likely to be subject to FIF rules. 65 5.77 If the minimum threshold remains at $50,000, moderate savers – say, those who have shares with savings of $20,000 to $50,000 – will be disadvantaged by investing in offshore equities through a QCIV rather than investing directly. Reducing the current minimum threshold would reduce this distortion. Keeping the threshold at a high level, however, minimises compliance costs for individuals. 5.78 On balance, a minimum threshold of $50,000 for individuals would seem appropriate as it would minimise compliance costs for small investors without creating significant incentives for investors with more sizeable portfolios to invest offshore directly rather than via a New Zealand-resident managed fund. The government proposes that the $50,000 minimum threshold should be available only for investments into companies that are listed on a recognised exchange in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. This should ensure that the vast majority of small investments into foreign companies fall below the threshold. It should also ensure that the minimum threshold cannot be used for tax minimisation rather than minimising compliance costs. 5.79 The government invites submissions on the appropriate level of the minimum threshold for individual investors. Points for submission The government welcomes submissions on any points raised in this discussion document, with specific comment welcomed on the following: • Whether the modified comparative value with a volatility cap is a workable proposal for the taxation of individual offshore investments that can be easily valued. • Whether the 6% income cap is an appropriate rate, given the proposals for rollover relief. • Whether taxpayers should be allowed to pool foreign investment fund interests together in applying the modified comparative value method, or whether a separate calculation should be required for each investment. • Whether the proposed treatment of losses in the context of the modified comparative value approach would be a workable solution. • Whether the method proposed for taxing individuals on investments with no readily attainable market value is an appropriate and workable method. • Whether the amount of the minimum threshold of $50,000 for individual investors is set at an appropriate level. 66 Chapter 6 TRANSITIONAL AND OUTSTANDING POLICY ISSUES 6.1 The proposed tax rules for QCIVs and the proposed changes to the taxation of offshore portfolio investment in shares raise several issues in relation to transitioning from the current rules. 6.2 For CIVs, the key issues are around moving from rules that may tax domestic share gains to rules that would generally exempt those gains. For investors in offshore shares, be they individual direct investors or a CIV, the key issues are likely to be around removal of the current grey list exemption and movement to rules where tax is based on changes in value. This chapter outlines some of the key transitional issues. 6.3 One of the key outstanding policy issues is life insurance. When life insurance companies offer savings products that mirror those offered by other CIVs, such as widely held unit trusts and registered superannuation schemes, similar tax rules should apply to these products. 6.4 Nonetheless, the taxation of life insurance is a complex area. While the government agrees that life insurance, as a collective savings vehicle, should get some benefit from the reforms it must consider how such benefit would be delivered within the overall framework of the life insurance rules. 6.5 Submissions on how to extend the benefits to life insurance as a savings vehicle are welcomed. Transitional issues – new tax rules for QCIVs 6.6 Currently, most CIVs pay tax on realised domestic share gains as a result of the current capital/revenue boundary. Similarly, revenue account losses are deductible. Under the proposed changes, these gains and losses would generally not be taxable. This creates a problem of how to deal with unrealised revenue account gains and losses under the current rules when a QCIV elects into the new rules on 1 April 2007 or later. 6.7 The government considers that transition rules that do not penalise investors or the QCIV, but that also do not give rise to undue windfall gains at the expense of the tax base, are desirable. Broadly, any transitional rules should treat losses and gains symmetrically. 67 Losses and gains arising under the current tax rules 6.8 At present, if a CIV treats domestic share gains on revenue account, on election into the new tax rules for QCIVs (the transition date) there is a question of whether these gains should be taxed. Similarly, if unrealised losses have been made, the issue arises whether these losses should be crystallised and able to be used to offset income under the new tax rules. 6.9 Two options have been considered for dealing with this transitional problem. The first would effectively retain the current tax rules for investments made before the transition date. The second would require there to be a notional “wind-up” of the entity on transition into the new rules. 6.10 Under the first option, any domestic share investments made by a CIV would remain subject to the current taxation of investment income rules. In other words, if they are currently treated on revenue account they would continue to be taxable on any gains on realisation and, similarly, any losses would be deductible. Investments entered into after the date of transition would instead be subject to the new taxation of investment income rules. This option would principally serve to provide certainty that the transactions entered into under a historical regime remain subject to those rules. It would effectively quarantine any tax losses to existing investments. As a result, tax losses incurred in relation to historical investments could be offset against any gains made on investments entered into before the transition to the new rules (rather than allowing the losses to be carried forward into a system where the gains are no longer taxed). 6.11 There are some concerns about such an option. CIVs may, for example, take the opportunity to time their transition to the new rules so that it is in their favour. In this case, a CIV could choose to enter the new tax rules when gains are expected, to avoid a tax liability arising on those gains. Conversely, there would be no such incentive for CIVs to move into the rules when tax losses were being made (to ensure that the losses can be used up before entry). 6.12 A more important concern is that this transition rule could result in complexity, because it would result in separate rules applying for QCIVs, depending on when an investment was made, and would require QCIVs to track different investments. Consequently, an option requiring QCIVs to track separately investments made under the current tax rules and the new tax rules (and apply different tax rules for each) is not preferred. 6.13 The other option considered was to require a notional “wind-up” of the CIV on entry into the new rules. This wind-up would relate to the CIV’s share investments, both onshore and offshore. Under the notional wind-up option, any unrealised share gains (or for that matter losses) would be crystallised on the date of transition. If there is a gain, and the gain is on revenue account, tax would be payable. Similarly, if a loss is made on revenue account, it would be available to be used against income arising on crystallisation of any 68 gains, with any excess available to be carried forward and offset against future assessable income (under the new rules). 6.14 Requiring a notional wind-up on transition to the new rules would also allow CIVs to time their transition so that there would be an incentive to make the transition when they are making losses. Such incentives would exist because the new rules, while coming into effect on 1 April 2007, would not compel CIVs to enter on this date. This was discussed in chapter 3 and is a practical recognition that certain CIVs may not have the systems to operate fully as a flow-through vehicle by the proposed implementation date. A notional wind-up would preclude the need for separate tax rules to apply to investments made before and after the transition. It is therefore the preferred transition approach. No reduced tax rate on unrealised gains 6.15 The government considered an option that would have applied a reduced tax rate to the taxation of unrealised equity gains on transition. Such an approach may have been justifiable on the basis that, under the current rules, the investments would be taxable only on a realised basis and, therefore, a crystallisation of gains on the date of transition would provide an advantage to the government because it would receive tax revenue earlier than it otherwise would. 6.16 Such a reduction is not considered appropriate. Active CIVs are likely to turn over their portfolios fairly regularly, with the result that gains would be brought to tax relatively quickly under the current rules. In addition, the removal of tax on most domestic equity gains represents a major benefit for QCIVs which should more than compensate for any timing disadvantage. How should any tax losses that enter the new rules be dealt with? 6.17 Under the proposed transitional rules, any tax losses arising from periods before the new QCIV rules take effect and on the notional wind-up of the entity that cannot be used to offset other taxable gains could be carried forward and offset against future income that is taxable under the new tax rules. However, these would be strictly quarantined so that they could be used only against QCIV income, since losses arising under the old entity rules should be able to offset only income arising from that entity. For that reason, and to minimise filing obligations and complexity to investors, it is proposed that the transitional losses of a QCIV be carried forward and offset against investor income arising only from that QCIV. Transitional losses should be tracked by the QCIV and taken into account in calculating investors’ withholding taxes. 69 6.18 The government recognises that requiring QCIVs to track losses in individual investors’ accounts would give rise to compliance costs for QCIVs. Therefore an option whereby the QCIV effectively pools losses and uses these against QCIV income (before such income is allocated to individual investors’ accounts) would also be acceptable. This is effectively how losses are dealt with by QCIVs currently, and would result in losses being reflected in the QCIV’s unit price. Treatment of tax credits on notional wind-up 6.19 While the discussion so far has focused on tax losses arising on transition to the new tax rules for QCIVs, qualifying vehicles may also have tax credits, such as imputation credits, credits for resident withholding tax paid, foreign non-resident withholding tax and dividend withholding payments, which have yet to be distributed. The options for dealing with these credits are similar to the losses issue – refunding the credits, allowing the credits to be offset against any assessable income of the investor (not just QCIV income) or requiring them to be offset against QCIV income (with any excess to be carried forward and offset against future investment income). 6.20 The preferred option is for tax credits that exist on the date of transition being used to offset tax on investment income derived via a QCIV and, if excess credits are available, for them to be carried forward if they would be allowed to be carried forward under normal rules. Such a treatment would necessarily be identical to the treatment of tax losses arising on transition and would also remove the need for taxpayers to file a tax return to get the benefit of these tax credits. 6.21 There is, however, a problem in relation to tax credits that, if distributed to individual investors (or if derived directly by individual holders) would be refundable. Credits for resident withholding tax paid and dividend withholding payments should be refunded to the QCIV, as a taxpayer, which could then apportion credits to investors’ accounts in the same way that tax credit refunds are made under current rules. Transitional considerations – new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares 6.22 Transitional considerations would also arise in relation to the proposed changes to the taxation of offshore portfolio investment in shares. They would arise for QCIVs and individual direct investors alike. 6.23 The key problem is the value at which offshore share holdings enter the new rules. Under the new rules, tax would apply to changes in the value of share holdings – a comparative value basis of taxation. 70 6.24 Under the current tax rules for offshore portfolio investments in shares, when the investment is in a grey list country and the holding is on capital account, investors would not need to respond to the change in value of the shares. That is likely to be the case for most direct holders. For active QCIVs with grey list investments, it is likely that the investments are currently on revenue account and, depending on turnover, that tax is being paid on something close to a comparative value basis. 6.25 For QCIVs, given that the current tax treatment is already likely to proxy a comparative value basis of taxation, existing investments should enter the new rules at their market value on 1 April 2007. It would apply for both savings vehicles that enter the new rules for QCIVs and undertake a notional wind-up on 1 April 2007, as well as those vehicles that do not elect into the new rules on this date. It would also apply to non-individual investors, such as companies and trusts with offshore holdings. 6.26 For individual investors currently in the grey list, it is more complicated. The issue is whether existing investments should enter the new tax rules at their market value on 1 April 2007, at cost, or at some other value, such as the median between the cost and market value on the transition date. The government considers that for individual investors, the entry value of their grey list interests should be at the higher of cost or the market value on the transition date. This may allow them to realise the benefit of an unrealised loss on interests acquired before they became subject to the new rules, as that would reflect their total economic loss on the investment up to that time. If the investor does not remember or have records of the original cost, the opening value would be the market value on the transition date. Outstanding policy issues 6.27 The proposals outlined in this discussion document are aimed at delivering a reform package that is comprehensive in scope and detail. In particular, the new tax rules for QCIVs are aimed at ensuring that, for investment vehicles generally, tax does not act as a deterrent to owning a diversified portfolio of investments or drive entity form. However, the range of savings vehicles is significant. 6.28 While complexity has not specifically precluded consideration of other investment vehicles, and the proposals for reform put forward should be consistent with the treatment of savings via these alternate entities, it has meant that it has not been possible to consider certain detailed design issues for these other vehicles fully. In particular, this has been the case with life insurance companies that offer savings products which, in many cases, can be similar to those offered by unit trusts and superannuation schemes. 71 6.29 The taxation of life insurance is a complex area. Life insurance companies are taxed on two bases. The first, the life office base, is the profits from the life insurance business – premium income, mortality profit and investment returns. The second, the policyholder base, attempts to tax the returns to policy holders, with a credit for tax paid on the life office base. In practice, the tax rules for life insurance companies result in all investments being held on revenue account. Consequently, there are problems associated with changing the tax rules for savings vehicles such as unit trusts and superannuation schemes, while leaving investment income made via life insurance companies taxable under the current life insurance rules. The inequity in treatment is not desirable as the savings products on offer may be equivalent to that offered through a vehicle that does qualify for QCIV treatment (and should therefore be treated the same). 6.30 However, there has been insufficient time to consider the implications of moving life insurance companies into the new tax rules for QCIVs, as part of this reform phase. In his review, Craig Stobo noted that life insurance should be included within the scope of any reform of the investment tax rules. 6.31 Since the report-back from the Stobo review, the government has been working with key stakeholders to further develop the recommendations for reform put forward. The detailed nature of these discussions, and the desire to get the framework right for the majority of savings vehicles that are likely to use the new rules, has precluded looking in detail at the issue of life insurance companies. The government is, however, committed to ensuring that investments via a life insurance company will not be tax-disadvantaged compared with investments in a superannuation scheme or a unit trust under the new rules for QCIVs and will examine ways to ensure that this does not occur. Points for submission The government welcomes submissions on any points raised in this discussion document, with specific comment welcomed on the following: • Whether the notional wind-up rules proposed for the treatment of historic losses and gains is the appropriate approach. • Whether the proposal for individuals to bring assets into the new offshore rules at the higher of the asset’s cost or market value is appropriate.
Rewriting the Income Tax Act Exposure Draft Part F Rewrite Project Team First published in November 2005 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft – Part F ISBN 478-27130-1 1 Introduction This exposure draft has been prepared by the project team responsible for rewriting New Zealand’s income tax legislation. It contains draft legislation for the rewrite of Part F of the Income Tax Act 2004, which relates to special rules that modify the way other Parts of the Act operate for a variety of circumstances. The key objective of rewriting the Act is to produce tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent. This should make it easier for taxpayers to identify and comply with their income tax obligations, and ultimately save them time and money. We are rewriting the law as it currently stands. Changes to the law, other than minor ones in the interests of clarity or simplicity, will continue to be handled through the normal legislative programme. Cross references to sections outside Part F are to provisions within the Income Tax Act 2004. The presence or absence of provisions in the rewritten draft legislation does not necessarily indicate any future change in tax policy. We invite submissions on any aspect of this work, including the points raised in this commentary. The closing date for submissions is 31 January 2006. Submissions should be made to: The Rewrite Project Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Electronic submissions should be sent to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz . Please note submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with the Act. If you feel any part of your submission could be properly withheld under the Act (for example, for reasons of privacy), please indicate this clearly in your submission. 2 COMMENTARY ON REWRITTEN PART F OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 2004 Introduction The current Part F contains a range of provisions, including: • apportionment rules for cross-border transactions; • modifications to the interest deductibility rules for certain types of debentures and, under thin capitalisation rules, some foreign-owned organisations and banks; • rules for consolidated companies when calculating their income tax liability for a tax year; • rules for determining how groups of companies use imputation credits; and • modifications to the tax treatment of certain transfers of property and financial arrangements under a relationship agreement or upon death. The rewritten Part F preserves the role of modifying the calculation of taxable income for a tax year for persons entering into certain arrangements or transactions from the outcome that would occur if Part F did not exist. However, as apportionment is one of the functions ascribed to Part F in the 2004 Act, a number of apportionment rules have been moved closer to their related provisions in Parts C, D, and E. Despite this move, the apportionment rules relating to interest deductibility in thin capitalisation situations have been retained in Part F. This commentary outlines the main drafting changes made in rewriting Part F. These drafting changes relate mainly to structural relationships, are relatively minor, and are intended to improve the legislation. They fall into three main types: • modernising the style and language; • improving the clarity of the law; and • removing redundant material and moving some provisions to other parts of the Act. Some minor policy changes are being made for the rewrite of Part F, mainly to correct drafting errors or improve clarity. Provisions relating to consolidated companies have been moved into the rewritten Part F to make it easier to access this set of rules. 3 Benefits of the proposed structure Although current readers may be familiar with the concepts contained in Part F, the rewriting of this Part must also take into account the needs of future readers. Future readers will come to the legislation without knowledge of how the various rules in Part F interact with the core provisions and other Parts of the Act. In identifying these interrelationships, the draft legislation helps readers understand the relationship between provisions in other Parts of the Act and the transactions and situations dealt with in Part F. The ordering of the subparts and provisions in the subparts reflects the drafting policy that more generally applicable provisions should appear earliest in each Part. Cross-references in this exposure draft to Parts outside Part F relate to the 2004 Act, not to the recently released exposure drafts of other rewritten Parts. This is because further intensive specialist reviews of these exposure drafts are planned and may lead to changes to these draft provisions. Specific feedback Questions for specific consideration by readers of the exposure draft are set out in the commentary under the relevant draft sections. Comment on any of the drafting clarifications are also welcomed. 4 Minor policy changes and technical corrections Commentary on technical corrections and clarifications in individual draft sections Draft section FA 2: Recharacterisation of certain debentures References to debentures issued before 23 October 1986 contained in section FC 1 of the 2004 Act have been relocated to draft section FZ 1. References to debentures issued before 30 August 1940 contained in section FC 2 of the 2004 Act have been omitted as we have assumed that debentures issued earlier than this date are no longer in existence. However, if there are debentures from this period still on issue, this should be brought to our attention. Draft section FA 3: Recharacterisation of certain dividends: recovery of cost of shares held on revenue account In the 2004 Act, section FC 3 is intended to address the situation when a person enters into a dividend-stripping arrangement in relation to a purchase of shares on revenue account. This rule adjusts the sale price on disposal of those shares to take into account all dividends derived from pre-acquisition profits. Draft section FA 3 has been rewritten more simply to quantify the amount of the dividend from pre-acquisition profits that is taken into account as income (sale proceeds) by reference to the cost of the shares. This approach has enabled the proviso to be omitted. Draft section FA 5: Assets acquired and disposed of after deduction of payments under lease In draft section FA 5(5), the time of association is clarified as being at the time of acquisition by the associated person, irrespective of whether there is an association at the time of sale. Draft section FA 6: Recharacterisation of amounts derived under finance leases The draft provision provides a clear link to the financial arrangement rules, the valuation provisions contained in those rules, and the depreciation provisions. This approach allows the drafting of the finance lease provisions to be significantly rationalised. The relationship between lease payments under a finance lease and the non-resident withholding tax rules is to be addressed in the exposure draft of Part N. 5 Draft section FA 12: Recharacterisation of amounts derived under hire purchase agreements The draft provision provides a clear link to the financial arrangement rules, the valuation provisions contained in those rules, and the depreciation provisions. This approach allows the drafting of the hire purchase provisions to be significantly rationalised. Draft section FA 17: Treatment when agreement ends: when the buyer is a cash basis person Draft section FA 17(3) clarifies the ambiguity in section FC 10(4) of the 2004 Act by making it clear that the expenditure incurred by the lessee from hire purchase payments refers to the interest component of those payments. Draft section FB 13: Trading stock In draft section FB 13, the period to which the provision relates has been changed from “tax year” (31 March) to “income year” (31 March or approved alternative balance date). This change is necessary to ensure the provision aligns correctly with the trading stock provisions in Part E, which are based on the income year rather than the tax year. Draft section FB 16: Non-specified livestock: adjustments for enhanced production Draft section FB 16 has been rationalised with section EC 31 of the 2004 Act. This has allowed significant portions of the text to be omitted in draft section FB 16. Draft section FB 19, FB 20 and FB 21: Leased assets; Mining Assets; Depreciable property The transfer values set out in these three draft sections have been rationalised with the depreciation provisions, where possible, by referring to the defined terms “adjusted tax value” and “base value”. Draft section FB 21: Depreciable property In draft section FB 21(6), the relationship between this provision and the depreciation provisions has been clarified to show that draft subsection (6) is only for the purpose of determining the correct depreciation rate. 6 Subpart FE: Interest apportionment on thin capitalisation In this subpart, the drafting clarifies how the thin capitalisation provisions apply to natural persons and trustees. Draft section FM 2: The consolidation rules This definition has been relocated from section OB 1 to draft section FM 2. An index entry will be retained in section OB 1. We invite comment on whether the retention of this definition in the Act is desirable. Draft section FN 2: The imputation rules This definition has been relocated from section OB 1 to draft section FN 2. An index entry will be retained in section OB 1. We invite comment on whether the retention of this definition within the Act is desirable. Draft section FN 9: Joining existing imputation group Draft section FN 9(3) rewrites existing section FDA 4. However, this provision may be unnecessary, given this liability is a statutory imposition. We invite comment on whether draft section FN 9(3) should be omitted. Relationship of Part F to other Parts The relationship between the provisions in Part F and those in other Parts of the Act are proposed to be signalled with new draft linkage provisions in Parts C, D, E, H, K, L, M, and N. While this exposure draft contains specific linkage provisions, consideration is being given to providing for a general linkage provision in Parts C, D, and E in particular which would list the relevant Part F provisions. An example of this approach is set out in the exposure draft of Part G issued mid-2005. Comment is invited on the advantages and disadvantages of providing general linkage provisions in Parts C, D, and E that list the provisions in Part F that modify the operation of provisions in Parts C, D, and E. 7 Moving 2004 Act Part F provisions to other Parts Section FB 2(1) has been moved to draft section OE 4B, as this rule attributes a source to a particular amount of income. Section FB 2(1A) has been moved to draft subsections LC 1(5B) and (5C) to more appropriately locate the rule. Section FB 3 has been moved to draft section CB 1B as this provision is an apportionment rule that is better aligned with the business income and trading stock rules. Section FB 4A has been moved to section DB 21B as this provision is an apportionment rule related to the land sale rules. Section FB 7 has been moved to draft section EE 42B as it is an apportionment rule that is better aligned with the depreciation rules. Sections FC 13 to FC 16 and FC 18 to FC 21 (which relate to what is income or what is not a deduction) for non-resident insurers, shippers and film renters have been moved to Parts C, D, and O as draft sections CR 3, CV 3, CV 4, DW 3, OE 9 and OE 10. This move ensures that these income and deduction prohibitions and their attribution of a New Zealand source to that income are appropriately treated in the scheme of the 2004 Act. Section FC 17 has been moved to draft sections HK 27 and HK 28 to reflect the policy of the agency relationship that arises on payment of certain insurance premiums to non-resident insurers. Moving 2004 Act provisions from other Parts to Part F Sections HB 1 and HB 2 have been moved to draft subpart FM for integration with the consolidated company rules. Moving 2004 Act provisions from Part F to subpart FZ Sections FC 6 to FC 8, which relate to the specified lease regime, have been relocated to draft sections FZ 2 to FZ 4. Section FF 5, relating to commercial bills, has been moved to draft section FZ 6. Section FF 18, relating to specified activities carried on before 11 October 1982, has been moved to draft section FZ 7. Sections FI 9 and FI 10 of the 2004 Act have been moved to, and combined in, draft section FZ 7.
