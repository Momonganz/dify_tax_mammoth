1 UNCLASSIFIED DOMESTIC AIR TRAVEL – ZERO-RATING FOR GST PURPOSES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 98/3 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”) unless otherwise indicated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 11(2)(aa). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of air travel in the following circumstances: • The travel involves the transport of passengers by aircraft (any other mode of transport will not qualify, e.g. transport by road, sea, or rail); and • The transport is a direct flight from a place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand (referred to in this Ruling as “domestic air travel”); and • The domestic air travel is part of a wider agreement or contract for air carriage in respect of which all the parties to the wider agreement or contract (and in particular the party providing the domestic air travel services) contemplate that either: • The place of departure is within the territory of one country and the place of destination is within the territory of another country, not being travel where New Zealand is the place of: • Departure, and the Cook Islands, or Niue, or the Tokelau Islands is the place of destination; or • Destination, and the Cook Islands, or Niue, or the Tokelau Islands is the place of departure; or • The place of departure and the place of destination are both within the territory of a single country, but there is an agreed stopping place in another country. The term “agreed stopping place” refers to any place that the aircraft intends to land in accordance with the travel contract, not being travel that has a place of departure and destination both located in the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands unless there is an agreed stopping place in a country other than New Zealand, Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands. • All the parties to the wider agreement or contract for air carriage (i.e. all the carriers and the passenger or other party to the contract or agreement), and in particular the supplier of the domestic air travel, regard the domestic air travel to 2 UNCLASSIFIED be supplied as part of the wider agreement or contract for air carriage and as a single operation of international carriage. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • The supply of the domestic air travel by any supplier will constitute “international carriage” for the purposes of the Carriage By Air Act 1967 (“the CBA Act”) and so will be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa). This Ruling is based on the state of the Carriage By Air Act 1967 (and the treaties to which that Act gives effect) as at the date this Ruling is made. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to the supply of domestic air travel to the extent that that supply occurs during the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2001. For the purposes of determining the period for which this Ruling applies, the time of supply of air travel is the earlier of the time an invoice is issued or payment is received by the supplier in respect of that supply. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of May 1998.

Background Domestic air travel within New Zealand will often be part of an international travel package which involves travel to, or from, New Zealand. Generally, domestic air travel within New Zealand is standard rated for GST purposes because the travel is considered to be a service which is supplied in New Zealand. However, the GST Act provides for domestic air travel to be zero-rated in certain circumstances when international travel is involved, and the domestic air travel constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. According to the Ruling, it applies to the supply of air travel in the following circumstances: • The travel involves the transport of passengers by aircraft (any other mode of transport will not qualify, e.g. transport by road, sea, or rail); and • The transport is a direct flight from a place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand (referred to in this Ruling as “domestic air travel”); and • The domestic air travel is part of a wider agreement or contract for air carriage in respect of which all the parties to the wider agreement or contract (and in particular the party providing the domestic air travel services) contemplate that either: • The place of departure is within the territory of one country and the place of destination is within the territory of another country, not being travel where New Zealand is the place of: • Departure, and the Cook Islands, or Niue, or the Tokelau Islands is the place of destination; or 4 UNCLASSIFIED • Destination, and the Cook Islands, or Niue, or the Tokelau Islands is the place of departure; or • The place of departure and the place of destination are both within the territory of a single country, but there is an agreed stopping place in another country. The term “agreed stopping place” refers to any place that the aircraft intends to land in accordance with the travel contract, not being travel that has a place of departure and destination both located in the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands unless there is an agreed stopping place in a country other than New Zealand, Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands. • All the parties to the wider agreement or contract for air carriage (i.e. all the carriers and the passenger or other party to the contract or agreement), and in particular the supplier of the domestic air travel, regard the domestic air travel to be supplied as part of the wider agreement or contract for air carriage and as a single operation of international carriage. As long as these requirements are fulfilled, the Ruling will apply irrespective of whether: • The wider air carriage agreement is in the form of one contract or a series of contracts; or • The carriage is all with one carrier or with a series of carriers; or • Any of the air carriage contracts which form part of the wider air carriage agreement or contract consist purely of domestic travel; or • There are breaks between each flight; or • The domestic air travel is a connecting flight which takes a person out of New Zealand or to another place in New Zealand. The Ruling will be of primary interest and application to the airlines that supply domestic air travel services in New Zealand. If the Ruling applies, and the air travel services supplied to the passenger constitute “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act, the airline must zero-rate the domestic air travel services. Authority to make the Ruling One purpose of the binding rulings regime is to provide taxpayers with certainty about the way that the Commissioner will apply the taxation laws. In pursuance of this aim, sections 91A, 91D, and 91E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that the Commissioner may issue binding rulings that set out how a taxation law will apply to any person and to any arrangement. Section 91C(1)(c) provides that the Commissioner may make a binding ruling on any provision of the GST Act (except sections 12 and 13 of that Act). Section 11(2)(aa) is a provision of the GST Act. The Commissioner is authorised to make a binding ruling on how this section will apply to any person and any arrangement. 5 UNCLASSIFIED To determine whether section 11(2)(aa) applies to any person and any arrangement, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the services supplied comprise the transport of passengers within New Zealand by aircraft and that the transport constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. It will be impossible for the Commissioner to administer and apply section 11(2)(aa) unless he first determines whether the supply constitutes “international carriage” under the CBA Act. To determine whether a supply constitutes international carriage under the CBA Act, the Commissioner must be able to determine the meaning of that term for the purposes of that Act. The Commissioner considers that he can issue a ruling which involves interpreting the meaning of a term contained in a non-Revenue Act if the application of a provision of a Revenue Act is dependent on the meaning of that term. Legislation The Goods and Services Tax 1985 Under section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act, where a supply of services would otherwise be charged with GST under section 8 of that Act, that supply shall be charged at the rate of zero percent if: (aa) The services comprise the transport of passengers from a place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand to the extent that the transport is by aircraft and constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the Carriage By Air Act 1967 ... The Carriage By Air Act 1967 Section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act applies to air carriage which constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. There are three possible ways that air carriage can constitute “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. Firstly, under the Hague Protocol; secondly, under the Warsaw Convention; and thirdly, under section 18 of the CBA Act. The Hague Protocol Part I of the CBA Act gives effect to the provisions of the Warsaw Convention of 1929 as amended by the Hague Protocol of 1955, and supplemented by the Guadalajara Convention of 1961. The Convention is a multi-lateral treaty, intended to unify international law as it relates to carriers’ rights, obligations and liabilities and to override member nations’ differing domestic laws. In this Commentary, the amended and supplemented Convention is referred to as “the Hague Protocol”. Section 7 of the CBA Act states that the Hague Protocol has the force of law in New Zealand. The Hague Protocol is set out in the Schedule to the Act. Parties to the Hague Protocol are referred to in it as “High Contracting Parties”. “International carriage” is defined in Article 1(2) of the Hague Protocol (as set out in the Schedule to the CBA Act) as follows: 6 UNCLASSIFIED For the purposes of this Convention, the expression international carriage means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a trans-shipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State: even if that State is not a High Contracting Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention. Sub-Article 1(3) states: Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State. The Warsaw Convention A number of countries, including the United States, are signatories to the Warsaw Convention, but not to the Hague Protocol. The Hague Protocol does not apply to one way carriage between a Hague Protocol High Contracting Party (such as New Zealand) and a country which is not a signatory to the Hague Protocol. This is because that other country will not be a “High Contracting Party” to the Hague Protocol. In cases where the travel is between New Zealand and a country which is only a party to the Warsaw Convention, the Warsaw Convention will apply to the carriage. This is by virtue of the fact that section 15 of the CBA Act keeps alive the provisions of the old Carriage By Air Act 1940, which gave the Warsaw Convention the force of law in New Zealand. In some cases a country may be a High Contracting Party to the Hague Protocol, but not to the original Warsaw Convention. Articles XXI and XXIII of the Hague Protocol provide that where a country adheres to the Hague Protocol, but is not a signatory to the original Warsaw Convention, that country automatically becomes an adherent of the Warsaw Convention. Thus, if travel is between a country that is only a signatory to the Hague Protocol and a country that is only a signatory to the Warsaw Convention, the Warsaw Convention will apply because the Hague Protocol country is automatically an adherent to the Warsaw Convention. In cases where the Warsaw Convention applies, the definition of “international carriage” in Article 1(2) of that Convention is applicable. The definition of “international carriage” in the Warsaw Convention is very similar to the definition of “international carriage” in the Hague Protocol. Section 18 of the CBA Act Part II of the CBA Act provides rules for carriage by air that is not international carriage (international carriage is dealt with in Part I and by the Conventions, as discussed above). Section 18 of the CBA Act defines “international carriage”, for the 7 UNCLASSIFIED purposes of Part II of the CBA Act (i.e. for the purposes of working out what is not international carriage), as : “International carriage”, in relation to carriage by air, means carriage in which, according to the contract between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a trans-shipment, are within the territories of two countries or within the territory of a single country if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another country: Section 19 of the CBA Act provides for the application of Part II of the Act and states: (1) This Part of the Act applies to any carriage by air (not being international carriage) performed by a carrier as part of an air transport service in which, according to the contract between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination are both situated in New Zealand and there is no agreed stopping place outside New Zealand; notwithstanding that the aircraft in which the carriage takes place is at the same time engaged in international carriage and notwithstanding that the contract for the carriage of any passenger is made without consideration. (2) For the purposes of determining whether or not any carriage is international carriage, every island in the Cook Islands, Niue, and every island in Tokelau shall be deemed part of New Zealand and any carriage between such islands or between New Zealand (as defined in section 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924) and any such island shall be deemed to be carriage within New Zealand and shall not (unless there is an agreed stopping place outside any such place) be international carriage for the purposes of this Part of the Act. Application of the Legislation Section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act allows zero-rating of services where the services comprise the transport of passengers by aircraft from one place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand to the extent that the transport constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act 1967. It can be seen from the above extracts from the CBA Act, that the term “international carriage” has the following meanings in the CBA Act: • The definition contained in Article 1(2) of the Hague Protocol (which is given the force of law in New Zealand by section 7 of the CBA Act), as modified by Article 1(3) of the Hague Protocol (which relates to undivided carriage by successive carriers). • The definition contained in Article 1(2) of the original Warsaw Convention, as modified by Article 1(3) of that Convention (these sub-articles are substantially the same as Article 1(2) and (3) of the Hague Protocol ), as kept alive by section 15(2) of the CBA Act. • The definition contained in section 18 of the CBA Act which only applies to Part II of the CBA Act and defines the type of carriage to which Part II does not apply. While each of the meanings of “international carriage” in the CBA Act have some of the same components, they are not identical. The main differences are: 1. “International carriage” under the Hague Protocol must involve places of departure and destination that are within countries which are both High 8 UNCLASSIFIED Contracting Parties to the Hague Protocol. Similarly, “international carriage” under the Warsaw Convention must involve places of departure and destination that are within countries which are both High Contracting Parties (or deemed High Contracting Parties) to that Convention. The section 18 definition is not limited to travel between particular countries, and potentially applies to carriage involving places of departure or destination in any country. 2. The Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol contain Article 1(3), which deems carriage performed by successive carriers to be one undivided carriage if that carriage has been regarded by the parties to it as a single operation. There is no equivalent of this provision in section 18. 3. Article 1(2) in the Hague Protocol speaks of “the agreement between the parties”. By contrast, section 18 refers to “the contract between the parties”. 4. For the purposes of applying Part II of the CBA Act, section 19(2) states that “international carriage” does not include any travel between New Zealand and the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands unless there is an agreed stopping place in another country. This is because these islands are deemed to be part of New Zealand for the purposes of Part II of the CBA Act. These islands are not deemed to be part of New Zealand for the purposes of Part I of the CBA Act or the conventions. In many cases, the question of whether a domestic flight within New Zealand comprises “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act can be answered by reference to the definitions in the Conventions, since most carriage involving two or more countries will be convention carriage under either the Hague Protocol or the Warsaw Convention. In some cases, however, the carriage may involve a place of departure or destination in a country that is not a Convention country. The Commissioner’s view is that the words ‘constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the Carriage By Air Act 1967’ in section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act mean: constitutes “international carriage” for any of the purposes of the Carriage By Air Act 1967. Thus, in cases where the travel involves a place of departure or destination which is not a Convention country, the Commissioner considers that the question of whether a domestic flight within New Zealand comprises part of a contract of “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act can be decided by reference to the section 18 definition. The requirements of “international carriage” under the Conventions and under section 18 are discussed below. Whether or not carriage constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the Warsaw Convention or the Hague Protocol or section 18 will depend fundamentally on whether, according to the agreement or contract between the parties, the parties agree that the places of departure and destination are in two different countries or are in a single country if there is an agreed stopping place in another country. It is, therefore, necessary to ascertain who the “parties” to the agreement are, what the “agreement” between them is, and where the places of departure, destination, and any agreed stopping place are. 9 UNCLASSIFIED The parties to the agreement In applying section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act and determining whether domestic air travel constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act, the Commissioner considers that the parties to the agreement or contract for carriage for the purposes of section 18 of the CBA Act and for the purposes of Article 1(2) of each Convention, are: • The passenger where that passenger (or his or her agent) has arranged the carriage; and • All the carriers that are to provide carriage under the agreement or contract; and where applicable • A person or organisation (not being the passenger or an agent of the passenger) will be a party to the agreement or contract for international carriage where that person or organisation enters into contractual relationships concerning the international carriage of the passenger, e.g. an employer of a passenger where the employer has arranged the carriage. Such a carriage will not be prevented from being “international carriage” simply because the passenger is not a party to the contract: Ross v Pan American Airways 85 NE 2d 880 (1949); Block v Compagnie Nationale Air France 386 F 2d 323 (1967); Bafana & Anor v Commercial Airways (Pty) Limited (1990)(1)(SA)368. The agreement between the parties When determining whether carriage is “international carriage”, it appears that the important factor is what was the contemplation of all the parties who made the agreement or contract for carriage at the time the agreement or contract was made. Layovers and stops, even for extended periods of time, are unimportant if what was originally contemplated by the parties meets the descriptions in Article 1(2) or section 18 – i.e. if the parties originally contemplated that the places of departure and destination would be in different countries or if they originally contemplated that the places of departure and destination would be in the same country but with an agreed stopping place in another country. Carriage which may, from the passenger’s perspective, be part of his or her journey, but which is arranged subsequently will not have been the contemplation of all the parties at the time the original agreement was made, and so may not form part of the original agreement or contract for “international carriage”. (However, depending on whether the subsequent carriage meets the criteria of Article 1(2) or section 18, that subsequent carriage may constitute a new and separate agreement or contract for international carriage.) Multiple airlines There is no requirement in section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act that the air carriage services must be supplied by one supplier. For the purposes of that section, as long as the services supplied constitute “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act, those services are entitled to be zero-rated. Article 1(3) of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol specifically provides for carriage with successive carriers to be treated as international carriage for the 10 UNCLASSIFIED purposes of the convention where the parties have regarded the carriages as one undivided operation. Further, this sub-article provides that the fact that one carrier performs carriage totally within one country does not mean that the wider carriage loses its international character. There is no deeming provision which is similar to Article 1(3) for the purposes of the definition of “international carriage” in section 18. However, in determining whether section 11(2)(aa) applies to domestic air travel, the Commissioner considers that the same treatment will apply to carriage with successive carriers for the purposes of section 18 of the CBA Act as applies for the purposes of Article 1(3). In other words, for the purposes of applying section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act and determining whether domestic air carriage is “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act, carriage which is performed by successive carriers will be regarded as one undivided carriage if it is regarded by all the parties, and in particular the supplier of the domestic air travel services, as part of a single operation for international carriage. In order for successive carriage to be regarded as one undivided carriage, all the carriers must have regarded the flights as a single operation at the time the agreement or contract was made. It is clear from the authorities that if a series of flights was contemplated by one party, but not another, at the time the agreement or contract for carriage was made, the flights with successive carriers could not be viewed as a “single operation”: Karfunkel v Compagnie Nationale Air France 427 F Supp. 971 (1977); Lemley v TWA Inc 807 F 2d 26 (1986). In particular, if a second carrier is organised by the main carrier, or any other person, and the second carrier does not know that its services are part of a larger operation of carriage, its services may not be part of an “undivided carriage”: Stratton v Trans Canada Airlines (1962) 32 DLR 2d. 736. If the second carrier is operating a domestic flight in New Zealand, and does not know any details of the wider air travel arrangements, so that it cannot be said to regard the domestic flight services that it is providing as being part of a “single operation” with the wider arrangements, the domestic flight services will not be part of the “international carriage”. Re-ticketing Re-ticketing can amount either to a variation to the original contract, or to the formation of a new contract. If the re-ticketing merely changes the time or date of the original flight, or the airline with which the passenger is flying, the re-ticketing is likely to be a variation of the original contract. However, when a passenger alters a destination or adds a side-trip, the re-ticketing will amount to a new contract. For example, in Stratton v Trans Canada Airlines (1962) 32 DLR 2d. 736 the passenger booked flights from Seattle to Calgary, via Victoria and Vancouver. The passenger later decided to take a more direct route to Calgary, and booked a direct flight from Seattle to Vancouver (he intended to buy a ticket to Calgary when he arrived in Vancouver). This re-ticketing was a new contract that was not in the parties’ original contemplation at the time that the original arrangements were made. If the re-ticketing amounts to a new contract, rather than a mere variation of the original contract, the new contract will not be part of a “single operation” that the parties contemplated at the start of the agreement. 11 UNCLASSIFIED The new contract will need to be examined to determine whether travel pursuant to it constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. If this is the case, the domestic flights which form part of the new contract will be able to be zero- rated under section 11(2)(aa). Otherwise, the domestic flights under the new contract should be standard rated. If a side-trip which is not part of the original contract is wholly domestic, it will be a separate contract from the original and will not be “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. The side-trip should be standard rated. Place of departure and place of destination Both the conventions and section 18 require the places of departure and destination to be within the territories of two different countries, or within a single country as long as there is an agreed stopping place outside that country. In Grein v Imperial Airways Ltd \[1936\] 2 All ER 1258, Greene LJ discussed the nature of the places of departure and destination. At page 1280 he said: ... every contract of carriage has one place of departure and one place of destination. An intermediate place at which the carriage may be broken is not regarded as a “place of destination”. ... If the contract is for a circular voyage, starting at Berlin, visiting various European capitals, and ending at Berlin, the contractual carriage begins at Berlin and ends at Berlin. And at page 1282 he said: ... the contract by reference to which the place of departure and the place of destination are to be ascertained may be any contract of carriage whether for a single journey, for a circular journey, or for a return journey; that the place of departure the place of destination means the places at which under the particular contract in question the contractual carriage begins and ends. If more than one carrier is involved, the “place of destination” is not the destination of each successive carrier, but is the place where the carriage finally ends according to the intention of the parties. As a final point, it should be noted that travel solely between New Zealand and the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands is considered to be “domestic travel” within New Zealand for the purposes of Part II of the CBA Act 1967. Accordingly, such travel cannot be considered to be “international carriage” under section 18 of that Act. As a result, any air travel within New Zealand that is associated with travel to or from the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands cannot be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act by virtue of section 18 of the CBA Act. In addition, these Islands are not signatories in their own right to the Conventions. Accordingly, one way travel between New Zealand and these Islands is not “international carriage” for the purposes of the Conventions because the places of departure and destination are not both within the territories of parties to Conventions. As a result, any air travel within New Zealand that is associated with one way travel to or from the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands cannot be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act. As an example, a flight from Wellington to Auckland cannot be zero-rated even where there is a single contract of carriage which involves taking the passenger to one of the Islands. 12 UNCLASSIFIED The exception to this is where there is an agreed stopping place located in a country other than New Zealand, Cook Islands, Niue, and the Tokelau Islands. In this case, although this is non-Convention carriage, section 18 of the CBA Act can be applied. Under this section travel from New Zealand to the Islands is considered to be travel within New Zealand. However, if there is an agreed stopping place other than in New Zealand or the Islands, e.g. Australia, this will satisfy the definition of “international carriage” for the purposes of Part II of the CBA Act. However, in the case of circular flights, it is necessary to determine where the places of departure and destination are located. If a circular flight involving travel to the Islands commences and ends in New Zealand, any domestic flight included in the contract of carriage will be “international carriage” for the purposes of the Conventions. This is because New Zealand is a party to the Conventions and the travel is from New Zealand to New Zealand with agreed stopping places outside New Zealand. In this case it does not matter that the agreed stopping place is located in a country that is not a party to the Conventions. If, on the other hand, the circular flight commences and ends in one of the Islands, any domestic flight cannot be considered for zero-rating under section 11(2)(aa) as such travel will not be “international carriage” for any of the purposes of the CBA Act. However, the exception will be where a flight commences from one of the Islands and returns to that Island but there is an agreed stopping place in a country other than New Zealand, Cook Islands, Niue and the Tokelau Islands. In this situation the travel can be “international carriage” under section 18 for the purposes of Part II of the CBA Act. This will satisfy the zero-rating requirements under section 11(2)(aa). The above comments are only applicable in respect of air travel involving the Islands mentioned. If section 19 of the CBA Act had not deemed these Islands to be part of New Zealand, travel that cannot be zero-rated as described above could have been considered to be “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act by virtue of section 18 of that Act. This is the only reason why the Commissioner considers that travel involving these countries is treated differently from travel involving other non- Convention countries. Section 19 of the CBA Act only deems travel to these Islands to be travel within New Zealand “for the purposes of Part II of that Act”. These Islands are not part of New Zealand for the purposes of the definitions contained in the Conventions, nor are these Islands part of New Zealand for the purposes of any other provision in the GST Act. This also means that the actual flight to these Islands can be zero-rated under section 11(2)(a). This is irrespective of the treatment applicable to the domestic flights associated with such travel. The treatment of the domestic flights is linked to the CBA Act and must be considered separately from the actual flight to these Islands. However, this Ruling is concerned with the application of section 11(2)(aa) (not section 11(2)(a)) which involves the zero-rating flight services between two points in New Zealand and whether the “domestic flights” can be considered to be “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. 13 UNCLASSIFIED Comments on technical submissions received The principal submissions received on the first exposure draft focused on travel involving the Cook Islands, Niue, and the Tokelau Islands. However, as discussed in the above commentary, the unique GST treatment arises as a result of provisions contained in the CBA Act. Examples The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to cater for all circumstances that may arise. Example 1 Passenger A is intending on travelling to Australia to attend a wedding. The travel agent arranges air travel from Wellington to Auckland to Sydney. No return flights have been arranged. The tickets are provided to Passenger A in a single book of tickets. Passenger A pays for them in advance. The tickets show that the flights are from Wellington to Auckland to Sydney. Only one airline carrier will undertake to carry Passenger A to Sydney. The airline acknowledges that the flight is an international flight with a connection in Auckland. With respect to the Arrangement contained in the Ruling, it can be determined that: • The travel is by air; • It does involve travel from one place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand, i.e. from Wellington to Auckland; • The places of departure and destination are within the territories of two countries, i.e. New Zealand and Australia respectively; • The factors that indicate that the two flights may be part of a single operation to transport Passenger A from Wellington to Sydney include: • The fact that the flights are arranged together by the travel agent; • The flights are ticketed together and provided in a book of tickets; • The passenger contemplates going to Sydney and not to Auckland. However, all factors surrounding the circumstances of particular passengers must be taken into consideration in forming a view as to what was contemplated by the parties to the contract or agreement. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that all parties contemplate that the travel is to be performed as a single operation. The domestic leg of the journey can be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa). Both New Zealand and Australia are parties to the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol and the journey can be regarded as Convention carriage. In addition, this travel would also satisfy the definition of “international carriage” in section 18 of the CBA Act. Accordingly, the domestic leg of the travel to Australia is “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act and, therefore, the requirements of section 11(2)(aa) are satisfied. 14 UNCLASSIFIED Example 2 Passenger B arranges air travel from Christchurch to Auckland to attend a conference. This is arranged through a travel agent one week prior to the conference. The ticket is booked and paid for. One day before this travel, Passenger B contacts the travel agent again to arrange an additional flight from Auckland to India with a stopover in Singapore. Passenger B believes that the additional flight may as well be taken advantage of as Passenger B will be in Auckland. The second flight is booked by the travel agent and a separate ticket is provided to Passenger B for this flight. The circumstances of Passenger B would suggest that not all the parties have contemplated all the flights to be performed as a single operation. Consequently, these facts do not fall within the Arrangement to which the Ruling applies. There are, prima facie, two separate contracts or agreements that are to be performed independently of each other. Given that all the requirements of the Arrangement contained in the Ruling are not satisfied, the flight from Christchurch to Auckland cannot be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa). Example 3 Passenger C wishes to arrange a holiday tour package involving a return journey from Tokyo, Japan. The tour is to include various New Zealand destinations. Passenger C contacts a local travel agent in Tokyo to arrange the tour package. The Japanese travel agent contacts a New Zealand travel agent to arrange the New Zealand portion of the tour. The tour involves the following: • Flight from Tokyo to Christchurch; • Hotel accommodation in Christchurch for two nights and a sightseeing bus tour around Christchurch; • Flight from Christchurch to Wellington; • Sightseeing tour around Wellington; • Same day flight from Wellington to Hamilton; • Four days of accommodation and sightseeing around the Waikato arranged; • A bus trip to Auckland from Hamilton and a five day stopover there; • Flight from Auckland to Tokyo. All this is arranged as a single package for Passenger C. Several different books of tickets and information are provided to Passenger C, and the flights also involve several airlines. Some airline tickets are issued on domestic ticket stock while others are issued on international stock. However, the domestic tickets are noted that they are issued in conjunction with the international tickets. In respect of the Arrangement contained in the Ruling, the following can be determined from the above: • The package involves more than just airline travel. The bus travel, accommodation and sightseeing services must be ignored when considering zero- rating under section 11(2)(aa). Only the air travel is relevant. 15 UNCLASSIFIED • The package does contain domestic air travel, i.e. from Christchurch to Wellington to Hamilton. • The place of departure and destination can be said to be Tokyo. The carriage commences and ends in Japan. • The package is arranged as a return journey. It is assumed that all the parties, being all the carriers and Passenger C, regard all the air travel as a single operation. The whole operation is arranged as a package and the domestic tickets note that they are issued in conjunction with the international tickets. It is assumed that the international carriers are aware of these domestic flights and consider these flights to be part of the international carriage. These factors are indicative of all the flights being performed as a single operation. However, it is also necessary to be satisfied that all the carriers regard the flights as part of a wider contract or agreement involving international travel, especially given that more than one carrier is involved. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that this is the case. The domestic flights can be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa). Japan, like New Zealand, is a signatory to both the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol. In addition, section 18 could also be applied to treat the carriage as “international carriage”. Accordingly, the domestic leg of the overall travel is “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act and, therefore, the requirements of section 11(2)(aa) are satisfied. Example 4 While in Auckland, Passenger C, in Example 3 above, decides to add a trip from Auckland to Queenstown return before returning to Japan. The travel agent arranges this additional trip and adds it to the tour package. The domestic ticket is noted as being issued in conjunction with the international tickets. This additional trip was not contemplated by all the parties at the time the original package was put together. This additional trip is a separate contract or agreement from the international carriage contract or agreement. Consequently, these facts do not fall within the Arrangement to which the Ruling applies. As this additional trip is purely domestic, it cannot be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa). 16 UNCLASSIFIED APPENDIX 1 Schedule States that are party to the Warsaw Convention Afghanistan Greece Peru Algeria Guinea Philippines Argentina Hungary Poland Australia Iceland Portugal Austria India Qatar Bahamas Indonesia Romania Bangladesh Iran, Islamic Republic of Russian Federation Barbados Iraq Rwanda Belarus Ireland Samoa Belgium Israel Saudi Arabia Benin Italy Senegal Botswana Japan Seychelles Brazil Jordan Sierra Leone Brunei Darussalam Kenya Singapore Bulgaria Kuwait Solomon Islands Burkina Faso Lao People’s Democratic South Africa Cameroon Republic Spain Canada Lebanon Sri Lanka Chile Lesotho Sweden Colombia Libyan Arab Jamahirrya Switzerland Comoros Liechtenstein Syrian Arab Republic Congo Luxembourg Togo Costa Rica Madagascar Tonga Cote d’Ivoire Malaysia Trinidad and Tobago Croatia Mali Tunisia Cuba Maita Turkey Cyprus Mauritania Uganda Democratic People’s Mauritius Ukraine Republic of Korea Mexico United Arab Emirates Denmark Mongolia United Kingdom Dominican Republic Morocco United Republic of Ecuador Myanmar Tanzania Egypt Nauru United States Equatorial Guinea Nepal Uruguay Ethiopia Netherlands, Kingdom of the Vanuatu Federal Republic of New Zealand Venezuela Yugoslavia (Serbia Niger Viet Nam and Montenegro) Nigeria Yemen Fiji Norway Yugoslavia Finland Oman Zaire France Pakistan Zambia Gabon Papua New Guinea Zimbabwe Germany Paraguay 17 UNCLASSIFIED APPENDIX 2 States that are party to the Hague Protocol Afghanistan Guatemala Peru Algeria Guinea Philippines Argentina Hungary Poland Australia Iceland Portugal Austria India Qatar Bahamas Iran, Islamic Republic of Republic of Korea Bangladesh Iraq Romania Belarus Ireland Russian Federation Belgium Israel Rwanda Benin Italy Samoa Brazil Japan Saudi Arabia Bulgaria Jordan Senegal Cameroon Kuwait Seychelles Canada Lao People’s Democratic Singapore Chile Republic Solomon Islands Colombia Lebanon South Africa Congo Lesotho Spain Costa Rica Libyan Arab Jamahirrya Sudan Cote d’Ivoire Liechtenstein Swaziland Croatia Luxembourg Sweden Cuba Madagascar Switzerland Cyprus Malawi Syrian Arab Republic Democratic People’s Malaysia Togo Republic of Korea Mali Tonga Denmark Mauritius Trinidad and Tobago Dominican Republic Mexico Tunisia Ecuador Monaco Turkey Egypt Morocco Ukraine El Salvador Nauru United Arab Emirates Federal Republic of Nepal United Kingdom Yugoslavia (Serbia Netherlands, Kingdom of the Vanuatu and Montenegro) New Zealand Venezuela Fiji Niger Viet Nam Finland Nigeria Yemen France Norway Yugoslavia Gabon Oman Zambia Germany Pakistan Zimbabwe Greece Papua New Guinea Grenada Paraguay

Title Topic Reason for public item Status & next steps PUB00329 GST – Definition of “dwelling” The definition of "dwelling" in s 2 of the GST Act refers to the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, including the requirement that the tenant has quiet enjoyment, as that term is used in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986.

Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2021 1 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Public Statements Service Customer Survey 2021 Context From 4 October to 14 October 2021, Public Rulings and Technical Standards (together referred to as the Public Statements Service) ran a customer survey to identify levels of customer satisfaction and to invite comments on ways in which we can improve our products and services. Public Rulings conducted similar surveys in 2009, 2012, 2015 and 2018. Response rate Thank you to everyone who took part in our survey. The number of responses received was up from 142 in 2018 to 284 in 2021 (but still below the 350 responses in 2015). Overall satisfaction with the service remains high with 85% of respondents rating the service as good or better. However, this is a small drop from 88% in the 2018 survey and a slight trend down from earlier surveys. (The results in the graph below are also shown in a table on page 8). Improvements to our service since the 2018 survey After analysing the results of the 2018 survey, we identified areas in which we wanted to improve. In the report on that survey, we listed the key recommendations for change in specific areas that would improve our performance. 2% 1% 1.4% 1% 2% 12% 10% 7% 11% 13% 41% 30% 28.1% 23% 28% 38% 52% 49.5% 46% 43% 7%7% 13.5% 19% 14% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 20092012201520182021 Overall rating of Inland Revenue's Public Statements service PoorAcceptableGoodVery goodExcellent Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2021 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] We have delivered on most of the recommendations for change. It is disappointing to see a decrease in satisfaction overall but pleasing to see our continued focus on improving our items’ presentation (making things simpler and easier to understand), our efforts to improve our timeliness around getting items advanced and finalised and the attention we give to our consultation process, have resulted in improved scores. The main areas of focus have been: • brevity and clarity • relevance • communication Brevity and clarity We have focused on improving the brevity and clarity of our items by: • the use of fact sheets to accompany draft items and/or as a final product to accompany the finalised item. • the use of appendices for legal analysis where appropriate. • ensuring diagrams and flow charts are increasingly part of the summary section to assist customers. Relevance We have made progress on engagement with the work setting process. We have strengthened our internal connections to better align with Inland Revenue’s areas of focus and priorities. Externally, we routinely ask for suggestions for the work programme and consult directly with industry groups to identify items for the work programme. We have tried to include more borderline examples in our items to provide more certainty where appropriate. This remains an area of focus for us. Communication We have treated internal to Inland Revenue submitters more like our external customers and have seen significant improvements in satisfaction levels. We have made progress in aligning the Public Rulings and Technical Standards processes. Both units now show items out for public consultation in the public fortnightly newsletter, use editorial services and have a single email address for the receipt of submissions. We have a new “highlights” space on the home page of the Tax Technical website. We use this to advise when consultations are about to close and provide other tax technical updates. Highlights from the 2021 survey As noted earlier, there has been a 3% decrease in the overall rating since 2018. There has however been an average increase of 1.6% in positive responses (“sometimes”, “usually”, “always”). Areas that improved are: • items are clearly presented and formatted • items are completed in a timely manner • the opportunity to comment on consultation drafts • our communication during and after consultation Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2021 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • our consideration of feedback on drafts Two areas that maintained a high rating across the 2018 and 2021 surveys are: • relevance and usefulness of our items (98%) • sound technical thinking (98.5%) Areas of focus from the 2021 survey Considering both the scores and the comments, the main areas for focus are: • continuing to focus on the brevity and clarity of our items • continuing to focus on ensuring the relevance and usefulness of our items • how we communicate • timeliness of and approach to consultation • enhancements to the survey itself We have identified specific actions in these areas. Brevity and clarity We aim to: • more routinely provide a fact sheet to accompany our longer or more complex items • more routinely use appendices for legal analysis where this would improve the readability and layering of the information • continue to make the summary section of our items more useful • continue to use diagrams, flowcharts and other visual aids to help people understand our items Relevance and usefulness We aim to: • explore with professional groups how we can broaden participation in identifying work programme items • explore how we can better align the work programme with Inland Revenue’s areas of focus and business priorities eg support compliance campaigns with technical guidance • continue to involve professional bodies and submitters earlier in the process to ensure that our items cover the issues and circumstances of most relevance to them and include real world examples • continue to try to include more borderline examples in our items where this is possible plus use “safe harbours” to raise certainty wherever possible • consider including fuller and deeper analysis of significant opposing views in our items so it is apparent they have been considered and why not agreed to. Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2021 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Communication We aim to: • continue to encourage and support internal staff to submit on drafts • explore providing a “short form” feedback option to external submitters • provide better updates on items that have finished consultation but are yet to be finalised Timeliness We aim to: • revisit internal consultation and how we do this most effectively • smooth out consultation so we are not sending too many items for external consultation at once Survey For subsequent surveys, we will: • review the questions to see if the survey might be shortened • include a guide on time required to complete the survey • explore whether we can capture partially completed survey responses Response highlights The graph below shows the results from the 2015, 2018 and 2021 surveys. We made a few slight changes to the numbering in 2021 and introduced a N/A (not applicable) option. We asked you to rate each of the questions 2-17 on a scale of 1 (never) to 5 (always) with an option of 6 (N/A). The N/A responses were removed and the graph represents the 1 to 5 average ratings as in the past surveys. The 2021 responses for each of the 15 questions are shown in detail in the Appendix . 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 Q2Q3Q4Q5Q6Q7Q8Q9Q10Q11Q13Q14Q15Q16Q17 Average response (out of 5) Questions Comparison of responses - 2015, 2018 and 2021 201520182021 Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2021 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] It should be noted due to renumbering and splitting a past year question that combined both impartial decision making, and the consideration of all arguments and viewpoints into two questions, the previous year’s results are the same for Q5 and Q6. Questions 2, 3, and 8: For many years, the relevancy of our items has been an area identified by Public Rulings as requiring added effort. Although we still score highly here, it appears from the 2021 results that we need to keep up the focus given less of you have selected “always” useful and more have selected “sometimes” useful. Question 4: You continue to rate us high in demonstrating sound technical thinking, research, and analysis. Question 5, 6, and 7: While still maintaining a good rating, we have seen some small decreases in the areas of: • impartial decision making • considering all arguments and views • making our items easy to understand and apply. Of note there has been a small increase in the number of external respondents telling us we are rarely or never impartial. Question 9: We continue to maintain a good rating in removing uncertainty and improving compliance, but you have told us to provide more borderline examples in our items. Question 10: You continue to rate us highly on presentation and format. We expect that this response may reflect the new templates we are using for our items following the launch of our tax technical website. We intend to continue our focus on improving the clarity and brevity of our items. Question 11: The survey shows we are maintaining our level of satisfaction with the timeliness of our items. Your feedback does tell us we need to keep you informed of progress on items consulted on but not yet completed, particularly when there have been delays. Questions 13, 14 and 15: As was the case in previous surveys, you value the opportunity to consult on draft items and the timeframes for responding are about right most of the time. We do however need to work on introducing easier methods for you to provide feedback to us. Questions 16 and 17: There were significant increases in satisfaction with our communication during and after the consultation process and that you feel your feedback is appreciated and fairly considered. We will continue to improve how we inform you of items consulted on but not yet finalised. Further survey information In addition to the 15 questions discussed above, we also asked you about: • how you access our public items • the best things you like about our service Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2021 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • the areas where we need to improve • whether we should issue more public items • the overall rating of our service. We have set out the main themes from your responses in each of those areas below. Additionally, we have summarised the further comments you provided on how we could improve our products and processes. Finally, we show a high-level breakdown of the organisations that you work for. Accessing public items This is now in two parts. Question 18 asked you where you liked to hear and read about consultation drafts and finalised items. Multiple places could be selected. Question 19 (a new question) then asked you to select 1 place you preferred to hear and read about consultation drafts and finalised items. 63% of you prefer the Public Consultation notification emails with links to the items on our tax technical website. 65% of external respondents and 58% of internal respondents chose this option. The best things about our service We were very pleased to receive positive feedback on the items we produce and the way we go about producing them. Although we acknowledge there is still room for improvement, recurring themes in the responses were about: • Brevity / clarity / relevance improving • Certainty / compliance • Communication These themes were also evident in the 2018 survey. Here is a sample of your comments: Your comments “well written, nicely presented. Summaries are generally good, particularly on the very long items.” (External respondent) “Clear, concise and well-researched.” (External respondent) “The guidance provided by these statements is great.  They provide certainty and direction for both staff and the public. The examples within the statements are particularly helpful.” (Internal respondent) “It gives notifications about the various consultations and finalised statements considered and published by IR. Majority of the issues covered are very topical and relevant. The statements themselves are a good form of reference point to refer to clients in instances where they disagree” (External respondent) Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2021 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The areas where we need to improve Even though we received positive comments about the relevance, brevity and clarity of our items, these remain the areas where we also need to continue to improve. A recurring comment was about including examples closer to the line – grey areas – with more of a focus on practical examples. This was also a theme from comments in 2018. You also told us: • we need to engage more with practitioners who operate “in the real world” • to use plain English and reduce the length of items We have noted above several areas of focus that we hope will improve the brevity, clarity and relevance of our items and will continue to focus on recommendations made in earlier surveys. Here is a sample of your comments: Your comments “Try to get more precise. Incorporate broader views of the law - i.e. Public Statements only incorporate an analysis of law, if there was more of a practical "what does this mean in practice" part to the statements this would be helpful - so the advice is more of a "one stop shop" for a particular topic.” (External respondent) “Moving away from black and white examples and also having some "grey area" or trickier ones too.” (External respondent) “C reating documents which can be clearly understood by professionals and general taxpayers.” (Internal respondent) “Real life examples, practical solutions.” (External respondent) “More input from small business that operate in the real world.” (External respondent) “Focuses on more important areas where there is much uncertainty and less on very minor issues.” (External respondent) “Reducing the number of words, \[use\] plain English with clear statements that cannot be misunderstood.” (Internal respondent) Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2021 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Inland Revenue should issue more public rulings and statements 45% of you thought we should issue more rulings and statements provided we are sufficiently resourced to do so without compromising quality. This is up 2% from the 2018 result. 55% answered “No” compared to 43% in 2018. It should be noted only 3% did not offer an answer compared to 14% in 2018 that didn’t know or provided an answer other than yes or no. At this stage there are no plans to increase the number of items – the focus will continue to be on working on the most relevant topics. Overall rating of our service As noted earlier, overall 85% of you rated the service as positive – i.e., either good, very good or excellent. This figure represents a small decrease from 88% in 2018 (91% in 2015 and 89.3% in 2012) and reflects a trending down overall. There was a corresponding increase of 2% of you who considered the service to be only “acceptable” and a 1% increase in those rating the service as “poor”. The results in the table below are also shown graphically on page 1. Year Rating (%) Poor Acceptable Good Very good Excellent 2021 2 13 28 43 14 2018 1 11 23 46 19 2015 1 7 28 49 14 2012 1 10 30 52 7 2009 2 12 41 38 7 Details of survey respondents In terms of the profile of respondents, the 2021 survey shows a different mix from the 2018 survey. The number of Inland Revenue staff has decreased 7% and small to medium tax agents/advisors has decreased 5%. The “small to medium taxpayer” group has gone up 7% and the “other” category has gone up 5%. While there has been some shift in the groups responding, the large taxpayers, agents and advisor’s group has remained fairly constant as has the small to medium sized taxpayers, agents, and advisor group. Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2021 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Conclusion Conducting the customer feedback survey for the fifth time has been a worthwhile exercise. It has again provided Public Rulings and Technical Standards with useful information regarding the current situation and how it has evolved since 2009. The 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2021 surveys have allowed Public Rulings to see if the changes we have made have had the desired impact. For the most part it appears they have. The 2021 results will again assist in continuing to improve our products and services. The standout aspects of the feedback were that you really value the consultation process (and thought that had improved) but the items would be more useful if they addressed grey areas essentially through including more real-world examples.

Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2018 1 UNCLASSIFIED Public Statements Service Customer Survey 2018 Context From 28 November to 7 December 2018, the Public Rulings and Technical Standards units in the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (together referred to as the Public Statements Service) ran a customer survey to identify levels of customer satisfaction and to invite comments on ways in which we can improve our products and services. Public Rulings conducted similar surveys in 2009, 2012 and 2015 (also on the website). Response rate Thank you to everyone who took part in our survey. The number of responses received was down from 350 in 2015 to 142 in 2018, but we were pleased to see 88% of respondents rated the service as good (or better). We were especially pleased with the increase in the proportion of respondents rating the service as excellent. (The results in the graph are also shown in a table on page 7.) Improvements to our service since the 2015 survey After analysing the results of the 2015 survey, we identified areas in which we wanted to improve. In the report on that survey, we listed the key recommendations for change in specific areas that would improve our performance. 2% 1% 1.4% 1% 12% 10% 7% 11% 41% 30% 28.1% 23% 38% 52% 49.5% 46% 7%7% 13.5% 19% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2009201220152018 Overall rating of Inland Revenue's Public Statements service PoorAcceptableGoodVery goodExcellent Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2018 2 UNCLASSIFIED We have delivered on most of the recommendations for change. We consider that in addressing these matters we have improved the service we provide to both the wider Inland Revenue organisation and taxpayers generally. The satisfaction ratings received in the 2018 survey indicate some improvement has been achieved. The main areas of focus have been: • brevity and clarity • relevance • communication Brevity and clarity We have focused on improving the brevity and clarity of our items by: • making the Q&A section of our QWBA items, and the summary of interpretation statements, clearer and more standalone • continuing to use plain English writing and techniques in our items • increasing the use of flowcharts, diagrams and illustrations in our items. Relevance We have focused on expanding the explanation section of the work programme to include the reason we are undertaking an item. We have also sought wider input to the work programme. We include a section at the top of our QWBA items explaining who might find the item relevant. We have tried to include more borderline examples in our items to provide more certainty where appropriate. This remains an area of focus for us. Communication We have treated internal submitters more like our external customers and have seen significant improvements in satisfaction levels. We have made progress in aligning the Public Rulings and Technical Standards processes. Both units now show items out for public consultation in the public fortnightly newsletter, use editorial services and have a single email address for the receipt of submissions. We have successfully used the “short form” feedback option for external customers on occasion. Highlights from the 2018 survey There have been pleasing increases in the percentage of positive responses (“sometimes”, “usually”, “always”) for: • the relevance and usefulness of items • how frequently items are used • the relevance of items to respondents’ tax situations • the frequency of respondent comments on draft items • our communication during and after consultation • our consideration of feedback on drafts. Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED Areas of focus from the 2018 survey The areas for improvement continue to relate to: • the brevity and clarity of some items • the relevance and usefulness of some items • how we communicate We have identified specific actions in these areas that we will aim to progress or implement. Brevity and clarity We aim to: • provide a fact sheet to accompany our longer items where appropriate • use appendices for legal analysis where appropriate • make the summary section of our items more useful. Relevance and usefulness We aim to: • explore with CA ANZ and other industry groups how we can encourage smaller accountancy firms and sole advisers to identify work programme items • invite suggestions for the work programme in our fortnightly newsletter • explore how we can better align the work programme with Inland Revenue’s areas of focus • include updates to the work programme in a different colour to make them more obvious • continue to try to include more borderline examples in our items where this would be helpful and not imprudent for the Commissioner to do so • consider including fuller and deeper analysis of opposing views in our items, where appropriate. Communication We aim to: • include a “what’s new” section at the beginning of our fortnightly newsletter with names of new items hyperlinked to help customers go directly to what they are interested in • routinely provide the online “short form” feedback option to external customers • align the Public Rulings and Technical Standards processes • work with Inland Revenue’s Information and Intelligence Services to reorganise the tax technical material on Inland Revenue’s website. Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED Response highlights The graph below shows the results from the 2009, 2012, 2015 and 2018 surveys. We asked you to rate each of 14 questions on a scale of 1 (never) to 5 (always). The graph compares the average rating received by the question in 2018 with the equivalent ratings in 2015, 2012 and 2009. The 2018 responses for each of the 14 questions are shown in detail in the Appendix. Questions 1, 2, and 6: We were pleased to see increases in the regular use of our items and their usefulness and relevance for you and your clients. Questions 3, 4, and 5: We have made slight improvements in the areas of: • demonstrating sound technical thinking, research and analysis • making impartial decisions and considering all arguments and views • making our items easy to understand and apply. Of particular note is the shift upwards in the percentage of responses from the “sometimes” category to the “usually” and “always” categories from internal respondents. Question 7: There was a slight decrease in perceptions that our items remove uncertainly and improve compliance. We will continue to try to include more borderline examples where appropriate. Question 8: You told us that we have maintained our focus on producing items that are clearly presented and formatted. We intend to continue our focus on improving the clarity and brevity of our items. Question 9: The survey shows an increased level of satisfaction with the timeliness of our items. In particular, we continually try to decrease the time between external consultation and publication of our items as we know that if this period extends out it can create uncertainty for taxpayers and advisers. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 Q1Q2Q3Q4Q5Q6Q7Q8Q9Q10Q11Q12Q13Q14 Average response (out of 5) Questions Comparison of responses -2009, 2012, 2015 and 2018 2009201220152018 Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2018 5 UNCLASSIFIED Questions 10, 11 and 12: As was the case in previous surveys, consultation is still highly valued by you. Further, your responses suggest that our 4- to 6-week timeframes for consultation is adequate. We were pleased to see a slight increase in the average response for submissions made. We will make it easier for externals to provide feedback to us by routinely including the online “short form” feedback option. Questions 13 and 14: There were increases in satisfaction with how we communicate through the consultation process and consider feedback. This was particularly true of internal respondents. We will continue to include analysis of opposing views in our items where appropriate. Further survey information In addition to the 14 questions discussed above, we also asked you about: • how you access our public items • the best things you like about our service • the areas where we need to improve • whether we should issue more public items • the overall rating of our service. We have set out the main themes from your responses in each of those areas below. Additionally, we have summarised the further comments you provided on how we could improve our products and processes. Finally, we show a high-level breakdown of the organisations that you work for. Accessing public items Most of you preferred the Public Consultation email or e-newsletter for hearing about and accessing consultation drafts and finalised items. About a third of you preferred Inland Revenue’s website or the Tax Information Bulletin which is available online as a PDF on the website. We will continue to support multiple ways of accessing public items. The best things about our service We were very pleased to receive positive feedback on the items we produce and the way we go about producing them. Although we acknowledge there is still room for further improvement, recurring themes in the responses were about: • Brevity / clarity / relevance • Certainty / compliance • Communication These themes were also evident in the 2015 survey. Here is a sample of your comments: Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2018 6 UNCLASSIFIED The areas where we need to improve The two main areas in which you suggested we needed to improve, from most to least important, were: • brevity, clarity and relevance • communication. Your two main concerns regarding brevity, clarity and relevance were: • the length and accessibility of items • that examples tended to deal with scenarios where the outcome was clear cut rather than scenarios with less clear outcomes. We have noted above several recommendations that we hope will improve the brevity, clarity and relevance of our items and will continue to focus on recommendations made in earlier surveys. Comments about communication concerned the ability to self-select topics to be notified about and improvements to the technical area of Inland Revenue’s website. We are aiming to make improvements to our fortnightly newsletter to help you go directly to the topics you are interested in. We will also be working with Inland Revenue’s Information and Intelligence Services to improve the website. Here is a sample of your comments: Your comments “They are well laid out with the basis for the view usually well documented, even if you don't agree with it!” “Clear and easy to understand.” “More certainty for us and clients.” “Having a CIR’s position on various matters which is available publicly.” “They value my feedback and are willing to discuss the issues with me after the feedback is given.” “Transparency of what is on the work programme and the indicative timeframes. Great team of people who are always happy to talk about items / submission points.” Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2018 7 UNCLASSIFIED Inland Revenue should issue more public rulings and statements About half of you thought we should issue more rulings and statements provided we are sufficiently resourced to do so without compromising quality. And half of you thought we already issue the right number of public rulings and statements. Overall rating of our service Your responses show a slight decrease in the overall rating of our service. However, the percentage of you rating the service as a 4 (very good) or 5 (excellent) increased from 45% in 2009 to 59% in 2012 to 63% in 2015 to 65% in 2018.

We will continue our work to align our processes and ensure this is as seamless as possible for submitters to and users of our material. Your comments “I think they are a bit long winded. I wonder if all the detail of how they got to the position is really needed - most of us want a clear answer and a brief understanding of why that is the answer. I often find the examples used only cover obvious situations but leave no guidance on the more complex or contentious situations. We don't need guidance on obvious situations.” “The executive summary is a bit too long sometimes. The contents sometimes try to avoid the "too hard basket" scenarios, which reduce the usefulness of the item.” “Make it more readable and easier to understand.” “Sometimes the explanations need to be less focused on the Taxation Specialists and more on the general public /small business operators.” “Better indexing and search capability via IRD website.” “Allow recipients of notifications to self-select topics they wish to be notified about.” Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2018 8 UNCLASSIFIED Details of survey respondents The 2018 survey showed a similar organisation profile for respondents to the 2015 survey if the small to medium sized taxpayer and small to medium tax agent/advisor are considered together. While the split between Inland Revenue staff members and external survey respondents was 39:61 in 2015, this changed to 43:57 in 2018. Conclusion Conducting the customer feedback survey for the fourth time has been a worthwhile exercise. It has again provided Public Rulings, and now Technical Standards, with useful information regarding the current situation and how it has evolved since 2009. The 2012, 2015 and 2018 surveys have allowed Public Rulings to see if the changes we have made have had the desired impact. For the most part it appears they have. It is clear the 2018 results will again assist us in continuing to improve our products and services. 7% 39% 5% 7% 2% 26% 14% 5% 43% 6% 6% 0% 33% 7% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Employee of large tax agent/advisor Inland Revenue staff member Large corporate taxpayer Other (please specify) Principal at large tax agent/advisor Small to medium sized tax agent/advisor Small to medium taxpayer Survey respondents 20152018 Public Rulings customer feedback survey 2018 9 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix: Responses to questions 1 to 14 1 Never 2 Rarely 3 Sometimes 4 Usually 5 Always Total Q1.

The paper does not propose to examine the interaction of the tax and welfare systems. As a consequence the analysis of efficiency and productivity will be partial and incomplete. The interaction of the tax and welfare systems (mostly abatement rate impacts) creates very high effective marginal tax rates. In some instances well above 100% when the costs of work are considered. These high EMTR’s are partly responsible for high rates of opting out of the workforce and welfare costs. Any consideration of personal income tax must consider the actual effective marginal tax rates that individuals face. 2. Company tax rate consideration does not take into account NZ’s highly restrictive foreign direct investment regime or low levels of productivity. As a consequence the analysis will not effectively address the optimal tax base question. Low levels of foreign direct investment, poor international connectivity and a high rate of company taxation are very clearly a major contributor to New Zealand’s poor productivity. Consideration of the company tax rate should take account of the difficulty of and return on investing in New Zealand. I hope that your work considers land tax – it was recommended by the VUW Tax Working Group in 2010 as a means of funding tax rate reductions and improving overall efficiency of the tax system (p67; https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf ) Regards Andrew Body s 9(2)(a) s 9(2) (a) External Email CAUTION: Please take CARE when opening any links or attachments.

Personal Submission by Dr Andrew Coleman. October 4 2024. 1. This is a personal submission. I am currently employed by the Asia School of Business (Kuala Lumpur) as a visiting professor while on leave from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for six months. The views expressed in this submission do not reflect the views of either of my employers. As an academic at the University of Otago I taught an advanced public finance course that focused on taxation and retirement income issues between 2017 and 2020. I have subsequently taught courses on taxation for the Government Economics Network. One focus of this material is the differences between New Zealand’s tax system and the tax systems used in most other OECD countries. A second focus is the differences between income and consumption bases for taxation. A third focus is the relative merits of different ways of funding public and private retirement incomes. In recent years I have undertaken considerable research on the economic effects of the New Zealand tax and retirement income systems. Much of this research has been published in New Zealand and Australian journals including the ‘Economic Record’, ‘Australian Economic Papers’, and ‘New Zealand Economic Papers’. Some of this research was commissioned by the IRD for the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group (2010) and the Tax Working Group (2018). Other papers have been published as working papers by Motu Economics and Public Policy, the University of Otago, the New Zealand Treasury, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Much of the research was informed by the results from a sequence of overlapping generations models incorporating housing, heterogeneous agents, and detailed descriptions of the tax system that was developed to examine the incidence of New Zealand’s tax and retirement income policies. A list of some of these papers is appended to the end of this submission. 2. The IRD document is welcome. I am very much looking forward to the results of the proposed IRD work programme as it should throw considerable light onto several unresolved issues concerning the economic consequences of New Zealand’s current tax system. 3. As the document indicates, New Zealand has one of the most unusual tax systems in the OECD. I agree with the characterization of New Zealand’s system in paragraph 7, and have frequently made identical points in my own papers and lectures. In particular, I think it is accurate to characterize the NZ tax system as being unusual for the following reasons. • New Zealand does not use social security taxes to fund retirement incomes. • New Zealand has relatively low taxes on labour incomes, primarily because it does not have social security taxes. • New Zealand has relatively high taxes on companies and corporates. • Unlike most OECD countries, where capital income is taxed at lower rates than labour incomes, the relative size of taxes on capital and labour income is ambiguous in New Zealand, sometimes lower, sometimes the same, and sometimes higher. In principle, most capital and labour incomes are taxed at the same rates, in part due to the imputation system, but there are exceptions due to PIES and because the corporate tax rate is lower 2 than the top personal tax rate. Real interest incomes are also taxed at much higher rates than most other incomes when there is inflation. However, I think the document accurately describes the overall tax position in New Zealand, and it does note that is unusual not to attempt to tax capital income at lower rates than labour income. 4. In sections 9, 12, and 13 the document notes that it is likely that tax receipts will need to increase over time because of population ageing and long term demographic trends. This characterization seems accurate, and has been a focus of my own research for some time (Coleman 2014a, 2016, 2017). This observation, combined with the observation in paragraph 7 about the lack of social security taxes in New Zealand, suggests that a key focus of the IRD work programme should be the tax systems used in New Zealand to fund retirement incomes. 5. In the rest of this submission I would like to make comments some issues that the IRD may wish to consider more fully as it begins this work programme. Most of these issues concern • the ways that retirement incomes are funded and are taxed; • the links between consumption and income taxes; • the progressivity or otherwise of consumption taxes; • the taxation of real interest income. Many of these comments are based on my earlier research, particularly Coleman (2017, 2019, 2024). The first of these papers was written at the New Zealand Treasury but subsequently published by Motu Economics and Public Policy; the second was written as the basis for a submission made to the Tax Working Group and which was published as Coleman 2019; and the third paper was presented to the New Zealand Treasury in March this year as part of a discussion about potential reform of the retirement and tax systems. This article is the basis for a series of 13 articles published by New Zealand’s leading online business newspaper “Interest.co.nz” between July and September 2024. 6. The IRD document does not adequately cover indirect expenditure taxes of the type introduced by Fisher (1937) and discussed at length by Kaldor (1955) and many subsequent authors and tax inquiries including Meade (1978) and Mirrlees et al (2010). 1 Fisher pointed out that since an income tax taxes income when it is first earned, but a consumption tax taxes income when it is spent, a government implicitly taxes consumption if it taxes income net of savings. Since the 1960s a majority of OECD governments including all G-7 countries have utilized this insight and applied a standard progressive “income tax” to a base that is “income net of savings made in specialized retirement income accounts”. By doing this they have partially converted a progressive income tax into a progressive consumption tax because the time when tax is paid on the portion of a person’s income that is saved in these accounts is delayed in a manner similar to the delay that occurs when a country utilizes an indirect consumption tax such as a VAT. Most OECD countries apply this form of tax by taxing savings placed in specified retirement income accounts on an EET (Exempt-Exempt-Taxed) basis. 1 The last two documents are the comprehensive United Kingdom tax reviews chaired by the two Nobel prize winning economists James Meade and James Mirrlees. 3 New Zealand taxed retirement savings placed in specified retirement income accounts on this basis prior to 1989. However, it changed its approach in 1989 when it began to tax all retirement savings on a TTE (Taxed, Taxed, Exempt) basis. By making this change, which no other countries have copied, New Zealand has rejected an approach which enables many countries to implement progressive consumption taxes. The IRD document explicitly discusses its interest in finding ways to make a VAT style expenditure tax progressive. Consequently, it is very strange that there is no discussion at all in the document of the usual “Fisherian” way that most OECD countries adopt progressive consumption taxes. This oversight should should be rectified. It is noteworthy that the 2010 Mirrlees Report discusses this issue at length and support the continued use of EET taxation in the United Kingdom because it. 2 The choice of TTE rather than EET taxation has been discussed in many official documents including the 2018 Tax Working Group since the change was made in New Zealand in 1989. Yet these discussions are far from compelling, possibly because it appears neither the lead advising agencies (the IRD and the NZ Treasury) have models suitable for analysing the distributional consequences of the two alternative tax methods once the effects on housing markets are taken into account. Moreover, the analysis of the different consequences of TTE and EET taxation tend to ignore the different ways that inflation affects real effective tax rates on different classes of assets under the two systems. These omissions are unfortunate, because standard international analysis suggests that the EET taxation of retirement income savings (i) reduces the distortionary effects of inflation on the taxation of different assets, particularly debt and equity claims and (ii) reduces the distortionary effects of taxation on the incentive to own owner-occupied housing when it is taxed on a TEE basis. 3 Given the analysis of Kaldor 1955, and noting that residential housing is by far the largest asset class in New Zealand, it is quite likely that the relative merits of EET and TTE taxation principles applied to retirement savings are very different than has been postulated in New Zealand when inflation and housing are taken into account. For these reasons, I recommend i. The IRD extend its analysis concerning the possibility of introducing progressive consumption taxes to include the possibility of EET taxation of retirement income accounts, which is the standard way that progressive consumption taxes are adopted in most OECD countries. ii. That it undertakes this analysis explicitly taking into account the way current taxation results in very different real effective tax rates on debt and equity instruments when there is inflation. iii. That it undertakes its analysis of the relative merits of the TTE and EET taxation explicitly taking into account the likely effects on residential housing markets. 7. The IRD document makes little mention of inflation. It is first mentioned in paragraph 54, largely in the context of fiscal drag. As the IRD has previously observed, the New Zealand government 2 For example see the chapter by Banks and Diamond in Mirrlees 2010. 3 It is noteworthy that the primary advisory document supporting the change to TTE taxation in 1989 (New Zealand Government 1988) did not even analyse the relative effects of taxing retirement savings on a TTE rather than EET basis system on New Zealand’s largest asset class, residential housing, even though this was one of the key aspects of Kaldor’s 1955 analysis. 4 applies income taxes to nominal rather than real interest payments and by doing so it induces a large distortion into the taxation of capital earnings when inflation is non-zero. The document also notes that New Zealand has a very heavy reliance on income taxes because it does not have social security taxes, so these distortions may be worse in New Zealand than other countries. Since expenditure and income taxes behave very differently in an inflationary environment, the proposed work programme suggested in the IRD document should explicitly discuss how a change in the tax bases will affect the taxation of different capital income instruments, particularly debt and equity instruments. 8. The document has very little discussion of compulsory saving schemes as an alternative to social security taxes. In some countries such as Australia, a compulsory saving scheme is a direct substitute for a contributory retirement income scheme funded from social security taxes, and as such it probably should be considered as an alternative to social security taxes. In these countries, the compulsory saving scheme reduces taxes and the size of government expenditure, and the New Zealand Government may find it attractive for these reasons. An income tax scheme that is used to fund retirement incomes is more distortionary than either a compulsory saving scheme that is used to fund retirement incomes or a social security scheme that is used to fund retirement incomes because (i) it is applied to capital earnings as well as labour earnings and capital earnings are widely considered to be more susceptible to taxation distortions than labour incomes and (ii) the size of retirement income benefits is linked to compulsory saving contributions or social security taxes so these contributions or taxes have greater incentive compatibility than income taxes applied to labour incomes (Disney 2004; Börsch-Supan and Cole 2020). 4 Coleman 2024 discusses a particular form of a compulsory saving scheme that replicates many of the payment features of New Zealand superannuation, but which has many advantages including less distortionary taxation, reduced inequality (in part because social security balances are bequeathable) and higher returns in a dynamically efficient economy. It is noticeable that the graph in paragraph 70 showing income, consumption and social security taxes does not have an allowance for compulsory savings schemes. While it is true than a compulsory saving scheme is not a tax, to the extent they are used to directly reduce government expenditure they are close substitutes for a tax and pension system and there is a case for including them in a second graph to show their effect in the countries that use them such as Australia. 9. In chapter 3, the IRD document proposes discussing the progressivity of a VAT system in its future research. I think this is a very good idea, but I was surprised that there was no discussion of either the Hall-Rabushka flat tax proposal, or the Bradford X-tax proposal. 5 Both of these proposals outline how a VAT system can be made progressive. The Hall Rabushka proposal is nicely summarized in the book “Taxing Ourselves” by Joel Slemrod and Jon Bakija; in brief, they propose that firms pay GST on wages as well as other inputs, and deduct them from their GST 4 In paragraph 74 it is stated the social security contributions and payroll taxes “have a similar effect to income taxes on wages and salaries, although they are generally linked to an entitlement to receive a future social benefit.” I am curious about the literature on which this claim is based, and would be obliged if the IRD could document it as I have been unable to find many empirical studies on the topic. 5 I was surprised because both topics are standard in the literature and included in many undergraduate tax courses. 5 receipts; the wage earners then pay tax at the same GST rate on their incomes, less a tax free allowance. This process converts the tax system to a progressive consumption tax. Bradford’s scheme is similar. Bakija (2024) notes that not only is the big question facing tax authorities in most countries “ whether we should move the tax system more in the direction of a consumption tax” (p56) but that “ a consumption tax can be made as progressive as the current income tax (for example, by using the X-tax approach suggested by Bradford 1986), while removing the negative impact of the tax system on incentives to save and invest.” (p56). In short these schemes for creating a progressive VAT exist and are widely discussed in the literature. Modern technology means there are means available to make a VAT tax system progressive that have not previously been available. In 2021, I circulated a proposal written at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand designed to make a VAT system progress via the use of modern payments systems (Coleman 2021). In this proposal, commercial banks would collect the amount of GST paid on their customer’s purchases as well as the purchase price. If this were done, it would be possible to refund part of the GST payment to a person if a government so desired. In this manner, technology would allow a VAT system to be progressive by the simple expedient of sending refunds to low income (or low consumption) people. The technology for this type of arrangement can be easily created (or so I am told by people working in advanced “Fin tech” payments systems). This proposal is related to the Hall- Rabushka flat tax plan, but could also be used to allow countercyclical tax collections as a supplement to monetary policy. Other designs are possible and I hope that the IRD work programme considers them. 10. Overall, I think the direction of the work programme suggested by the IRD document is very good. For a long time it has been apparent that New Zealand’s tax system is very different from the tax systems used in most OECD countries, with low taxes on labour incomes and high taxes on corporate incomes. These choices, which date back to the adoption of National Superannuation in 1977 following the scrapping of the 1974 compulsory saving scheme, have largely been ignored for 30 years. 6 It is important that the implications of these choices are investigated, to see if the tax system adopted in the second half of the twentieth century is still fit for purpose in the twenty-first century. 6 See Overbye 1997. 6 References.

Looks like a valuable and timely issue to look at. Three thoughts: Consider a wider range of drivers of change It should look at wider factors which will affect NZ's fiscal future in addition to pension and health costs. As a minimum this should include the direct and indirect impacts of climate change. Direct impacts include factors such as increasing costs to protect infrastructure and consideration of distribution of costs when an area is affected by an event or an individual looses assets through an event or adaptation (such as managed retreat from flooding). It should also consider the indirect effects - such as the possibility of mass immigration as increasing numbers of people are displaced internationally. It should also consider and the impact on the shape of NZ's future economy of climate change and other drivers of change such as AI. Consider central and local government The work also consider the balance between central and local government - in terms of responsibilities and ability to raise money Use the 3 horizon model The work should use the 3 horizons model - so it considers the short medium and long term implications of decisions. Join up with the Treasury's LTIB to understand the implication of shocks on the tax system Finally - you need to consider the implication of shocks on the tax system and as such to connect with the work of the Treasuries LTIB.

Sir / Madame 1) I believe that overtime above 40 hours weekly should NOT be taxed. The productivity gained for NZ and the resultant GST income from increased spending would counterbalance the loss of overtime taxation. 2) If it was possible to increase GST moderately and direct that percentage directly to a NZ superannuation fund would have the advantage of being a cross nation taxation. I disagree that low income would suffer more because high spenders would pay more . 3) If a GST increase was unacceptable then; A consumption tax from bank account transactions directly for Superannuation and medical intervention Health Insurance would be positive. 4) NZ has to remove wasteful , nonproductive spending and be merciless in this regard throughout ALL Government departments . I believe eliminating all NZ Budget appropriations that are directed only to Maori & Pacific Islanders should be law and prepare the nation as equals .

NZ is one of the few OECD countries without any form of inheritance tax. On top of that, baby boomers are one of the wealthiest generations ever, and there will be a huge transfer of wealth over the next decades. Cheers Bianca s 9(2)(a) 1 Submission to the Inland Revenue Department (IR) on: Our tax system: Bases and regimes. Consultation on the scope of Inland Revenue’s Long-Term Insights Briefing 2024-25 4 October 2024 2 Tax Justice Aotearoa Submission on the scope of IR’s Long-Term Insights Briefing 2024-25 Summary of recommendations Recommendation See paragraphs a. IR’s proposed approach to the LTIB of considering what broad structure of the tax system would be most suitable for the future, focusing on tax bases and income and consumption tax regimes, is a plausible one, with some caveats (see following recommendations), if it is taking into account major international and local trends which will put stress on the system. 3-5 b. The tax and transfer systems should be seen as one system. We strongly encourage IR to consider a joint review for a future LTIB and to work with MSD on the interactions between the two systems for the present LTIB. 6-7 c. Use of the term “burden” to refer to taxes is inappropriate, particularly for a government agency, as it takes a particular view of taxation as being unequivocally negative. 8-11 d. There are longer-term impacts of the tax system than on the individual taxpayers’ incomes and short-term economic growth, such as the quality of our education system and public infrastructure. The analysis of the economic impacts of the tax system should incorporate such longer-term impacts and consider the level of revenue required as well as different types of tax. In addition, it should consider the impacts on economic and community resilience. 11-14 e. We are pleased that consideration of alternative tax bases including land, wealth (including capital gains) and inheritances will be in scope. We submit that corrective taxes should be included. 15-17 f. We recommend that there be a greater emphasis on the distributional impacts of the tax system in the LTIB. 18 g. We comment on the background information regarding the relationship between taxes on company and labour income, and on the level of tax revenue in New Zealand and propose different approaches to assessing these which we recommend IR incorporates in its analysis. 19-35 Introduction 1. We welcome the good practice that IR is consulting on the scope of its Long-Term Insights Briefing (LTIB), and we have benefited from speaking directly to some of those who are involved in its development. We are disappointed however that it appears that most of the decisions about scope appear to have been made, leaving only marginal aspects susceptible to change. 2. We would be happy to discuss any of the matters raised in the submission. 3 3. IR summarises its approach to the LTIB on p.48 of its consultation paper (Inland Revenue, 2024) as follows: 160. ... Inland Revenue is proposing that the next LTIB focuses on considering what broad structure of the tax system would be most suitable for the future. We propose to look at the broad structure of the tax system by focusing on two elements: tax bases and income and consumption tax regimes. 161. Our aim is to enable open discussion on the challenges that our tax system faces and possible options to address these challenges. 162. We will approach this topic by undertaking four main pieces of work: • Developing an analytical framework, including an economic framework to understand the effects of taxes on income and expenditure. • Considering the pros and cons of alternative income tax regimes and enhancements to our current income tax regimes. • Considering the literature on the design of alternative consumption tax regimes and approaches to low-income offsets to consumption tax rate increases. • Considering the pros and cons of new tax bases. 163. These work areas will be used to assess options for New Zealand 4. This is a plausible and useful approach to take, subject to some caveats below. We agree that New Zealand, and thus our tax system, must be ready to address some major international and local trends including a. Demographic changes, including an aging population, a rapidly growing population, mainly due to high rates of net immigration, a Māori population which is growing in both size and confidence, and an increasingly diverse population. These will require increasing investment and operational expenditure on infrastructure, social services, workforce skills and capacity, and social support. They will demand sensitivity to equity, cultural, and partnership expectations. b. Rapidly changing technology, including but not limited to Artificial Intelligence (AI). This brings both opportunities, which may need government involvement and investment to realise, and disruption which is likely to require government support to assist people through change in order to ensure people do not feel they are losers from change and to protect social cohesion. c. Climate change, which will require outlays to reduce New Zealand’s carbon emissions and to mitigate the effects of the impacts of climate change including storms, droughts and rising sea levels. It will require assisting people through change – a Just Transition. d. Geopolitical change, in the fields of both commercial and political/military relationships. Trade relationships are changing, and political relationships are increasingly difficult to navigate. Many impacts on New Zealand are and will be beyond our control. These will reinforce a growing emphasis on resilience rather than primarily efficiency, which has been noted internationally, and a need to diversify our production and our markets which on past experience will not happen without active, strategic government involvement. 4 e. Well documented weakness in productivity performance which must be addressed to provide for rising living standards and to stem the flow of young New Zealanders overseas. This too will require diversification and changes to the structure of the economy. Success will require coherent government strategies and investment, and stronger investment and business performance in the private sector. f. Persistent high inequality (compared to other countries in the OECD) threatening social cohesion, including unacceptable rates of poverty and low rates of taxation of wealthy individuals compared to average effective tax rates. These require improved government programmes, income support and changes to the tax system. In the current context, it underlines the importance of the distributional function of the tax system. 5. While the consultation paper has traversed some of these, all have implications for revenue, and for the forms and structure of our tax system. They may require changes that range from tweaks, such as depreciation rates, to major changes, such as wealth taxes. Some comments on the scope The tax and transfer systems should be seen as one system 6. Poverty and the need to assist people through change raise an important structural issue: that the tax system and the transfer system (including benefits and tax credits) are interlinked and impact upon each other. Social support is carried out through either or both the social welfare system and the tax system. Progressivity of taxation and effective marginal tax rates are impacted by both systems, with implications for fairness, inequality and poverty (as analyses of disposable income inequality such as by the OECD 1 or Treasury (e.g. Wright & Nguyen, 2024) illustrate). 7. The many reviews New Zealand governments have carried out into the tax and the social welfare systems in the last 2-3 decades have in every case been siloed. The issues this raises include both fairness and effectiveness as described in the previous paragraph, and that administration by multiple departments adds complexity for both administration of the system and people needing assistance. A review that considers them as a whole is well overdue. We recognise that this would require at least IR and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to work together if a review took the form of an LTIB. It is unfortunate that there appear to be substantial difficulties in government departments working together on a LTIB. In addition, IR appears to have decided on the current topic. We strongly encourage IR to consider a joint review for a future LTIB and to work with MSD on the interactions between the two systems for the present LTIB. Terminology 8. In more than a dozen places in the consultation paper, IR uses the term “tax burden”. Paragraph 7, p.4 for example, states “Consequently, most OECD countries have a higher tax burden on employee labour income than New Zealand.” 9. We consider this inappropriate, particularly for a government agency, as it takes a particular view of taxation as being unequivocally negative. In fact, as IR is well aware, 1 E.g. https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/income-inequality.html 5 taxation is the way a nation ensures it can provide the services and support a society needs to thrive and prosper. Higher taxation as a proportion of GDP is associated with higher income countries 2 . As living standards – and expectations of government – have risen, so has the rate of taxation. As countries have developed, societies have become more complex and challenges have increasingly required or benefited from national or international solutions. To refer to taxation as a “burden” buys into a viewpoint that it is solely a cost to those paying it, ignoring the benefits they receive – individually or as part of a community. 10. This of course does not mean we should not try to optimise the forms of taxation used and the tax system’s composition, taking the incidence of the different forms into account. 11. As the consultation paper acknowledges in the section on “Tax and growth” starting on p.44, these factors do highlight that the tax system has wider impacts than on the individual taxpayer’s income and short-term economic growth: the long run benefits of a good education system, health system, social support system, legal system, public housing, transport, utilities and other infrastructure may be difficult to measure precisely – particularly given their effects are often long term. But they are crucial to the development of a society. The fact that higher income countries tend to raise and spend higher tax revenues as a proportion of GDP strongly suggests that on average that spending has been beneficial. Economic analysis 12. We hope that the analysis of the economic impacts of the tax system promised for the LTIB will incorporate the longer term and wider impacts noted in the previous paragraph (and at paragraph 142 of the consultation paper) rather than focusing solely on short term impacts on fiscal measures and economic growth. 13. Given that increased revenue will be needed, as the paper acknowledges, an increased level of tax revenue is an important matter to consider in the LTIB as well as the impacts of different types of tax. 14. We noted at 4.d that internationally there is a growing emphasis on resilience rather than primarily efficiency. We suggest that this should be one of the factors included in addition to those listed in paragraph 149 of the paper. Types of taxes in scope 15. We are pleased that consideration of alternative tax bases including land, wealth and inheritances will be in scope. We consider that capital is undertaxed in New Zealand leading to growing wealth inequality (including intergenerational) with accompanying inequities in the exercise of political and economic p o w e r. The taxation of wealth (including capital gains) provides both a potential new revenue base and a corrective to growing inequality. 16. We are disappointed that the proposed scope does not include corrective taxes. While we understand that this would increase the effort required from IR, we consider that the use of such taxes will only increase, given increasing awareness and urgency of problems such as 2 See for example Our World in Data at https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/tax-revenues-vs-gdp-per- capita?time=1986..2022 “ Tax revenues as a share of GDP vs. GDP per capita, 1986 to 2022”; and Hall (2014). 6 climate change and other environmental impacts; obesity; alcohol, tobacco and other drug use; gambling; congestion; and excess profits resulting from lack of competition. In all cases, corrective taxes are either in use or have been proposed. Some, consistent with the proposed focus of the LTIB, are substantial revenue raisers, and as observed in the previous paragraph, some tax bases that IR is proposing to include also have a corrective aspect. While well designed corrective taxes may be useful in addressing their targets, they have side effects such as some being regressive. Their design and use will become increasingly important and, if poorly designed, increasingly contentious for the wrong reasons. In addition they may act as a substitute for other forms of revenue raising, allowing the other forms to be used to fund needed services rather than to mitigate problems which corrective taxes address. Similarly there are interactions with user-pays levies which apparently are also not in scope. 17. We urge IR to reconsider the omission of corrective taxes from the LTIB. Distributional impacts 18. We recommend that there be a greater emphasis on the distributional impacts of the tax system. One of the purposes of a tax system (identified for example by the 2018 Tax Working Group) is redistribution, and we would expect that to be a significant aspect of the LTIB’s analysis and recommendations. The discussion in the consultation paper is brief (mainly in paragraphs 55-64), but Figure 8 does identify an important feature and failing of the New Zealand tax system, that it is only very weakly progressive, the main work being done by the income support system and government expenditure on public services. Comments on the background information The relationship between taxes on company and labour income 19. The consultation paper suggests (e.g. paragraph 7, p.4, and p.27ff) that New Zealand’s corporate income tax rates are high relative to other OECD countries, and our income tax rates on labour are relatively low. 20. Our headline corporate income tax rate of 28% is relatively high (though not the highest) due to other countries reducing their rates over the last 20-30 years. Growing international concerns at this race to the bottom were an important factor in the decision at the OECD to establish a minimum corporate tax rate. On the other hand, other countries have other taxes such as capital gains taxes that also tax capital. However our headline rate needs to be considered differently because as the paper points out, New Zealand is one of only a small number of countries operating a full imputation system for dividends. This means that for companies with New Zealand shareholders, company tax is effectively a withholding tax on the shareholders and its effective rate will depend on their marginal income tax rate. Arguably it is the owners, particularly of small companies, who make the decisions on matters which might be affected by the tax rate on company profits. Given that company owners tend to receive high incomes the company tax rate is usually lower than their marginal income tax rate – similar in effect to a dual tax regime. For low-income owners such as some small business owners or for high income owners who have arranged their affairs to receive a low taxable income the effective company income tax rate will be below 28% reflecting their low marginal tax rate. 7 21. The revenue recorded as being from company income tax is therefore not necessarily the additional revenue received by taxing company income, because, for New Zealand owned companies, company tax is simply a withholding tax on account of domestic individual shareholders through the imputation system. If the company tax rate were zero for New Zealand owned companies and all profits were paid out to be taxed as personal income in the hands of New Zealand shareholders (and we disregard for now the undoubted increase in use of companies as tax shelters that would occur), total tax revenue from such companies’ incomes would be little different to the current situation but company tax revenue from the New Zealand owned companies would be recorded as zero. It would be useful to quantify how large that effect is, in contrast to foreign-controlled and government- owned companies, and PIE funds (given they are – confusingly – included in corporate taxation). 22. In addition, as the consultation paper briefly mentions, the difference between top personal tax rates and the company tax rate of 28% can be used and is used by high income individuals to reduce their effective marginal tax rates. Further, in other countries there is double taxation of company income, once at the company level and then again at the personal level (though some mitigate this in various ways such as a tax-free dividend allowance that benefits small investors in the UK). 23. Therefore the combined tax revenue arising from company income is what should be compared with the New Zealand system. 24. Consequently, the principal significance of the headline company tax rate is how it affects overseas investors in New Zealand companies. 25. The impact of imputation is not made clear in the international comparisons provided such as in Figures 17 and 18. 26. There is concern that a higher company tax rate may disincentivise investment in the company and therefore slow productivity growth. However, considerations of imputation aside, reducing the company tax rate will not necessarily flow into greater investment in productivity-improving assets. The large company income tax cuts under the Trump Administration were illustrative. They failed to spur investment for at least three possible reasons. Firstly, investment may not be as sensitive to tax rates as is asserted (especially if the investment is debt-financed) according to Nobel Memorial prize-winning economist Paul Krugman (2021). Secondly, to the degree that companies are receiving economic rents (or monopoly profits) – and Krugman thinks they are large in the US – it is efficient to tax them without reducing productivity-enhancing investment. Economic rents may be high in New Zealand too (Bertram & Rosenberg, 2023). Thirdly, tax cuts were used to buy back company shares or make higher payouts to shareholders rather than investment (Phillips, 2018). 27. While the New Zealand and US tax systems differ so that the exact way in which companies respond to a tax cut will also differ, the message is that a large proportion of tax reductions may well be paid out to shareholders and senior executives rather than invested. An analysis of the types of companies which are present in New Zealand, including their ultimate ownership and purpose, would improve our understanding of the impacts of a reduction in corporate tax rates. 9 of scale in government. There are services that all governments which we compare ourselves to must provide – such as a democratic system of government, a legal system, tax system, policy advice, public safety, and some forms of infrastructure – which are only to a limited extent scalable to their population size. The costs of government and revenue requirements for smaller countries are likely to be higher per capita than for larger countries. We should compare ourselves to countries with a similar population. The above figure reproduces Figure 9 but only for OECD countries with a population under 15 million. 32. Particularly with the adjustment that the consultation paper applies to remove double- counting of taxation paid by the Crown, New Zealand raises tax revenue at a rate well below the small country average. Ireland’s apparently low proportion can be put aside because its GDP is well known to be artificially swollen by the activities of multinationals using it as a tax shelter (e.g. Honohan, 2021), reducing its apparent rate of tax revenue 3 . All of the highest income small countries other than Switzerland have higher rates of tax revenue collection than New Zealand. Those with the highest rates are countries known for their high productivity, high wages and high quality of life such as Denmark, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Belgium and Norway. 33. New Zealand has other reasons for needing disproportionately high government revenue including the difficulties of isolation, a long narrow country stretching over two main islands which is amongst the largest geographic size of the small countries and relatively sparsely populated, and its susceptibility to natural disasters including earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions 4 . 34. This all points to New Zealand’s tax revenue being inadequate to maintain living standards relative to similar countries. Our well recognised infrastructure deficit and high levels of child poverty, both of which require higher levels of government spending, are symptoms of this inadequacy. Conclusion 35. Thank you for the opportunity to submit on the scope of the LTIB. We hope there is room for change in your proposal as we have indicated. We have pointed out some areas that need greater emphasis, and proposed some different ways of viewing and analysing the issues raised in the consultation paper. We look forward to further interaction with IR as this work progresses. References Bertram, G., & Rosenberg, B. (2023, June). Economic rents in industry sectors in New Zealand.

I know wealthy people in the Un ted States who were prepared to immigrate, start businesses and invest large amounts of capital in New Zealand, but were put off because of the endless rants from the Green Party and the media on the need for a very low threshold wealth tax.

Dan McGuire s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) To: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Topic : LTIB Submission By 4 October 2024 Submission to the IRD Long Term Insights Briefing on the future of the tax system. Background 1. I am an interested neutral, non-expert in the horrifyingly difficult job of the collection and enforcement of tax law, but have a strong interest in good tax policy, particularly as it relates to the intersection of housing policy and consequent social outcomes. 2. First, to the advisors reviewing evidence, and developing this - You’ve done a great job. Summarising the history of New Zealand’s taxation system is hard, and you’ll have a limited scope of what is possible, and what can be said in publicly released documents. This is a good technical summary of the state of the NZ tax system. 3. My feedback generally agrees with the approach outlined as a focus, though I’m raising some items related to how and why we may seek to charge taxes to address social issues, noting that revenue is not the sole focus of tax systems and IRD should be in a position to consider a wider range of social impacts that are influenced by taxation. This doesn’t mean abandoning the core focus, though it raises opportunities to work with other agencies and consider whether tax changes may be appropriate to help the purpose of those agencies, within the context of overall Government focus. 4. I have endeavoured to fit feedback broadly into the questions raised, for ease of work sorting at the IRD. For the feedback to be meaningful I’ve gone beyond Yes / No responses and fit this together, though this does mean that the feedback flows between questions. 5. Happy to be contacted to discuss any points raised, using the email I use to make the submission. Does the environmental scan identify the key challenges facing our tax system over the long term? 6. The environment scan does a good job of covering the long-term make-up of the tax system and revenue sources, how these have varied over time based on public sentiment of the challenges that need to be faced beyond simply revenue, the ability to effectively collect revenue given the collection tools of the day. 7. Beyond the scope of the tax system (and thus this review), the revenue of collected through central government organisations through fees and levies and local government organisations through rates and fees are helpful for understanding the complete tax picture, including a full understanding of progressivity. That’s a big job, and would need more information than is (or should be) publicly available. 8. As noted on page 19, New Zealand’s frequent (roughly once a decade) long term reviews and media discussion have often pointed to the need for a more complete form of taxation on capital income, noting the fragmented nature of the current system for taxation of capital income, and likely need for a shift to cover the costs of the ageing population as we become more reliant on a smaller portion of the people in workforce. 9. Politically directed, government led reviews (For instance the TWG enacted by the previous Labour led Government), have often limited the scope of the reviews based on political expediency, such as the limit of the review into looking at taxing the family home 1 whether through capital gains taxation on sale or taxation of imputed rent, when asked to look at how to improve housing affordability. 10. Such directions limit the ability of a review to lead to optimal taxation, and when forgotten, give an illusion that the findings of reviews have found changes in a fully free and frank manner. 11. The comprehensiveness of the summary of sources of income, comparison to other OECD countries both in comprehensiveness, design and detailed nature of aspects of the taxation system are excellent. In terms of revenue collection tools in the detailed nature of the taxation system, options for adjusting collection methods and potential design challenges for revenue collection, this is an excellent summary of challenges. How well positioned is our current tax system to respond to these challenges? 12. Tax has never been a simple issue of the collection of revenue. Throughout history, tax has been used as one of many tools to address social harm alongside other policy tools. While appreciating that this is one of many jobs for policy officials, our future challenges are not just limited to revenue alone, but new and existing social challenges. Briefly: a. How can tax address the cost of mitigating and responding to climate change, including the costs of managed retreat (i.e, buying out giant chunks of land on a semi regular basis at prices inflated by the nature of our tax system)? b. How can we address long term rates of child poverty, and does the nature of our taxation system contribute to the rate of childhood poverty? (i.e Does a tax system that relies heavily on labour income, which is the dominant income source for families with young children contribute to New Zealands high rates of childhood poverty) c. What is the conceptual model 2 of how domestic violence occurs that is held by the public sector (explicitly not the IRDs role to develop this), and how 1 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/terms-reference-tax-working-group.html 2 I have a model in my head, discussed briefly below in para 22a, similar to that in Stevenson and Wolfers’ Bargaining in the Shadow of the Law, available here https://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/bargaining in the shadow of the law.pdf . The public service should be able to come up with something better that is tractable to tax modelling, given time. could tax contribute to mitigating the levels of harm through influencing variables that contribute to the likelihood and severity of harm? 13. Some of those areas are raised in chapter 2, and the need for our taxation system to address the equity issues of historical poor outcomes for Maori and allow the taxation system to effectively work to meet the obligations that the crown has as a treaty partner. 14. In most cases the responsibility of understanding social issues such as the above at a causal level is not the role of the IRD. But public understanding and public opinion informed will influence the tax system, and being able to understand these considerations from other and social challenges and adapt to public and political pressure is a necessity for the tax system. 15. It is understandable that this is not the focus of the environmental scan. Everyone has their own issues that they think are the most important in the world, and as a tool, there are likely methods of using tax to address every social issue. Ensuring that New Zealand keeps its focus on good design with principles of taxation is a valid focus within the specific purpose of the IRD. 16. To help address future challenges, understanding both the weaknesses / issues with the tax system (such as through the frequent reviews), and how tax policy could influence these challenges (based on the work of other public sector agencies) is necessary. The IRD (alongside tax policy partners) will need to determine: a. How tax changes could help address an issue? b. Whether changes through the tax system would worsen the integrity of the taxation system (or, by happy coincidence, improve the integrity of the system), c. Whether a change is worthwhile. 17. Based on the depth of understanding of the principles of taxation of a broad base, low rate, and the depth of knowledge of the issues with our taxation system, IRD is in an excellent to help guide the tax system to respond to these challenges. 18. Addressing them will not be the role of IRD alone, and in some cases with potentially require decision making by Ministers alongside elected representatives in local bodies who collect alternative sources of revenue (ie rates). 19. The effectiveness of the broader public sector in aligning local and national policy decision making could always improve, and that may be a limiting factor in the ability of the tax system (considered broadly) to respond to challenges. How well positioned is our current tax system to respond to these challenges? 20. New Zealand has a principled taxation system based on a broad base, low rate with few exemptions. As a general rule this means that the taxation system with not respond 1:1 to new challenges, and rely on fiscal decision making to address particular issues other than revenue. This is generally a good approach, though means that the taxation system is not flexible to respond to individual challenges, with targeted benefits often allowing focus on distributional aims. 21. Our tax system is well positioned for its role, as currently envisioned, in responding to these challenges. It’s a sensible split, and this should probably broadly continue. Do you agree with the focus on how to maintain a stable core structure of the tax system while ensuring the system has flexibility to adapt to different revenue and distributional objectives over time? 22. Yes. Seems fairly general, and flexibility is a useful focus as the tax system will need to respond to the will of the elected Government that changes over time. In the New Zealand context, this may mean changing in ways that worsen the integrity of the tax system. The IRD should be in position to adjust the rates of taxation based on the will of the government of the day, and make it clear through its advice to Ministers (through BIMs, RIA, briefings etc) that changes are not in keeping with the principles of good tax design. Do you agree that understanding the pros and cons of different approaches to income and consumption tax is important for understanding what tax system would be suitable for the future? 23. It’s a great place to start. Analysis of the pros and cons of different taxation methods should also consider New Zealand’s place as a small, distant economy, mostly as it relates to how we capture revenue from non-residents, both through the incidence of consumption taxes on visitors, and how our corporate taxation covers the income of non-residents who own companies are not passed taxed on the personal income they gain from the ownership in assets. 24. While there are potentially good reasons for adapting the rate of the corporate taxation more in line with the remainder of the OECD 3 , the incidence of tax needing to shift to residents should be a consideration. Do you agree that we should consider what is taxed under our current main two bases, and if there are any bases it makes sense to add to our tax mix? 25. Yes, good process. I trust the officials to consider exactly how the base is added to over time to effectively capture a shift to more capital-intensive economy. 26. Effective design to address issues will mean taking on and developing a rigorous economic model for the types of social harm that could be addressed through the tax system. The proposed process (paragraph 162) includes a process for understanding taxation, revenue and expenditure impacts, alternative tax systems. This is a good basis for the work planned and a general understanding to work towards the flexible, adaptable tax system. 27. For 2025, this is a good process. For future work on the long-term design of the tax system, leveraging the Treasury’s role as a wide ranging center of economic expertise for the entirety of New Zealand’s economic and social policy, and working 3 Personal preference, rate is 0 and we capture it all through pass through on the taxation of personal income and we agree on tax sharing internationally. to turn the general, implicit models that exist in other agencies into explicit models that can inform tax policy. a. For instance, policy consideration of domestic abuse will often discuss power, in various forms (physical, financial, etc) along with stress as an explanation. Turning this into a model that can explicitly interact with how the tax system works may allow for more public understanding of the reasons for tax policy changes and provide a reason for changes that maintain the integrity of the tax system. Do you think we should consider both options for a future tax system that may have higher revenue needs and options at current revenue levels? 28. Yes. Higher revenue needs are likely to be needed as our population ages, and relying on the same income taxation share is likely to become difficult with our increased dependency ratio. Such factors have been regularly raised in public facing reports (I think the Treasury has included them in every single long term fiscal briefing since time began) and will impact both the revenue needs of particular spending (notably health, and retirement related income support). 29. While that is one direction, ruling parties have often aimed for a tax rate at about 30% of GDP, and keeping with the general pattern, may be the direction future Governments take. An option of continuing at the same level would necessitate some changes to the structure of fiscal decision making, snd should be considered alongside the Treasury as the counterfactual of a 30% tax rate to inform advice to Government. This would cover areas such as reduced health spending, targeted / means tested superannuation, lower rates of benefits for disabled groups, deferred maintenance on education buildings and a need for high rates of migration – essentially, what other options are needed for the country to continue with a continuing focus on a given tax rate. 30. While not an IRD decision alone, this should need advice from other agencies to deliver effective advice.           !" #$%&'()'\* +&'()'\*\* ,   !!!-$./-.01 2 !"$  3%$.. 4 .4 %/  /3 4$ .. 4 .344 ! % ,    5. 2$  6/3%.$7. 7/  - /% 3 3 - 8. 334 9:;<=>?@ABC 9 DAEF<=><GHI@GJEH>G=E<K %L% /  %46.3 27 ,M N( L/   4N)N\*O-   NN 8 % P@G?Q=>ARSGTE?U=TVAE>JEG?W@XEIQYZA=<\[TBT=>R\\V<T>T<GHA>?ER>T L!. %$$  7 .3.33,M\]33   % 3$4 3 /^  .3/% 3 4/\_\`5#,ab $- , 3$ $3 % % 5#,3%$ !%  3   4 % 373 .! 3 4 %4  -#%3!.$33 % /.3 % /%!%% !" 3 . 3.$  %.4 33- L/ ! % % 3$4 %5#, $-! 2!% %4!/c3 3  3- #%$ $3$ $34 3//0 /\`3  373 .4 %4  a 43 33   7 %/  .\_ c7 . 4  / . $   3b2 . .3\_447$   7b3   .3\_c 7b- L%! /  % % 73/$ $323%$ 47  4 .! 23  33 / 34.$.3  !%%2  ! 2  3  %  /  74 %373 .- /3 % .$3 3 !  $ 73 3$ 4447$   73  3 % 3   $$ .33$  . 4.$3 3-#%3  3//3 3 %  .3  37 %3$4 %5#,-#%3!  3  3 74   373 .3332$  7!% /$   ^443 33 %  3 3/$ $33% % 4 .! - #%  4 ! % 373 . % /.33$$ 3 3$ - .$ 3 %  4 ! %!4  373 .3233.3333 3 $  % /% % 373 .-#%  3/4defghijkefklmhnhop   324 .$2 %3/4 .$ 32 % /%%/%44 . /   3-q. 72 % $ $34 .! $$ 3 / % .$ 34 3r % 32%! % 373 . .742$3 7 / 72 .  3 %3-/2 3.33        !" # $%&'&$ ()\*+(,-\*./012345236789:3;<==>?>3<:>29@AB<:8C2DEF( 7<E>7G<3::H88I<;6<:>292?1>??8D89:2G:>29=0 JH889I>D29789:<;=3<9<=G<D:2?:H8329=6;:<:>2992:8=:H8>7G<3:2?;29CK:8D7?>=3<;L832927>3 <91=23>8 :<;:D891=L=63H<=<C8>9CG2G6;<:>29L3;>7<:83H<9C8L;2M;<N26DGD2163:>I>:EL3H<9C8= >9:83H92; 2CE>93;61>9C<D:>?>3><;>9:8;;>C8938<919<:6D8O?6:6D82?M2DPL29:H8:<4=E=:870 Q2M8I8DL :H8329=6;:<:>29=6CC8=:=:H8>7G<3:2?=2782?:H8=8:D891=29<?6:6D8:<4=E=:87 18=>C9M> ;;92:N8329=>18D81>9<9E18:<>;<=G<D:2?:H8RJST<9<;E=>=0JH>=>=2?32938D9LC>I89 :H<::H8=8 :D891=326;11D<7<:>3<;;E>7G<3::H88I<;6<:>292?:H81>??8D89:2G:>29=0U2D84<7G;8L 3H<9C8=> 9:H89<:6D8<91?6:6D82?M2DPL<=M8;;<=:H8D2;82?:83H92;2CEL7<E>7G<3::H8 =6=:<>9<N >;>:E2?:H836DD89:G8D=29<;>93278:<4N<=8<91D<>=8V68=:>29=<N26:MH<:<9 <GGD2GD>< :8D8G;<38789::<4N<=8326;12D=H26;1N80 W8<CD88:H<::H8RJST9881=:23;8<D;E<D:>36;<:8:H8GD2=<91329=?2D:H81>??8D89:O<;:8D9<:>I8 :<4D8C>78 =<91:<4N<=8=:H<:<D8329=>18D81L=2:H<::H8=83<9N8GD2G8D;E8I<;6<:81<91 18N<:810 JH>=>=;>P8;E:278<9:H<::H8RJSTM>;;9881:2N884G;>3>:2938D:<>9=G83>?>318=>C9 G<D<78:8 D=?2D:H8D8C>78=<91O2DN<=8=329=>18D81L<=:H8GD2=<91329=7<EM8;;18G89129 :H818=>C9 <==67G:>29=7<180 U>9<;;ELMH>;8=6GG2D:>I82?:H8GD2G2=81RJST:2G>3LM892:8:H<:>18<;;E>:=H26;1N8G<D:2?< 72D8H2;>= :>3329=>18D<:>292?X8MY8<;<91Z=?>=3<;L832927>3<91G2;>3E=8::>9C=LC>I89:H8>9:8DK ;>9P<C8=L D<:H8D:H<9;22P>9C<::H8:<4=E=:87\[<912:H8DD8C>78=\\>9>=2;<:>290 \]^\_\`ab\_cdef\_gh\`cfd S?E26H<I8<9EV68=:>29=<N26:26D=6N7>==>29LG;8<=81292:H8=>:<:8:2329:<3:5<D=H<9< i;M8;<29     m26D==>938D8;E 5<D=H<9<i;M8;< n<D:98D o<3H8;n>G8D n<D:98D s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Hi could you include the email below in the LTIB submissions? Thanks Matt External Email CAUTION: Please take CARE when opening any links or attachments. Dear Matt, Unfortunately we haven’t had capacity to put together a full submission on this year’s proposed LTIB. I am however very keen to see the results of the work on consumption tax regimes and progressive consumption taxes. The X-tax has always been fun, but seems such a fundamental redoing of the tax system that it’s implausible that we could get there. But Canada’s GST rebate scheme isn’t that far from what the Key government did as a tax shift in 2010/11 except with better optics. Hike GST while adjusting other bits so those on lower incomes aren’t worse off. While they’re not that different in effect, they are different in perception. Everyone getting the GST rebate every year knows that they are getting the GST rebate. I expect most people forgot that they had gotten changes that compensated them for the GST switch 30 seconds after the GST switch, then went back to hating having to pay a consumption tax. So on that basis the Canadian version has some merit. Hike GST, set a refundable tax credit so that a person on low income who spends 100% of that income is fully compensated for the change, and adjust other worse taxes downward to make the thing revenue neutral. Gives you a pro-efficiency tax switch that’s more politically feasible. In lieu of formal submission, I had a short column in our Insights newsletter. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) https://www.nzinitiative.org.nz/reports-and-media/opinion/for-a-better-tax-conversation/ CGT-talk has become incredibly tedious. Whatever CGT might get implemented wouldn’t be worth the effort (but also isn’t worth the effort to argue much against), but just gets unbearable endless news cycles. Getting to talk about progressive consumption taxes instead would be refreshing! Best, Eric Crampton | Chief Economist s 9(2)(a) LONG-TERM INSIGHTS BRIEFING – GIACOMO LIZZADRO FEEDBACK Disclosure The feedback provided to this LTIB topic context have the purpose to inform on the big picture, particularly the long-term part. Further details and analysis are not included, simply because not all information is available to the writer to make up or elaborate on further statements. I do share what I know and what I think could be the best course forward. Also, the contents of this document do take advantage proposals to improve New Zealand as a whole, and therefore this is not in any way, shape or form, feedback to influence a single group, party, person, household, individual investor. The collective is front and centre here. The feedback provided is moderate and personal, it does not lean to left or right. In fact, there’s not left or right in an MMP environment, just plenty of coalitions that are compromising, contradicting and buying each other out. Finally, the text in this document has been written informally, colloquially. Brief introduction I think we all agree that the tax base, intake has to be sustainable moving forward and in the long term as a result of the growing population and all the current and future challenges (Artificial Intelligence, Climate Change, Ageing Population, Health system is very important etc.) that you have exhaustively described, supported by evidence, in the scope of the consultation. I won’t dwell or spend too long on all these elements from the list. The economic growth won’t be slowing down, be on a downward trajectory forever. It needs serious and competent Government management and allocation of spendings, savings, investments to previously unfunded public infrastructures, and the whole balancing of all of these. I have to say that we’ve got to a point really where things are even more unsustainable nowadays compared to our parents’/grandparents’ generation. I am going to divide this piece of feedback in two parts, so that the process of thoughts can be clearer, classified appropriately, more efficient and easily to read. The first part will look at the short term, the second part at the long-term. Both parts include the potential changes as suggested and, they’re generally explained, with some of the references taken from trusted sources (i.e. from New Zealand independent journalism sources), and some other personal lived examples from personal experience. Short preamble There are a lot of thematics and issues to discuss and consider from the LTIB consultation report. But I would only focus on a couple of those, by bringing back some of the assertions from the LTIB together with my own personal view of the future. Taxes as in GST and PAYE will not be discussed in greater detail in this document. While the ‘Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax Rates’ thresholds will certainly need adjusting in my opinion, because the biggest chunk of the tax take in recent years, if not for many years, has come from PAYE personal tax from middle class employees, and this raises some questions in relation to whether the tax system is fair or else could be reviewed to fit not only integrity, equity democratic values, but ensure in practice that all tax alternatives and sources are explored with an open mind and acted upon. Anyway, this won’t be the topic discussed in this document because there are other priorities that need looked at and addressed first. 1. Short-term horizon: The need of new taxes to be introduced and the need of changing the rates on the company tax rate. Timeframe: Up and running from now through to the next 2-3 year period I am not 100% sure if that is explicitly expressed or meant in the report the passage that there is appetite to expand the tax base or not. It does appear that there is appetite at this point of history, and this is the right decision, course of action to take for IRD. Capital Gains Tax: Yes, and long overdue. We do need a capital gains tax applied to certain areas of the economy, and I will be making a classic example for housing. We all know very well what this tax will do and where this tax will be collected from predominantly, and this will also help shifting that long-standing, cultural approach and mentality to “one-way investment concentration” (it’s a term I use). By stating this, I am not saying that the public or investors should stop considering investment property to gain a passive income in New Zealand as their final destination to raise their capital. I personally like that idea too and we all take a direction and different decisions in our life of where we’re going. Fair enough. The message that I am trying to get across is let’s not keep incentivise investments in the property market by not applying a fair level of tax in that space. Let’s shift the narrative and be open to create incentives (and disincentives) for diversification of investments. The other thing on investment property is that it needs to serve the purpose of housing people, adding up to the property stock market. Therefore, empty houses should be monitored. Prices of rent or buying a property are through the roof (even if they’re fluctuating, they remain pretty high) and hard to find due to the shortage and competition that there is, and so the last thing we all want is to find them sitting empty on purpose. Unintended practices of such nature could be disincentivised with more taxes there as well, why not. Less of Company Tax: Here I come to another piece of the puzzle in connection with what I have expressed in regard to diversification before. There are endless opportunities out there with new markets and new industries emerging particularly in tech and science, and many more which all have some important transferrable skills to use in other industries. Let’s balance up the playing field for SME’s businesses in New Zealand and alleviate the pressure on them, and so reduce the company tax rate (they represent the very most and best part of our economy). Nowadays businesses are doing it tough, business failure is at an all-time high. Last record of this magnitude was back in 2016. This has effect consequences on the ability of a business to invest and employ staff. In fact, the workforce is poorer and going backwards because they cannot control what’s happening in the job market and with less options to choose from. One thing I have noticed much more frequently lately is that businesses are using salary thresholds caps to tighten their belt and save costs on labour / personnel. Previously salary was based on employee’s experience, not threshold caps limitations. Small parenthesis: Even if interest rates get back down, households and businesses will still struggle. That won’t be a one-off bullet proof to alleviate all of the pressure, hence way reviewing this tax will contribute to resilience and autonomy for both groups. Land Tax: Absolutely. Without doubt. That’s yet again another ‘elephant in the room’. Why are we not, or haven’t we overlooked this enough, to make the best use of unutilised land? Some is protected by the legislation I know because is defined to be ‘productive’ for whatever reasons. However, the land is not utilised, sits empty, and in the hands of a wealthy few landowners that are making the land banking out of it (because we all know how expensive land is and how much is valued at). But again, when this is not a source of productivity then this is not paying off for the public... then what is that is coming next there? If the answer is nothing, then we’re all missing a big opportunity. The bottom line here is we either decide to apply a land tax or we should start building on it to ‘harvest the fruits’. The land areas in some of the regions are wider than in where the big cities (i.e. Auckland) are. Let’s open up space there to build more of the residential portfolio and commercial activities. What we don’t need is a wealth tax, because there are other levers that New Zealand can pull in the first instance like I’ve mentioned just earlier. Also, private investments are much needed, need to be incentivised and welcomed to our shores if that creates wealth, jobs and all sorts of revenues opportunities. This bit needs to blend together with Government in a form of Public-Private Partnership delivery deals always taking in mind, at the forefront the public interest. It will take some time to collect all these new taxes over the coming years, before a decent sum of tax intake can add up to the Government’s coffin and be re-invested in all the public projects that are long overdue and much needed to both catch up from the past and build for the future. Until then, debts keep accumulating with no way back to even think about repaying all these debts from the future generations. Hint: Make use of the robots to pay for future debt repayments. I conclude here by making this section very clear. The restructure of those tax reforms that I have mentioned are wanting to shift the dial and trying to address the same repetitive practices of investments that have happened internally in New Zealand for many years. We need to build a culture in which that it’s okay to invest and grow where taxes exist, or are projected to be existing. Hence why the more taxes are applied broadly and fairly, the more diversified and competitive the economy will turn out to be, potentially. Fairly contribute more to the system and diversify investments and create jobs elsewhere. This is what New Zealand can control and can be fixed, improved. What is external instead, are the big capital investments that will help us get through it and realise potential. We need this too. But they won’t just come. We need to negotiate a deal with them by keeping the public interest at heart. 2. Long-term horizon: Growing the population at equal pace. Timeframe: Ideally within the next 20 years (possibly less, but it would take more I think) The longest and most arduous challenge that every Government can have, has and will have in my own honest and humble opinion is to grow New Zealand as a whole, all regions. But doing it much more equally and sustainably. I am trying to be realistic and let’s face it, it will be near impossible to compare an Invercargill to an Auckland growth population because of the complexities and delays in building new infrastructure and houses, and also, we cannot control where all of those private investments will be going. Why? Because it’s not at the advantage of those who invest capital to go and live and splash their cash in little towns New Zealand. The risks of that returns on investments are too high and the all the resources required to build on that investment are not a given. But there is hope to try and catch up. It’s about believed in it and push forward, invest resources in this plan, direction. There is work that the Government can do to balance up this equation. It won’t come from Inland Revenue only, there needs to be cooperation and an interdisciplinary approach with the other Government agencies. For example, for Kainga Ora to expand their housing portfolios in the regions, and for Immigration New Zealand to bring back a specific lever on their residency points system scheme – and I would add work visa schemes too – with the purpose to add points to their visa applications if they find employment in the regions, and so incentivise visa applicants to go and live there whether it be for work opportunities, experience a different lifestyle, or in fact because employers are crying out for workers in these areas and cannot find the employees that they need to run their businesses. Equally important for kiwis, residents and citizens to be able to move across the regions and find opportunities there, where they’re closer to their families. The bottom line is to grow all of New Zealand equally, so that IRD can collect GST, PAYE, and all other applicable deductions of sorts from a more robust and ‘high-in-GDP’ regions. Currently, and have been for some time, we have the biggest contributors being the same 2/3 big cities (Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch). Why? Because more people live there where infrastructure capacity is greater as a consequence of policy decisions, in part, that have brought both the public and private sectors to grow and invest there. As the report rightly impart in p. 149, distributional outcomes (equity) are one of the targets from which to rebuild and design the tax system. So, I would like to see more equity done right in that way to have a growing New Zealand with more opportunities in the regions and provinces for both New Zealanders and the migrant skilled workforce of the future that New Zealand needs. In addition, it’s an interesting point that one raised in p. 133 where the so-called gig economy, you know, will advance and make further giant steps forward. Inevitable, and it’s welcomed if it does improve efficiency, innovation and productivity. However, we will need to wait and see how this component will evolve, what impact will it have, and how diffuse will it be in New Zealand because if you want to tax more heavily on capital, as the machine it’s used as a business asset, you’re ending up taxing back to the business which is what I wanted to avoid when I talked about company tax previously. It’s definitely something to monitor because at the end of the day, we want to prioritise our people and lay down the conditions to support them, not the machines. Machines work for the people, not the other way around. There is one more point to this long-term analysis that may make you realise the even much harder consequences of not having sustainability and growth in regional New Zealand and towns. There are some of the numbers that shocked me, honestly. That is New Zealand local Government as in Councils are ranked in the bottom three of the most indebted Councils, wait, in the world. The average debt-to-revenue ratio among these Councils is as high as 180%. Certain Councils fared even worse than that. In other words, they’re struggling and can’t move a finger, very limited in what they can do really. Why is that? Bad management and underspending? Probably. But also, not enough people living there to pay all the rates to create, support and maintain the infrastructure network that they use. Take Queenstown for instance, probably there is where you pay the highest rate bill in the country because the population is shrinking and the few residents who are left are paying all the bills. Bottom line is the less people living in an area, the more disproportionate effect will be on the living costs that they would have to bear. But if we grow the population in these regions, the more proportionate the rate bills and living costs will be, and they will be shared equally. Also, the more capital, resources and job opportunities will be there to prosper as a nation and getting ahead. Council rates are not GST or PAYE I understand that, not the same sources and they end up in different “accounts” – rates to Councils and GST, PAYE to Government. But it’s important to grasp that one (rates) pull or push the other one (GST, PAYE) out. The level of excessive rates costings has a knock on effect on consumer spendings (GST) and potential employment opportunities (PAYE). Key highlights are these: • Find specific policies to bring New Zealanders back to New Zealand long-term to contribute to the tax system. They’re leaving in droves, and not just for an Overseas Experience. • Choose humans, not robots. I agree with your suggestion of lifting employment in paragraphs 137 and 143 pointing out to ways of efficiency, productivity and social security contributions (welfare) that will serve to potentially sustain people when they experience difficulties for whatever social and/or work-related reasons. • Grow the regions to grow the tax take that is coming from there. It’s the challenge of the century as I see it fit. Councils have major structural problems that leads to conflicting decisions internally which affect spendings and money management that need to be addressed for a start. If we take the 15 regions and improve each of them individually, they will improve New Zealand as a whole. The same analogy can apply to football management. If you improve each player, the team will ultimately achieve a higher score in order to win. Other further comments - Addressing the ageing population at glance That’s a tough one to solve. I won’t repeat some of the policy solutions that were covered (i.e. ways to incentivise men and women to have children). Plenty of very good options available from your list, so I think these options have validity. On the other hand of that, what I would say is that we need to give young people opportunities to participate more and be seen and make it easy for them to become a first-time employee from when they’re younger, fresh after university, or make it easier to re-enter the workforce in their 30s. If we focus on finding solutions down this path, that inter-generational transition from replacing the “ageing grandfather with their dude grandchild” will contribute to addressing the issue. Also, we would need to remove some of those impediments that prevent younger people to work, such as the starting-out wage which does not in any way reflect the current reality and earnings that people can live on to support themselves and getting ahead sustainably. There’re also other considerations to be made in regard to mentality and traditional thinking when it comes to employment hiring, such as some of the employers view that “a couple of years’ experience” isn’t enough and does not make younger people competitive in the market. Why? They can be taught and can pick up things. Believe in them and in what they can do and deliver. Do not look at their past based on experience as the only decision-making factor. Other further comments - The GST-shared scheme already proposed in New Zealand I think this is a good idea that could be considered, explored further to a point of implementation. You know, it can empower and equip Councils with more resources to deliver and will give them some extra tools to work with. But again, the problem is downstream. In other words, we could better first expand, increase the tax take to sustainable levels, then consider this option a tad later in the course (once the Councils have sorted their underlying structural issues). Brief conclusion Overall, this could only be the start of a new beginning, if ever taken into consideration. There’s a lot of work to do in this space, lots of changes to make gradually. IRD will need to be willing to take new risks. There will be some hard and some unusual, unprecedented decisions to make starting from the near future. IRD needs to be more ambitious than just proceeding with opting with expanding and increasing the current tax base. The New Zealand Government and Councils need to work together more effectively and set even more ambitious goals and grow the population in the towns, provinces and regions. Additional money will come in part from the first step in the ‘short-term horizon’ (that you have proposed as a long-term plan instead), plus other investments that I understand Chris Luxon is working on by reconnecting with some of those countries that want to come and invest here, so that we can attempt to grow and pursue a more balanced long-term regional growth, hopefully. Final remarks What I am expecting is that in the next three years from now, when a new report of this nature will be released (presumably with similar contents as the challenges we have now won’t simply disappear this quickly) and new feedback will be sought as part of the process – I do hope that by then some progresses would have been made towards achieving the short-term goals of this feedback and analysis reported in this document. I may be available by the time we get to write the plan for the long-term settings. I could potentially assist, and be part of the IR team who manages and dedicates their time to this piece of work, who knows... do not hesitate to give me a call. Stated with humour obviously. We live in a beautiful country with lots of potentials and without needing to worry about the levels of corruption and tax evasions that has been seen overseas. Let’s make it better together as a team of 5+ million. It’s about time that real change occurs in this country. Go Ahead New Zealand. Buon lavoro, and all the best. Mr. Giacomo Lizzadro New Zealand Resident This day of 22 September 2024, at Auckland Young IFA Network 4 October 2024 Public Consultation Inland Revenue Wellington By email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing Introduction The Young International Fiscal Association Network (“Young IFA”) welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback on the scope of Inland Revenue’s next long-term insights briefing (“LTIB”). The submissions in this letter represent the views that the Young IFA Committee have received from Young IFA contributors, and do not necessarily represent the views of each Young IFA Committee member, the International Fiscal Association (“IFA”) or of each Young IFA Committee member’s employers. For the sake of completeness, we note that Young IFA includes individuals employed by Inland Revenue and The Treasury, however individuals from these organisations have not been involved in the preparation or discussion of this submission. Background to Young IFA • Young IFA is an offshoot of the New Zealand branch of the International Fiscal Association (IFA) (a global organisation that comprises tax partners/Heads of Tax/senior tax policy officials). The purpose of YIN is to bring together younger members of the tax profession and cultivate interest in IFA initiatives, tax policies/developments and connect those who will be building a career in tax. Comments • We agree with the proposal that Inland Revenue’s next LTIB explores what broad structure of the tax system would be suitable for the future. The LTIB is an appropriate vehicle for having these broader discussions about New Zealand’s tax system, to inform debate, allowing stakeholders to engage in a conversation about the various issues. However, we do caution that the LTIB in itself is unlikely to be able to look at all the issues required in enough depth to form the basis for new tax policy. It is important that if any issues are to be taken further from the LTIB, proper consultation is undertaken that engages with a broad range of New Zealand society, given that any broad changes to the tax system are likely to impact on all. • We set our comments in regard to the specific questions posed in the consultation document below. Young IFA Network Submission on Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing 4 October 2024 Does the environmental scan identify the key challenges facing our tax system over the long term? • Paragraph 23 states that corrective taxes such as environmental taxes are specifically excluded from the environmental scan because “\[c\]orrective taxes raise a range of issues that are different to those raised by revenue raising taxes and are a large topic in themselves” and because “environmental taxes were recently considered in depth by the last Tax Working Group”. • Environmental challenges are a key concern for us because future generations will bear the burden of environmental degradation and the associated costs to address environmental restoration. While we acknowledge that the scope of the LTIB cannot be all encompassing, we suggest that consideration is given to the role that environmental taxes should play in New Zealand’s tax system, especially given the focus on tax bases and mixes, and long- term trends. • There is also no mention of horizontal equity or intergenerational fairness in the LTIB. This issue is also important to us. We note that New Zealand’s tax system currently places an emphasis on the taxation of gains derived from the disposal of shares and cryptocurrency, which are increasingly favoured by younger investors who experience difficulty accessing real property investment, in comparison with a perceived lack of focus on taxation of gains derived from the disposal of real property. How well positioned is our current tax system to respond to these challenges? • We support a broad-base, low rate (“BBLR”’) approach to taxation. However, New Zealand’s tax system, especially in recent times, has appeared to diverge from this principle, with political expediency prevailing over sound tax policy. A number of tax reforms have been ad-hoc and have not been undertaken with a longer term view. As a result, New Zealand’s current tax system results in significant distortions, and challenges identified will only exacerbate these distortions. Do you agree with the focus on how to maintain a stable core structure of the tax system while ensuring the system has flexibility to adapt to different revenue and distributional objectives over time? • We agree with this focus, although it should be noted that tax reform is an ongoing process and while a stable core structure of the tax system is desirable, it should not be pursued to the detriment of other factors. Do you agree that understanding the pros and cons of different approaches to income and consumption tax is important for understanding what tax system would be suitable for the future? • We agree in principle with this statement, however, a New Zealand lens should be applied to understand the pros and cons (for example, a Te ao Māori view). In other words, some hypothetical pros and cons may be less or more relevant in New Zealand context. Young IFA Network Submission on Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing 4 October 2024 Do you agree that we should consider what is taxed under our current main two bases, and if there are any bases it makes sense to add to our tax mix? • We agree, however, see our comments above regarding the environmental scan. Do you think we should consider both options for a future tax system that may have higher revenue needs and options at current revenue levels? • A number of factors (for example, an aging population) make it clear that changes to the future tax system to raise additional revenue, will need to be considered. Accordingly, we think that you should prioritise considering options for a future tax system that will have higher revenue needs, so that these options are able to be considered in detail now, instead of being introduced quickly and without proper consideration. Further assistance We trust Inland Revenue will find these comments useful in deciding the scope of the next LTIB. If you would like to discuss these comments, please contact one of the members of the committee. Kind regards Young IFA Committee (Dion Blummont, Nancy Chen, Harrison Cooper, Audrey Gregan, Mikaila Harris, Steven Liu, Aaron Mitchell, Brendan Ng, Charlotte Rudkin, Denver Saldanha, Harry Waddell) LTIB topic, c/ - Chief Economist, Policy | Taukaea Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Sent via email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz 10 October 2024 Submission on Inland Revenue’s Long-Term Insights Briefing Dear LTIB team Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed topic of Inland Revenue’s next long-term insights briefing (LTIB). As a general comment, we broadly support further consideration of the proposed topic. The revenue sufficiency of New Zealand’s current tax settings is an important topic to consider in detail at this time, particularly in the light of the various challenges outlined in the consultation paper. We have set out further comments in relation to the specific questions posed in the consultation paper. We would be happy to discuss our submission in further detail if that would be helpful. Does the environmental scan identify the key challenges facing our tax system over the long term? We broadly agree with the key challenges outlined in the environmental scan. In our view, the main thing that is currently missing is the consideration of the impact of technological change (both in terms of challenges and opportunities presented by these changes). We elaborate below. New Zealand’s “broad-base low rate” (BBLR) tax system has generally delivered well for New Zealand to date, and this has been confirmed by a number of tax reviews that have been conducted over the years, with the last one being the Tax Working Group (TWG) review which was completed in 2019. However, the 2019 review did highlight that the current system is reliant on a relatively narrow range of taxes (i.e. on labour income and consumption) and is not particularly progressive. The previous Government’s High-Wealth Individuals (HWI) Research Project Report also suggested that the undertaxation of capital gives rise to unfairness and reduced progressivity in the tax system. Key developments such as the changing demographics of New Zealand and technological change (e.g. the impact of generative artificial intelligence) will be important to consider given the current heavy reliance on tax on labour. While changing demographics is a story that has been many years in the making, the potential disruptive impact of technological change is less certain. Further, a recent IMF study considers that up to 40% of global employment is potentially exposed to artificial intelligence - for advanced economies, it is predicted that up to 60% of jobs could be exposed to artificial intelligence due to the prevalence of cognitive-task-oriented jobs. 1 While the scale of the potential future disruption to the workforce is therefore uncertain, we consider 1 Cazzaniga and others. 2024. “Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work.” IMF Staff Discussion Note SDN2024/001, International Monetary Fund, Washington, DC. PricewaterhouseCoopers, 10 Waterloo Quay, PO Box 243, Wellington 6140, New Zealand T: +64 4 462 7000, pwc.co.nz that it is a safe assumption that the proportion of New Zealanders in the workforce will look different in the medium and long term future - and potentially be smaller. With a lower proportion of people working, the amount of tax collected could reduce, in the absence of a change in tax rates or broadening of tax bases. This may further exacerbate fiscal pressures taking into consideration issues such as the ageing population which will likely increase expenditure needs, for example health care, New Zealand superannuation, etc. assuming there are no significant policy changes. For completeness, there will be a number of other factors that could impact on the amount of tax revenue generated by the tax system, for example general economic conditions or the competitiveness of the New Zealand economy and migration (which could in turn be impacted by the design of the tax system). However, in our view the impact of demographic and technological changes are more pressing in the medium term which may not have been considered in detail previously. How well positioned is our current tax system to respond to these challenges? In our view, our tax system has strong foundations which should provide current and future Governments with the ability to respond to challenges in the future. Relatively speaking, the New Zealand tax system maintains the following advantages: ● The tax system broadly follows a BBLR approach (notwithstanding the absence of a comprehensive capital gains tax; and notwithstanding recent changes to personal and trustee tax rates which have given rise to higher rates, and greater misalignment between tax rates for individuals, trusts, and companies). The BBLR approach helps give rise to a relatively simple tax system, with relatively few distortionary tax concessions. For example, while New Zealand’s GST system has seen a number of policy changes over the past five years which has given rise to increased complexity, comparatively speaking the GST system is more simple and efficient than many overseas consumption tax regimes. The BBLR approach provides a framework that is consistent with the hallmarks of good tax policy design and raises revenue efficiently. ● The generic tax policy process (GTPP) is relatively unique globally, and can help develop policy changes at speed - for example, the development of the business continuity test during the COVID-19 pandemic. The small size of the tax community and relatively high level of trust between the private sector and officials are conducive towards greater collaboration and better overall policy outcomes when utilised well by both parties. ● New Zealand’s constitutional arrangements lend itself to being able to enact major policy reform relatively quickly, as legislation is only required to be passed by one House of Parliament, which is controlled by the Government. Do you agree with the focus on how to maintain a stable core structure of the tax system while ensuring the system has flexibility to adapt to different revenue and distributional objectives over time? We agree that a stable core structure with flexibility to adapt to different objectives over time is desirable. The overall coherence of a tax system is fundamental to ensuring that tax settings do not discourage investment, and supports productivity growth. This does not necessarily mean that tax rules remain static and do not change over time, but that there is a unifying framework which ties the system together, while providing a framework or lens through which future changes or additions to the system can be evaluated. To date, the BBLR approach has been helpful for providing a clear framework for evaluating tax changes. However, we would note that certainty is important, therefore whilst there is a need for agility and flexibility, a stable and certain tax environment is important for businesses. As such, care should be given so that any changes are well signposted and enduring so that taxpayers can have confidence in a stable tax system. We agree with the comments in the paper that it is not an absolute requirement to align different entity’s tax rates, particularly in relation to the company tax rate and the personal tax rate. To the PwC2 extent that the New Zealand tax system has made a deliberate policy decision to not have full integration, this should be respected. As noted in the paper, the misalignment of rates is cited as a barrier to changes to the company tax rate and/or personal rates as it departs from the goal of full integration. The LTIB should consider measures adopted in overseas jurisdiction to manage this gap between the company and personal rates, given this is not uncommon in other countries to have a divergence between these. Do you agree that understanding the pros and cons of different approaches to income and consumption tax is important for understanding what tax system would be suitable for the future? Do you agree that we should consider what is taxed under our current main two bases, and if there are any bases it makes sense to add to our tax mix? In our view, the current tax settings are relatively efficient and comprehensive in how the current main two bases (labour and consumption) are taxed. While further improvements could always be made to the existing tax settings for these tax bases, in our view they would be more technical rather than structural. In our view, the LTIB should take the opportunity to consider: ● The impact of broadening the current tax bases on future revenue adequacy and economic efficiency, in the light of future changes to New Zealand’s workforce, technological changes (e.g. the impact of generative artificial intelligence on labour), and expected future revenue needs. ● New Zealand’s wider economic strategy and the role of tax policy within that strategy. In our view, there are three tax-related levers available to future Governments to address some of the challenges outlined in the consultation paper: -Increase rates of tax on existing tax bases. This would need to consider potential rate misalignment issues for different legal entities, the competitiveness of New Zealand’s corporate tax rate, and the overall mix of revenue from labour, consumption, and capital. To the extent that an increase in GST rates is considered, we support the suggestion in the paper to explore offsetting measures to reduce the regressive impact of such an increase. -New tax bases. We can appreciate the need to consider alternative tax bases given the inflexibility of our company and personal tax rates in raising revenue. One option is to broaden the tax base further, in effect taxing things that currently sit outside the existing tax system. A number of options have been the topic of discussion over the last few years, in particular leading up to the 2023 general election, and include the introduction of a comprehensive capital gains tax or a wealth tax. It is also noted that New Zealand currently has relatively few corrective taxes (such as environmental taxes). -Growing existing tax bases. Consideration should also be given towards whether tax policy settings (and economic policy more generally) could help contribute to raising more revenue from existing tax settings by “growing the pie”. For example, Ireland has a lower tax-to-GDP ratio than New Zealand but in dollar terms collects a higher amount of revenue (while maintaining a lower level of government debt). Inland Revenue’s previous LTIB considered several such potential tax changes - we consider that this LTIB should build on this previous work. ● Opportunities presented by technological change, and the extent to which this could change how the tax system could operate in the future. For example, technological changes could allow for real-time reporting and collection of consumption taxes at the point of sale - this may increase collection of tax from existing tax bases, without wider structural policy change. Alternatively, policy changes could be made in the future to consumption tax - including how technology could be used to mitigate against the regressivity of consumption taxes (i.e. make it possible to administer more complex but economically sound policy/tax system design). PwC3 Do you think we should consider both options for a future tax system that may have higher revenue needs and options at current revenue levels? In our view, the LTIB presents an opportunity for more “blue sky” thinking regarding the structure of New Zealand’s tax system. Further, other non-tax levers could be available to future Governments in relation to meeting its future revenue needs or managing its expenditure. As such, while the LTIB should be cognisant of the challenges facing the tax system and the wider fiscal position, in our view the review should not be overly focussed on meeting specific revenue needs. Rather, it should be a holistic review of what an optimal tax system looks like (taking into account revenue adequacy, economic efficiency, fairness, compliance costs, and overall coherence), in the light of the various challenges outlined in the consultation paper and our letter. The LTIB should focus on what is the right mix of tax bases for New Zealand going forward which adapts to changes in the wider environment and enables flexibility to raise more revenue if required. Yours sincerely Sandy Lau Partner PwC4 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) Appendix Responses to questions Does the environmental scan identify the key challenges facing our tax system over the long term? The environmental scan identifies several key challenges that the New Zealand tax system will face over the long term. In particular, the paper highlights challenges include demographic shifts, particularly an ageing population, which is expected to exert downward pressure on income tax revenue as a larger share of the population transitions into retirement. The consequence of this is the slowing down of New Zealand’s economic growth and expenditure pressures from pension and health care costs. There are also other challenges that New Zealand faces that should be taken into account in the context of this review: • Productivity: New Zealand’s productivity growth has lagged behind other developed economies, and this remains a significant concern. Without a significant improvement in productivity growth, New Zealand’s tax system will continue to come under pressure. Productivity is important for sustaining long-term economic growth, and without improvements, the country’s tax system will face increasing strain. Low productivity growth limits wage increases, stifles business profitability, and curtails government revenue. • Controlling inflation and cost of living: Persistent inflation has resulted in a cost-of-living crisis. Rising prices for essential goods, housing, and services are putting increasing pressure on households • Housing affordability: Housing affordability has emerged as one of the most significant social and economic challenges in New Zealand. The rapid increase in property prices over the past decade has put homeownership out of reach for many, especially younger generations. • Healthcare: New Zealand faces significant fiscal challenges, particularly in manageing healthcare expenditure. New Zealand’s healthcare system is facing critical issues of equity, accessibility and financial sustainability. Healthcare expenditure is set to rise as the population ages, placing increasing pressure on government resources. • Debt levels: The cost of debt servicing is becoming a growing concern, particularly as interest rates rise and government borrowing increases. Treasury has flagged that structural deficits are expected for the foreseeable future, with some interpreting this as an indication that these deficits may become a permanent feature of the fiscal landscape. • Technological disruption: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), is reshaping the future of work and labour productivity, posing significant challenges and opportunities for New Zealand tax system. As AI automates manual labour and the population ages, reliance on traditional tax bases like Pay As You Earn (PAYE) may decline, requiring a re-evaluation of how taxes are generated. The briefing paper briefly acknowledges the issues in paragraphs 132-135 stating the issues are mainly in relation to tax administration. The issues concerning technological disruption is beyond just tax administration. Shifts in the balance between labour and capital will need to be addressed to ensure the tax system remains fit for purpose. The rise of digital technologies also calls for a review of the rules around "permanent establishments," as remote work enables more employees to work offshore for New Zealand-based employers as well as the rise of AI driven businesses. We agree there is a need for a more in-depth examination of how technological disruption impacts the tax system including both the tax base and tax administration, which should be conducted in parrallel to deveopments at a global level. This raises questions about the long-term sustainability of New Zealand’s fiscal policy and its capacity to fund essential services without exacerbating public debt levels. It will be important to ensure New Zealand’s tax system can support these looming deficits and the country’s growing expenditure needs. While we are not necessarily suggesting that the tax system should directly address these challenges, we believe it is essential to acknowledge their potential impacts. Solutions may lie within the tax system, outside it, or in a combination of both. How well positioned is our current tax system to respond to these challenges? The current New Zealand tax system has strengths and weaknesses in its ability to respond to the identified challenges. On one hand, the system's reliance on income and consumption taxes provides a stable revenue stream. However, New Zealand’s current tax system does not provide a genuinely broad-based and low-rate structure, which will continue to exert upward pressure on income tax rates. In addition, the flat rate structure to the GST may hinder its responsiveness to changing economic conditions and demographic trends. Ageing population and retirement income policy New Zealand’s tax system relies heavily on taxes like the income tax and GST. This provides a stable revenue stream to fund public expenditures, including healthcare and public pensions ( New Zealand Superannuation). As the population ages, healthcare and pension costs are projected to rise substantially. The current system, which relies on income tax and GST, may struggle to generate sufficient revenue to fund public pensions. New Zealand’s tax system does not provide a genuinely broad-based and low-rate structure, as exclusions, such as a comprehensive CGT regime, continue to apply pressure on income tax rates. The working-age population is shrinking relative to the growing retired population, which creates a tax revenue gap. Fewer working-age individuals will be paying income taxes while a larger number of retirees draw on pension benefits and healthcare services. There is merit in evaluating the recalibration of the tax mix to create opportunities to lower rates while maintaining a stable revenue stream. This could better position New Zealand to address demographic shifts related to an ageing population and the rising costs of healthcare and pensions. Unlike many international countries (not limited to the OECD) that rely heavily on payroll taxes or social security contributions, New Zealand’s tax system funds public pensions (New Zealand Superannuation) through general taxation. To some degree this simplifies the system. However, there is also a need to consider reforms in New Zealand’s retirement income policy in parallel to any review of New Zealand’s tax system to ensure it is fit for purpose to meet the economic and social challenges that lie ahead. For example, considerations can include making KiwiSaver compulsory; examining how superannuation contributions to funds should be taxed eg considering the Exempt-Exempt-Taxed or EET principle; increasing contributions progressively and introduce a new means tested New Zealand superannuation regime. Productivity In the face of an ageing population and increasing costs of superannuation and healthcare, the briefing paper identifies that productivity growth will be an important source of economic growth. New Zealand has a low level of labour productivity compared to the average OECD country. As the population ages, the downward pressure on income tax revenue must be addressed to ensure the tax system does not act as a disincentive to encourageing higher participation rates among older workers and women. In addition, a tax system that is compatible with investment in innovation, technology, and skills development, and measures to support entrepreneurship will be important for boosting productivity. New Zealand’s corporate tax rate, currently set at 28%, has become less competitive compared to those in other OECD countries, raising concerns about the potential negative impact on investment and economic growth. A widening gap between personal, corporate, and investment vehicles like portfolio investment entities (PIEs) creates opportunities for tax avoidance and inefficiencies within the tax system, undermining public trust and compliance. It is important to recognise that the corporate tax rate effectively serves as little more than a withholding tax. Many shareholders ultimately face additional taxation at their marginal rates, which diminishes the impact of any corporate tax reductions. Consideration should be given to a more aligned tax structure that reduces discrepancies among these rates. By more closely harmonising the tax rates, New Zealand can enhance its attractiveness to both domestic and foreign investors, fostering a more conducive environment for economic growth. International tax settings warrant increased attention in the context of New Zealand’s tax reform, particularly given the country's ongoing challenges as a capital importer facing productivity issues and a shortage of capital. Attracting capital has been a persistent struggle for New Zealand, yet this critical issue receives only short mentions in the briefing paper. A more robust focus on international tax policies could enhance New Zealand’s ability to compete for foreign investment. Controlling inflation and cost of living Tax adjustments (such as income tax bracket indexation or using the transfer system in a targeted way to reduce the net cost on essential goods and services for lower income households) can be ways to provide relief to households under pressure from inflation and rising costs. We support the principle of indexing marginal tax rates to inflation and by not adopting this approach it places New Zealand among a minority of OECD countries. Indexation not only preserves the integrity of the tax system by preventing bracket creep but also better meets the principle of equity. While concerns have been raised about potential inflationary impacts, we believe that significant increases in government expenditure are far more likely to provoke inflation than adjusting tax thresholds to account for rising costs of living. Housing affordability & property Whether housing affordability can be addressed through tax policy has been contentious in countries like Australia and there is a need for better evidence and modelling of the subsequent secondary impacts of any changes to the tax policy settings for housing. For example, considerations should include how the changes in the tax policy setting for housing impact investment in property, supply and rental prices. Land supply and regulatory constraints are also factors at play that contribute to escalating housing costs. Reforming land use regulations, planning restrictions and providng better incentives to infrastructure financing to enhance the availability of land for development are also factors to consider in tackling the fundamental supply issues that drive housing unaffordability. Do you agree with the focus on how to maintain a stable core structure of the tax system while ensuring the system has flexibility to adapt to different revenue and distributional objectives over time? In considering whether New Zealand should focus on maintaining a stable core structure of its tax system while allowing for flexibility to adapt to varying revenue and distributional objectives, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons of such an approach, as well as explore alternative solutions, for example instead of looking to opportunities to raise revenue, comprehensive expenditure review should be undertaken. A stable core structure of the tax system is important for fostering economic confidence and ensuring predictable revenue streams. Stability in tax structures can provide taxpayer certainty and enhance compliance. A stable tax framework enables businesses to plan for the long term and make informed investment decisions. However, a stable tax system can also pose challenges particularly in responding to evolving challenges New Zealand faces and the shift in societal needs, and economic shocks. For instance, during economic downturns, a flexible tax system can allow for adjustments that provide necessary relief to taxpayers and stimulate economic activity. Different tax bases can yield varying impacts on economic growth and equity, and thus a comprehensive analysis is necessary to inform policy decisions. On the other hand, the flexibility of the tax system can lead to complications such as increased complexity. Frequent changes to tax policies can create uncertainty for investment decisions, making it difficult for taxpayers to model future costs, returns, and overall financial outcomes. Thus, while flexibility can be beneficial, it must be balanced with the need for a stable core structure to avoid undermining public trust in the tax system. While flexibility in the tax system is essential for adapting to changing revenue and distributional objectives, it is important that this does not undermine the stability and integrity of the core tax structure. The introduction of the 39% individual tax bracket demonstrates the risks of prioritising short-term flexibility without considering broader impacts on the tax system. The recent increase in individual tax rates contradicts the broad-base, low-rate principle and incentivises income sheltering behavior. To address this, integrity measures, such as adjusting the trustee income tax rate, were introduced. However, these changes created further complexity by introducing two rates for the same tax base, increasing administrative and compliance burdens, while generating relatively modest revenue.. Alternative solutions, such as conducting a comprehensive expenditure review should also be considered. Expenditure reviews can help identify inefficiencies and areas where public spending can be optimised. By focusing on the spending side of the equation, the government can avoid over-reliance on making frequent adjustments to the tax system to address fiscal imbalances. A comprehensive expenditure review that is undertaken regularly helps ensure that public funds are used effectively before resorting to adjustments to the tax system to raise revenue. Do you agree that understanding the pros and cons of different approaches to income and consumption tax is important for understanding what tax system would be suitable for the future? Understanding the pros and cons of different approaches to income and consumption tax is essential for shaping a suitable future tax system. Different tax structures can have varying impacts on economic growth, equity, and efficiency. For instance, while income taxes may promote equity, heavy reliance on income taxes can also disincentivise work and investment, whereas consumption taxes, while less progressive, can encourage savings and investment. Revisiting a proposal to introduce a CGT in New Zealand requires careful consideration of the lessons from the Tax Working Group (TWG) proposals in 2019 1 , which were ultimately rejected due to concerns over fairness, complexity, and potential impacts on investment behaviour. The TWG's recommendations, particularly the proposed 33% marginal tax rate without inflation adjustments, were seen by many as overly punitive. The pros and cons of alternative approaches should be explored as part of this review, such as grandfathering rules so that the new rules apply to asset purchased after a specific date (such as Australia’s pre and post CGT concept), incorporating inflation adjustments to tax only real gains, introducing exemptions or concessions for personal use assets or small businesses, and implementing roll-over relief for reinvested gains. Given the sensitivity surrounding this issue, ongoing dialogue with key stakeholders will be essential to fostering a constructive discussion on what a workable CGT could look like for New Zealand. Evaluating the potential of land taxes and increasing the GST rate offers both opportunities and challenges. Pros include the efficiency of land taxes, as land is immobile and less likely to be affected by market distortions. Increasing GST could simplify the tax system and broaden the revenue base, especially as consumption patterns evolve. It could also mitigate some of the tension highlighted in the paper from the altering the interaction between the personal tax system and the taxation of entities. However, cons include concerns about equity—higher GST rates can disproportionately affect lower-income households, worsening inequality if not addressed properly. The tax and transfer system could be adjusted to compensate low-income taxpayers through targeted offsets, ensuring that the tax system remains fair while encourageing economic growth. A comprehensive analysis of these trade-offs will be important, particularly in light of ongoing debates about tax reform and the potential introduction of new tax bases to address current and future challenges. Do you agree that we should consider what is taxed under our current main two bases, and if there are any bases it makes sense to add to our tax mix? The income tax system in New Zealand has been critiqued for its progressive nature, which, while aimed at equity, may inadvertently discourage higher earnings due to the disincentives created by higher marginal tax rates. The reliance on income taxes can disproportionately affect those with variable income streams, such as self-employed individuals or those in precarious employment situations, thereby raising concerns about fairness and stability. Conversely, the consumption tax, primarily implemented through the GST, provides a more stable revenue source that is less sensitive to economic fluctuations. Consumption taxes tend to be less distortionary than income taxes, as they do not penalise savings and investment. However, they can be regressive, disproportionately impacting lower-income households who spend a larger share of their income on consumption. There has been recent 1 New Zealand Government, Tax Working Group. Future of Tax: Final Report. Vol. I: Recommendations and Vol. II: Design Details of the Proposed Extension of Capital Gains Taxation, 21 Feb. 2019. literature 2 on adjustments that can be made to ensure the GST is less regressive. While the IMF’s suggestion of a progressive VAT is noted, we believe that the current system of transfer payments through the welfare system already plays an important role in addressing the regressive impacts of consumption taxes. In New Zealand, the consideration of alternative revenue sources, including inheritance, estate and wealth taxes, must take into account the lessons learned from international experiences. For instance, while some European countries, have implemented wealth taxes, the overall success and sustainability of these measures remain contentious. The OECD's report on wealth taxation 3 outlines both the advantages and disadvantages of such taxes, suggesting that they may not be the panacea for fiscal challenges faced by governments. The effectiveness of wealth taxes can be undermined by tax avoidance strategies employed by high net wealth individuals, who can shift their assets to lower-tax jurisdictions. These issues were also highlighted in a recent OECD report on Taxation and Inequality 4 reporting on the declining reliance on revenues from inheritance and wealth taxes i n OECD countries. In addition, an American economist 5 recently noted that one of the biggest and often overlooked issues with a wealth tax is how it benefits foreigners at the expense of domestic investors. While local taxpayers would face higher taxes on unrealised capital gains, non-resident foreigners would remain largely exempt from these taxes. As a result, local investors would have a financial incentive to sell their assets to foreigners, lowering domestic ownership of productive capital. Over time, this would erode the wealth of local investors while increasing foreign ownership of key local assets. The risk of significant outmigration, particularly to Australia, is real and could be exacerbated if a wealth tax were introduced in New Zealand. It is also worth noting that economists (including French economist, Thomas Picketty) 6 acknowledge that wealth and inheritance taxes are only effective if systematic and consistent, both at a domestic and global level, requiring more intensive international coordination. As noted above, expenditure reviews could assist in identifying inefficiencies in public spending and ensuring that tax revenues are utilised effectively. By focusing on how public funds are allocated, New Zealand could enhance the overall efficiency of its fiscal policy, potentially reducing the need for frequent tax adjustments and allowing for a more stable tax environment. Do you think we should consider both options for a future tax system that may have higher revenue needs and options at current revenue levels? The consideration of options for a future tax system that accommodates both higher revenue needs and current revenue levels is necessary but there also needs to be a review of government expenditures. As New Zealand faces increasing fiscal pressures, particularly from an ageing population and rising public expenditure demands, it is worthwhile modelling both incremental reform options to the existing tax structure and more radical changes that could fundamentally alter the tax landscape. By evaluating these options, the New Zealand IR can provide a roadmap for sustainable fiscal policy that meets the needs of future generations. In addition, the adequacy of New Zealand’s retirement income policy should be reviewed to ensure it addresses the challenges posed by an ageing population and ensuring that all citizens can enjoy a dignified retirement. Together with a review of the tax system, retirement income policy should be subject to regular reviews to adapt to changing demographics, economic conditions, and societal needs. This allows policymakers to identify emerging challenges and opportunities, ensuring that the retirement income framework remains relevant and effective. 2 Swistak, A., & de la Feria, R. (2024).

With reference to https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/-/media /project/ir/tp/publications/2024/2024- feedback-ltib/ltib.pdf? Specific responses to LTIB 2024 Taxation Policy report items :- Item 23. Questions – We are seeking your feedback on the scope of the proposed topic of our next LTIB as outlined in this document. We provide the following questions to guide responses: • Does the environmental scan identify the key challenges facing our tax system over the long term? Answer : Some of the statistics are quite deficient and omit key factors like the real effect of inflation. The study cannot separate the tax system from the productive income producing efforts, and social policy they are intertwined and inter-dependent. The most important key factors as I see them in order of importance are – 1. New Zealand’s work force has a lack of productivity and is severely hampered by leftist government policy, this is not working – for example changing land use away from farming, cutting off the most productive sector of the economy at the knees. Improper application of climate change polices killing productive land use. Distortion of energy use in to far more expensive and less efficient modes that also are not working effectively. NZ already has its largest hydro – electric sources working just fine. If only maintenance and capital upgrades could be met. Also oil, gas and coal are in plenty, and sufficient to tide the country over the next 10 plus years transition at least. The work ethic of the current generation is different from those of the boomer generation now retiring. This is neither a positive or negative statement, the two generations have different ethos’s and outcomes for you to study. 2. NZ clearly has an aging demographic - referred later in this response. 3. Government policy with its short term \[ three year\] attention span is inconsistent, unreliable and full of bad decisions. While it is not the purpose of this report to criticise the government some headway could be made if the Government and IRD could map the s 9(2)(a) people relationship of policy – productivity – prosperity. Without this equation being solved the taxation policy review will fail. • How well positioned is our current tax system to respond to these challenges? Answer: As they currently stand the range of tax rates except those for Trusts and Maori businesses are equitable and what the population have become accustomed to. Trust taxation rate at 39% is clearly punitive and unfounded for reasons discussed later in this submission. Similarly the Maori rate is selectively racially biased and discriminates against all other multi-cultural ethnic groups \[25%\] that collectively outnumber Maori. Again please note the reasons outlined later in the document. • Do you agree with the focus on how to maintain a stable core structure of the tax system while ensuring the system has flexibility to adapt to different revenue and distributional objectives over time? Answer : in principle yes, but in order for this to succeed the study has to recognise and future proof the changing nature of the earning workforce. Namely the creation of new types of employment / businesses that will increase 50 % over the next five years, the development of new skills not yet being taught or existing. The problem with New Zealand’s tax system is that in addition to being the funding source for core government services – Education, medical system, Law and order etc. its main downfall is that it is a socialist wealth re-distribution vehicle. This can only survive in the short term. If you look to the systems elsewhere world wide this system has ultimately broken down. New Zealand has also entered this entropy phase. For some perspective please see the quotes at the end of this document. • Do you agree that understanding the pros and cons of different approaches to income and consumption tax is important for understanding what tax system would be suitable for the future? Answer: yes, definitly but the problem is that the few percents of rich are getting richer and The so called huge middle is getting squeezed and becoming much, much poorer this is where the taxation fiscal dilemma lies at the moment. It is anticipated that this will get steadily worse as the earning workforce shrinks. Increasing immigration will only work if the right skilled and qualified people are introduced. Fruit pickers for example while necessary for short seasonal work are not going to solve the ‘brain drain’ skills shortage that NZ has always suffered from. • Do you agree that we should consider what is taxed under our current main two bases, and if there are any bases it makes sense to add to our tax mix? Answer: Income tax and Consumption taxes are the two most reliable, tried and true methods. A Capital gains tax does exist in NZ but not on the family home – to do so would be election suicide for any incoming government. They are not entirely successful overseas. Wealth taxes, again not successful overseas. Inheritance taxes are entirely unfair and unjust in the sense that the state has no right to interfere with a deceased’s right to devolve their tax paid savings or their tax paid home as they see fit - that is their right. This form of taxation has caused major problems in the UK where it has been in place for many years. Stamp duty and Gift Duty also were quite inequitable as IRD know full well. • Do you think we should consider both options for a future tax system that may have higher revenue needs and options at current revenue levels? Answer: The higher revenue needs are fuelled primarily by inflation and loss of buying power. So until inflation i.e the unofficial actual real income and asset inflation is brought under control – or close to zero, then IRD will always have to have higher revenue needs. If there is a major economic downturn then those earning or experiencing business losses will detract from the revenue tax base. You cannot stop this. Nineteen years ago the submitter discontinued a Wedding and Conference function business because - 1. Local body council compliance costs and overheads were too high 2. We could not afford to be IRD’s book keeper in terms of student loans, employment law requirements, and administrative overhead. 3. Earnings were insufficient to generate profits \[ and tax\] 4. The market simply did not want to pay what the cost of doing business was, so we got out. Item 25. Yes, you may contact the presenter to discuss the points raised in this submission Item 26. Only providing my name and personal details are redacted and not leaked to any social media, mainstream media or any other government agencies, for obvious privacy reasons. Item 28. “We collect around a third of gross domestic product (GDP) in tax” indicat es specifically that overall 33.3% of all revenue is income tax ‘officially’ - that is the collective averaged rate. If the effect of consumption tax GST is added the average collective tax base increases to 38% \[33.3 x 1.15. without including the effect of the ‘erosion’ tax of inflation reducing earning and buying power, which has not been factored in. Please note the earning aspect is only the first stage in the monetary cycle, consumption taxes \[ GST\] is a ‘tax on a tax’ for an income that has been previously taxed to have the money free to spend on food and fuel which in New Zealand’s case is effectively double taxed. The submitter trusts that the policy group can understand the true logic here, not the simplistic academic misrepresentation that looks good on a report paper? Item 29. “ New Zealand has for many years followed a broad-based low-rate approach to taxation “ The claim of a “low rate” is unfounded for the reason cited in item 28 above. Take the effect of the overall tax and duties on Fuel – Petrol and Diesel are close to 50% of the tax on these items. It is a tax on a duty, and then double taxed by GST added to the tax on the tax. The lucrative taxes on cigarettes and alcohol and other luxury items are also taxed far in excess of the “average”, because they provide lucrative ‘easy revenue’ to the government far in excess in of what they cost in medical downstream terms. A collective tax approaching 38% is not a low rate. This 38% is also underpinned by the fact that Government ‘officially’ spends approximately 40 cents in the dollar of ALL New Zealand GDP. The net government expenditure \[ 2022 \] of $143 Bn here https://www.stats.govt.nz/information- releases/government-finance-statistics-general-government-year-ended-june-2022 are unadjusted for the inflationary devaluation of buying power \[ money printing with no offset counter of productivity \] using the matched 2022 Expenditure $143 Bn over the 2024 GDP of $415 Bn ex https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics /countries/NZL/new-zealand/gdp-gross- domestic-product yields a ratio of government spending of 34% - not the “official” 38% but no doubt exacerbated by the excessive borrowing and money printing to fund the Covid 19 response. A costly tax on all of New Zealand with no productivity returns to justify or finance its implementation. It is expe cted that the 2024 figures will be worse and the submitter requests that the ITIB team assess this update for relativity and add this addendum to the report. Item 31. “Local government levies “rates” based on property values “ While technically not a tax, Local body rating levies are a levy recovery for the local body community services – Three waters, Roading and Community services etc, but actually have the effect of being a “tax” on household expenditure; while it may be 5% of Government collection it represents far more than that figure on a per household basis taking the averaged collective tax rate upwards of 41 % \[38 +3\]. Anecdotally Rating levy increases for 2024 have been around the high teens per cents. \[Wellington 20% , Kapiti 17.13+ without taking into effect property revaluation creep \] Item 32 As reported 28.4% is incorrect both in absolute and statistical terms and does not reconcile with the Department of Stats figures or objective assessment. Item 36 – is misleading in the sense that it does not show the analysis of the breakdown of constituent tax components. It is a valid OIA request under the 1982 Act to request to see the breakdown of each party contribution - e.g. individuals 52%, Companies 17% etc. That funds the reported percentages of tax on page 10. For example the ‘other indirects’ does not reconcile with the statement in item 36 that local government rates are 5.5% of GDP when total Other Indirect is stated as 6% - presumably to include duties, levies , on alcohol, luxury items etc which will be far in excess of 0.5%. Item 36. “At the general government level, local government rates are around 5.5% of general government tax revenue, or 1.9% of GDP.” And 84. “Every OECD country levies some form of recurrent tax on immoveable property. New Zealand does so i n the form of local government rates , which raised 1.9% of GDP in 2021. Across the OECD, revenue from these taxes ranged from 0.1% (in Luxembourg) to 3.0% (in Canada) of GDP in 2021, with an average of 1%” From the statistics supplied New Zealand has one of the highest Local Body rating levy levels in the OECD at 1.9% of GDP compared to the average of 1.0% Item 43. GST “25.0% in 2023 (on a consolidated basis).” The prob lem with this is that the graph does not show who is paying the 25 % GST – only then can it be useful to gauge who is bearing that tax burden – probably weighted to the Companies side but is unclear as represented in the report . Item 52. “The rules for taxing Māori authorities use similar principles, with tax being applied to Māori authority taxable income at the rate of 17.5% “ This rate is clearly discriminative affording a preferential racially biased advantage to an ethnic minority that contravenes the equality of all races under the NZ Human Rights and Bill of Right Acts. This issue that the current tax regime does not address in addition to the discriminative 17% tax rate is that a very large number of Maori businesses are afforded even further privilege by the extant fact that they are registered under the registered Charities Act 2005 and actually pay NO tax at all on their business earnings and profits on an equitable basis that all other New Zealand Businesses have to comply with. The treaty of Waitangi specified that all New Zealanders were equal under the law and did not specify preferential treatment for one class of New Zealanders in the taxation system. Item 54. “ The fourth income tax regime is trusts. Trustee income (that is, income taxable to the trust) is taxed at a flat rate. This is 39% ...” This is clearly punitive and quite inequitable compared to the preferential and biased Maori business and Company tax rates. The purpose of Trusts is to protect assets from inappropriate claims, and in a major sense the intention of a Trust is to re-distribute and devolve wealth and assets to Families or within arms length parties that in a Familial and Whanau sense is a private re-distribution of wealth, a ‘tax’ – actually doing the IRD’s work for them. Similar in a sense to bequests made under a Will and last Testament. Wealth or Death Taxes would not be necessary if authoritarian governments simply allowed individuals, families, trusts and companies to attend to their own business of passing on and channelling tax paid or earned savings to those deemed necessary to benefit from them. It is not for the Government or IRD to decide or intercede what right is personally best for the entity who has earned or saved to pass on those private tax paid earnings or savings. Government interference in this arena has and will continue to receive strong pushback from the right to free will and initiate the design and use of other vehicles to achieve private goals. Item 56. “ Inflation can change the level of progressivity of the tax and transfer system” Fiscal drag is real, what the report does not address is the loss in buying power of the inflated \[ devalued\] earning and real asset buying power. Tax bracket creep ensures that the government progressively takes more and more from the tax take. The government working hand in hand with the RBNZ New Zealanders have suffered incredible buying power loss – An example:- in 1980 the submitter and partner purchased an old two flat property - a 1901 villa in Mt Cook central Wellington for $29,500 on joint salaries of $13,500 + $15,000. Forty odd years later in September 2021 it marketed for $1.5 M in 2024 it fell back to slightly over $1.0M this clearly demonstrates the extent of fiscal and monetary policy interference that the Government and its RBNZ subjects its taxpayers to. Incidentally the submitter’s Wife did not like living in central Wellington and within six months we had bought a run down 1900’s property in Berhampore from a property trader for $25,000 with a $3,500 credit card deposit. Item 57. Simply demonstrates that the government cannot live within its means and needs to take more and more from its citizens at a rate exceeding inflationary and fictitious ‘growth’. Item 60. “Average transfers are larger for lower income deciles,” The problem IRD face is that the middle income earners are being squeezed by inflation, loss of buying power due to money printing, and general lack of productivity compared to OECD comparative country performance . The bulk of the tax base is becoming poorer and will increasingly become unable to support or fund the transfer payments to the lower income deciles under this current socialist policy. Transfers of wealth are only possible providing: • The lower poorer deciles are not expanding – which they are • The middle income earners class are growing – which they are not • The wealthy top 5% continue to pay a fair share of the tax burden – which they are not Item 66. “Therefore, we have adjusted the OECD’s figures for New Zealand to exclude GST on public services, to the extent it is likely to result in an artificially high ratio for New Zealand, “ This is a clear word distortion by IRD – it is no t an “artificially high ratio” – it is an actual high tax ratio Item 67. The tax as a proportion of the economy is closer to 38% - 40 % based on actual government expenditure and the compounding effect of consumption tax increased by inflation. It is not a simplistic calculation. Item 68. The level of tax revenue as a proportion of the economy from 1965 to 2023 being “24.5% to 34.6%” will likely reach 50 % by 2050 based on the factors of aging demographic, inflation, and fall in productivity – again this is not a simplistic calculation the ITiB report does not disclose the true calculation for NZ. Item 81 The statement “New Zealand is unusual among OECD countries in not having a general tax on income from capital gains” is a blatant misrepresentation. New Zealand does a have capital gains tax on property with the bright line test, and with capital gains on share investments etc. Item 92. “ “New Zealand’s company income tax rate is currently higher than the OECD average” This should clearly be reduced back to 17 % to put it back in line with the preferential bias for Maori businesses – or alternatively for the sake of equity Maori businesses should be increased to 28 % Similarly Trust taxation should be brought back to 28% for the sake of equity. The intentional and punitive distortion by Government is not acceptable and should be discontinued. Currently the 28,000 Charities in NZ receive $16 Billion of tax breaks from the government - The Charities Register should be investigated for companies who are actually using that vehicle to hide or ring fence their commercial profits – essentially defrauding the IRD, and cheating the rest of New Zealand from paying their ‘fair share’. Item 95. “the OECD calculated that New Zealand’s EMTR was higher than all but three other countries” For the record “real interest rate of 3% and an inflation rate of 1%” is complete nonsense over the specified time period. Where realistic and truthful input factors are not represented correctly the resulting EMTR assumptions will be false. Item 99 “New Zealand’s \[ GST \] ratio was the highest in the OECD and significantly higher than the second highest ratio.” Clearly shows how inequitable and unfair New Zealan d’s GST tax base is when compared to all other countries. This requir es correction. Item 100 “New Zealand raises a higher level of revenue from GST, relative to GDP, than the OECD average” Mirroring the inequitable high tax level and base in Item 99. This requires correction. Items 106-112 “Demographics” All OECD countries are experiencing demographic transformation, including the well known examples of China and Japan. Couples cannot afford to have children - mostly thanks to the rising of cost of living , engineered reserve bank inflationary interference and direct anti – family conditioning by the universities touting leftist feminist polices promoting that it is best to have a career \[ and earn money \] than it is to have a family. Sorry Ladies, but you cannot have your cake and eat it too, as many have found out. And, s orry IRD you to cannot have your cake and eat it too. If the families do not produce children then there are fewer lambs to become sheeple to fuel the machine. It is just that simple, read up Darwin and Orwell. Importing low skilled labour by immigration can tend to make the matters worse by burdening infrastructure and resources. In this area often earned income is channelled to the countries of origin and the workers cannot be blamed for that. Items 113-117 “Labour Force” For decades New Zealand has suffered from a ‘brain drain’, mostly across the Tasman but many to farer and fairer fields. If New Zealand cannot pay its skilled staff to thrive in a cost of living crisis then this will continue to happen as it has for the submitter’s experienced past. In 1992 for example he was forced to go and work in Australia in the IT field because there was no work in NZ, nothing has changed. Sure the demographic of the workforce is aging, we are losing our skill base as they retire. Take the example of Russia, the average age of electrical and calibration engineers is over 65 and they have to import engineers for example from Bulgaria to commission and bring new manufacturing installations on-line. New Zealand is no different , except that the mainstream media no longer report on it as it is not ‘sensational’ enough. New Zealand has been on a slippery skill slope for decades and until this is rectified our skill shortage will not regulate. The replacement rate in New Zealand has fallen below the required 2.1 live births to 1.56 per birthing woman, this has been by choice, career choice, because of cost pressures, and the effects of unforeseen medical interventions. From the statistics it is not clear that immigration will fill this gap. Items 118 – 119 “slowing Economic Growth” New Zealand is hamstrung by its economic structural deficit – DEBT! Not just government debt but private debt . An increasing tax policy will not resolve this. We do not produce enough to pay our way in the world – molly coddled \[ hoodwinked \] by a ‘nanny state’ that now cannot balance the books means that we are ‘stuffed’ to put it bluntly. On the one hand you have minority leftist greenwashing lobby groups brainwashed by the woke universities telling the children, students and earning population that we must cut out our meat and dairy producing farms, destroy our industries that rely on fossil fuels – pretty much all of them, convert to dangerous EV inflammable technology , hammer the rich with ‘envy ‘ taxes and the IRD and the government are dealing with an nihilistic leftist woke cancel culture intent on destroying any attempt or effort at producing an honest or profitable living. Until the Government and IRD resolve this brick wall to economic growth no amount of theorising reports around the coffee machine is going to make a scrap of difference. Please wake up to the real world, not the ideologies you have been spoon feed by your nanny state labour party comrades. Item 120 - “Labour Productivity” “New Zealand’s level of labour productivity was only 62% of the median of a group of 19 OECD countries.” This is the most telling statistic affecting Taxation policy – if the working population is not allowed the freedom to be productive whether that be by employment or entrepreneurship then taxation creep and inequitable tax policy will be a further dis-incentive to work productively if the worker or business is deprived of the right to access their own wealth by hard work penalised by ever increasing taxes. Furthermore government policy needs to look hard at the reasons why their over –arching leftist socialist policies are not working. Fiscal Pressure items 122 - 144 Item 123 Actuarial sequestering of individual citizen’s taxation paid savings contribution to fund future Superannuation liability – i.e. Taxed at source and held in that person’s name actuarially. The submitter personally addressed this issue with the late Michael Cullen back in 2004. I n order to safeguard the individual’s right to universal superannuation, it would need subsidisation for the lower paid deciles but this option promotes self responsibility much like the later Kiwisaver programme, its not about the “government will provide for me” – it is about the individual providing for themselves. Self Responsibility. “He who governs least governs best” ~ old chinese proverb Item 124 The tax contributions to NZSF by the entire workforce should be increased to fund the shortfall. The drawdowns should only reflect what is necessary to fund the superannuitants. If the suggestion under item 123 had been implemented twenty years ago the situation would not be the problem it is now. This correction to tax policy is a ‘no-brainer’ and should be seriously considered by the working group. Item 125 In terms of the Health system the elephant in the room here is the refusal of the previous Labour government in acknowledging the damaging effect on future health of New Zealanders by the forced medical intervention of an untested GMO contaminated injection that via CRISPR based DNA intentional interference is actually causing serious cardiac, respiratory , and neurological damage on an ongoing basis in the working population. Refusal to acknowledge the truth is no safeguard to the future failing health of all \[ injected \] New Zealanders and its inescapable effect on the tax base. Item 128 This situation will only intensify. The Taxation authority as represented by IRD has to find ways to tax the online activity – there are numerous ways to do this but it may not be politically or socially acceptable. Item 129-130 Taxing climate change is not going to change the climate effects. At best it is a covert money maker to virtue signal the population into succumbing to yet another tax for the ‘good of the world’ - but really only for the good of the IRD and treasury coffers. Climate taxes will not stop earthquakes, fires, floods, or so called rising sea levels. The climate ‘science’ being touted by local councils has extrapolated the most extreme scenarios that even the IPCC do not support. But it is a billion dollar money maker for the consultant’s Jacob’s etc. Unfortunately the downside is that the fearmongering is forcing down the values of coastal properties, creating uninsurable assets and in generally a hand break on economic development and housing in the affected areas – i.e. a lot of New Zealand. So in actuality all that climate change is going to do for IRD and the government is to reduce the productive tax take. Item 131 “An ecosystem collapse would cost about 2.3% of global GDP annually by 2030” The ecosystem collapse is being engineered intentionally by the UN polices, and as evidenced by the leftist ideologies and implementation of the Labour government 2017 -2023 now deeply affecting the New Zealand primary industry economy. Item 132-133 The report is entering into the world of conjecture here; artificial intelligence has been over sold and over exaggerated as to its effect. True AI is in its infant stages of development. Employment/ career skill types will always change and evolve that has been happening since the Stone Age, Iron Age, Industrial revolution, digital age etc. but is not going to happen as fast as some actors are purporting. All of these ‘revolutions’ have been disruptive to the preceding or reigning civilisation machines. What is happening now world wide is no different. Item 137 The government cannot ‘lift’ employment if the working work force is shrinking – with NZ’s lack of pr oductivity there appears to be considerable lethargy to work hard. Perhaps if the Education system were improved people could learn to work ‘smarter’ , not necessarily harder. The bottom line is that if we cannot afford something we should not take taxes for it. If there is just one takeaway for the policy group from this representation it is this statement: If we cannot afford something we should not take taxes for it. In conclusion some realism aka humour:- “What exactly is your 'fair share' of what 'someone else' has worked for?” ~ Thomas Sowell “One of the biggest taxes is one that is not even called a tax — Inflation. When the government spends money that it creates, it is transferring part of the value of your money to themselves.” ~ Thomas Sowell "It is a way to take people's wealth from them without having to openly raise taxes. Inflation is the most universal tax of all." ~ Thomas Sowell “No society ever thrived because it had a large and growing class of parasites living off those who produce” ~ Thomas Sowell “"The probl em with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples' money." ~ Margaret Thatcher “The government has no money of its own. It's all your money” ~ Margaret Thatcher “Let us never forget this fundamental truth: the State has no source of money other than money which people earn themselves. If the State wishes to spend more it can do so only by borrowing your savings or by taxing you more. It is no good thinking that someone else will pay - that 'someone else' is you. There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers' money.” ~ Margaret Thatcher "Liberals love to say things like, "We're just asking everyone to pay their fair share." But government is not about asking. It is about telling. The difference is fundamental. It is the difference between making love and being raped, between working for a living and being a slave. The Internal Revenue service is not asking anybody to do anything. It confiscates your assets and puts you behind bars if you don't pay." ~ Thomas Sowell "What the welfare system and other kinds of governmental programs are doing is paying people to fail. In so far as they fail, they receive the money; in so far as they succeed, even to a moderate extent, the money is taken away." ~ Thomas Sowell "The welfare state is the oldest con game in the world. First you take people's money away quietly, and then you give some of it back to them flamboyantly." ~ Thomas Sowell "You can only confiscate the wealth that exists at a given moment. You cannot confiscate future wealth - and that future wealth is less likely to be produced when people see that it is going to be confiscated." ~ Thomas Sowell Yours faithfully s 9(2)(a) Appendix 1 Update 3/10/24 This article is included for the Policy group to review as it is a comprehensive discussion in the public domain regarding some pertinent issues within the scope of the ITIB Policy report . It discusses the ‘fors and againsts’ for a CGT and FER \[ Fair Economic return \] taxes as historical propositions. The article published 2/10/24 after this submissions as submitted has the added advantage of a considerable number of public feedback comments from observers and commentators on the subject.

He needs to read up on why so many countries that had a wealth tax eliminated them. But of course, there may be a desire to make NZ a third-world country. by increasing the size of the government and eliminating private investment. • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 18 by K.W. | 2nd Oct 24, 2:18pm I think that is absolutely the plan of the Left. If you drive all the wealthy and aspiring-to -be-wealthy people to Australia or Singapore, then all you are left with is the low income, beneficiary-dependent, and too-thick-to -know-better voters, and voila, "inequality" is solved overnight. And the bonus - you have guaranteed yourself political power for ever. The medical system would collapse. Recent analysis of the Australian negative gearing tax claimants shows that 42% of surgeons own investment properties, half of which are negatively geared. Might go someway to already explaining why we cant get surgeons to want to immigrate to NZ. Govt policies have consequences - not all of them obvious at first sight.

We charge GST on food essentials yet allow property investors tax free capital gains on residential real estate. It's wrong, it's unfair, inequitable and a stain on our social fabric.

You're wrong. • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 31 by GV 27 | 2nd Oct 24, 3:09pm There's a massive leap from a CGT on realised sold investment properties to a wealth tax, if you're going to make sweeping statements and pontificate about what is and isn't wrong. • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 8 by Te Kooti | 2nd Oct 24, 3:45pm Wealth taxes come in many forms, speaking of sweeping statements. Wealthy Kiwi's leaving may even be a good thing because, let's be honest, us property investors are unimaginative and entrepreneurially stunted.

That's like telling on yourself & expecting some kind of reward as a result. Counterproductive. The secret to prosperity would involve incentivizing, not penalizing. You don't get a donkey through a corn field by whipping it. Both sides are so concerned with penalizing one for the sake of the other, that they miss the point entirely. We've had decades of penalizing. Time for a new approach. If the current lot of mps on both sides can't or won't do it, then they need to be told to step aside & let a new generation of leaders give it a go.

It's been around since 2015. Keep up. Taxing something neither makes it more abundant nor cheaper. Cannot tax ones self to wealth. That's more of a left wing socialist labour approach, than right wing basic economics. One would also be much less vocal & in favour of A CGT if it were to be backdated for all historic rentals as well. The only right wing investors in favour of taxing the he'll out of property are those who've invested for decades & simply do not wish the next up & coming investor generation to catch up & compete. Advocating for a 39% self tax of ones assets is essentially cutting off ones nose to spite the face. This doesn't sound like a right wing approach at all, but more a left wing envy tax advocate.

For all intents and purposes the Brightline test is gone, which leaves us the only Western economy without a CGT on residential property investment. It's not right v left, it's getting a fair tax system in place so that struggling families aren't paying tax on food basics while property investors get a free ride. • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 11 by GoWokeGobroke | 2nd Oct 24, 6:51pm 39% CGT would be the taxed rate should it be implemented. The Brightline still target speculators & flippers with its two year period, exactly as it should. Most flippers understand this & factor it in the costing. The purpose of holding properties longer are for eventual cash flow through rental income or to sell for retirement funds. A fair & non biased tax system as you say, taxes either all forms of profit, or no forms at all. Because unlike opinions, both profit & taxes are not biased as to who makes profit & how. So to implement a true fair & non biased tax system, all primary family homes would be heavily taxed upon sale, preventing many households from upgrading in future, all kiwisavers heavily taxed, preventing plenty of would be FHBs from being able to buy, & eventually being able to retire & live off the KS funds, all generational farms heavily taxed when past down from generation to generation, preventing future generations from being able to build on & improve the efforts of the previous generation, all inheritance heavily taxed, preventing many from using this often large fund towards a hone deposit or to pay off a mortgage. Nobody wants a true fair & non biased tax system. The very tax system you advocate is again one of envy tax, by where the idea is to tax those who have, & hopefully it will trickle down to positively effect those who have not. The trickle down theory does not work. One cannot Rob Peter to pay Paul, & expect that it creates equal outcomes & fairness. That's leftist labour gibberish. Again, one cannot tax onesself to financial prosperity. The last 6 years under Labour attempting to do just that should be evident enough of this. In the end, nobody gets a free ride, most particularly those at the bottom just starting out. Labourdecieved many into believing handouts & envy taxes were the way forward, yet has put us backwards. Tenants must learn to pay their way just like everyone else. That means paying adequate rent. It is not the job nor the responsibility of a private landlord to financially educate a tenant, nor is it their responsibility to heavily discount their services out of charity so that tenants may have an easier time to buy a property. That responsibility lands on each individual. In most cases, private landlords first started out as tenants, then becoming home owners. They did all this without handouts & envy taxes. If they can do it, so can other tenants. Blame, denial, deflection & deception causes tenants to remain stagnant. Always someone else's fault why they can't get ahead. Their greedy boses fault for not paying them enough, their greedy landlords fault for charging too much rent. The success starts when the complaining stops & the personal individual accountability starts. One things for certain, a true fair & non biased 39% tax system would put tenants even further back than they are now, likely for life. Shifting both blame & taxes off one entity to another is not the solution. Read less • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 1 by ChrisOfNoFame | 2nd Oct 24, 7:56pm Where did 39% come from? Oh.

It appears not. • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 6 by averagejoe | 2nd Oct 24, 8:02pm CGT is paid at your marginal rate right now, if you are in that tax bracket and you get caught by the bright line tax. The CGT being proposed by Labour and the TWG was at marginal rates. So that is where that comes from. CGT will not be implemented (most likely not at all) but never at marginal rates. So, as long as the left keeps talking like that. Notthing will ever happen. • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 0 by GoWokeGobroke | 2nd Oct 24, 9:27pm 39% is based on the highest tax take, which is generally exactly what the CGT advocates advocate for, the harshest tax penalty for the entities they deem to be making too much profit. Currently the Brightline tax take stands at 33% for an individual & 28% tax for a business entity. What did you understand the advocating CGT % rate to be at? Could I help you to understand this better? Or is advocating for a CGT for just property investment only your alarmist nonsense? Could you explain how taxing something makes it cheaper & brings tenants closer to home ownership? • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 0 by Macawsley | 3rd Oct 24, 6:39am The Church of Ashley needs to find an alternative business model.

All I know is that half of Australia's medical workforce are internationally born (56% of GPs, 47% of Specialists) Australia has no problem attracting skilled surgeons to their hospitals, despite a 45% tax rate on their million dollar salaries (which explains why so many surgeons negatively gear). While NZ can't. It was probably also the threat of the Labour Govts wealth tax (and the invasive IRD investigation into wealthy people's asset holdings) that have put off people like surgeons from moving here, as evidenced by the collapse in people seeking an investment visa. My point is that many things go into the consideration of where to move to when looking to relocate - and the short sightedness of the Left to just "tax everything" will have outcomes that they are currently not foreseeing.

Their surgeons cannot claim Government Super if they reach retirement age and still employed. How much stamp duty did their surgeons pay for each house they buy? You're right on the tax too, 45% versus our "abhorrent" 39% top rate.

The reason is because anyone who has assets in Aus get a reduced pension on the basis of an 'asset test', or no pension at all if the value of assets (or the income they produce) are way above the threshold. Anyone, including surgeons, will find that NZ is actually a better place to retire (from the financial point of view), just because the pension here is not means tested. • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 1 by Hamish | 2nd Oct 24, 4:58pm This might have helped to hang onto a few. https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/473245/pressures-profits-and-patien... • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 0 by Nzdan | 2nd Oct 24, 5:05pm I guess when people's skills become a scarce resource, humility goes out the window.

But at the end of the day homes need to be removed as the main investment vehicle for NZ. Homes should be for people to live in, otherwise all young people will continue to leave for overseas. Unaffordable housing has massive negative implications to society as a whole. Case in point; emergency housing. To accompany this transition, to an affordable and sustainable housing market, tax should not be applied to kiwisaver assets, dividends or gains. And employee contributions should be made tax free, to incentivise everyone to save for their retirement, at minimal/no cost to the govt. Employers need to fund retirements again so follow Australia's lead and force employers to contribute a minimum of 5% into KiwiSaver. KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals prior to 60 should be taxed as income. Kiwisaver first home withdrawals should be capped at 5% of the purchase price.

New builds cost a lot more money than existing properties to buy, therefore landlords need to get a much higher rent for them, so low income tenants are rapidly driven into social housing due to increasing rents and scarcity of older rental properties. And when new builds stop getting built at all (like now) then where do all the new tenants live then? Labour oversaw a 500% increase in the number of families on the public housing waitlist - do we really want a repeat of that until all but the richest of tenants are living in homes funded by the taxpayer?

Not really, rents fell significantly with the boarders being closed. They s tarted rising when they opened again. Supply and demand (demand in the form of new renters can arrive a lot faster off a plane than supply can). The older properties are made scarce by population growth. I do agree rents for new houses are normally higher than an equivalent older house, but population growth is the key driver. • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 2 by GoWokeGobroke | 3rd Oct 24, 10:57am Population growth and poor government policy. There's a reason why rents rose over two and a half times faster under the last Labour governments 6 years than under 9 years of the last National government. There's a reason why rent rose to an all time 17year high of 60% increase in rents and over 548% increase in the government's emergancy social housing wait list during Labours 6 years tampering, restricting & penalizing the housing market. You don't get drastic increases like that in such a short space of time with just immigration alone. C'mon, hold our governments accountable. • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 0 by GoWokeGobroke | 2nd Oct 24, 2:56pm 1. Why exclude the family home? Tax & profit unlike opinions is not envious or biased as to who makes it & how. What you advocate for is no more biased than the current tax system we currently have. Now a fair tax system would either tax all forms of profit, or none at all, regardless of how it's made. This means a hefty tax on primary family.homes, kiwisaver, generational farms, inheritance, stocks & bonds & cryptocurrency. This would be a fair tax system, but of course since the have nots only want the haves to be taxed until they have as little as them, this fair & non biased tax system would hardly be welcomed & which ever government voted it in would quickly be removed come next election. Hence even labour was too timid to try implement. We also already have a hefty CGT on non primary homes, called the brightline tax, which has been in place since 2015. Keep up. 2. Expecting private landlords to supply further housing is not thier job. That is the government's job, something labour failed to do be historic margins, & national know not to re attempt to suffer the same fate. If private landlords are only welcome to invest in new builds, & new builds are.horrendously expensive, then of course the rent will need to actively reflect this as well. Private landlords don't rent homes to those who can't buy out of charity, it is a business, so there needs to be profitability out of private landlording, from either capital gain, or cashflow. One cannot take both away & still expect that a rental market will still exist out of charitable nature. Considering 80% of the rental market is held by private landlords, not government, the government requires private landlords to continue to house nearly half the country that they themselves cannot house in emmergancy social housing. 3. How else are Kiwis suppost to save for their retirement if they are not able to put their equity to good use? NZ Stats shows the average 50yo NZr has just $2,300 saved towards retirement & at age 65yo 90% cannot get.their hands on more than $10,000. Stocks, bonds, crypto much too volatile & risky for most. One cannot save ones self to wealthy or rely heavily on gov assistance come retirement, as pensions alone are not nearly enough to survive on let alone thrive come retirement as a thanks for working 45yrs of one's life away. The ability to use one's equity at very least on the primary residence only is now the primary reason keeping most retirees out of a state of poverty. I'm in full support of this method continuing for the greater good of our country. 4. FHBs already have significant leverage lending abilities and advantages over investors when they only require 10% deposits. Investors still require 30% deposits, thats 3x less money FHBs require. All debt is considered before being approved & investors will have far more debt than a would be FHB. The significant leverage and lending favourbility is tipped about as far as it can go towards the favour of a FHB. Also, when one is just starting out, one can't expect that one has the same advantages & opportunities available to them as someone who has already a proven track record. That's like expecting that a janitor should get paid as much as the CEO of the company, to "retirement the balance", otherwise it's unfair. Who said life was fair? Cannot expect to have it all when first starting out. That's entitlement, not fairness. 5. Banning? Have we not learnt over the last 6 years under Labour what happens when we villyfy those who have, for the sake of those who have not. It always ends up worse off for the have nots. Instead, try.incentivize, not penalize. 6. Short term rentals are nor nearly the problem here.

This is exactly what caused then the election. Labour couldn't deliver what they promised, to fix the housing crisis with a series of cheesy "Let's do this" slogans, and the majority finally woke up & held them accountable. Labours best chance of getting back in would be to not announce any further extreme & unrealistic policies they can't deliver on, and to just play it safe. If they really are better at governing than National, then National will eventually undo themselves, much like Labour did last election. National was practically handed the election with the amount of damage Labour caused. That & the fact that labour got power hungary & started coming after people's personal freedoms. A big no no.

Unfortunately far from reality. Labour spent most of their 6years villyfying, taxing, badgering, private landlords, despite 80% owning just 1 rental property. This again created the largest increase in both property prices, rents, homeless & devide in this countries history. They said no CGT before being elected then extended Brightline Tax out to 10years. The Brightline was introduced by National to capture short term ownership via way of flipping & speculating, not extended out to those private landlords that provide over 80% of the countries rentals to those who cannot buy. How many homes the PM has or how expensive it is is irrelevant. Plenty of Labour mps have multiple houses & multi million dollar mc mansions too, but labour supporters ignore that. No one would vote for a 50yo tenant to run a country, as it speaks volumes of just how they deal & manage their own personal finances. We don't want the country run full of the entitled waiting for their handouts. We had 6 years of that under Labour already. Ardern sealed her own fate when she went too far & attacked individuals freedom, speaking like a true dictator that freedom of speech was an act of terrsism. Exactly why over 75% of last voted did not vote for Labour. Lanour have a long long way to go to improve before they would be voted in again. Expect National for at least the next 2 terms, minimum.

Situations that basically don't exist in Singapore. And Singapore has a significant number of workers commuting from Malaysia for low-wage jobs. How does their medical care compare? It's likely many of those commuting every day from Malaysia will be using medical services in Malaysia rather than Singapore which would take a massive load of Singapore's health system, it looks like they are taking some small steps to change this but it doesn't remove that "advantage" Singapore has that allows a health system like theirs to work so effectively for their citizens.

Basic economics shows an increases cost & risk to operate increases the cost of the service & product. So could you explain how removing interest free student loans somehow incentivizes more people to study? We have a health crisis already, an average student loan for a nurse is 60k, the average for a Dr is 150k. If people are suddenly told they are now to pay interest on that, please explain how you feel more people will be incentivized to study well needed professions? I agree on cutting back on government expenditures though. Could you also explain how removing Winter Energy Payments would somehow put more money into the pockets of already struggling families? Could you also explain how removing the accomodation supplement for some tenants who require this to pay rent would somehow improve our housing crisis & get tenants closer towards home ownership? Currently home ownership is at its lowest in over 70 years. Remove the accom supp & see the emergancy social housing waiting list rise even further than the 548% in 6yrs under labour? Without this tenants that require this in to pay rent will have no other option. Removing the accom supp condemns many tenants to homelessness. This is a tenant subsidy, not a landlord one. Plenty of tenants do not require this supplememt to pay rent, the ones that do would only be able to turn to the gov to house them, with the private sector then be known to only rent to elite tenants, who can pay rent without any gov financial assistance. To take away the accomodation supplement is to create further homelessness, further tenants from home ownership, yet you advocate for this? Labour had 6years to remove this, they didnt, as they also recognize this is needed for tenants to pay rent so further records dont become homeless. Again the claim that removing the accomodation supplement will somehow improve our situation comes only out of envy. Those who advocate for it cannot justify why increasing the cost to operate & why further increases to rent would somehow improve a tenants financial position to gain them any closer to home ownership. We've tried 6 years of penalizing those who have for those who haven't, & life got much tougher for all. Tenants are now further away from ownership than they've ever been in our countries history. Time for a much needed different approach. Read less • LOG IN OR REGISTER TO POST COMMENTS 1 by Murray Falconer | 2nd Oct 24, 10:44pm In general terms, the argument to remove the various subsidies is they act like a price floor which everyone must pay (regardless of if received) and just flow to landlords anyway. I always thought I was paying twice the rent I should have in Auckland at $600pw when the accommodation supplement was running at over $300pw. If removed, the same houses exist and the same people exist, so the rents would fall to meet what the market could now afford once subsidies removed. That would mean lower prices for houses since the rental yield would be lower (the price fall would be from the land value). Removal need not result in more homelessness although there would be some teething pain for sure. Homelessness will increase with fast population growth which we seem determined to have for reasons I cannot fathom.

Crude example (I'm not suggesting we replace PAYE with LT), take the NZ urban area of roughly 5000 km2. In 2022, the Govt collected $38b in income taxes. If you wanted to recover that just from the 5000 km2 of urban, then you'd charge $7.60 per m2. My household with a 1080m2 section would pay $8.2k p.a. in land taxes, instead of about $70k in PAYE.

Rents are set at what the market can bear, not the landlords costs. They ma y jack up rents if they can, but the price of the apartments would be less (land taxes reduce property prices despite the opposite being stated by some commenters - possibly the only tax that lowers the cost of the item?).

They can't explain it coherently because it's a falsehood mantra they throw out buzz words out of envy. "Tax further the wealthy Landlord" they say, yet ignore that the average landlord in NZ makes just 14k per year off their property, that over 80% of landlords in NZ own just 1 rental property, & over 60% of those still have mortgages on them. If that's wealthy, then the bar has been set very low, far too low.

An Income Tax law that imposes tax more on productive labour than unproductive investment. We wouldn't be having this problem if we just said all income is taxed. Then it's simply at what rate.

The voluminous report and background papers illustrate the vast complexities of such a tax." For her to call this 'comprehensive' show she doesn't know the meaning of the word. The reason 'the voices supporting a CGT grow louder' is because they are being enabled by left-wing idealogues who believe utopia can be achieved by stoking envy to gain support for increasing and collecting more tax for redistribution instead of growing wealth.

This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 2 response. However, I take responsibility for the interpretation of what the participants said. The way I have characterized their comments may not in fact be their views. My submission is in five parts. I place the tax system in context, make some observations which suggest the characterisation in chapter 1 is not entirely accurate, draw out some issues with the economist’s approach to the effects of taxation, consider some matters of principle for a future tax system and outline a future regime as a basis of comparison. Of particular importance are: • Economic concepts of burden etc are marginal concepts and ignore the reality of government spending. The design of the tax system needs to be tested against no government spending or these concepts limited in their use to their designed function. • The sources and nature of capital for New Zealand should be determined. Inland Revenue should have information to establish this. This helps with considering the effects of possible future taxes. For example, how realistic are concerns regarding capital flight? • Capital needs to be made concrete. The sources of capital for New Zealand include many New Zealanders (through KiwiSaver, their own home and businesses), higher wealth households, foreign investors and Government. o The effect of capital taxation for individuals needs to be considered at the personal level rather than the impersonal – desired return – level to inform consideration of a future tax system. o The effect of taxation on Government as a source of capital is an under researched and considered area. The contribution of government to New Zealand’s economy means this should be corrected; questions such as the impact for consumers answered. o Not addressed in any detail in my response but the contribution of charities and not-for-profits are also important sectors of the economy which should be considered. (implicit is that the system needs to be designed to accommodate these potential different sources of capital and that new taxes will have different consequences. Trade offs will be required as they are now.) • Why capital is of benefit to New Zealand should be clearly stated and tested. In particular: o Whether the personal, company, employment and GST taxes are an appropriate measure of the benefit provided from an investor’s capital investment, should be tested. o The public benefit of personal interests such as saving, providing an inheritance etc should be stated and considered to establish how and whether they support capital being preferred through the tax system. • The Budget 2023 tax proposals should not be used as a model for designing future capital taxes. A broader perspective of the scope of a tax may help with raising revenue and mitigation of capital flight concerns. Our tax system: Bases and regimes. A “Draft for discussion” response to Inland Revenue © 2024 Cantin Consulting. This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 3 • Concerns regarding the implementation of wealth and other taxes may be overstated (given there is some support for RFRM) and proxy valuation methods may help with reducing compliance costs. • The GST base could be expanded to exempt services and to limit zero-rated supplies. • The interaction of tax and social policy and transfers, especially with regard to effective marginal rates, should be considered (and arguably is a greater problem than the 39% rate.. Use of revenue to address this problem as well as redesign of these systems shoud be considered. These factors lead me to suggest a future tax system which has a comprehensive realised capital gains tax (with listed equities taxed under FDR), a wealth or inheritance tax set with a high threshold but aligned with a global regime, and expanded GST base with revenue used for social policy objectives. It follows that I am in general agreement with the proposed scope of the LTIB. However, I consider that the effect of the ssues that are and should be considered mean that other government agencies, especially the Treasury, MBIE and MSD, should be consulted. My response has not had any element of peer or other review. (Various conversations over many years have contributed but none have focused on the particular elements of my response.).

Context The tax system does not stand alone. In a recent Musings, I described the State as: The modern Aotearoa New Zealand State is how collective action is given effect. The what, why and the detailed how are determined through our democracy and its institutions. To the extent we have a universal franchise, the State is us. It reflects our own contradictions. We all have an interest in the State operating successfully. 2 The tax system is, in large part, how our collective action is funded. That is its primary purpose. The tax system – scope of LTIB The funding system for Government can be characterised as: - what you are obliged to pay (the various taxes)? - what you “choose” to pay? • Corrective taxes are a subset as generally they do not apply to activities which you are forced to do. • Explicit user pays, for example, road user charges, fuel excise taxes are also a subset. • A wider view of user pays includes services provided by Government owned SOEs. Mixed Ownership Model companies are a further subset. • However, the “choice/compulsion” boundary is not a hard one. For example, how real is the choice to use electricity in modern society? - what you qualify for (the various transfers)? • The various social policy transfers are an integral part of the tax system as they are included in determinations of progressivity. (Further comments on this are below.) These three aspects of funding and spending by government have an impact on behaviour and Government revenue. The LTIB proposes that corrective taxes are excluded and, it appears, transfers. 2 Demysttifying the State – Musings on Dr Burton’s Report (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnfcantin\_demystifying-the-state-musings-on-dr-burtons-activity- 7243481745243676673-k\_eQ?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=member\_desktop) Our tax system: Bases and regimes.

This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 6 For corrective and user pays taxes, if they are out of scope, this should also mean that Government expenditure on those items should be excluded from consideration. In effect this would mean the assumption is that corrective taxes and user pays fund the expenditure (so the right base and level is determined by reference to the expected expenditure on those items. Submission 1: transfers and user pays/corrective taxes should be in scope. If this makes the LTIB too large a project, then the project should make explicit that existing transfers and user pays/corrective taxes are assumed to continue but also consider the impact on the projections of Government expenditure.

This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 7 Part II Current regime It is important that the current regime is properly characterised and analysed. Chapter 1 does not correctly reflect the current regime. Some observations follow. Fiscal drag 3 Paragraph 56 refes to inflation changing progressivity in ways not intended by the government. This is a “generous” assessment of fiscal drag. Fiscal drag is a known effect of inflation. To the extent that New Zealand parliament confirms tax rates annually, the effect of fiscal drag is a known, and therefore, intended effect. Figure 6 shows the effect of fiscal drag on personal income tax rates. However, paragraph 58 notes that the measure of fiscal incidence takes into account market income, transfers, diret income tax and indirect taxes. This is illustrated in figure 7 for the 2017-18 year. There is no corresponding figure for the effect of fiscal drag on disposable income. Figure 6 therefore excludes the effect of inflation, and counter-measures such as increases in transfers, from the effect of fiscal drag. Two examples may illustrate. GST was increased to 15%. That has contributed to increased government revenue as the economy has grown. However, this increase is nominal as inflation also increses the GST revenue. Working for familes, among other credits, have been adjusted over the same period. To that extent, governments have chosen to counter fiscal drag through credits rather than personal tax rate change. The focus on personal tax rate fiscal drag ignores the effects of inflation on counter- measures such as these. Submission 2: The comprehensive net effect (on GST and social policy credits and transfers) of fiscal drag should be considered in assessing what responses should be made. 3 Further commentary may be found at https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnfcantin\_musings-inflation-activity- 6939778479575953408-4TWG?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=member\_desktop Our tax system: Bases and regimes. A “Draft for discussion” response to Inland Revenue © 2024 Cantin Consulting. This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 8 Progressivity Paragraph 49 refers to the personal tax system as the main way progressivity is measured. As the LTIB suggests, progressivity is more often measured on a broader basis. Submission 3 : The LTIB should make clear what is its focus when considering progressivity of the tax base and systems. Government tax The tax that government pays is often overlooked. This is considered further in the next part. Captial taxation and characterisation of New Zealand’s tax regime Paragraph 70 seems to imply that company tax is a tax on capital but also notes that in New Zealand, compmany tax is also a labour tax for SMEs. Paragraph 89 reports on an OECD study which classifies New Zealand’s sytem as a comprehensive system. I have not reread the OECD report. The characterisation may be correct based on its definition. However, it does not, in my view, correctly characterise New Zealand’s tax system. It is true that capital income which is taxed is generally taxed at the same rate as labour income. (The footnote clarifies that the PIE rate is not the same as the personal tax rate.) However, much capital income is not taxed at all. It has a 0% economically effective tax rate. In some cases, it has a better than 0% economically effective tax rate. With the removal of the prohibition on interest deductibility for residential rental, the current system allows deductions for dual purpose expenditure thereby providing a further benefit for capital income. Submission 4 : The New Zealand tax system should be correctly characterised so that its current effects are properly stated and the effect of changes can be assessed.

This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 9 Part III Matters of principle to consider for the LTIB Converting economic concepts into everyday language and peer review The language of economists has technical meanings. It is used in the context of an economist’s framework and based on (simplified) models of how the world is expected to work. However, that language is also “loaded” in its common understanding. Concepts such as “burden”, “wedge”, “deadweight loss” when used in a tax context will have a different implication for an ordinary reader. The work of the LTIB is necessarily economic. However, care needs to be taken that the rreal world effects are explained in appropriate language. That language should be neutral. (One might speculate that the language used by econmists is deliberate – a “political” statement on the effects of taxation. I have not of course done the research to confirm the political views of the relevant economists with their theories. However, a paper of potential interest is Wolfgang Schoen’s Working Paper 4 for the Max Planck Institute on the role of political views in international taxation.) For the last LTIB, Inland Revenue engaged expert economist reviewers. That was understandable given the cost of capital topic. The peer review for this LTIB should be broader than economic specialists. The breadth of the topic and its political as well as fiscal impact means other views are important. Submission 5 : The LTIB should use neutral language and should have a wider (beyond economists) peer review. The taxation effects for labour and capital The economically orthodox view is that taxing capital highly is counter to productivity. What economists don’t make clear is what is the capital that is affected. A picture of NZ sources of capital follows. 4 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract id=4933649 Working Paper 2024-06 International Tax Scholarship and International Tax Activism Our tax system: Bases and regimes.

What is the driver now? 5 Note that the boundaries are undefined but the categories are intended to be broadly illustrative. Our tax system: Bases and regimes. A “Draft for discussion” response to Inland Revenue © 2024 Cantin Consulting. This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 11 What is the tax effect on capital? Each of these sources of capital has different reasons for investment. There is unlikely to be a one size fits all tax response. Changes to capital taxation need to consider the different drivers and effects – a single economic model is unlikely to provide the answer. There are and have been trade offs, for example, company tax as a withholding for resident individuals but a final tax for non-resident FDI.. Inland Revenue should have information on how the break down of between these categories. It has information on company ownership where a company pays dividends and also the percentage of foreign ownership. It has information on the personal income position of individuals. It will have information on AIL, if not the actual detail of the foreign investor it could do a cross check of FATCA/CRS reporting for financial institution AIL payers.. Submission 6 : The LTIB should provide existing information to provide a view of the sources and use of capital (as found in the NZ tax system). This would provide a good starting point to test opt ions for future tax bases and systems and the potential impact of changes on the availablilty of capital. Who/what is capital? The economic theories do not define who is the capital investor – they generally say that “capital” will respond in a certain way to tax. The diagram above is an attempt to provide some definition. One capital investor is an individual. (This is potentially true for all entities, some of the exceptions are discussed below.). This means that capital taxation is personal taxation. The individual columns divides those into three. Some have only KiwiSaver and their own home, others their own business, others a broader set of capital investments. When the LTIB considers concerns regarding the behaviour of capital in response to tax, it should consider the personal responses of individuals. For an individual investor, apart from KiwiSaver, capital is provided by those who do not need the income from the capital to live on. This means they can defer taxation (through using a company for their investment activity, for example). This can be seen in the comments made regarding a wealth tax in Terry Baucher’s Titans of Tax Podcast 6 The very strong reaction of the participants to a wealth tax was that capital would move. This is in effect a personal move – the individuals with the capital will move with their capital. (See further observations below regarding wealth and other taxes.) For FDI, a similar personal analysis can be made – it is foreign individuals who are the economic investors. However, the deicisons are made by managers who have home country tax and personal incentives when making those decisions. It could be argued that the BEPS project is a response to the personal drivers of the US tax system. With a classical tax system, company tax affects the share price ( because it is a multiple of earnings, actual or expected). Lower company tax means a higher share price (all things being equal). A higher share price affects manager remuneration as well as shareholder returns. Investment with low foreign (and no US) taxation benefits both managers and investors. How the BEPS project and New Zealand’s tax system interacts with drivers such as this needs to be considered by the LTIB. My diagram responds to the analysis in chapter 1 of the LTIB and includes government entity taxation. Government entity taxation has not been the subject of focus or review. In one sense, company tax should have no impact on a government decision to invest capital – it benefits from either an increase or a decrease in company tax (- a decrease through increased dividends or lower capital calls). (The position is 6 https://www.interest.co.nz/public-policy/127473/new-zealand-tax-podcast-special-episode-three-gurus-new- zealand-tax-sir -rob Our tax system: Bases and regimes.

However, that does not seem to have been the practice for the government or government investors, such as the NZ Super Fund or ACC, investments appear to be assessed on an after-tax basis. Notwithstanding, the questions that arise are: • What is the effect of government as a capital provider on the economy? • Does government as a source of capital have a different response to taxation? S hould it do so? • Who bears the tax? (considered further in the next section) Submission 7: The LTIB should consider who the capital investor is, including the NZ Government, and whether the response to tax is different for different capital investors. Its assessment should inform its consideration of options for a future tax regime. Who bears the tax? For Government companies, the standard model would suggest that, as a capital investor desires a specific return, the tax is actually borne by either customers or labour (employees and suppliers) rather than shareholders. For Government companies, the following questions arise: • Does taxing them increase the cost of living for consumers (because the amount charged by the company has to cover the company tax to provide the desired return to the Government) ? • If so, are there reasons to retain company tax (for example, to maintain competitive markets) or remove it? (As an aside, if the theory is correct, imputation is not required because sharehodlers do not bear the tax – employees and customers do. However, that is not how markets have responded to the availablilty of imputation credits.) More broadly, who bears the tax is a difficult question to answer. For example, studies on the removal of VAT on certain products tend to show that the supplier benefits from the reduction. (By contrast, imposing VAT has the reverse effect.). However, clarity on this is important to the design of the tax system. Firstty, when the progressivity and fairness of the system is raised, a response from higher wealth investors tends to be along the lines of “I pay company tax, GST and PAYE” with the implication that this is the right measure of the tax they bear. Theory would suggest otherwise. Further, the correctness of this statement relies on a nil hypothesis – consumers would spend nothing, employees would have no ot her employment, no other businesses would operate. These assumptions are not consistent with our economy. Consumers do spend on goods and services and they would likely find others to substitute. Employees do find work. Businesses are established daily. At best the contribution is “marginal” - the additional value their business brings to the economy ( including consumers and employees) and the tax on that additional value. This is less than 100% of their activity but is hard to determine. (Inland Revenue may be able to do some analysis by comparing employee salary to an industry average for example?) Secondly, when considering tax exemptions and credits, it is important to ask who benefits. For example, local government has asked for GST on rates to be provided as funding to them. This would mean that consumers are subsidising land owners (ratepayers, but noting the question of whether tenants pay for the rates is a contested question). (Whether the effect is lower rates or rates not as high rates as they would otherwise be, ratepayers benefit from this funding.). To the extent that capital (real property) is taxed differently by government, this affects the relative taxation of consumers and capital. Our tax system: Bases and regimes. A “Draft for discussion” response to Inland Revenue © 2024 Cantin Consulting. This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 13 A possible argument is that Working for Families is of benfefit is to the employee rather than a subsidy to the employer. In short: • Employers pay the market value of the work (contestable of course but the employer is unable to discriminate based on gender or family situation); • The market rate is insufficient for the employee to support a family; • Working for families provides credits to support the household; • Working for families is a subsidy for the employee. Submission 8 : Examples such as these mean the LTIB needs to be as clear as possible as to who will bear the tax being considered for the future. Submission 9 : This work is important for perceptions of fairness. The information gained from following submissions 6 and 7 , should also help with assessing the reality of the effect on capital investment and therefore of capital flight. Submission 10: The LTIB should consider the reasons for and against the continued income taxation of government entities. Marginal and Average rates and no tax and comparative tax revenue to GDP In the Titans of Tax podcast, some commentators were especially concerned with the impact of the 39% marginal tax rate. Theories of wage burden and deadweight loss focus on the marginal effect of taxation. The economic conclusions tend, in popular and political usage, to be generalised to apply to all tax. Deadweight loss is applied to taxation as a whole and not, as intended, applied to considerations of extensions to tax. What the popular use ignores (and economists do not appear to do a good job of considering) is the effect of existing taxation. In other words, popular usage does not take into account what existing tax funds. If there were no taxation, the collective action funded by those taxes would likely still be required. Those services would not be costless. In feudal societies, serfs paid for protection provided by nobles through their produce (and to the church for protection of their souls by way of tithes). Equivalent payments would be required in the absence of no tax at all. There is of course room for debate over what government should provide (and therefore be funded to provide) but no taxation is not a viable alternative. Submission 11: The LTIB should examine wage burden, deadweight loss etc more closely and testing their effects with an assumption that a base level of taxation is required (i.e. what is the wage burden of substitute costs if no tax is paid.). Alternatively, those concepts should only be used to rank taxes. Our tax system: Bases and regimes. A “Draft for discussion” response to Inland Revenue © 2024 Cantin Consulting. This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 14 Government revenue to GDP does provide information on the size of government . It reinforces the importance I place on the difference between marginal effects of new taxes and the effect of the existing “acerage” tax rates. The LTIB compares government tax revenue to GDP for 2021 at Figure 9. The OECD has recently released its 2024 analysis of tax policy reform 7 . Its media release refers to tax reform increasing tax revenues. This comparative measure does tell us something about our system. However, the OECD report means that the comparisons will change. Submission 11A: The comparative tax revenue to GDP data should be updated for the effect of tax policy reforms since 2021. Distribution Some argue that the tax system should not have a redistribution objective. There are two separate points. As a matter of fact, tax redistributes. I was fortunate to have sometime in Europe this year which included some of the usual tourist spots. A lot of what is displayed is acquisitions by monarchs, nobles and churches, funded in part at least by “tax”. So tax was redistributed from various payers upwards (in a class sense). This can be seen in modern New Zealand, tax redistributes to providers of services. An example is government funding of early childhood which provides some $20m per annum to one family which “controls” a charitable provider of such services. However, the usual objection to redistribution is that the tax system should not be used to deal with inequality. That is a valid question – is the tax system the best way to address inequality? However, while decrying redistribution as an objective, the fact that transfers (redistribution) are used to measure the progressivity of the system (see the Treasury household report) is ignored. Studies (including the OliverShaw Sapere report 8 ), use these measures of progressivity to justify the current system as appropriately progressive – no change is needed. A consistent position would need to defend the progressivity of the current tax system without reference to its redistribution aspects. Submission 12: The LTIB should state with clarity and reality the impact of distribution on the design of the system. Is the current system fair? Fairness is just one measure of a tax system but it is an important one for political sustainability. If an ideal system taxes all economic income equally, departures from that need to be justified. Sometimes that is more easily done – an owner occupier’s income, from rental saved in essence, is difficult to measure and also difficult to justify. An unrealised CGT may have valuation and funding problems (but see wealth taxes and RFRM below) . The lack of a comprehensive CGT is less easy to defend on fairness grounds. There must be other good reasons for this to remain a feature. 7 https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/tax-policy-reforms-2024\_c3686f5e-en.html 8 See Musings on the Sapere report here https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnfcantin\_is-the-tax-system-fair- activity-7054332944089321472-emcD?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=member\_desktop Our tax system: Bases and regimes. A “Draft for discussion” response to Inland Revenue © 2024 Cantin Consulting. This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 15 As implied above, the economic and political reasons for supporting the current system are likely to be found in the benefit to the provider of that view – there is a personal interest in the current position. Further, if the reason for preferring capital is because of its benefits for NZ Inc, those benefits should be made clear. For example, labour income’s benefit is to be able to live ( but not exclusively at higher incomes). The reasons for personal capital investment may include: • To live in (for a personal residence); • To save for: o a holiday; o Retirement; • To support family; • To provide an inheritance; • To support causes that the person supports. Do these essentially private benefits provide public benefits which justify a different tax treatment? Submission 13: The LTIIB should bear in mind that opposition to broadening the base means that the current system is being supported. That case needs to be well made and, potentially, some discounting, because of self-interest, of support for the current system is appropriate. Submission 14: The LTIB should clearly state why capital income should be tax preferred sand those reasons should be tested. Our tax system: Bases and regimes.

This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 16 Part IV Future regime – issues to consider Some of the submissions and work suggested by my responses in the first three parts will provide a better picture than currently of the options that are available. I make some initial observations and submissions pending that work. The taxpayer and the income tax and social policy bases For Budget 2023, officials considered an alternative minimum tax and a wealth tax. The design of these taxes was limited by budget secrecy and political decisions on a capital gains tax. Officials were wary of supporting either because they did not have information to be able to assess the economic impact of such a change. Taxpayers are individuals or vehicles treated as separate persons (companies and trusts, for example). For income tax, residency determines whether NZ sourced or world-wide income is included in their taxable income. However, for social policy, it is more often household income (and more bro adly defined than for income tax purposes) which is relevant. Submission 15 : The LTIB should consider options for redefining the taxpayer including: • Citizenship 9 discussed in a Musings but which may also be relevant to mitigating “ capital flight” concerns (discussed below); • Households; • Economic units (including companies and trusts). Submission 16 : The LTIB should address the question, if it is appropriate for social policy to have a broader definition of “income” why is that not the case for income tax? The GST base For GST, the assumed taxpayer is a consumer who uses the goods and services in New Zealand. This means that NZ resident and non-residents pay GST on their spending in NZ. NZ residents consumption outside NZ is not subject to GST. NZ’s GST is comprehensive excluding financial services and residential letting as the two major exemptions. Expanding the GST base to these two items may raise revenue. However, applying GST to residential rental may make increase the regressiveness of GST. To the extent that higher income New Zealanders are able to consume goods and services outside New Zealand, their consumption does not contribute to the progressivity of the tax system. It is difficult on a unilateral and principled basis to change the GST base to address this. Submission 17 : The LTIB should consider: • the impact of extending GST to exempt supplies – is there a net revenue benefit? Are they practical to implement?; 9 https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnfcantin\_tintax-musings-citizenship-activity-6915392328413171712- CYg-?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=member\_desktop Our tax system: Bases and regimes. A “Draft for discussion” response to Inland Revenue © 2024 Cantin Consulting. This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 17 • the treatment of overseas travel 10 where there may be a princpled basis to amend the zero-rating rules but it is likely that a mulit-lateral consensus is required; • the treatment of duty-free shopping by NZ residents who reimport goods without GST applying. The taxation of capital Although a well-trodden path, the LTIB proposes a broader consideration of options for taxing capital. Submisison 18 : The LTIB is to consider a wide range of taxes than those considered for Budget 2023. That is appropriate. The design features of the Budget 2023 taxes should not constrain the consideration of these taxes. Capital flight A significant issue will be the prospect of capital flight, i.e., those subject to such taxes will leave New Zealand with their capital. Careful consideration of the capital flight risk is required. In my view, this is where capital and capital taxation is personal and not an abstract concept. The assessment of capital flight risk should take the personal into account. Submisison 19 : The factors that should be taken into account are: • what effect and benefits do current capital investment provide? The work to determine who are the providers of capital (submissions 6 and 7) should also help with an assessment of where the capital is actually employed (i.e. in what assets and in New Zealand or elsewhere) and the benefit to New Zealand); • whether there is a basis of taxation (for example, citizenship or making ability to vote contingent on being a tax resident) that can be used to mitigate this risk?; • where would the providers of capital go and what, if anything would they take with them? o Australia is a likely place to emigrate as New Zealanders have automatic rights to reside there. Although Australia has a CGT (and many other taxes), foreign sourced income is not taxable for certain NZ residents. (In brief, if they do not become Australian citizens. If they do not become Australian citizens my understanding is they are unable to vote in Australia.) It is therefore possible for an NZ citizen to move to Australia and be taxed there on Australian surced income and on NZ income as a non-resident. This could be addressed by: § Using citizenship as a basis for taxation; § Explictlly denying Australian DTA benefits. This could be achieved through the existing DTA as such NZ citizens are not taxed on world-wide income and therefore are not, arguably, Australian resident. Alternatively, an equivalent to the “transitional NZ resident” rule (such persons are able to be treated as not NZ resident by Australia) could be agreed. 10 https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnfcantin\_gst-on-international-air-travel-activity- 6988336034140884992-7V5y?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=member\_desktop Our tax system: Bases and regimes. A “Draft for discussion” response to Inland Revenue © 2024 Cantin Consulting. This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 18 o Using the analysis on sources of capital for personal capital to answer questions such as: § How much real property would be disposed of? Is that good or bad? § How much NZ portfolio (debt and equity) investment would be disposed of? Is that good or bad? § How much offshore investment would be disposed of? (or more likely retained but no longer in the economic base?). What is the public benefit of those investments to NZ Inc? o These questions suggest that disposals of NZ property would likely be acquired by NZ residents (but see FDI). Do immigration settings need to change to assist with currently offshore providers of such capital settling in NZ? • Whether a multi- lateral consensus on a specific tax can help? The capital flight risk is predicated on the person and the capital moving away from New Zealand. (This assumes immigration settings elsewhere are friendly for the person). This implies that an equivalent tax is not applied in the other country. If all countries had an equivalent tax, then the ability to migrate so the New Zealand tax did not apply would be reduced. Any emigration would be for other reasons. Brazil and others, through the UN, are advocating for a global wealth tax. As the Pillar 2 project shows, achieving a consensus on a single set of rules will be difficult but aligning the design of a potential tax regime for New Zealand with a possible global regime may mitigate against capital flight. FDI For FDI there are two issues, withdrawal of capital and not investing in the first place. Inland Revenue should have information on taxable income of FDI and how that has changed when tax settings have changed. (Taxable income is a first proxy, it can not be an exact response to these changes. A second proxy could be the change in dividends. As I argued for the first Inland Revenue LTIB, the most significant source of FDI is likely to be reinvestment of profits rather than new capital. The change in divdiends may also provide some indication of the change in FDI investment. Note that Inland Revenue’s 2022 trust disclosure report compared trutee income to distributions, equivalent comparisons could be made of company taxable income and dividends?) Submisison 20 : Inland Revenue shoud use the information it has to assist with its assessment of the impact on FDI. Transition and why are tax settings “special”? My experience is that the transition to a new set of rules create most of the opposition to tax changes. This was seen particularly with the last Tax Working Group’s CGT recommendation. The effect on existing investments was of significant concern (despite the rebasing of the cost on implementation date). Grandparenting is one way of addressing such concerns (to be traded off with a lock in effect). The reality of perceptions of any possible change is that it will be seen as disadvantageous to existing investments. The agument for preferring capital is that it takes the risk. It must must manage changes in the economy and society, to consumer preferences, to employement preferences. None of these are a given when an Our tax system: Bases and regimes. A “Draft for discussion” response to Inland Revenue © 2024 Cantin Consulting. This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 19 investment is made. Business must adapt to the changes. The reason why business considers it should not have to adapt to tax changes should be made explcit and considered. Submission 21 ; The LTIB needs to carefully consider the transition to any new regime and why tax settings in particular should not change. Practical objections to wealth tax and the example of RFRM One reaction to the possibility of a wealth tax was that it was difficult to value assets. The same objectors can be proponents of RFRM as a method of determining income and the FDR method applies to foreign equities. FDR is in effect a wealth tax set at the personal marginal tax rate. It will vary from 0% to 2% (taking into account income tax only) of the value at the begiing of the year. RFRM would apply a similar wealth tax. Submission 22 : Given support for either of these two methods of tsxing capital, concerns reagarding valuation should be given less weight. Effective marginal tax rates and social policies The highest personal income tax rate is 39%. This is also now the trustee rate. However, as the Budget 2024 papers illustrate, these are not the highest marginal rates. The effect of the combined personal tax rates and social policy abatements means that the 39% is by a significant magnitude not the highest marginal rate. It is usual for those considering tax policy to focus on income tax. The problem of transfers’ effective marginal rates is not usually of direct concern. If we are concerned with a 39% rate, which is not a comparatively high rate, because of its perceived detrimentsl effect on propensity to work and invest, we shoud be more concerned with higher rates. Submission 23: The LTIB should consider methods to reduce high effective marginal tax rates. Our tax system: Bases and regimes.

This response should not be used in substitution for specific advice on your own circumstances. 20 Part V – My Future Tax Regime My comments and questions can be seen as theoretical or abstaract. I have asked many questions which will hopefully be addressed in the LTIB. However, a concrete consideration of the questions may be assisted by a focus on exact proposals. I set out a future regime accordingly. Comprehensive GST, wealth or inheritance tax, extensions to GST and address social policy entitlements and marginal rates or a lower GST rate The key features of my future regime are: • A comprehensive realised CGT but: o Apply FDR to all listed portfolio equities with a CV option available with imputation being retained for New Zealand equities. (Note this discounts the tax on gains which are made in excess of the FDR rate but aligns direct and PIE investment taxable income treatment and does not allow all losses.) o Realised losses are allowable which may impact on the fiscal consequences. In principle, though this is required to “sell” a CGT. o For transition, see valuation proxies below. • A wealth or inheritance tax for wealth above a very high threshold subject to a global consensus if there is a material undesirable/unmanageable capital flight risk. This needs to be part of the system because at a certain level assets do not need to be realised so a CGT never applies;. The tax unit would be citizenship and NZ property. • Extending GST to residential rental and financial services (with the residential rental extension likely to require special input tax rules for assets committed to the residential activity); • Using the revenue to address marginal tax rates arising from social policy measures and removing bureaucracy from the benefits system or a lower GST rate. Valuation A concern with introducing new taxes is the what to do with existing assets. A way to address this is to grandparent assets but this has a potential for a lock in effect. An alternative is to have valuation proxies which can be used. So: • Real property has its rating value. Taxpayers who consider their asset is worth more would have the option of having their alternative value used for both tax and rating purposes. • Unlisted shares could be valued at an earnings multiple – either established arbitrarily (say 10%) or by reference to some index (eg NZSX for NZ equiies or some industry average).

The documents that were released showed that government and officials had considered both an alternative minimum tax and a wealth tax. We expressed concerns about this process. It remains our view that an entirely new tax base should not be developed in haste and in secret. To implement a new tax base will require detailed policy thinking and widespread consultation to ensure appropriate policy settings and a practical implementation plan. We recommended that all participants in the tax system be involved in advance thinking about how the bases be expanded, and additional revenue raised, in a politically neutral setting in advance of a Ministerial request. Proposed topic You have proposed that the next LTIB considers the topic “Our tax system: Bases and regimes”. We support this. It aligns with suggestions we and others have made for examination of the tax system in a politically neutral environment and with wider input from other participants in the tax system. You have also provided us with additional detail regarding the potential analysis and we provide comment on the information provided so far and the future direction of the work. Our comments Scope of analysis We agree with the decision to consider only taxes that are aimed at raising revenue and not those that are aimed at other objectives such as changing behaviour. The role of the tax system is to raise the money needed by the Government to fulfil its policy objectives. If the funds raised are not sufficient for the Government to carry out its mandated policy plan then, in the absence of reforming that policy plan to reduce expenditure, changes must be made to raise additional funds. Growing the economy is of course key to this, alongside tax reform. The tax system itself should not be political but should, as far as possible, remain efficient, fair, equitable and transparent with low compliance costs. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. charteredaccountantsanz.com Review of Treasury/IR Budget Papers November 2023 Page 3 As you are aware the proposed LTIB topic has been covered in previous Tax Working Groups. The most recent Tax Working Group work in 2017 gave detailed consideration to base expansion. While that work will provide useful background information, the world has changed. Any analysis must be updated to reflect: • current trends in work; • international trends in corporate tax rates; • OECD thinking and future work; • The desirability of rate alignment; • New Zealand’s need for capital and FDI to support our infrastructure needs; and • advances in technology (and corresponding shifts to source taxation). We discuss each of these briefly below. No-one can predict the future. Nevertheless there are broad trends in the domestic and global economy that should be specifically taken into account in this analysis. These factors are not discrete and most will overlap. Current trends in work As you are aware there is continued movement towards a gig economy, enabled by technology and a new generation of workers. This will affect how people earn money and pay tax. International trends in corporate tax rates The document notes that New Zealand is often at the higher end of OECD graphs of corporate tax rates. This can affect political decisions regarding rates and base. However, the LTIB must look forward to consider trends in rates in future and how this may affect Government decision making. For example, if the Government decides to cut corporate rates to remain internationally competitive, it may need to investigate expanding the base. There is overlap between this factor and the OECD work (see below). OECD activity The OECD is continuing its work on global tax and information sharing regimes. The latest work is widely known as BEPS Pillar One and Pillar Two. Hypothetical decisions at that level can have real life impacts for New Zealand taxpayers. For example, Pillar Two takes into © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. charteredaccountantsanz.com Review of Treasury/IR Budget Papers November 2023 Page 4 account certain revenue items and tax paid on the revenue amounts. New Zealand tax paid may show as lower in periods when the taxpayer derives revenue from the sale of a capital asset because there is no corresponding capital gains tax. Compliance Within the tax system there is a certain amount of non-compliance, including as part of the “hidden economy”. It has been acknowledged that this gap is difficult to quantify. Willing non- compliance is addressed through benchmarking and formal audit; however, these are not a total solution. It may be that if compliance can be lifted then the additional revenue will limit the need to expand the bases in future. This point interlinks with the point about technology (below) and international trends such as the move to source taxation (above). The desirability of rate alignment Para 166 of the consultation document notes as follows: “... there are trade-offs between revenue integrity, efficiency and utility in the design of the income tax regimes. Given potential future revenue needs, we should not assume that the tax system of the future will align entity and top personal rates.” We agree. The LTIB analysis should also consider the desirability (or otherwise) of rate alignment in future as this is likely to affect several factors in the evaluation framework (discussed below). New Zealand’s need for capital and infrastructure As discussed in the previous LTIB, New Zealand is a net capital importer. We have an “infrastructure deficit”. Any change to the tax bases should not discourage foreign direct investment or domestic infrastructure investment. Advances in technology We are all aware of the continuing impact of advances in technology, particularly digital technology, in changing the world where we live. Paragraph 135 of the document states as follows: “We consider issues arising from disruptive technology and the changing nature of work are either most relevant to tax administration (which we do not intend to focus on in the next LTIB) or have highly uncertain impacts. So, we propose not to consider the impact of these factors further in the LTIB.” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. charteredaccountantsanz.com Review of Treasury/IR Budget Papers November 2023 Page 5 We disagree. The future cannot be known; however, trends over time are evident and should be taken into account in any future focused study. The LTIB should not assume that New Zealand will remain as it is now. In addition, as we have discussed above, tax administration must be a factor in determining whether and how the bases should be expanded in future. Effects of technological change cannot be disregarded. Paragraph 44 of the document states: “Given these considerations, we propose that the LTIB focus on understanding the desirability of different tax mixes (that is, the sensible set of tax bases and their relative economic cost), rather than the overall level of taxation.” We agree. The LTIB should be used to develop a range of options and inform public debate, should those options be put forward as future proposals for reform. Officials should draw on the research of prior working groups but this will need to be updated with current thought leadership and analysis. It is important that consideration also extend to the practical application and implementation of potential reform options drawing on overseas experience. Framework for analysis The work to be undertaken is explained succinctly at paragraph 159: “To understand this question, we propose to first consider areas of overlap and difference between our two main tax bases and the pros and cons of changes in the tax mix between these bases. We then propose to consider what bases, if any, it might make sense to add to New Zealand’s current tax mix. Different legal bases for taxation may, from an economic perspective, tax the same factor. Therefore, it is important to understand what the differences and overlaps are between various potential bases to understand what bases it might be sensible to add.” We agree. We would add that it is crucially important that the document develop a framework for evaluating the different possibilities. Some items to consider include: - efficiency (including compliance costs); - fairness or equity; - effectiveness; - likely amount of revenue raised; - timing of revenue; and - trigger of other behaviours including on capital. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. charteredaccountantsanz.com Review of Treasury/IR Budget Papers November 2023 Page 6 Design decisions are important. Sometimes it is the detail that can make things unworkable. The framework should consider the relative merits of expanded bases with different design parameters – such as, a capital gains tax with a “valuation day” approach vs applying only to assets acquired following the date of introduction. Equally the scope of assets included in a capital gains tax may affect efficiency but also revenue raised. A wealth tax may be efficient at raising revenue but may also encourage capital flight and avoidance behaviour. A broad scope wealth tax may create the need for a high de minimis threshold or significant exceptions. We acknowledge that the role of the LTIB is not to develop a detailed design for an entirely new tax, butt believe some consideration should be given to how different design parameters may affect the evaluation criteria. The timing of the revenue raised is also important. The wealth tax that was developed prior to the 2023 election suggested cutting some tax rates at the same time as the tax is introduced. This is inadvisable. Governments should only spend additional revenue from base expansion after it has been earned. In addition it would be unwise to modify the tax base mix, reducing existing tax impost ahead of new tax base revenue being received. These design factors are key to a successful base expansion, will inform public debate and therefore should be considered as part of the evaluation framework. It is important that the LTIB analysis is specifically applicable to New Zealand. OECD data can provide useful benchmarks; however, New Zealand as a country faces a unique combination of challenges and the analysis must take these specific circumstances into consideration.

This makes it politically palatable and makes fair the current unfair situation where money in your pocket is taxed if you sweated, but not if you’ve done nothing at all to earn it and not supported the countries economy in a productive manner. Not hard to do. Look around the World. 2) EET instead of TTE for KiwiSaver retirement funds. That way both the Government and the taxpayer benefit from the phenomenal benefit of longterm equity investments. The tax is just delayed until the person makes withdrawals. This is what virtual every comparable country in the World does. It’s not hard. I’m from one of those foolish other countries that do EET. I saved $300,000 over ten years. It’s now worth $900,000, so the Government gets to tax $900,000 instead of $300,000. All it takes is the anathema of NZ politics - long term thinking. Laird Madison s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) ICNZB IRD WORKING GROUP 13 TH September 2024 Consultation on the scope of Inland Revenues long-term insights briefing (LTIB) Dear IRD team, Thank you for taking the time to explain the process around the consultation. Matt your presentation summarising the information was very useful. Some feedback: 1. Was there an initial discussion regarding topic options which we have missed, or was this the topic the IRD wanted to focus on? 2. As the focus is informing the public could IRD prepare a 3-4 min overview of the topic and their goals like what Matt just covered. And secondly, could this be translated into possibly Te Reo/Sign Language and a Chinese dialect which could be shared out to the wider public via various channels. 3. In the summarised version of the document its very wordy and not aimed at the mid/low educated NZ’er. Could this not be revamped by a marketing/social writer to use language that connects with this part of the community for them to easily understand it and include the visuals like the 3 graphs Matt used. Consulting Proposal (ird.govt.nz) Scope of Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing (ird.govt.nz) ltib.pdf (ird.govt.nz) Other notes: We understand that IRD considered what to include the environmental review stage however we believe there are several factors that will impact this. A few: - Regional poverty/wealth - Refugees impact - GST breakdown by type of cost i.e. food/luxury items - The likely trend for fulltime roles to be reduced by AI/robotic etc and the workforce either less hours or needing 2-3 jobs to meet their household income needs. - The digital divide i.e. areas of the population still without wifi at home etc - Ethnicity breakdown now and in 20 years which will link into education, numbers moving into business etc. We support the LTIB topic and think that this covers the IRD’s requirement to provide public information services on long- term issues. We welcome the opportunity to provide feedback at the next stage.

Does the environmental scan identify the key challenges facing our tax system over the long term? Yes, the environmental scan does identify key challenges, particularly in the context of the taxation of global equities within PIEs and the broader implications of the Fair Dividend Rate (FDR). The current FDR system, which effectively operates as a quasi-wealth tax, poses a long-term challenge by creating an inequitable investing environment, especially as economic conditions evolve and risk-free rates continue to fall. The challenge lies in ensuring that the tax system adapts to these changes while remaining fair and supportive of long-term wealth accumulation for Kiwis. 2. How well positioned is our current tax system to respond to these challenges? The current tax system is not well positioned to respond to these challenges. The FDR regime, established in 2007, has not been adjusted to reflect significant changes in economic conditions, such as the decline in risk-free rates. This has resulted in an outdated and punitive system that overtaxes global investments, particularly in poor-performing years or when currency fluctuations occur. The rigidity of the FDR rate and the limited flexibility in taxation methods (e.g., the selective use of the Comparative Value method) indicate that the system lacks the necessary adaptability to respond effectively to these long-term challenges. 3. Do you agree with the focus on how to maintain a stable core structure of the tax system while ensuring the system has flexibility to adapt to different revenue and distributional objectives over time? Yes, it is crucial to maintain a stable core structure of the tax system, but this stability should not come at the expense of fairness and adaptability. The FDR system's inflexibility in adjusting to changing economic conditions illustrates the risk of prioritizing stability over necessary reforms. The tax system should be able to evolve, allowing for adjustments like a reduced FDR rate when appropriate, to ensure it remains equitable and does not disproportionately burden specific groups, such as average investors in global equities. 4. Do you agree that understanding the pros and cons of different approaches to income and consumption tax is important for understanding what tax system would be suitable for the future? Understanding the pros and cons of various tax approaches is essential for designing a future-proof tax system. The current issues with the FDR system highlight the need for a comprehensive review of how different tax methods impact both income and consumption. An informed analysis could help in identifying more balanced approaches that ensure fairness, especially in the context of global equity investments, and avoid the punitive aspects of the current system. \*\*5. Do you agree that we should consider what is taxed under our current main two bases, and if there are any bases it makes sense to add to our tax mix?\*\* Yes, a review of what is taxed under the current main two bases (income and consumption) is necessary. The current focus on taxing unrealized gains in global equities through the FDR is a clear example of where the tax base might be overly broad or s 9(2)(a) misaligned with economic realities. It would be prudent to explore other potential tax bases that might provide a more equitable and effective way to generate revenue, without distorting investment decisions or disproportionately impacting long-term savings and retirement outcomes. 6. Do you think we should consider both options for a future tax system that may have higher revenue needs and options at current revenue levels? Yes, it is essential to consider both scenarios. A future tax system must be versatile enough to meet varying revenue needs while maintaining fairness and promoting economic growth. The current FDR system, which overtaxes certain investments, underscores the importance of having options that can be adjusted based on revenue requirements. A flexible approach would allow for adjustments in tax rates or bases as economic conditions and revenue needs change, ensuring the tax system remains both sustainable and fair.

To whom this may concern, This is a brief submission in support of IR's intention to make the subject of its next long-term insights briefing (LTIB) the broad structure of the tax regime, taking into account projected fiscal trade-offs and tensions. First, the broad scope proposed seems in line with the intention underlying the introduction of LTIBs, which was to spur the public sector to take a longer-term view of the big issues facing agencies. Second, the issue seems highly pertinent to some of the major choices we will face in coming years as regards the design of the tax system. As someone whose work focusses substantially on inequality, I would note, for instance, the intergenerational tension in our current tax arrangements. As IR notes, older age groups are likely to put increasing pressure on spending, via increased superannuation and health costs. While this is not a bad thing per se (caring for those groups is important), it does seem to sit in tension with the fact that (crudely speaking) the system generally taxes the things young people have (wages and salaries) and not the things older people make or have (capital gains and assets). Such issues could usefully be considered by the kind of research IR is proposing. Accordingly, I support IR's proposed approach to its LTIB.

The Chief Economist Inland Revenue Department I should like to make some comments on what I believe the future New Zealand revenue framework could look like, and the types of additional revenue streams, IRD could consider. Most New Zealander's are aware that future governments need to look at ways to spread the tax burden. Currently governments are very dependent on revenue from personal income, corporate taxes, and GST. Naturally, other "taxes" also contribute to the overall revenue streams, but miniscule amounts, as highlighted in your discussion document. With Treasury predicting structural deficits from 2030, something needs to be done to increase the governments revenue stream. It is time to be a little more creative and to look at taxing wealth and capital. I believe the following should be considered: Capital Gains Tax - largely as proposed by the 2019 Tax Working Group. The only changes I would make is in addition to exempting the family home, I would also exempt individuals KiwiSaver accounts, (which I would make compulsory - see below), and set a flat rate of 15%. This would help reduce administration costs and complexity and may make it more salable to political parties, and the electorate. Death Duty / Inheritance Tax - look at introducing a flat 15% tax on a deceased persons estate, payable by beneficiaries. The only people to be excluded from paying the duty would be the spouse/legal partner of the deceased. Stamp Duty - a flat 2% levied on the sale of all land and property, but paid by the seller (not as traditionally designed, the purchaser). The suggested process would be: Upon receipt of the deposit and the agreement going unconditional, real estate agents fees (3- 6%) are deducted and Stamp Duty of 2% is also deducted and placed into a lawyers trust account. Within 10 days of settlement the 2% Stamp Duty is to be paid to IRD. Ideally, once estimates of potential additional revenue is calculated, and so long as revenue will increase, you should also look at a rearrangement of personal income taxes to s 9(2)(a) closer resemble Australian personal tax rates. For example: $0 to $15,000 0% $15,001 to. $60,000 15% $60,001 to $80,000 30% $80,001 to $120,000 35% $120,001 to $200,000 40% $200,001 and over 45% Lastly, I have a suggestion with regards to KiwiSaver, which I recognise is outside the framework you are looking at, but I believe is important to help reduce New Zealander's reliance on National Superannuation, and to help increase individuals' retirement funds. Firstly, KiwiSaver should be compulsory (all employees should contribute a minimum of 3%). Secondly, employer contributions should be increased to encourage more New Zealanders to increase their KiwiSaver contributions. The table below illustrates how employees could be incentivised to contribute 6% to their KiwiSaver. EmployeeEmployerBefore Tax Total 3%3%6% 4%4%8% 6%6%12% 8%6%14% 10%6%16% By requiring employer's to pay up to 6%, I believe this would act as a strong incentive for New Zealander's to increase their savings from 3% to 6%. By adjusting tax thresholds, as proposed above, and directing some savings to KiwiSaver, we would be doing all New Zealand's a major service. At present, according to the Retirement Commissioners Policy Briefing Paper 2024, KiwiSaver employee contributions are: Contribution %Employees 3%63% 4%19% 6%6% 8%7% 10%5% Imagine if 60% of employees saved 6%, rather than the current 6%. I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on these proposals. Regards, Mike Hern External Email CAUTION: Please take CARE when opening any links or attachments. Dear Sir/Madam The exploration of the broad tax structure for New Zealand is an entirely inappropriate Long Term Insights Briefing (LTIB) topic. The proposed LTIB as suggested extends beyond the scope of the IRD and has significant duplication with the remit of Treasury (and that of the Tax Working Groups' Final Report in 2019). To focus on such areas as proposed seems, on face value, to be an inefficient application of the required LTIB. As has been shown recently with the High Worth Entity research, having two Government departments with different methodologies addressing the same subject matter and reaching very different conclusions only creates confusion and little scope for academic discussion on potential policy in the future (without talking at cross purposes). Should the LTIB continue in its current form any conclusions will result in tacit acceptance (at best) by Treasury and will require Treasury to undertake its own analysis of the same topics or require the establishment of another TWG to investigate said topics. Furthermore the discussion and analysis of long term fiscal pressures is beyond the remit of the IRD. There is little benefit from understanding how to grow the tax pie, an inherently political decision, to close any fiscal gap when successive governments continue to ignore the existing fiscal shortfalls and choose to, the the words of Bruce Plested (CEO Mainfreight), squander the tax revenue received. This suggests that the proposed LTIB becomes an academic exercise with little future benefit. Any attempt at postulating long term fiscal pressures will be, at best, speculative and, at worst, bordering on reckless scaremongering. The ability of any department to forecast beyond a short term time frame is near zero. In fact the focus on just one long term fiscal pressure in the early 2000's by Treasury with respect to superannuation (NZSF) predicted that the cost of superannuation as a proportion of GDP would be, by now, in excess of 10%. Current evidence has shown that prediction to be wildly inaccurate. It would seem more appropriate for the scope of the LTIB to be inward looking rather than outward looking. Rather than focus on esoteric research, the IRD should be focusing its LTIB on Compliance, Monitoring and Enforcement. Instead it should be seeking feedback on areas of focus for operating efficiently and effectively given the current tax settings. s 9(2)(a) Such scope could include: greater use of data monitoring for recurring transactions and commonality of parties as indicators of intent to or for the purpose of evasion of tax or money laundering greater collaboration under current law with other enforcement agencies (NZ Police, MoJ, DIA, FMA) to detect activities of criminal enterprise or behavior and/or organized crime and the use of both the Income Tax Act and Proceeds of Crime Act to seek court enforcement for winding up or for the forfeiture of assets feedback on whether purchase of non-income generating assets (or assets whose income is below the risk free rate (or RFR + margin)) constitutes purchase for intent for capital gains and whether a High Court ruling with respect to items of art, antiquities, commodities or block chain financial assets could set precedent for capital gains tax under current tax law. This could be extended to investment property assets where income earned (or losses generated) never exceeds the RFR/RFR+margin. greater monitoring of increasing tax arrears (PAYE, GST, provisional tax) at entity and individual levels for early intervention to prevent subsequent court action to recover arrears. workforce and IT planning to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Monitoring, Compliance and Enforcement functions of the department. In the event that the IRD chooses to pursue the LTIB topic it has outlined then it should ensure consistency with respect to topics already considered by the Tax Working Group in 2019. The LTIB specifically states that it will not analyze environmental taxes as the subject has been covered in the TWG Final Report and yet the LTIB will consider capital gains tax. For consistency the scope should either: include and analyze environmental taxes in addition to all other taxes in the scope or exclude CGT given it has been covered extensively in the TWG Final Report Given the cost and man-hours required for an LTIB it is my recommendation that the proposed LTIB be abandoned and efforts made to focus on a topic that can add value to the long-term strategic direction of the IRD. Yours sincerely Michael Locke s 9(2)(a) External Email CAUTION: Please take CARE when opening any links or attachments. Hi Initially, I have one concern and one observation for your consideration: 1. I am concerned you cannot arrive at anything new or practical from this topic scope having put the greatest challenges to existing settings on the sidelines as follows: “Other trends identified include New Zealand’s low levels of productivity compared to OECD countries, as well as changes in technology, the impacts of artificial intelligence and changes in the nature of work. However, we do not plan to consider the latter trends in depth because the impacts on the tax system are uncertain or they are more directly relevant to tax administration, which we do not plan to consider in the LTIB.” 2. It has been argued in some quarters that aging should be approached as a disease. The importance of modern monetary theory and practice (as made mainstream during COVID) in deciding the quality of life in respect of global issues, such as disease, aging and global warming are critical considerations missing from the paper and scope. That is, tax is not the only modern means of stabilising progress and development and the analysis appears incomplete without this wider context expressed.

I shall start with answers to the particular questions mentioned in the discussion document, and then follow with some personal thoughts. 23.1 Does the environmental scan identify the key challenges facing our tax system over the long term? NO, I was pleasantly impressed by the quantity and quality of the comparative information, but the information itself did not indicate the future challenges to our economy. In fact I found the NZ IRD discussion document a more useful source of information about the future challenges. 23.2 How well positioned is our current tax system to respond to these challenges? Moderately well. We have a tax system that is currently working well and reasonably easy to understand. It also avoids some of the problems of other systems, like thresholds, exclusions and special cases, that complicate tax systems elsewhere. The discussion document seems to place a lot of weight on GST/VAT having a larger relative impact on low-income families, but that can be dealt with by simply increasing welfare support, as was done when NZ introduced GST. Creating multiple GST rates and exclusions would cause more problems than would be worthwhile. 23.3 Do you agree with the focus on how to maintain a stable core structure of the tax system while ensuring the system has flexibility to adapt to different revenue and distributional objectives over time? Partially. I certainly support a stable tax structure, with as few surprises as possible. Flexibility sounds fine on paper, but tax changes often end up distorting the economy as individuals and entities adjust their activities to minimize their tax liability, and there is a risk that flexibility could cause more problems than it is worth. We also need to be aware that flexibiliy is all too often used politically to justify treating some groups or individuals differently from the rest. 23.4 Do you agree that understanding the pros and cons of different approaches to income and consumption tax is important for understanding what tax system would be suitable for the future? YES, understanding is always useful in any situation. BUT tax is not simply an economic process, it also has huge a political impact, and we need to also understand how to manage the politics of taxation in addition to the economics. 23.5 Do you agree that we should consider what is taxed under our current main two bases, and if there are any bases it makes sense to add to our tax mix? YES, BUT whilst such consideration is needed, the process should best start with tax principles, and then the specifics should become clear. I believe that this process does generally occur in NZ. There are some aspects of the economy that should be excluded from taxation, and the most important is wealth -- I shall expand on that theme further down this document. 23.6 Do you think we should consider both options for a future tax system that may have higher revenue needs and options at current revenue levels? MORE even than those two options, we should also consider lower revenue scenarios. One of the problems of democracies is the ability of the majority to create a taxation system that disadvantages a minority of members of society (often those who are wealthy) and also the next generation. Many OECD Countries have already loaded the next generation with debt, and a few are still considering wealth taxes, which will reduce the tax base of the next generation. That process has been made politically attractive by encouraging many of our population to tax wealth off the rich. Such a process will end up delivering less tax (on Capital earnings) to future generations. PERSONAL THOUGHTS on TAXATION in the future Capital Gains are a most complicated situation as so many aspects may contribute to an increase in value of an item. Doing up an old dwelling gets labeled as a capital gain, but in truth that is a manufacturing process and profits are properly taxed as income. Some offshore shares gain value when minimally taxed company earnings are retained, and these also end up taxed in NZ with the same good reason. More controversial is items increasing their cash price due to inflation, when inflation is primarily caused by governments printing money. It seems irrational to reward governments for damaging the economy with additional tax. A practical problem with CGT is the management of of Capital Losses, as most governments insulate themselves from the immediate impact of such losses by refusing refunds and only offering to offset future gains against past losses. In doing so they distort the justification for the tax. Some items gain value simply because demand increases. It seems unusual to tax good luck, unless the tax were applied in a similar way to gambling taxes. I would like to suggest that once we have identified gains due to work being input, any other gains should not be taxed, and offer the table below as a summary:- Cause of ▲ Price TaxJustification Work put inAs earned income◄ Ūn-taxed EarningsAs Income◄ InflationNOPrice increase due to money being worth less is no real gain. LuckUnwisePossibly tax as gambling, but problems dealing with losses. Wise ChoicesCounter-productiveThe economy benefits when people make wise investments, and when they fund risky ventures, some of which work out. Wealth taxes have been a regular subject of calls for additional taxation, and I believe that wealth itself should most definitely not be taxed. The earnings from invested wealth are currently taxed, and deliver a significant part of the government’s tax take, and on an ongoing basis. If the wealth were taxed away (or persuaded to leave), then the tax on wealth earnings would disappear. The graph on the right has some Laffer-like features and demonstrates the loss of future tax on the earnings from wealth when the wealth itself is taxed. Using a model with tax rates similar to those currently in NZ, and assuming that the wealth delivers a 5% earnings return, which is taxed at 33%, 33% is spent and the remaining 34% is re-invested. With NO wealth tax the tax would be 33% of 5% plus 15% of 33% of 5%, ie 2.4% of the wealth every year. Looking into the future, the wealth (and associated taxes) would have grown by 18% at 10 years, 41% at 20 years and 66% at 30 years. Leaving wealth to grow would deliver to the next generation Capital for our industries and more tax for our future governments. WITH a Wealth Tax The graphs show that when wealth taxes are applied, there is a short period when the tax take increases, followed by a permanent reduction in the future tax takes. This generation will benefit at the expense of future generations. At very low levels of wealth tax, the tax simply reduces the rate at which the Tax (earnings + GST + Wealth) increase the future tax take. The point at which the wealth (& associated taxes) decline into the future is when the wealth tax exceeds the re-investment rate, which is 1.7% in this model. I believe that the UK has inheritance tax at around 40%, which would be the equivalent of 1.6%/year for inheritances being passed on every generation (25 years), and they are still talking about additional annual wealth taxes, which would undoubtedly result in a net decline in national wealth, plus the associated future taxes. Another aspect of this process is that in a future with less workers and employment, wealth and savings will become a progressively more important contribution to personal spending, and consumption taxes We are already encouraging some growth in wealth with Kiwisaver, so there is no economic logic in trying to eliminate other forms of wealth. Local Government in NZ is clearly out of kilter with much of the rest of the OECD, and I believe it was a mistake for central government to give local government the authority to levy taxes, but without adequate limits or constraints. We are now in a most difficult situation, with high levels of debt, high expectations for services, and local government taxes at levels that are almost intolerable. We clearly need a plan to resolve this situation. It is the responsibility of central government to restrain taxation and spending by it’s proxy – Local Government. However, in doing so, central government must stop passing work (& additional costs) onto local Councils. The Land Tax is a significant part of the problem, and there is a certain irony in the fact that whilst the IRD discussion documents talks about flexibility, land taxes are very inflexible. Many taxes can be mitigated if they become too onerous, often by moving oneself or one’s business to a more friendly location, or reducing production. Not so with land taxes, as the owner will have to pay the tax, whether the land/property is generating profits or not. So, there is no incentive for Local Authorities to be reasonable or to consider whether their tax is discouraging production. Working Life was mentioned several times in the discussion document, with most attention applied to increasing the retirement age. That is certainly important, and needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Minimal attention has been applied to extending the working life by starting work earlier. In a process that looks very much like provider capture, we have added several years of formal education (and the associated debt) to many young lives by pushing their skill-based educational needs out of apprenticeships and into theory-orientated Universities. A partial solution to perceived workforce shortages would be to get many of our young people out of Universities and debt, and back into apprenticeships and earning several years earlier. Offshore Influences cannot be ignored, as they provide competition for our workers, Capital and production. They also represent a risk to our home industries and tax base. We need to start with proper taxation of goods and services from abroad or offshore companies. We have not done well so far, allowing offshore providers a low-tax advantage that damages our tax base and the ability of our home industries to compete. I am amazed that successive governments should allow such advantages to offshore entities to persist for so long. Ensuring fair taxation of goods and services from offshore is probably the most fruitful aspect to explore for new taxes. We should also remain aware that the opportunities to cheat our tax system are much greater for offshore owners and providers than for NZ residents. Tax Production or Consumption? ... The data in the discussion document shows that we do indeed tax both, but that consumption taxes are significantly smaller. That is probably because consumption taxes are politically less acceptable than production taxes. However, high taxes on production tend to deliver a competitive advantage to offshore production, especially if offshore company taxes and post-tax wages are lower. If additional taxes were desired, then increasing consumption tax (GST) would be improve the lot of our productive companies and workers. Stealth taxes did not get a mention in the IRD discussion document, possibly because they remain invisible to the IRD, and apparently to the news media as well. These are financial processes in which companies or individuals are required to pay for a social outcome that the government desires, but the money does not go through the government accounts as tax and expenditure. One example would be minimum wage legislation which reduces the cost of welfare to the government, whilst allowing the government to claim that NZ taxes are low. Unfortunately, this invisible tax also makes it difficult for our producers to compete offshore, and keeps prices high onshore. Environmental Scan!! -- whilst I recognise the trend to use new and modern sounding words, would it not have been simple (especially or old fogeys like myself) to call the process an International Comparison, or even a Benchmark? Regardless of the name, one of the difficulties of the process is the missing information, specifically how well the Countries used for comparison are doing economically. We really don’t want to copy taxation amounts or processes that are associated with poor economic performance, and poor performance seems to be all too common in the OECD these days. California is already showing us that high taxation plays a significant part in persuading Capital, companies and rich taxpayers to move away. 1 April 2017 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington Dear Sir/Madam This submission to the Tax Working Group draws on a range of experience involving tax, business, and investment matters including – • 1960-61 Inland Revenue Department - Assessment Officer • 1963-64 Richardson McKissock Cartwright (Tax Consultants) – Tax Accountant • 1975-79 New Zealand Dairy Board – Chief Financial Officer • 1979-83 New Zealand Dairy Board (London) – Regional Director Europe • 1985-92 New Zealand Dairy Board – Chief Executive • 1992-2015 Professional Director/Chairman (public and private companies, including AMP NZ Ltd and investment company Rangatira Ltd) • 1992-2018 Management of personal retirement investment fund I am happy to be available to discuss the points raised. Yours faithfully R M (Murray) Gough OBE s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP from Murray Gough 10 April 2018 Introduction The fundamental aim of this submission is to highlight the practical difficulties of designing and implementing a Capital Gains Tax that could be accepted as fair by most New Zealanders. As the Working Group has identified, New Zealand enjoys a tax system that is broad-based and widely supported - as well as being coherent and efficient. It is, in fact, remarkable how few issues of real concern are identified in the Background Paper. Maintaining the existing level of acceptance is important. Any changes to the current tax system should be for clear reasons, and implemented in a manner that has wide public endorsement. This submission considers what such reasons might be, and comments on options for addressing them. Reasons for Change The Background Paper, explicitly or implicitly, indicates the following main reasons for significant change – 1. Additional tax revenue may be needed 2. Fairness requires a Capital Gains Tax 3. Wealth inequality is too great, and can be reduced by a suitable tax. Comments 1. Additional tax revenue may be needed – The broad numbers (Table 1, Page 10) suggest that over coming decades New Zealand will need to either reduce Government Expenditure as a proportion of GDP, or increase taxes. The changes required are not particularly substantial and do not appear to be urgent. Both alternatives can be reasonably easily accommodated – a) Reduce Government Expenditure - obviously there are many ways to reduce expenditure, but the least disruptive way to make a significant difference is a progressive extension of the qualifying age for National Superannuation. Life expectancy is increasing by 3 months or so every year, and rather than an increased period of old age and ill health this is resulting in an extended healthy life. There is accordingly an increasing ability (and indeed, for many people, desire) to work longer. Pushing out the qualifying age for National Superannuation will almost certainly become increasingly acceptable. b) Increase Taxes – if future governments find it impossible to curtail expenditure, the best way to increase revenue will be to increase expenditure-linked taxes, particularly GST. GST is widely regarded by New Zealanders as unobjectionable, and the VAT table (Figure 9, Page 30) shows that our rate is well below that of most other developed countries. The main concern with GST is regressivity, but that can be largely addressed by transfer payments. Expenditure-linked taxes also have the desirable outcome of causing tourists to contribute to tax revenue. Any proposal to introduce new taxes, or increase income tax rates, should have merits that are clearly greater than these relatively straightforward alternatives. 2. Fairness requires a Capital Gains Tax – The Background Paper makes the point that “What is fair to one person might not seem fair to another”. It may accordingly be seen to be just as fair to tax Capital Gains as to tax income and expenditure. To gain widespread acceptance, however, a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) would need to be seen as unquestionably fair. The experiences of other countries, and previous reviews of our own tax system, highlight just how difficult – if not impossible - that is to achieve. To be fair, a Capital Gains Tax would have to include the following provisions - 1) inflation would need to be allowed for when measuring gains and losses – otherwise CGT would be applied to partially fictitious value movements; 2) a carry-forward CGT credit would be needed for losses (asset values go down as well as up, and it would be unfair to apply CGT only to gains); 3) CGT would need to apply to all sales and transfers of assets - including gifts to family members and trusts, and assets transferred or sold from a deceased estate; 4) both realised and unrealised gains would need to be taxed because – a. it would be unfair that a taxpayer was subject to CGT because he had to (or decided to) sell, while his neighbour avoided CGT by continuing to hold; b. taxing only realised gains would result in substantial economic inefficiency by discouraging sales that would otherwise be made – such as a farmer selling to move to a larger property, or a particular share being replaced with a better investment in an investment portfolio; allowing a non-taxable rollover for reinvestment in similar assets may appear a simple solution, but would greatly reduce the CGT tax base (and unless gifts and transfer on death were treated as sales - or Gift and Estate Duties reintroduced - rollover would result in increasingly valuable portfolios being passed on with no CGT being paid); however, taxing unrealised gains raises complex and difficult issues, such as how to value assets without a public market (shares in unlisted companies, small businesses, professional and other partnerships) and how to manage the cash impact on taxpayers with substantial assets but restricted cashflow. A fair Capital Gains Tax system would also need to have found satisfactory solutions to the following issues - 1) while a New Zealand-domiciled investment fund would (presumably) be subject to CGT when any of the fund’s investments were sold, overseas-domiciled funds in non-CGT jurisdictions would not (including ones investing in New Zealand shares and property); owning units or shares in such overseas funds would need to be prohibited as taxpayers would otherwise simply move their investments into them (avoiding CGT, and reducing New Zealand’s CGT tax base); 2) funds that support final-salary-related pensions would be underfunded if CGT applied to sales of their investments, yet it would be inequitable for such funds not to be subject to CGT while defined-contribution plans (and private investment accumulations) were; it would also be inequitable if superannuitants whose payments were not drawn from an identified fund retained existing benefits while the funds supporting others became subject to CGT; 3) there would be a strong temptation to fail to report the existence of (and gains on) offshore assets, particularly non-income-producing assets; 4) significant valuation difficulties would arise (for gifts and estate transfers) for assets without a public market such as small businesses, professional and other partnerships, and shares in unlisted companies; 5) severe cash flow difficulties would arise for taxpayers selling one investment to reinvest in another (unless a rollover is permitted for reinvestment of funds into a replacement asset). In summary, designing a fair Capital Gains Tax is a hugely daunting task. And if family homes are largely or wholly exempt, offset is allowed for capital losses, allowance is made for inflation, and reinvestment rollover is permitted, net tax raised is unlikely to be substantial. 3. Wealth inequality is too great, and can be reduced by a suitable tax – There is only limited data on wealth inequality in the Background Paper and it is difficult to know to what degree this is a problem – and importantly, how rapidly wealth inequality has been/still is growing. If the political judgement is that wealth inequality needs to be addressed, it is unlikely (given the concerns set out above) that a Capital Gains Tax will have much effect. While a Wealth Tax may be considered, the experiences of countries that have experimented with this are not encouraging. The valuation and cash flow issues with a Capital Gains Tax, as well as many of the other difficulties, also apply to a Wealth Tax. If it is considered that wealth inequality needs to be addressed, the simplest and most effective way to do so is likely to be reintroduction of Estate and Gift Duties. Response to Appendix 2 Questions on CGT Design Issues • Should CGT be a separate tax? Yes. Otherwise the huge swings that can occur in asset values (such as the 1987 and 2008 share market falls) would result in a substantial drop in income tax receipts as CGT losses offset taxable income. • Accrual or realised basis? Accrual – for the reasons outlined in the submission above. • Matrimonial settlements and disposal of assets on death? There is no obvious reason why these should be treated any differently from when an asset is sold. The question does not arise if the accrual option is used. • What assets should be covered? Assets of an enduring investment nature should be covered; for administrative simplicity defined assets that have a limited life and declining value (such as ordinary cars and household goods) should be excluded. • Should assets held by Kiwisaver and other savings schemes be taxed? Yes. To do otherwise will distort investment decisions. • Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? Yes. Excluding such assets will distort investment decisions (please also note the comments in the submission above). • How would CGT integrate with current tax laws? CGT paid by a company should be able to be passed down to its shareholders as a CGT imputation credit, able to be used by each shareholder to offset any CGT the shareholder becomes liable for. Otherwise a capital gain is likely to be taxed twice. • When should non-residents be subject to tax? All property owned by non-residents but physically located in New Zealand should be subject to CGT. To do otherwise would give residents in non-CGT jurisdictions a greater financial return than that available to local residents – with obvious implications for foreign ownership of houses and farms. • Should capital losses be ring fenced? Yes (per comments against the first question above). • Should there be a rollover relief? Yes. This isn’t an issue if CGT is applied on an accrual basis – which, for the reasons in the submission above, is the fairest basis for such a tax. • How should death, emigration, and immigration be handled? There is no reason why death should be treated any differently from when an asset is sold. Emigration and immigration are essentially questions of when a person becomes (or ceases to be) a New Zealand resident – assets should be valued as at the relevant dates, with CGT payable for emigrants based on asset values at the date the person ceases to be a resident. The question does not arise if the accrual option is used. • How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? Gifts and gambling winnings (and prizes) should be treated as having been purchased by the recipient at market value, and disposed of by the giver at the same value. • Rate of CGT? There is no strong pointer to any particular rate. • Should there be an allowance for inflation? Yes. Gains and losses can only be measured fairly after making an allowance for inflation. • Should there be a de minimis rule? Yes. • What administrative implications? Some of the more difficult implications are how to ensure all gains are properly reported (particularly overseas assets); and how to value assets without a public market (shares in unlisted companies, small businesses, professional and other partnerships). • Transition rules? Opening values for assets should be their value at the date of formal commitment to CGT introduction. It would be extremely unfair to retrospectively tax past gains - taxpayers may well have made different acquisition or sale decisions if they had known that CGT would be payable. It would also be unfair if existing assets were never subject to CGT. The accrual approach makes this issue irrelevant – assets would simply be valued at a CGT commencement date with CGT applicable to annually updated values from then on. • Family trusts? Assets held in family trusts should be subject to CGT on exactly the same basis as assets owned by individuals and companies. Gifts to (and from) a trust should be valued at market value at the date of gift. 20241003 LTIB TAX NZCCSS | 20241003 Our Tax System Bases and Regimes Tirohanga Whānui | Overview The New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services (NZCCSS) welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback on IR’s LTIB for 2024. We support the kaupapa to explore a range of responses to the question around the mix of tax bases and regimes in our tax system. With infrastructure challenges, low relative national debt and a low tax economy, this review is timely. Taunakitanga | Recommendations Our main points are: Tax Education Required As the discussion around tax gains traction, there needs to be more attention given to wider public understanding of tax. Both how taxes operate, but also, what they exist for. Wealth Tax / Tax Switch We support the development of a tax on our highest earners, as proposed by the previous Labour Party government. Line by Line / Review of Practices We believe that a review of income allocation across related party entities would indicate a range of areas of the income tax that could be tightened up / are being to reduce marginal tax rates to inequitable levels. We believe a line-by-line review of the Income Tax Act for equity, fairness and transparency is overdue, but that a review that has been informed by common business practices would identify a range of ways to increase the tax take under existing rules. Associated Party Register and RIT Statement With the utilisation of income spreading across entities, we would like to see a register of associated parties, and reporting of group real income tax rates. This would support IR to identify the equity or not of the current system of taxation and identify areas of focus.

As a general comment, we found the scoping document interesting and informative, providing valuable context on the challenges New Zealand faces in raising sufficient revenue for the future. Deloitte’s principal concern, and sole submission point, is the broad scope of the proposed LTIB topic. While the bases and regimes of New Zealand’s tax system is a commendable topic and undeniably important, its extensive scale may prevent the final LTIB from analysing each issue in sufficient depth. Superficial or cursory discussions could lead to inaccuracies and limit the usefulness of the analysis. For example, the proposed section on income as a tax base proposes to discuss the taxation of capital income. Deloitte submits that an abstract analysis of the pros and cons might lean in one direction based on theoretical underpinning but would unlikely be able to sufficiently grapple with the volume and nature of the regulations necessary for implementing a capital gains tax. Consequently, the LTIB’s discussions may be disconnected from the practical realities and trade-offs of any tax change. Deloitte believes this capital income example highlights a broader issue. Therefore, Deloitte recommends that the LTIB’s scope be narrowed and focused. In our view, an LTIB is not the appropriate forum for a comprehensive review of the entire tax system, such as those conducted by the Cullen and McLeod tax working groups. Given the scale of this undertaking, Deloitte also questions whether the proposed topic is the best use of Inland Revenue’s resources. Previous comprehensive tax system reviews, like those by the Cullen and McLeod groups, required significant input from many officials. There is a risk of a 'worst of both worlds' scenario: expending too much Inland Revenue resource on the LTIB could detract from other important projects, yet not committing enough resources could result in findings that are not comprehensive and, therefore, of little value.

C o r p o r a t e T a x p a y e r s G r o u p C T G 4 October 2024 Felicity Barker Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue WELLINGTON BY EMAIL: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Dear Felicity Consultation on the scope of Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing The Group thanks you for the opportunity to comment on the scope of Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing (LTIB scoping paper). The Group believes that the long-term insights briefing process is a valuable one. The Group strongly supports the consultation and discussion that occurs as a result of this process, and it is in that context that the Group’s comments are provided. It is the Group’s view that the recently released consultative paper on the scope of Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing (LTIB scoping paper) could be viewed as suggesting this next LTIB process would be a review of the “broad structure” of the New Zealand tax system and its future suitability. That seems to require a general review of all aspects of the tax system along the lines of the 2019 (Cullen) Tax Working Group Report and the prior general tax reviews. For example, the LTIB scoping paper seems to propose a review of: • The objectives of a good tax system. • The comprehensiveness and appropriateness of the income tax and GST bases. • The appropriate rate of tax for and mix of these bases. • Additional tax bases – payroll taxes (including social security taxes), land and real property taxes, wealth taxes, inheritance or estate taxes, turnover taxes, and transaction taxes (presumably stamp duties and similar). It also suggests that consideration be given to the design of “progressive consumption taxes”. This may or may not be intended to cover direct expenditure taxes. While this seems to exclude Pigouvian and behavioural taxes, the proposed scope remains comprehensive. That would mean a wide-ranging review without the explicit government support, resources and public input associated with past general tax reviews. Moreover, past general tax reviews have, out of necessity, considered political trade-offs involved in tax design. As a result, such reviews have been used to lead debate on tax policy – they have made specific proposals for tax reform. An official exercise, on the other hand, should, it seems, inform and not lead public debate. We thus consider it important that the LTIB be focused on what would be most useful in terms of informing public debate on tax policy matters while not itself setting out or advocating for any specific policy reform. Based on the environmental scan provided by the LTIB scoping paper, we suggest a more focused approach than attempting another general tax review. The environmental scan seems to suggest that officials’ concern with the existing tax system is its possible inflexibility. This seems to be in terms of: HON SIR ROGER DOUGLAS- A SUBMISSION ON LONG TERM TAX AND OTHER POLICIES. A Submission to the Inland Revenue Department on what sort of structure the tax system might need to take on to be suitable for the future, given, “The long-term fiscal pressures and current tensions in our system”. BACKGROUND NOTES SETTING OBJECTIVES FOR A WINNING MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY FOR N Z. - We can turn New Zealand’s current problems into opportunities, if we define what we need to deliver by say 2035, and how we intend to do it. - A single, measurable, overriding policy objective is suggested as the criterion which integrates a total 5-15+ year program. - My paper emphasizes, - the fundamental linkages, between the key issues and areas, which are key to solving the problems we face in New Zealand today. - In order to ensure policy credibility and success, my paper is based on a framework that exploits those basic linkages. - My paper is a broad description of an approach to policy which would work successfully in practice and ensure delivery, if implemented in an appropriate way. The second part of my paper, spells out detailed objectives for 2035, and beyond, and the key policies needed to achieve them. -What then are the key issues facing New Zealand at present time, they include-health, education, retirement super and health, welfare, tax, debt, housing, race, unemployment, productivity and the economy. -New Zealand cannot win, on any of these issues by seeking short-term answers to our problems over the next 12 months, or even the next 24 months. - None of these issues can be resolved, unless we place them in a medium-term context, of 4-6years, with retirement policy needing an even longer time period. -Because the issues set-out above are fundamentally linked, and the people of New Zealand know it. We cannot win either if we look at each area in isolation, as New Zealand’s politicians have been doing for the past 30 years. Unfortunately, the Inland Revenue Department in their paper, appears to be taking the same, one issue at a time approach to their project as well. 2 -Poor parenting, lack of motivation, inadequate skills, alienation, unemployment, and delinquency reinforce each other. -Low income, inadequate housing, poor health, lack of opportunity, debt and lack of economic growth are all part of the same syndrome. WHAT THEN IS THE TASK THAT FACES NEW ZEALAND OVER THE NEXT 5- 10 YEARS. -First and foremost, we need to encourage New Zealanders to think about where they want to get to over the next 5-10years. -To achieve this objective, we will need to have a program, about goals, objectives, and dreams—and practical common-sense delivery. We will also need to understand that New Zealand cannot win by trying to defend the past 50-60 years. New Zealand’s performance in total over that time is now seen as confused and totally unsatisfactory for today’s requirements. -New Zealand can only win if it establishes a great policy agenda, one that is seen by the people of New Zealand as having the ingredients in it, that are needed to be successful. (While IRD’s paper has some interesting facts and raises some interesting questions, better than treasuries recent efforts, it falls somewhat short of what is required, in part because the authors seem to believe important issues are outside the scope of their mandate) Given New Zealand’s current economic and social situation, what it needs is an active medium-term strategy, which aims to unite as many New Zealanders as possible behind it. A STRATEGY TO APPEAL TO ALL NEW ZEALANDERS. -New Zealanders as a whole are desperate to see a real recover, not the phony ones, they have been subjected to by some politicians (Key -New Zealand is a rock star economy) -The simple fact is, that the social costs of very low growth, over a period of several decades has damaged the security and well-being of people at every level of New Zealand society. -While the costs, have hit the disadvantaged harder than anyone else, their reaction too it has had an impact on everyone. -Deep down the public know growth is the only way to avoid an ongoing erosion of living standards and wellbeing, and look to the government to provide the policy leadership needed. -Growth of necessity involves a reduction of waste, privilege (tax privileges for example), inefficiency and avoidable burdens placed on those who create and contribute to growth. 3 -In these circumstances, Government’s need to be seen to be tackling the fundamental problems of our society. That is, tackling the root causes of dissatisfaction at every level of our society, rather than dealing piecemeal or short-term with the symptoms, as New Zealand has been doing for most of the past 60 years. In order to solve our problems, New Zealand governments, will in the future need to focus, without shame, guilt or confusion on what they want to deliver to voters across the whole social and political spectrum. The government who-ever it is will need to tell voters the truth, the whole truth, about their country’s current economic and social situation. They will need to stop polling, in order to be able to tell voters, what voters want to hear as Clark, Key, Ardern and others have been doing for the past 25 years. WHAT KEY ISSUE COULD UNITE NEW ZEALANDERS AND APPEAL TO A MAJORITY OF VOTERS -The issues defined on page 1 of this paper, are central to New Zealand’s recovery, as a nation, because they react negatively on rich and poor alike. -Those issues focus around the plight of the disadvantaged and the adverse impact their situation has on the rest of the public. - The only way, both sides of the equation can be satisfied is if we set ourselves one single overriding objective, which is central to achieving our economic and social objectives, and solving New Zealand’s growth issues at the same time. My suggestion- “REAL SUSTAINABLE GAINS IN LIVING STANDARDS AND OPPORTITY FOR ALL NEW ZEALANDERS, WITH PARTICULARLY EMPHASIS ON THE DISADVANTAGE “. -Within that framework, we could integrate all our thinking. On growth, investment, jobs, tax, security, and social policy, in areas like education, retirement, health, housing and social harmony. -If all our programs, once developed were referred back to that objective, New Zealand governments could if they chose to do so, act with purpose, conviction and commitment in the interests of all of us. The Audit or some other specialist office, should be charged with the job, of telling the public when the government’s policies were likely to fail to help us reach our central objective. (See Appendix one- On how New Zealand got into the mess we are in today) 4 POLICY STEPS –- REQUIRED TO FIX THE FINANCIAL MESS NEW ZEALAND IS IN. Treasury predicts on a same trend basis, an operating deficit of 13.3% off GDP by 2061, with net government debt of 197%. That is, New Zealand will be bankrupt by 2061, or before. These numbers are driven, by the 8.1% of GDP (120 billion dollars), increase in government expenditure, for superannuation, healthcare and education over the 40 years from 2021. It is this increase in government expenditure, from 2021, that is pushing New Zealand into the massive, yearly fiscal deficit position predicted by Treasury. These deficits will also, result in large increases in the interest costs of government each year, adding further to New Zealand’s deficit position. (See Appendix one, for details about how NZ got into the mess it has.) Unfortunately, Treasury’s ideas to get out of the mess we are in, are old hat, (increase taxes and cut benefits) policies which would merely kick the can down the road, for a while. Inland Revenue’s paper is not much better, it lacks the imagination needed, it asks for example “do you think we should consider both options for a future tax system that may have higher revenue needs and options at current revenue levels” My answer, is a simple No, I believe Inland Revenue should also consider other options, including my options, which would reduce the governments revenue needs by around 50%,over the next 40-50 years, and move us into a fiscal surplus within 20 years. POLICIES TO REDUCE GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE BY 50%, AND INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY. STEP 1 – Involves making the decision to move away from our existing pay- as- you- go system, to an individual saving-based retirement system. STEP 2-- Involves making the decision, about how much a person needs to save each year during their working years 18-65, (possibly 68 by 2060) in order to have enough capital, to cover their income and healthcare needs in retirement, at today’s levels at least. Using Treasury’s 40year forecasts, to tell me, what the average cost of superannuation and healthcare beyond 2072, was likely to be, I calculated how much New Zealanders would need to save in order to have enough capital to meet their welfare needs in retirement. My answer was they would need around $2.5 million each, for their super income and their healthcare needs in retirement. The $2.5 million was based on the assumption, that on average, New Zealanders will live for 20-21 years in retirement and earn 6%-6.5% on their capital. Given that few New Zealanders will work every year for the full 50 years (18-68) of their working lives, I decided to have a higher saving level per year than theoretically needed at $6,000 per year, adjusted for wage and health inflation at 3.5%, with fund earnings at 6.5% a year. (See table 1below) 5 The $6,000, to be saved each year by New Zealanders between the age of 18 and their retirement age, would be made available to them by way of personal income tax reductions. To do this the first $62,000, of any income earned, would be tax free, reducing New Zealanders personal income tax by $10,820 a year. $6,000 of which would go into an approved retirement savings account of their choice, with $4,500 of what remains going into their personal healthcare account. (See tax & health policy details below) TABLE-1 (Does not take into account any savings before the age of 18.)

How compound interest in the future pays for 80%, of a New Zealanders welfare needs in retirement, with individuals paying only 20%, not the 100% they pay today, under the current pay-as-you-go system. 6 -- Note also the slow decline, in the percentage of the existing pension paid out under the new system, during the early years of the new saving system. -- Note for example, that after 25 years of contributions to the new system, a retiree would be getting around 84% of the existing super pension, plus having a large lump sum of $548,000 to go with it. --Note that most New Zealand workers in addition to their welfare super savings (around $2.50 to 4 million dollars by 2074) will also have a Kiwi Saver style account in their own name and/or an alternative saving approach, which could easily equal their welfare super savings if they wanted it to. Lower income earners will be incentivised to save in a kiwi saver style account if they can. --Why is it, that despite the above information, Treasury, along with all of New Zealand’s existing political parties, favour, cuts to the existing superannuation pay outs and higher taxes across the board, rather than a saving based option, which would maintain their retirement benefits, at least at current levels as outlined above.? A lot of New Zealanders believe, holding onto their powers is the main reason politicians take the stance they do. --In the case of Treasury, their approach comes straight out of their standard play book, when faced with the kind of financial mess New Zealand is in today, they go straight to it, answer, cuts to benefits, and higher taxes as well. --In the case of New Zealand’s political parties, they are driven by mixed motives and incentives, as we will see. ON THE LEFT, it gives them the opportunity to appear to be caring, keep super benefits in place, and tax the rich to pay for it, tax capital gains, and increase taxes on those earning $100,000+. ON THE RIGHT, There is a total lack of imagination, about what can be done, National have already adopted Treasuries approach, of cuts to super and will hope that this will somehow be enough. Act while agreeing with the policy to cut superannuation, would also adjust personal income tax rates in a way that would penalise hard working lower income earners, while rewarding high income earners. Why is it, that none of New Zealand’s political parties, favour an individual saving-based approach to retirement, for health and income, despite the following facts- -Savings held by individual New Zealanders, for their future health and income needs in retirement, would exceed 9 trillion dollars by 2074, under my policies. Compared to unfunded liabilities of 5-6 trillion dollars, if we stay with the current pay-as-you-go- based welfare system, favoured by Treasury and all of New Zealand’s current political parties. -- While by year 2073, 220 billion dollars + or around $2,000 a week would be available for tax reductions (much of it already in place by that time) as a result of the reduction in government spending on superannuation and healthcare. (See table two below) 7 THE COST OF RETIREMENT SUPER AND HEALTHCARE IN TERMS OF LOST REVENUE YEAR ONE Cost year one -- 17Billion Dollars (2,833,333 workers X $6,000) by way of lower personal income taxes.

Because they have the most to gain by way of tax reductions in the future. TAX POLICY TO GO WITH NEW RETIREMENT SAVING AND OTHER POLICIES- Tax Reductions, to Fund Individual Savings for Super and Healthcare in Retirement, for Workers, Aged18-65 (With a possible move to 68 over 30 years, starting 2040) PERSONAL INCOME TAXES Z ERO- Personal Income Tax on First $62,000 of Income- A TAX SAVINGS $10,820 per year. -$6,000 of the $10,820 in personal income tax reductions, to go into an individuals approved retirement saving account for income and healthcare in retirement. (See table 1, with estimated retirement savings each year for the next 50 years, along with the % of government superannuation retirees could expect to still receive, on top of savings) $4,500 of the remaining $4,820, in tax reductions, would go into an individual’s healthcare fund, to help pay for any health costs incurred, during their working life, i ncluding a yearly catastrophic healthcare policy. Any money in an individual’s health account at their retirement date, to remain with that person, and be available to meet any healthcare costs they might have in retirement. T hresholds to go up each year by the rate of inflation in each specified area, for example (wages, healthcare costs for retirement, and healthcare costs for those aged 18-65) OTHER PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATES GHANGES-- -A Flat 28%- Personal income tax rate, on any income earned above $ 62,000. -A WELFARE TAX SURCHARGE- (For as long as it is needed) ON INCOME-- B etween $80,001 and $180,000-of 5%, (a combined tax rate 33%- 28%+5%) and 11% in the dollar, on income over $180,000. (A combined tax rate of 39%- 28%+11%) Any money raised by this welfare levy in the early years of the new system, would help pay for the education and other welfare costs, that New Zealand currently has. 9 OTHER TAX ISSUES- Cost of Tax Reduction Policy to the government— Superannuation- $6,000 X 2,833,333 individuals= 17 billion dollars Healthcare- $4,500 x 2,833,333 individuals = 12.7 billion dollars How Paid For— Superannuation-By a reduction in government expenditure of 17 billion dollars. (See Table 2 above) Healthcare—By using 12,7 billion dollars of the existing health vote for that purpose. (Individual control not government) OTHER TAX POLICIES--- CAPITAL TAXES- While I do not support a capital gains tax as such, I would support, consideration being given to the idea of a wealth tax, provided it is linked to getting rid of company tax and other business taxes. ( I advocated this approach to capital taxes 45 years ago, outcome I was removed from the Labour Party front bench) The change in incentives, from a policy of this nature, could if done well, result in a massive increase in productivity. The policy would reward people who use their assets well, while penalising those who do not do so, the exact opposite to what we do today. Example, 2 farmers, both own a property, valued at 100 million dollars. Farmer A is very productive and makes a profit of 15 million dollars after wages. Farmer A, pays company tax of $4.2 million dollars, and tax on his wages of $200,000. Farmer B is far less productive and fails to make a profit, and as a result pays no tax. Both have had the same opportunity, A is successful so we tax him hard, B is not successful so we give him a holiday, that is the situation, under the current tax system we have in place. Under a wealth tax, both would pay the same amount in tax, let us say 1%, that is $1 million each. A would be $3.2 million better off, while B would be $1 million worse off. A is rewarded for his productivity and skills, while B has to get better or sell his farm to someone who is in fact better than he is. (My 1980 Paper available if required) 10 RISK COVER (Accident, Sickness, Unemployment) Existing risk cover by government in the areas of accident, sickness and unemployment, will all be closed off from a specified date. A specialist organisation would be set up, with the sole purpose of winding down these three existing areas of risk cover. No new entrants. Cover from the specified date, for the three areas of risk highlighted above, will be for income only, with healthcare being covered separately. (See healthcare policy for details) RISK POLICY- -Individuals will contribute, what they do today for ACC in year one, while employers will at least match the contribution made. Individuals will be covered, for an amount equal to the existing sickness benefit for them. Individuals wanting a higher level of cover, will need to take it out for themselves in the private market. -The employer and employee, will determine where and with whom any risk insurance policy is taken out, this could include self-cover if that has been approved. A government underwrite (if funds available are insufficient to cover any part of the first 13weeks of being out of work,) will be put in place during the early years of the new scheme) An insurance policy to cover the next 139 weeks, will need to be put in place by the individual/employer. A government underwrite beyond three years (i.e., 156 weeks) would be put in place. WORKING FOR FAMILIES Existing payment rates will be maintained. POLICY- An Individuals Working for Families Weekly Payments Entitlement, for the next year, will be calculated by the Inland Revenue Department, each year, between April and June, based on an individual’s income for the past financial year, April to March. -A tax credit will be issued for each individual taxpayer, with copies going to both the individual and their employer (s). 11 -The employer will pay their employee, the taxpayer, the working for Family’s tax credit, due to them, each pay day for a twelvemonth period, July to June. -No adjustment, to a working for family’s tax credit, apart from that relating to the birth of an extra child, will be made during the year, to the amount of working for families paid. -Nor will there be any end of year adjustment made, even if, for example, if an individual’s wages went up by a significant amount during the year. -New Zealanders hate getting a bill at the end of the year for any under payments that have come about because they earned more than was anticipated during the year. -Note, an adjustment, will automatically come about anyway, when IRD calculates next year’s working for family’s tax credit. HEALTHCARE- The key relationship, in the new healthcare arrangements, will be that of the individual and his local doctor. GOVERNMENT INVOVEMENT IN HEALTHCARE- The New Zealand Government’s central planning of healthcare, over the past 80 years has done little if anything that can be regarded as really good. It has simply, substituted politics for the market place. In the process the system has wasted resources, and in the process has held back economic and social progress. Under my proposed new healthcare regime, government activity in the healthcare industry would be limited to providing those goods the market is unable to provide. The reduction in the health vote for administration would as a result be significant. POLICY- --The $4,500 healthcare tax credit mentioned above, would for most New Zealanders fund the cost of their catastrophic healthcare policy, that is, to cover any major healthcare event and leave something over. Any money left over plus any interest earned on it, would go towards meeting any other healthcare costs, they might have at some time in the future. -Individuals and families would be responsible for their healthcare costs up to 5% of their income, most of which would be covered by tax reductions for lower income earners. -Further tax reductions for families and the balance of any tax credit mentioned above, will cover a major part of yearly healthcare costs. - The chronically ill, would on the advice of their professional medical advisor, be enrolled with a new health status authority, which would, along with an individual’s own doctor, take responsibility for meeting their healthcare costs and needs beyond what is normal for the average New Zealander. 12 EDUCATION- The New Zealand education department would be abolished, it has out lived any usefulness it ever had a long time ago. Under the existing education department, education has been neglected and replaced with some form of weird indoctrination. POLICY The education department will be replaced by a small number of specialist operating units. 1.An education monitoring and approval unit. –Whose function will be to approve the continuation of existing schools at the start of the new system, including their must have prospectus, and any new schools that wish to enter the education market place. They will also be responsible for monitoring schools and reporting yearly on their performance against their prospectus. They will also be available, to advise the board of a school on the appointment of a new principal for the school. 2.An education property company—Whose main function will be to provide a school, that meets the needs of any approved school that wants one. Maintain the school in good condition and charge an appropriate rent for doing so. A rent that reflects its use as a school. After 5-6 years of the new education system being in operation, a review of school property and how it operates will be undertaken, to see if the model of school ownership and provision is suitable. 3.An education voucher will be issued to the parents of all children between the age of 2 and 18, by IRD> 4. Money not spent in any year, will be carried forward, and could for example be used at some time in the future to pay for university or other training, 5. Two billion dollars a year would be set aside to meet the needs of children with special educational needs. (In areas such as reading, maths etc because they have fallen behind, or the child with exceptional skills in various areas) 13 SUMMARY- GOVERNMENT PROVISION OF RETIREMENT WELFARE- CURRENT SYSTEM COMPARED TO PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM—COST THEREOF. -CURRENT PAY AS YOU GO WELFARE SYSTEM. - NEW WELFARE SYSTEM Cost of retirement welfare (Super & Healthcare). Cost of retirement welfare to government Year one 26 billion dollars 25.5 billion dollars --saving $0.5 billion Year ten 46 billion dollars 37.8 billion dollars—saving $8.2 billion Year twenty-five 100 billion dollars. 58.0 billion dollars—saving $42.0billion Year forty 201 billion dollars 42.0 billion dollars---saving $159 billion Year fifty 274 billion dollars -36 billion dollars -- saving $310 billion Note-- Savings in government spending, will be available for tax reductions, from year 10 on at least. What does the new system mean in the areas of personal and corporate taxes- Personal and corporate taxes, along with GST, could be reduced each year, after10 years of the new system, relative to what they will need to be under New Zealand’s existing pay as you go welfare system, if that system is kept in place. The reason why taxes can be reduced each year after 10 years, compared to our current pay as you go system is the contribution each retiree will be making to their own retirement. The contribution each retiree will make at their retirement date will grow each year until the new system is fully mature in 45-50years time. For example, -In year ten, 6 billion dollars would be available for tax reductions (63,000 retirees make a contribution of $90,000 each or $3,500 per qualifying taxpayer for the year) -In year twenty, 20 billion dollars in tax reductions would be available, (66,000 retirees make a contribution of $300,000 each or $29,000 per taxpayer for the year.) -In year 30, 50 billion dollars in tax reductions would be available (69,000 retirees make a contribution of $700,000 each or $29,000 per taxpayer for the year.) -In year 40, 160 billion dollars or $1,500 + a week in tax reductions would be available. While in year 50, 300 billion dollars would be available for tax reductions, or 50% plus, of government income including personal, corporate, GST and other indirect taxes, under the current pay-as-you-go system 14 OTHER ADVANTAGES OF THE NEW WELFARE SYSTEM. --Savings held by individual New Zealanders for their future healthcare and income retirement needs, will exceed 8 trillion dollars by 2073, compared, - to the unfunded government welfare liabilities of around 4-5 trillion dollars we will have, if we stay with the current pay as you go welfare system. A system where we will have no individual retirement savings set aside to meet our health and super needs. --Tax paid on the income generated by the 8Trillion dollars of savings in 2073, would amount to around, 60 billion dollars a year, at a tax rate of 12.5%. This 60billion dollars in tax revenue will help contribute to much lower personal and other taxes. --Individual savings of most retirees beyond 2073 are likely to exceed 4 million dollars at their retirement date, couple double the amount. (Assumption- A welfare fund of around 3 million dollars, plus a Kiwi Saver account or other personal saving around two million dollars.) Government spending on retiree’s healthcare and superannuation payments after 2073 would be limited to those who retired before 2070, with government payments, made for these items around 230Billion dollars lower than they will be if we stay with the current pay as you go welfare system. Virtually no government spending on healthcare and super for the retired will be necessary after 2090. Personal and corporate income tax rates by 2073 should be no more than 12.5% under the above scenario, that is, unless politicians are allowed to spend our money by the New Zealand voter. The question is, will we let them, or have we learnt our lesson.? IN THE END THE CHOICE IS ONE FOR TAXPAYERS AND THEIR ADVISORS— -They can elect to stay with the pay as you go welfare system we have today and see their personal income taxes, at least double, over the next 30-40 years, and see their government retirement benefits fall by at least 25%, over those 30-40 years. (Treasury policy) OR Support a Saving Based Welfare System similar to the one outlined in this paper and see your personal income rate and GST fall on taxable income or the money you spend to between 10% & 1 2.5% in the dollar, over the next 30-50 years 15 INSTITUTIONAL MESS WE ARE IN TODAY- Government welfare institutions are failing miserably, EDUCATION- Limited choice, falling standards, poor disciple, outcome, 40 of all students leave school with insufficient skills to succeed in life. RETIREMENT- 50%+ of all retirees do so, with little or no investment capital or savings. The number of workers to retirees is about to fall over the next 3—40 years. HEALTH- Limited choice, long waiting lists in some areas, wide spread staffing problems, bureaucratic, inefficiency in many areas, rapid rising cost structures. WELFARE- Dependency, hurts the poor the most, results include, inadequate housing, bad parenting, monopoly supply of various services, and low self-esteem. CAPTURE- Institutional capture where the money often goes to the benefit of the institutions or providers not the pupils or patients for whom the money was intended to benefit. RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION- Within the social services resource distribution is often of a ridiculous nature. It is often based on political preferences, not user need or demand. INSTITUTIONAL REFORM—OF THE MANAGEMENT OF GOVERNMENT WELFARE-- BY WAY OF COMPETITION AND CHOICE- Fundamental to the reform of the New Zealand government’s social service institutions is the introduction of competition to all areas of welfare, such as education, healthcare, housing and general welfare (out of work). Competition is just as important in government as it is in private sector markets. The lack of competition, over the past 70 years, in government-owned social service institutions, is why they are in such a mess today, when compared to say Singapore’s welfare institutions. Competition between government owned schools, and between government owned hospitals, and private organisations in those sectors, would help promote efficiency, and as a result economic prosperity, and New Zealanders’ wealth. In the private sector competition is a disciplinary force that requires businesses to compete for the loyalty of their customers. Government-owned social service institutions need to be subject to the same disciplinary forces, before they will get any better. 16 Competition provides consumers with protection against poor service, high prices, and poor products. The need for competition is generally not recognised in New Zealand’s public sector areas such as education and healthcare. In fact, the opposition to competition within the public sector, is already very strong. You can see that in the teacher unions’ reaction to charter schools- a minor incursion, into their near monopoly position. The reality is that performance would be enhanced if private firms were permitted to compete with government enterprises on a level playing field, in the welfare area. Competition would improve performance, it would reduce costs, and it would introduce many innovations, if it was allowed to take place. Competition is the force that encourages providers to, - operate efficiently and cater for their customers’ needs, -improve the products they produce on a continuous basis, -use the assets they have more efficiently, -put an end to monopoly provision HOW THEN IT WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE-- ONE EXAMPLE- HEALTHCARE HEALTHCARE POLICY- Would see New Zealand’s healthcare, move closer to Singapore’s model of individual healthcare saving accounts, catastrophic insurance cover, individual choice and decision making. Why? Because it works, the Singapore system was recently ranked sixth in the world in terms of overall quality, despite the fact, that in terms of cost, it was only half that of New Zealand’s or Australia. 17 STRUCTURE OF NEW HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. A healthcare SOE Committee- (Similar to the 1980’s SOE Committees), Would be established, to make recommendations on how the government should go about putting these policy measures in place and getting competition and choice throughout the healthcare industry. A changed Health Department- The new health department role, would be largely limited to the provision of public goods in the healthcare sector. Public goods being those goods, which the private sector find it impossible to produce and market. (covid) Contribute to the regulatory issues process making. Result the new health department will be much smaller than the current one is. Government owned hospitals- Will be turned into separate operating units, with their own local directors (3-8), depending on their size, directors would be appointed by the Government, on the recommendation of a special committee set up for that purpose. Each hospital will publish a prospectus outlining the services it will offer, and the initial price it will charge for each service. A monitoring group will be set up, to consider and report on how well each hospital has meet its obligations and promises. Health Status Authority- A new health status authority, with around 12 billion dollars of income in their first year of operation will be set up. The main responsibility of this new body will be to look after the needs of the existing chronically ill and disabled New Zealanders. New Zealanders who at some time in the future become chronically ill will if they wish call on the health status authority. Individual New Zealanders and their GP. (Will be at the centre of the new healthcare system) An individual’s local doctor will become not only a person’s GP, but their general health advisor as well. When their client needs help from a specialist or any other health matter. Individuals will make their own decisions in the healthcare market, with advice from their doctor and the new health status authority as, when and if required. 18 APPENDIX ONE HOW DID NEW ZEALAND GET INTO THE FINANCIAL & SOCIAL MESS IT FINDS ITSELF IN- Short Answer-Politicians - Politicians, who over the years, have lied to the public, about NZ’s financial position. They have for example, refused to include, large items of expenditure, they have incurred each year, in the government’s accounts. For example, the $40 Billion dollars of accrued retirement liabilities incurred this year. If a private sector company, failed to record an item of this nature in their books of account, their directors would end up in prison. Why not apply the same set of rules to politicians.? Long term answer- We started down the wrong path a long time ago, at least 50years ago. It started in 1976- when the National government repealed Labour’s 1974 NZ Superannuation Act, and replaced it with a Pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) system, we currently operate under. A Pyramid Scheme- see definition of PAYGO below). In 1976, as a country we shifted the cost of retirement onto future generations, in other words, our children. It is these liabilities, created by the (unfunded) PAYGO system we have, that is placing today’s unsustainable burden on to all of us. Hence the numbers in Treasury long run projections paper, and what will no doubt be in the Inland Revenue final paper as well. This problem was reinforced in 1994- When Bolger as Prime Minister, and leader of the National party and Moore as Labour party leader, entered into an accord on superannuation. This agreement made the economic crisis that is happening today inevitable, rather than probable. Why? Because we failed to set aside, the money required each year to pay for the liabilities we were incurring each year. A smart 10 year, given the basic facts facing New Zealand in 1994, could have worked out what was going to happen. On the other hand, the politicians of 1994, and since, have decided to simply ignore the problem, and pretend it did does not exist. PAYGO- A definition--As the system matures, it reaches the point where in relative terms to where it was when it started, the number of beneficiaries grows compared to the number of workers paying taxes. This inevitably leads to a growing gap between government expenditure and government revenue. As Thomas Sowell said and I quote him “There are few things more dishonourable than misleading the young”. New Zealand politicians, have been doing that in spads, deliberately so, for at least the past 35 year’s . New Zealand politicians, despite what has been happening over the last 30 years, have for their own selfish political reasons, continued to ignore the need to fund the contract they had entered into with the New Zealand taxpayer in 1994.Treasury, dominated by libertarians have done the same. 19 As Act’s leader in 1994 I was almost alone in pointing out to the public and the politicians of the day the crazy path they had set us out on. (Extract below.) EXREACT—From what I said, at Act’s launch of its social and economic policy in 1994. ” The question of money is particularly important at the moment. In the immediate future we are being threatened with the largest debt in our history= a debt that hasn’t reached the public’s consciousness in any serious way. It is a debt the state owes us, its citizens, for all our retirement pensions and healthcare in retirement. Essentially the deal is this. We’re paying taxes into the system to fulfil our half of the social contract between us and the government. We pay taxes and when we are sick the contract says the government will look after us. When we are old the state will look after us. We who pay tax have kept our part of the deal. But when we are sick, does the state pay.? There are 77,000 people on hospital waiting lists who would say “not really No”. When it comes to our retirement, are we going to get the care, the services, the support, that our parents knew in the post war days.? And the reason they say that is this. The amount owing to workers in New Zealand is so large- and there is so little backing for the debt- that no government, no matter how well the economy does on its present rate of growth can possibly pay for it. The figure including net public debt as of today is nearly 300 billion dollars. The largest single financial number in the country’s economy. Three times our gross national product. This is a number so large that no current political thinking can accommodate it. In Act we believe we can. We believe we have found a way to reorganise our superannuation and health arrangements painlessly so that a more generous pension can be paid to all New Zealanders now and into the future. But we need a circuit breaker to get us out of the dangerous spiral we’re in. And in doing this a number of wholly beneficial results would happen for all New Zealanders. - An education system that responds to the individual needs of students rather than have a one size fits all approach. - The elimination of waiting lists for another. - A solution to the issue of poverty in New Zealand. - A way of getting on top of New Zealand’s monumental debt. - The lowest rate of personal tax in the developed world. It’s a new way of thinking, a new way of looking at the relationship between the state and individuals, the state and families. It’s a way that will make all New Zealanders of whatever income bracket, racial origin or educational background—all of us better off. These ideas are essentially common sense. They will suit New Zealand very well. 20 Of cause, we can’t do it by ourselves, we can only do it together. And we believe that is something we all want to do, because suddenly we have a chance to return New Zealand to the sense of wealth we knew in our glory days, when we had the third highest standard of living in the world”.(end quote) Act for its part walked away from its 1994 welfare policies in 2000, it decided to join all the other NZ political parties in their support of the pay as you go pyramid welfare system. For me, this was a major disappointment, I had spent the whole of my political life of 20 years, trying to achieve the goal of having a super scheme for every working New Zealander. Had Act stuck to its guns and not listened to the libertarians among them, and rolled over so easily as a result, New Zealand may well have been, in a better financial position today than it is. OTHER EXAMPLES, OF HOW POLITICIANS WHO PUT THEMSELVES AHEAD OF THE COUNTRY, HAVE MADE THINGS WORSE IN THEIR SEARCH FOR VOTES- Politicians from both the left and right fall into this category, From the left, The most basic fact about the political left, is that their ideas rarely if ever work, (look for yourself on a world-wide basis). Despite this, if you don’t agree with what the left is saying, you are immediately accused of being someone who does not care about the general public, who the left claim to represent, but never do it very well in practice. Although the big word of the NEW ZEALAND’S left- (Labour, Greens. NZ Maori, Parties), is the word compassion, their big agenda, however, is to make as many voters as possible dependent upon them, WHY? so that they will have to vote for them at the next election. A prime example of this, was the left’s refusal, to implement the reductions in personal income tax, due to come into effect in the 2017-2018 financial year. They preferred to keep the tax money in their hands, (billions of dollars of it) to spend in a way that made as many New Zealanders, as possible dependent on them. The left believed this approach, would, in the end win them the most votes at the next election. A lot more votes than simply letting the planned tax reductions go ahead. Another example of this, was the decision of Clark and Cullen to have a centralised superannuation fund, which they could control, rather than individual saving accounts for New Zealanders. How do I know this, because that is what Cullen told the Act caucus when he went there to explain his super fund policy. In answer to a question of mine, as to why he was going to have a centralised fund rather than individual accounts he said that was the policy they liked and intended to implement. He said they did not favour the individual saving approach I had advocated for 30 years. Why? labour wanted to control the money, 21 they simply did not trust the people they claimed to represent to do so. My understanding, having asked labour caucus members of that time about it, they told me it was Peters who got Clark and Cullen to introduce individual accounts as part of his negotiations with them. Another example of the left’s approach, has been the deliberate introduction, of the biggest and nasties tax of all, on the poor. These nasty taxes, (often 100% of any increase in income) come about when lower income earners, lose some of their welfare benefits (For example housing, or working for families) when their income goes up. The left, love these policies they sound great and caring, they win votes while locking people into dependency on them. In these circumstances, it is little wonder, that the left’s main area of support in New Zealand, tends to come from people who work for institutions whose ideas do not have to work in order for them to survive. (Government, Universities, Schools) From the right, Libertarians (some) have exercised a lot of policy influence (most of it good) amongst the NZ centre right over the past 35years. They also have a lot to answer for in one or two areas, as well. For example, they have played a major part in the creation, of the financial mess New Zealand has ended up in today. For example, the unfunded welfare liabilities we have in New Zealand today, of at least 1.2 trillion dollars. (1,200 billion dollars) is in large part a result of their influence. A bright lot, but also a group, who have their own form of religion, if I can call it that. At times, it seems to me that they never stop and think, beyond what their religion is telling them, (Libertarianism) They never seem to consider what long-term damage they might be doing. They believe they know what is right, that is they know what fits in with their libertarian policy approach. Any adverse impact it might have on ordinary New Zealanders, does not seem to have any relevance for them what so ever. Why, they have opposed individual New Zealanders having their own saving accounts so strongly has always worried me. They have never explained why they prefer compulsory taxes to compulsory savings. (Because that is what they did in the 1990’s and it is what, they still do today). Why, they prefer, governments, to control retirement income and health provision, rather than have individual control and private provision, is beyond me. I still do not understand why they think the way they do. Another example of why dogma/ religion in politics, can be so dangerous, in some policy areas.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the scoping document. We broadly support the selected topic for the LTIB. Long-term fiscal sustainability is an important issue that needs due consideration. We wish to make a few brief suggestions for the LTIB’s scope and these are set out below: 1. Broader purpose of the LTIB needs to be front of mind 1.1. In our view, one of the benefits to the LTIB process is to encourage an informed public discourse on matters which have a long-term focus and may therefore not be on the agenda of the government of the day. If the LTIB is to achieve this purpose, we believe it will not be enough for the document to merely summarise academic literature on the various reform options canvassed. If that is all the LTIB aims to do, we believe it will miss the mark. 1.2. New Zealanders need to be empowered to have a meaningful discussion beyond the relative merits and drawbacks of the individual proposals; the LTIB needs to capture the trade-offs inherent in choosing one option over another, or implications of using a mix of solutions. Likely behavioural impacts also need to be addressed. 1.3. While we appreciate that the scope of the LTIB does not necessarily allow for a full canvassing of the design features of each proposal, we encourage Officials to nevertheless provide meaningful commentary on the likely design options available to government. The reader should be broadly informed about the potential implications from a government adopting any one of, or a mix of, the available solutions. Similarly, it would be helpful for the reader to become aware of the relevant frameworks used for analysis. 2. Discussion on taxation of capital income will likely attract the public’s eye 2.1. We note that there has been considerable media coverage of the need for tax base expansion to tax more extensively capital income sources, in recent times. This includes comments from prominent business leaders. As such we expect that Officials’ analysis in the LTIB may be picked up by the media following the release of the draft LTIB next year. We would encourage Officials therefore to ensure that the discussion around potential expansion to the taxation of capital income, whether through the introduction of capital gains taxes (CGT), wealth taxes or inheritance levies, or otherwise is well set out. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 2 2.2. It would in our view, be insufficient for the LTIB to merely state the agreed academic views on the relative merits/drawbacks of a CGT or wealth or inheritance taxes, without discussing the implications of choosing one setting over another. We appreciate that Officials may not be in a position to detail out all of their preferences for a theoretical new tax regime, but we think the LTIB needs to at least point readers to the impact of particular design decisions and how different features may work in unison. 2.3. To illustrate the point, we note that much of the media coverage/public debate around CGT for example, has focussed on the concern over the under-taxation of residential investment property versus other forms of fully taxed income. That is a very narrow focus, and many CGT regimes do much more than tax realised gains on real property sales. The Australian model of CGT for example can have tax liabilities triggered upon the creation of a legal right, such as the creation of an option to buy property. Indeed, Division 104 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, lists around 60 actions that can trigger a CGT event, only one of which is the disposal of a CGT asset. The scope therefore is far broader, capturing transactions and embodying complexity far beyond just simple asset sales. The public may not be contemplating this when discussing the relative merits of CGT. 2.4. Equally how many readers are likely to appreciate the impact of rollover relief or exclusion of the family home, and the impact on sales of small businesses on the revenue efficiency of these capital income taxes. The point is that there are trade-offs inherent in all of these design choices, which will make significant differences to the effectiveness of any expansion to the capital income tax regime. This is particularly the case if the primary aim of inclusion of a CGT or wealth tax for example, is to raise revenue. 2.5. Overall given the fact that this issue does already hold a degree of public awareness, there needs to be a careful balancing of the extent of granularity in the discussion. In our view the degree to which the general public can understand the trade-offs that lie behind decisions to, for example, extend roll-over relief, exclude the family home, require valuation etc. should be a key focus for this LTIB. 2.6. We reiterate we are not looking for detailed decisions. Rather we consider that for the LTIB to be a successful public debate document it needs to take the public along – a sensibly well informed audience should be able to draw conclusions about the relative merits of making one policy choice over another within the relevant framework for analysis. 3. Public appreciation for frameworks that underpin New Zealand tax settings 3.1. Another benefit that the LTIB can bring to the broader public debate around tax settings is the opportunity to reaffirm the frameworks which underpin New Zealand’s tax settings. The decision to adhere to or depart from the frameworks which underpin current settings will ultimately shape future policy decisions and possibly take some options off the table. 3.2. For example, the imputation regime which is intended to ensure that, as far as possible, income earned through a company is taxed at the marginal tax rates of the shareholders of the company and can be contrasted with regimes which exempt dividends. This approach requires a degree of tolerance for the potential “deferral” of the marginal tax rate applying to income earned through a company, (i.e., on income that is not immediately distributed). That “deferral” is a consequence A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 3 of the imputation approach and should not be seen as an “avoidance” risk, absent other concerning or uncommercial features. 3.3. Another example is the desire to keep as many individual taxpayers as possible as ‘non-filing’. Continued adherence to this approach means that appropriate data collection and withholding of taxes needs to be reflected in the design of compliance rules in the context of future base expansions. 3.4. In our view, the LTIB needs to endeavour to educate the public/its readers on the existence of such frameworks; and more broadly on the consequences that these overarching policy settings have on the available options for future policy reform. 4. LTIB should refer to broader policy options to address fiscal sustainability concerns 4.1. The scoping document suggests Inland Revenue does not intend to consider options that would reduce the gap between projected future revenues and future fiscal demands, through reductions in spending. For example, reform of NZ Superannuation. 4.2. It is in our view, important for the LTIB to acknowledge that future governments may also choose to address fiscal sustainability concerns through spending reductions. While policy reforms that reduce government expenditure necessarily go beyond Inland Revenue’s domain, we think it is important for readers to be informed about such potential options. 4.3. The LTIB could for example reference related materials produced by the Treasury, such as the Long-Term Fiscal Statement. That approach would ensure that Inland Revenue’s work in the LTIB is not viewed in isolation of the work being done around potential spending reform. Reducing the risk that the public/readers conclude that only revenue raising options exist. 5. General comments in response to specific questions raised in call for submissions 5.1. We set out some general comments in relation to the specific questions raised at page 7 of the document below:  Local-government financing for infrastructure could add to the fiscal pressure - we believe this is another important aspect that needs to be considered in the environmental scan of upcoming potential issues. Specifically, New Zealand’s infrastructure deficit and the rating system for local government funding are such that it seems likely that future governments could be increasingly called upon to fund (in whole or in part) local infrastructure assets from centrally collected revenue. This could add pressure on ratepayers, in particular in remote areas with smaller populations, unless the rating system is itself reconsidered.  Current system responds well in times of economic growth and is insulated from economic downturns – the LTIB should test tax policy settings in the context of economic downturn as well as economic expansion. The current system settings tend to collect additional revenues when the economy is growing, as more GST and income tax is collected as money is spent/earned. At the same time the inability to cash out tax losses for example, insulates the revenue base against economic downturns.

Dear Chief Economist, Policy, IRD NZ The scope of the LTIB does seem to scope the key challenges but is too narrow in critique of the options as to how we might respond to these challenges. It is agreed revenue and distribution objectives, income and consumption tax, tax mix and current revenue needs are key elements, however the way we fund public services in the future needs to change if this country is to maintain high living standards and avoid bankruptcy. Consider the Singapore Central Provident Fund approach. If the IRD is serious about investigating countries that are successfully dealing with the dual problem of funding the escalating costs of retirement income and healthcare for an aging population, they need to look beyond the OECD to Singapore. Through their Central Provident Fund - which is now worth over $500 billion - Singapore provides amongst the world’s highest quality living standards for the elderly. Through a mandatory personal retirement savings scheme, funded by employees and employers, a generous pension annuity is paid on retirement as well universal health insurance cover is provided for life. Instead of funding a personal savings scheme from wages and employer contributions, a better system is for individuals to direct a portion of the tax they would normally pay to the Government into a personal retirement savings account that would take advantage of the compounding of interest to provide universal health insurance cover and a generous annuity in retirement – along with a range of other services including income protection, education funding, and home ownership assistance. It is feasible that with such a personal super savings scheme, not only could an 18-year-old retire at age 65 with $3 million dollars in their account, but New Zealand’s tax rates could be reduced to 12.5 percent - amongst the lowest in the world. s 9(2)(a) The way we fund public services in the future needs to change if this country is to allow and maintain high living standards. A paper showing this can be seen HERE - with innovative thinking New Zealand’s future funding crisis can be averted in a way that not only enables people to have more control over their lives but will lead to a far more prosperous and successful society. I am willing to discuss this if it needs further clarification. Sincerely for a better NZ and grateful to be a citizen. Stan Thompson s 9(2)(a) External Email CAUTION: Please take CARE when opening any links or attachments. Dear Mr Brown and Inland Revenue I am a small-time developer and property owner in Wellington. I notice the IRD has the long-term insights briefing process going on. It is clear that our country’s tax system is not keeping pace with what is required. Politicians are too scared to introduce capital gains tax and our infrastructure locally and nationally is not keeping pace with our ambitions. Following a trip to Australia where I was looking to buy a house with my daughter and son in law, all states in Australia have “stamp duty”. https://stampduty.calculatorsaustralia.com.au/ It is clear to me that we should bring in stamp duty in New Zealand for local councils to help with costs. Rates in Australia are relatively low but councils are receiving millions in stamp duties. By implementing this the “rich” would pay more, who arguably could afford it, while first homeowners pay less. I would propose the following scales as an initial tax for anyone purchasing a home. (Nothing on selling) 0 to $1,000,000 – 2 % Stamp duty on purchase price, but first homeowners are 1% $1,000,000 to $3,000,000 2% of purchase price $3 million and above a flat 3% If over $10 million could have 5%. Just to make the real rich pay more, and give the argument there is no capital gains tax! (Would keep a lot of the “not so rich” happier as well) This removes the capital gains “discussion”, and provides a good income stream for councils, where the “rich” pay more. These numbers are a lot less than Australia in the first instance and could grow over time. As an example, in Queensland stamp duty on a $2 million house is $88,000 on $3 million is $145,000 Based on the current stamp duties in Australia, no wonder their cities look much nicer than ours, they must have millions pouring in!

INTERPRETATION "Confidential Information" means information about IR, its business, operations, technologies, taxpayers, suppliers or affairs and includes the terms of each Order and any information highlighted by IR to the Supplier as confidential or that would reasonably be considered to be confidential to IR, but excluding information that is required by law to be disclosed. "Delivery" means, in the case of Goods, the delivery of the Goods in good order and condition to a location nominated by IR and in the case of Services means the provision of the Services to IR's satisfaction at a location nominated by IR and "Deliver" has a corresponding meaning. "Goods" means the goods specified in the Order and all parts or components of those goods to be supplied by the Supplier to IR. "GST" means goods and services tax at the rate prevailing from time to time, as contemplated by the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

"Order" means an IR purchase order which may be placed with the Supplier from time to time containing a reference to these Terms. "Purchase Order Number" means the number supplied to the Supplier at the time of the Order for that particular purchase and listed on the Order. "Services" means the services specified in the Order to be provided or performed by the Supplier. "Supplier" means the person, firm, company or corporate entity to whom IR issues an Order. “Terms” means these Purchase Order Terms and Conditions. “Working Day” means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in Wellington.

Whether The Minor Beneficiary Rule Exemption In Section HH 3B Applies On A $1,000 "Per Beneficiary" Or On A $1,000 "Per Beneficiary Per Trust" Basis.
=====================================================================================================================================================

QB 07/02 sets out the operational guidelines regarding the minor beneficiary rule exemption in s HH 3B of the Income Tax Act 2004.

We have been asked to clarify the correct application of section HH 3B of the Income Tax Act 2004 (the minor beneficiary rule exemption).

This QWBA sets out the operational guidelines regarding the minor beneficiary rule exemption.

(Please note: All legislative references in this QWBA refer to the Income Tax Act 2004).

#### Background

Section HH 3A(1) states:

> If a minor derives beneficiary income,-

1.  a trustee of the trust from which the beneficiary income is derived must pay income tax on the beneficiary income as if the beneficiary income were trustee income:
2.  despite section HH 3(1), the beneficiary income is excluded from being income of the minor.

Section HH 3B states:

> Section HH 3A does not apply if the amount of beneficiary income derived by a minor in relation to a tax year is $1,000 or less.

Section HH 3A(1) provides that if a minor derives beneficiary income from a trust the trustee must pay income tax on that beneficiary income as if it were trustee income. The beneficiary income is not income of the minor.

However, section HH 3B contains a _de minimis_ exemption to this rule. It provides that where the amount of beneficiary income derived by a minor in relation to an income year is $1,000 or less, the beneficiary income is taxed at the minor beneficiary's marginal tax rate and not at the trustee's tax rate.

The Commissioner is aware of the uncertainty over the application of section HH 3B. That is, it is unclear whether section HH 3B applies on a "per beneficiary" basis or a "per beneficiary per trust" basis.

The Commissioner has reviewed the statement regarding HH 3B in the _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) and past practices. The operational guidelines are clarified as follows.

**Discussion - correct application of section HH 3B**

The Commissioner considers that section HH 3B must be applied in the context of sections HH 3A and HH 3C which are formulated on a "per beneficiary per trust" basis. Accordingly, the reference to "beneficiary income" in section HH 3B can only mean the beneficiary income derived from a specific trust that would be treated as trustee income for that trust under section HH 3A.

The underlying purpose of section HH 3B also supports this interpretation. The purpose of section HH 3B is to provide an exemption to the general rule in section HH 3A. Therefore the exemption can only apply in respect of the beneficiary income derived from a particular trust to which section HH 3A applies.

Accordingly, section HH 3B should be interpreted as applying to each beneficiary for every trust from which they derive income. If a beneficiary receives beneficiary income from a number of trusts the $1,000 exemption in section HH 3B will apply to the income that is received from each trust. That is, the aggregate exemption can exceed $1,000.

Although there is no express limit on the number of trusts that can make distributions of $1,000 or less to the same minor beneficiary and benefit from the section HH 3B exemption a settlor must have a legitimate purpose in establishing multiple trusts. The Commissioner may consider the application of the general anti-avoidance rules if people establish multiple trusts to obtain a greater than $1,000 exemption.

Trustees in the context of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: does a separate trustee capacity and personal capacity exist and do separate trustee capacities exist for trustees of multiple trusts?
======================================================================================================================================================================================================

QB 07/03 discusses 'associated persons' and whether a person acting as a trustee of a trust is acting in a different capacity from that of personal capacity.

### Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GSTA"), section 2 - Definition of the term "trustee"

### Background and question

We have been asked to clarify Inland Revenue's position on whether, in the context of the "associated persons" definition in section 2A(1) of the GSTA, a person acting in their capacity as a trustee of a trust is acting in a different capacity from when they are acting in their personal capacity. A related question is whether a person who is a trustee of more than one trust is to be regarded as possessing a separate trustee capacity for each particular trust.

### The answer

For the purposes of the "associated persons" definition in section 2A(1) of the GSTA, a person acting in their capacity as trustee of a particular trust will be treated as acting in a different capacity from when they are acting in their personal capacity. A person who is a trustee of more than one trust is to be regarded as possessing a separate trustee capacity for each particular trust.

### Legislation

Section 2A of the GSTA defines "associated persons" and provides that:

(1) In this Act, associated persons or persons associated with each other are-

(a) two companies if a group of persons-

(i) has voting interests in each of those companies of 50% or more when added together; or

(ii) has market value interests in each of those companies of 50% or more when added together and a market value circumstance exists in respect of either company; or

(iii) has control of each of those companies by any other means whatsoever:

(b) a company and a person other than a company if the person has-

(i) a voting interest in the company of 25% or more; or

(ii) a market value interest in the company of 25% or more and a market value circumstance exists in respect of the company:

(bb) a person, or a branch or division of the person that is treated as a separate person under section 56B, and another branch or division of the person that is treated as a separate person under section 56B

(c) two persons who are-

(i) connected by blood relationship:

(ii) connected by marriage, civil union or de facto relationship:

(iii) connected by adoption:

(cb) a trustee of a trust and another person (person A), if-

(i) person A is associated with another person (the relative) under paragraph (c); and

(ii) the relative is associated with the trustee under paragraph (f):

(d) a partnership and a partner in the partnership:

(e) a partnership and a person if the person is associated with a partner in the partnership:

(f) a trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust, except if, in relation to a supply of goods and services-

(i) the trustee is a charitable or non-profit body with wholly or principally charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes; and

(ii) the supply is made in carrying out these purposes:

(g) a trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust, except if the trustee is a charitable or non-profit body with wholly or principally charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes:

(h) a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust if the same person is a settlor of both trusts:

(i) a person (person A) and another person (person B) if-

(i) person B is associated with a third person (person C) under any one of paragraphs (a) to (h); and

(ii) person C is associated with person A under any one of paragraphs (a) to (h).

The "trustee" definition in section 2 of the GSTA provides that:

**"Trustee"** includes an executor and administrator; and includes Public Trust and the Maori Trustee.

The definition of "trustee" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 ("ITA 2004") provides that:

"trustee",-

(a) for a trust,-

(i) means the trustee only in the capacity of trustee of the trust; and

(ii) includes all trustees, for the time being, of the trust:

(b) includes an executor and administrator:

(c) includes Public Trust:

(d) includes the Maori Trustee:

(e) for a superannuation scheme that is a trust or that is treated by this Act as a trust, includes a person by whom the investments of the scheme (or a part of the scheme) are managed or controlled:

(f) for a unit trust, means the trustee in which is vested the money, investments, and other property that are for the time being subject to the trusts governing the unit trust:

(g) is defined in section DC 14 (Some definitions) for the purposes of sections DC 11 to DC 13 (which relate to share purchase schemes).

#### Analysis

The definition of "trustee" in the GSTA is an inclusive definition as it states that "trustee" _includes_ an executor and administrator; and also _includes_ Public Trust and the Maori Trustee. It therefore does not exhaustively list what is included in the "trustee" definition. By using an inclusive definition, Parliament must have intended to also rely on the common law meaning of "trustee".

Case law recognises that a person acting in their capacity as a trustee of a trust is acting in a different capacity from when they are acting in their personal capacity (_Case K68_ (1988) 10 NZTC 544; _Case L72_ (1989) 11 NZTC 1,419; _Gasparini v Gasparini_ (1978) 87 DLR (3d) 282; 20 OR (2d) 113). Case law also recognises that a person's capacity as a trustee of a particular trust is separate from their capacity as a trustee of any other trust (_Fraser v Murdoch_ (1880-81) LR 6 App Cas 855; _Commissioner of Taxes v Trustees of Joseph (deceased)_ (1908) 2 NZLR 1085; 10 GLR 556; _Case 98_ (1951) 1 CTBR (NS) 423).

The definitions of "trustee" in the GSTA and the ITA 2004 differ in that the ITA 2004 definition specifically states that a reference to a "trustee" of a trust in the ITA 2004 means "the trustee only in the capacity as trustee of the trust". The GSTA is silent on this point. Prior to 1988, the GSTA and the Income Tax Act 1976 ("ITA 1976") had the same "trustee" definition. The current GSTA "trustee" definition is the definition that the two Acts originally shared.

The ITA 1976 definition of "trustee" was amended by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 with application from 1 April 1988 to explicitly clarify that a reference in the ITA 1976 to a "trustee" of a trust meant that trustee only in their capacity as trustee of that trust. That approach is retained in the ITA 2004. The GSTA definition is different in that it does not contain an explicit reference to a separation between a person's capacity as trustee of a trust and their personal capacity. Therefore an issue arises as to whether the absence of this specific reference means that the separation between a person in their capacity as trustee of a trust and their personal capacity is recognised in the GSTA.

It is considered that the amendment was made to the ITA definition of "trustee" as a clarification exercise only. Although the GSTA definition of "trustee" was not amended to keep in step with the ITA definition, as noted above, it is considered that the inclusive nature of the GSTA definition means that the general principles relating to the status of trustees and their separate trustee and personal capacities are incorporated into the GSTA "trustee" definition.

#### Example

A is a trustee of a trust. A's wife (C) is a shareholder of a company, (B), and has a voting interest in the company of 25%. C is also a beneficiary of the trust. The trust sells property to the company. When determining the time of supply of the property under section 9(2)(a), a factor to consider is whether or not the parties are associated with each other. The question is whether the trust and the company are associated. To determine association, it is necessary to consider section 2A(1) which states:

2A(1) In this Act, associated persons or persons associated with each other are-

(a) two companies if a group of persons-

(i) has voting interests in each of those companies of 50% or more when added together; or

(ii) has market value interests in each of those companies of 50% or more when added together and a market value circumstance exists in respect of either company; or

(iii) has control of each of those companies by any other means whatsoever:

(b) a company and a person other than a company if the person has-

(i) a voting interest in the company of 25% or more; or

(ii) a market value interest in the company of 25% or more and a market value circumstance exists in respect of the company:

(bb) a person, or a branch or division of the person that is treated as a separate person under section 56B, and another branch or division of the person that is treated as a separate person under section 56B

(c) two persons who are-

(i) connected by blood relationship:

(ii) connected by marriage, civil union or de facto relationship:

(iii) connected by adoption:

(cb) a trustee of a trust and another person (person A), if-

(i) person A is associated with another person (the relative) under paragraph (c); and

(ii) the relative is associated with the trustee under paragraph (f):

(d) a partnership and a partner in the partnership:

(e) a partnership and a person if the person is associated with a partner in the partnership:

(f) a trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under the trust, except if, in relation to a supply of goods and services-

(i) the trustee is a charitable or non-profit body with wholly or principally charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes; and

(ii) the supply is made in carrying out these purposes:

(g) a trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust, except if the trustee is a charitable or non-profit body with wholly or principally charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes:

(h) a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust if the same person is a settlor of both trusts:

(i) a person (person A) and another person (person B) if-

(i) person B is associated with a third person (person C) under any one of paragraphs (a) to (h); and

(ii) person C is associated with person A under any one of paragraphs (a) to (h).

Section 2A(1)(i) is a test for association in a tripartite situation such as this, and provides that two people will be associated under section 2A(1)(i) if they are each associated with a third person under any one of paragraphs (a) to (h), being the remaining paragraphs of section 2A(1). The trust (represented by A, the trustee) and the company will be associated under section 2A(1)(i) if they are each associated with a third person under any one of the remaining paragraphs of section 2A(1).

A's wife (C) holds a voting interest of 25% in the company (B). This means that C and B are associated by virtue of section 2A(1)(b)(i).

The issue to then be determined is whether A and A's wife (C) are associated. If they too are associated under any of the paragraphs (a) to (h) of section 2A(1), then the company and the trust will be associated persons.

Because A is a trustee of the trust, he is regarded as having two capacities, a trustee capacity and a separate personal capacity. In this case the transaction involves trust property being sold to the company, with A acting in his trustee capacity. Because A is viewed only in his capacity as trustee of a trust, there is no association between A and A's wife (C) under section 2A(1)(c)(ii), which associates two people through marriage. Consequently, the trust and the company cannot be associated through A's marriage to C. However, as C is a beneficiary of the trust, and is, therefore, associated with A under section 2A(1)(f), the trust and the company are associated.

Furthermore, in this scenario, it is worth noting that section 2A(4) results in A being treated as holding a 25% interest in company B.

Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry that are to be mounted in New Zealand - zero-rating (WITHDRAWN)
==================================================================================================================================================

QB 07/04 clarifies the zero-rating rules applied to trophies/animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry and mounted in NZ.

This item has been withdrawn and replaced by [IS 20/02](/interpretation-statements/is-20-02)
, which will be published in the [Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 6 - July 2020](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-32---2020/tib-vol32-no6)

This item amends the Commissioner's policy statement "Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry: zero-rating under GST", _Tax Information Bulletin_ vol 9, no 6 (June 1997) to the extent that it relates to trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry that are to be mounted in New Zealand. This item is to be read with the policy statement "Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry: zero-rating under GST" _Tax Information Bulletin_ vol 15, no 7 (July 2003).

All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

### Question

We have been asked whether extensions exceeding 183 days may be granted under section 11(5)(b) with respect to trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry that are to be mounted in New Zealand.

### Answer

The 183-day extension period limit provided for in the 1997 TIB Item no longer applies with respect to trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry that are to be mounted in New Zealand. Consequently, extensions exceeding 183 days may be granted with respect to such trophies and animal products if section 11(5)(b) is satisfied in the particular case.

Industry practice indicates that generally a 12-month extension period, beginning on the day of the time of the supply, will be appropriate. However, when the information provided indicates that a 12-month extension period is not appropriate in the particular case, a shorter or longer extension period may be granted.

### Analysis

#### Background

1.  Taxidermists have stated that they are increasingly unable to mount trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry within sufficient time for the supplies of goods and services involved to qualify to be zero-rated. Taxidermists attribute this to an increased demand for mounting services resulting from growth in the tourist, hunting and safari industry, the small size of the New Zealand taxidermy industry, and the specialised and time-consuming nature of mounting.
2.  Under section 11(5)(b), the Commissioner may extend the 28-day period within which a supply of goods must be exported from New Zealand in order to qualify to be zero-rated. An extension may be granted where, due to the nature of the supply, it is not practicable for the supplier to export the goods, or a class of the goods, within 28 days beginning on the day of the time of supply.
3.  The Commissioner's practice has been to issue statements, published in the Tax Information Bulletin, governing the exercise of the discretion under section 11(5)(b) with respect to industries that require extensions to the 28-day statutory period. The Commissioner has issued statements in respect of two industries: the bloodstock industry and the tourist, hunting and safari industry. These statements recognise that the 28-day statutory period is not practicable for these industries. The statements apply on an industry-wide basis to specified supplies and set out the maximum extension period that may be granted in any particular case.
4.  In "Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry: zero-rating under GST", Tax Information Bulletin vol 9, no 6 (June 1997) (the 1997 TIB Item), the Commissioner's practice on the exercise of the discretion under section 11(5)(b) with respect to trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry is set out. The 1997 TIB Item states that applications for extensions, not exceeding 183 days, may be made with respect to certain supplies associated with trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry. The implication of this is that extensions exceeding 183 days may not be granted.
5.  The supplies covered by the 1997 TIB Item are specified to be the taxidermy service provided by the taxidermist, the packaging and shipping of the trophy and related animal products, and the trophy fee. The 1997 TIB Item states that the last two supplies are zero-rated provided their supply is in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act. It also states that the taxidermy service provided by the taxidermist is chargeable with GST at the standard rate.
6.  The 1997 TIB Item was amended by "Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry: zero-rating under GST" Tax Information Bulletin vol 15, no 7 (July 2003) (the 2003 TIB Item). The 2003 TIB Item concludes that, as a result of legislative changes, the 1997 TIB Item is no longer correct in stating that taxidermy services cannot be zero-rated. The 2003 TIB Item states that taxidermy services qualify to be zero-rated if section 11A (1)(m) is satisfied. It also emphasises that the 1997 TIB Item is limited to the factual scenario described in it and that other factual scenarios may have different tax consequences.

#### Legislation

7.  Section 11(1)(d) and (e) provides:  
      
    
    11\. Zero-rating of goods-
    
    (1) A supply of goods that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations:
    
    ...
    
    (d) subject to subsection (4), the supplier will enter the goods for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply, and will export the goods; or
    
    (e) subject to subsection (4), the goods will be deemed to be entered for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and will be exported by the supplier in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply; ...
    
8.  Section 11(4) and (5) provides:  
      
    
    (4) If subsection (1)(d) or (1)(e) applies and the goods are not exported by the supplier within 28 days beginning on the day of the time of supply or a longer period that the Commissioner has allowed under subsection (5), the supply of the goods must be charged with tax at the rate specified in section 8 despite subsection (1)(d) and (1)(e) but subject to subsection (1)(a), (1)(b) and subsection (5).
    
    (5) The Commissioner may extend the 28-day period before a supply of goods is charged with tax at the rate specified in section 8 if the Commissioner has determined, after the supplier has applied in writing, that-
    
    (a) circumstances beyond the control of the supplier and the recipient have prevented, or will prevent, the export of the goods within 28 days beginning on the day of the time of supply; or
    
    (b) due to the nature of the supply, it is not practicable for the supplier to export the goods, or a class of the goods, within 28 days beginning on the day of the time of supply.
    

#### Extension to time period

9.  The Commissioner is satisfied that, due to the nature of the supply, the 183-day extension period limit provided for in the 1997 TIB Item is insufficient with respect to trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry that are to be mounted in New Zealand.
10.  Having considered the industry practice, including the mounting process, the Commissioner considers that generally a 12-month extension period will be appropriate for trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry that are to be mounted in New Zealand. When the information provided indicates that a 12-month extension period is not appropriate in the particular case, a shorter or longer extension period may be granted.
11.  "Mounted" and "mounting" denote the taxidermy service whereby animal parts are removed, preserved, treated and attached to a form or mannequin for permanent display.
12.  The Commissioner therefore considers that the 183-day maximum extension period provided for in the 1997 TIB Item no longer applies with respect to trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry that are to be mounted in New Zealand. The 1997 TIB Item continues to apply with respect to trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry that are not to be mounted in New Zealand.
13.  Applications for extensions of the 28-day statutory period with respect to trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry that are to be mounted in New Zealand must be made in writing and sent with the necessary documentation to the supplier's local Inland Revenue office. An extension may be granted with respect to a good or class of goods.
14.  This item applies with respect to the supplies of goods and services specified in the 1997 TIB Item. In some cases, these goods and services are supplied to the tourist-hunter as part of a package, which may include the provision of other types of supplies such as accommodation, food, sightseeing and other activities. Zero-rating does not apply to these other types of supplies that are enjoyed and/or consumed in New Zealand.

Ability to rule where the Commissioner is auditing or investigating - whether the Commissioner has a discretion to rule or is prohibited
========================================================================================================================================

QB 07/05 considers whether the CIR has discretion or is prohibited from making a private ruling regarding a taxpayer who is being audited or investigated.

\[This item was issued by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel on 28 September 2007. It was previously released for public consultation as exposure draft QB0041\].

**Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"), section 91E(4)(g) - Private Rulings**

All legislative references in this item are to the TAA unless otherwise stated.

**The question**

We have been asked whether the Commissioner has a discretion to make a private ruling as to how the tax laws apply to a taxpayer and to an arrangement where that taxpayer is being audited or investigated, or whether the relevant provision is a mandatory prohibition.

**The answer**

Section 91E(4)(g) prohibits the Commissioner from making a private ruling where the Commissioner is auditing or investigating. The Commissioner does not have a discretion in such circumstances.

#### Background

Under section 91E(1), the Commissioner must make a private ruling on how a taxation law applies, or would apply, to a person and to the arrangement for which a ruling is sought. An arrangement that is the subject of a private ruling application may also be the subject of an audit or investigation by Inland Revenue at the same time. This would result in two different parts of Inland Revenue concurrently considering the same arrangement. In such situations, section 91E(4)(g) provides that the Commissioner "may not" make a private ruling as to how a taxation law applies to the person and to the arrangement.

#### Legislation

Section 91E(1) provides:

91E(1) Subject to section 91EF, the Commissioner must make a private ruling on how a taxation law applies, or would apply, to a person and to the arrangement, whether a single or a recurring arrangement, for which the ruling is sought.

Section 91E(4) provides:

91E(4) The Commissioner may not make a private ruling if -

....  
(g) The Commissioner is auditing or investigating how the taxation law applies to the person and to the arrangement for a period or a tax year to which the proposed ruling would apply; or  
...

#### Whether the Commissioner has a discretion to rule

Section 91E(4)(g) states that the Commissioner may not rule if there is an audit or investigation as to how the taxation law applies to the person and to the arrangement for a period or a tax year to which the proposed ruling would apply.

We have been asked whether the use of the words "may not" in section 91E means that the Commissioner has a discretion to rule in the circumstances outlined in the section, or whether it prohibits the Commissioner from ruling.

The _Concise Oxford English Dictionary_ (11th ed, 2004) defines "may" as:

**1** expressing possibility **2** expressing permission **3** expressing a wish or hope.

Thesame dictionary defines "not" as:

_adv._ Used chiefly with an auxiliary verb or 'be' to form the negative.

The dictionary definition indicates that the term "may" can express either a possibility, permission, or a wish. Which meaning is appropriate depends on the context in which the word is used. It seems unlikely in the context of a statute governing tax administration that either of meanings 1 or 3 were intended. Particularly because section 91E(4)(g) follows section 91E(1), which imposes a requirement to rule, the use of the word "may" suggests "expressing permission" is the intended meaning. "Not", expressing the negative following an auxiliary verb, would appear to suggest that "may not" means no permission or a prohibition.

For reasons set out below, the context in which the term "may not" is used within the TAA and within section 91E itself supports interpreting "may not" as a mandatory prohibition rather than a discretion.

The context of section 91E(4) within section 91E indicates that the Commissioner has no discretion to rule where any of the circumstances within the subsection apply.

Section 91E(1) places an obligation on the Commissioner to make binding rulings; subsections (3) and (4) provide exceptions to this obligation. Section 91E(3) states that the "Commissioner may decline" to rule in certain circumstances. The use of the words "may decline" appears to give the Commissioner a discretion as to whether or not to rule. The context of the phrase "may decline", used in section 91E(3), indicates more clearly than section 91E(4) that the Commissioner is being empowered with a discretion by the Act. It is arguable that if Parliament had intended that the Commissioner was to have a similar discretion under section 91E(4) then the same words would have been used.

Some of the exceptions set out in both subsections (3) and (4) require an exercise of the Commissioner's judgement to determine if the subsection applies, while others have no such element explicit in their application. However, whereas subsection (3) states "the Commissioner may decline to make a private ruling", subsection (4) states "the Commissioner may not make a private ruling". The only rational grounds for a distinction between the wording chosen in subsections (3) and (4) is that those in subsection (3) were meant to be discretionary, while those in subsection (4) are obligatory. It is considered then that if the circumstances fall within subsection (4) the Commissioner cannot make a ruling.

The view that Parliament intended "may not" to denote a denial of permission, as in "cannot", in section 91E(4)(g) is further illustrated by amendments made to the regime, such as the enactment of section 91E(4)(ga). The disputes resolution process came into force on 1 October 1996, 18 months after the binding rulings regime on 1 April 1995. It therefore became necessary to insert paragraph (ga) into the TAA to accommodate the disputes resolution process. To this extent, it is stated in the commentary on the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Bill 1998:

The policy intent behind the binding rulings legislation is that it should not overlap with existing dispute resolution procedures. Section 91E (4) will be amended to clarify that a binding ruling **cannot** be sought on an arrangement that is within the scope of a NOPA. \[Emphasis added\]

That this later amendment was inserted to ensure the binding rulings regime could not interfere with the dispute resolution process indicates that the Commissioner is not meant to have a discretion to rule where the situations in section 91E(4) arise. It suggests that the drafters considered "may not" equates to "cannot" in section 91E(4), because the circumstance outlined in paragraph (ga) is clearly one where the Commissioner is not meant to have a discretion to rule.

In other provisions of the TAA "may not" indicates cannot. For example, section 89B(4) provides:

The Commissioner **may not** issue a notice of proposed adjustment -

(a) If the proposed adjustment is already the subject of a challenge; or  
(b) **After the expiry of the time bar** that, under -

(i) Sections 108 and 108B; or  
(ii) Sections 108A and 108B, -

applies to the assessment. \[Emphasis added\]

Section 108(1), in turn, provides:

Except as specified in this section or in section 108B, if -

(a) A taxpayer furnishes an income tax return and an assessment has been made; and  
(b) **4 years have passed** from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the tax return, -

the Commissioner **may not** amend the assessment so as to increase the amount assessed. \[Emphasis added\]

The associated provision relating to GST, section 108A(1) provides:

Subject to this section and section 108B, if a taxpayer provides a GST tax return for a GST return period and an assessment has been made, the Commissioner **may not** amend the assessment to increase the amount assessed if 4 years have passed from the end of the GST return period in which the tax return was provided. \[Emphasis added\]

In _Simunovich Fisheries Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue & Anor_ (2001) 20 NZTC 17,065 Priestley J noted that section 108A(1) prohibits the Commissioner from issuing further assessments beyond a stipulated period. At page 17,083 he states:

\[90\] The four-year time limit contained in s 108A(1) must be seen in the context of that provision and the statutory regime generally. **The legislative policy is to stipulate a period beyond which the Commissioner cannot issue further assessments** which have the effect of increasing the amount of tax payable. ...

  

\[91\] In examining analogous provisions, Tipping J in _Dandelion Investments Limited v C of IR_ (2000) 19 NZTC 15,585 at p 15,588, adopting perhaps the perspective of the taxpayer, saw the policy this way:

Clearly Parliament intended that after four years the Commissioner could not issue any further assessments increasing the amount of tax beyond the amount of the last valid assessment made within the four years.

\[Emphasis added\]

Sections 89B(4), 108(1) and 108A(1) use "may not" in a context where the Commissioner is not permitted to either issue a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") or raise an assessment.

This indicates that the term "may not" also prohibits the Commissioner from ruling in section 91E(4).

In summary, interpreting the term "may not" as imposing a prohibition on the Commissioner ruling is consistent with how the phrase is used in other sections of the TAA, namely sections 89, 108 and 108A where it is also used as a prohibition.The context of section 91E(4) within section 91E also indicates that the Commissioner has no discretion to rule where any of the circumstances within the subsection apply. The Commissioner not having the discretion to rule in such circumstances ensures that private rulings do not overlap or interfere with other procedures within Inland Revenue.

Therefore, the words used in section 91E(4)(g) and the context indicate that the Commissioner is prohibited from ruling, where an arrangement is subject to an audit or investigation.

In addition, it is considered that section 91E(4)(g) can apply any time up to the Commissioner making a ruling, even if the taxpayer's ruling application was submitted before the audit commenced. However, it is noted that section 91E(4)(g) applies where "the Commissioner **is** auditing or investigating". Therefore, it only applies if an arrangement is currently being audited or investigated.

Tax Administration Act 1994 - Section 91E(4)(f) and self-assessment
===================================================================

QB 08/01 considers self-assessments where the taxpayer files a return before lodging a ruling application regarding a transaction and year covered by that return.

### Question

Section 91E(4)(f) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that the Commissioner may not make a private ruling if an assessment has been made relating to the person, the arrangement, and a period or an income year to which the proposed ruling would apply, before the ruling application has been received by the Commissioner. Under the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, with effect from 24 October 2001, and with application to the 2002/03 and subsequent income years, taxpayers are required to assess their own income tax liability. Where a taxpayer has filed a tax return that contains their assessment before lodging a binding ruling application regarding a transaction and year that is covered by the return, does section 91E(4)(f) apply to the taxpayer's self-assessment?

### Answer

When a taxpayer has made a self-assessment before a private ruling application has been received by the Inland Revenue Department section 91E(4)(f) applies.

#### Background

1.  Unless otherwise specified, all legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994.
2.  A taxpayer may apply for a private ruling that involves a transaction and year for which the taxpayer has already made a self-assessment. Section 91E(4)(f) states that the Commissioner may not make a private ruling if an assessment has been made relating to the person, the arrangement, and a period or an income year to which the proposed ruling would apply, before the ruling application has been received by the Commissioner. The rationale behind section 91E(4)(f) is that if a transaction has been the subject of an assessment, then any dispute over the correct tax treatment of that transaction should be resolved under the tax disputes resolution procedures (Inland Revenue Department, _Binding Rulings on Taxation: A Discussion Document on the Proposed Regime_, June 1994).

#### Analysis

**_Application of relevant statutory provisions_**

3.  Section 91E(4)(f) states:

(4)  The Commissioner may not make a private ruling if -  
...

6.  An assessment relating to the person, the arrangement, and a period or a tax year to which the proposed ruling would apply has been made, unless the application is received by the Commissioner before the date an assessment is made.

4.  Section 91E(4)(f), therefore, applies when an income tax return has been filed and an assessment has been made before the Commissioner has received the application for the ruling.
5.  Section 3, the interpretation section, defines "assessment" to include:

an assessment of tax made under a tax law by a taxpayer or by the Commissioner:

6.  A reference in the Act, therefore, to an "assessment" means an assessment made by the Commissioner or an assessment made by the taxpayer (ie, a self-assessment).
7.  Section 15B outlines a taxpayer's tax obligations. Section15B(aa) states:

A taxpayer must do the following:

(aa)  if required under a tax law, make an assessment:

8.  Part 3 of the Act refers to information, record-keeping and returns. Section 33 relates to annual returns of income from taxpayers. Section 33(2) states:

(2)  A return must contain a notice of the assessment required to be made under section 92.

9.  Sections 92 and 92B provide for self-assessment and are in Part 6 of the Act relating to assessments.  Sections 92(1) and (2) and 92B(1) and (2) (as amended by section 112 of the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004) state:

**92 Taxpayer assessment of income tax**

1.  A taxpayer who is required to furnish a return of income for a tax year must make an assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable for the tax year, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due.
2.  An assessment under this section is made on the date on which the taxpayer's return of income is received at an office of the Department.

**92B Taxpayer assessment of GST**

1.  A taxpayer who is required under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide a GST tax return for a GST return period must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable by the taxpayer for the return period.
2.  An assessment under this section is made on the date on which the taxpayer's GST tax return is received at an office of the Department.

10.  On the basis of the above provisions, it is considered that section 91E(4)(f) applies to both Commissioner-made assessments and taxpayer self-assessments.
11.  Section 91E(4)(f) applies if an assessment has been made before the ruling application has been received by the Commissioner. "Assessment" is defined as an assessment of tax made by a taxpayer or by the Commissioner. There is an obligation on a taxpayer under section 15B(aa) to make an assessment, if required to do so under a tax law. Sections 92 and 92B stipulate that a taxpayer must make an assessment. Section 92(2) states that an assessment is made on the date on which the income tax return is received at an office of the Inland Revenue Department. The income tax return contains the taxpayer's assessment. The same is true of GST.

**_Background policy of self-assessment legislation_**

12.  As noted above, self-assessment was brought into the legislation through the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 with effect from 24 October 2001, and with application to the 2002/03 and subsequent income years. The rationale behind the changes to the legislation was that, in practice, taxpayers self-assess their liability for tax as part of meeting their return filing obligations. Also, taxpayers are in the best position to assess their liabilities as they have the best information about their activities.
13.  This rationale was described in "Taxpayer self-assessment", _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001), on page 45:

**_Background_**  
Our tax administration practices are based on the idea that taxpayers have the best information about their own activities. As such, taxpayers are better placed than the Commissioner to assess their tax liabilities by making the appropriate calculations and furnishing their returns each year. Inland Revenue automatically processes these returns and issues notices of assessment generally reflecting the information on each return. This approach is supported by audit processes, which in some cases will mean that the Commissioner amends an assessment.  
Despite these practices, self-assessment has not, until now, been reflected in the tax legislation. Instead the tax legislation has been written as if it were the Commissioner who actually performed all assessment activities.  
...  
Legislating for self-assessment provides a more consistent framework for our tax laws by aligning the legislation with practice. In this way, taxpayer's obligations are now provided for more clearly and directly in our tax laws.

14.  The most significant change to the legislation was that section 92 was amended to require taxpayers to assess their taxable income and income tax liability. The _Tax Information Bulletin_ item stated, on page 47:

**_Detailed analysis_**  
_Requiring taxpayers to make assessments_  
...  
The most significant change is that former section 92 of the Tax Administration Act, which required the Commissioner to make all income tax assessments, has been replaced with a requirement for taxpayers to assess their taxable income and income tax liability.  
...  
_Definition of "assessment"_  
The definition of "assessment" has, for the purpose of the Income Tax Act and consequently the Tax Administration Act, been amended to reflect that either the taxpayer or the Commissioner may be performing the assessment function, depending on the context. The definition also includes all amendments to assessments; these can only be made by the Commissioner, although taxpayers can propose adjustments.

15.  It is also noted that there are provisions in the Act that are limited to Commissioner-made assessments. For example, sections 111(1) and 114 refer only to Commissioner-made assessments and state:

**111 Commissioner to give notice of assessment to taxpayer**

1.  As soon as conveniently may be after making an assessment the Commissioner shall cause notice of the assessment to be given to the taxpayer:

**Validity of assessments**

  

An assessment made by the Commissioner is not invalidated -

1.  through a failure to comply with a provision of this Act or another Inland Revenue Act; or
2.  because the assessment is made wholly or partially in compliance with -
    1.  a direction or recommendation made by an authorised officer on matters relating to the assessment:
    2.  a current policy or practice approved by the Commissioner that is applicable to matters relating to the assessment.

16.  These provisions can be contrasted with section 92(1), which is limited to a taxpayer self-assessment (quoted in paragraph 9).

**_Binding rulings and disputes resolution regimes_**

17.  Section 91E(4)(f) refers to an assessment having been made, and does not refer explicitly to either a Commissioner-made assessment or a taxpayer self-assessment. The definition of "assessment" in section 3 includes both Commissioner-made and taxpayer-made assessments.
18.  It is noted that when section 91E(4)(f) was introduced with the rest of the binding rulings regime in 1994, only the Commissioner could make an assessment. The power to self-assess was enacted in 2001. However, although this was the position in 1994, it is also noted that one of the general principles of interpretation is that "the law is always speaking". The Interpretation Act 1999 sets out several principles of interpretation, including section 6, which states:

**6   Enactments apply to circumstances as they arise**

  

An enactment applies to circumstances as they arise.

19.  Based on the analysis above, it is considered that section 91E(4)(f), therefore, applies to both types of assessment.
20.  The conclusion reached that section 91E(4)(f) is applicable to self-assessment is also consistent with the roles of the binding rulings regime and the disputes resolution process in facilitating taxpayer compliance.
21.  The rulings regime exists primarily for prospective transactions to enable taxpayers to obtain certainty, and thus comply with their tax obligations. When a taxpayer has already filed their return and made an assessment, the disputes resolution process is available to the taxpayer, should the Service Delivery Group disagree with the assessment. There was a clear legislative policy that the disputes resolution process would be available to ensure that disputes were resolved in these situations, and that the rulings regime would generally be available for situations that were contemplated or occurred before assessment.

**_Conclusion_**

22.  It is concluded that section 91E(4)(f) applies in the situation where a taxpayer has filed their income tax return or their GST tax return and made a self-assessment before the Inland Revenue Department has received the ruling application. This is because:
    *   the definition of "assessment" in the Act refers to Commissioner-made assessments or self-assessments, and this definition applies in respect of section 91E(4)(f);
    *   taxpayers make self-assessments under sections 92(1) and 92B(1), which state (under sections 92(2) and 92B(2)) that the date of assessment is the date the taxpayer's return is received at an office of the Department; and
    *   the applicability of section 91E(4)(f) to self-assessments is consistent with the clear policy intent to introduce self-assessment, and the legislative policies behind the binding rulings regime and the tax disputes resolution procedure.

Commissioner's power to issue a replacement ruling that operates retrospectively
================================================================================

QB 08/02 considers whether the CIR may withdraw a ruling and issue a replacement that operates retrospectively for all/some of the period of the withdrawn ruling.

### Tax Administration Act 1994, sections 91E(4)(e) and 91F(4)(e)

1.  All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated.

### Background

2.  A private or product ruling may be issued that is incorrect because it contains an error not previously detected. This may be a factual error contained in the description of the arrangement, an error in the reference to the taxation laws applied, or an error affecting another aspect of the ruling.

3.  Where the error is a minor or typographical error and its correction will not change the meaning of the ruling, section 91GI applies so the ruling may be corrected without being withdrawn and reissued. Where the error results in a materially different arrangement, the ruling will not apply as a result of sections 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a), and a new ruling may be reissued for the same period.

### Question

4.  A question has been asked whether the Commissioner may withdraw a ruling and issue a replacement ruling that operates retrospectively for all or some of the same period as the withdrawn ruling if the withdrawn ruling contains an error that cannot be dealt with under section 91GI, the error is not material, and the Commissioner and the taxpayer consider that the error does not affect the technical conclusion reached, but agree that the error should still be corrected.

### Answer

5.  In these circumstances, sections 91E(4)(e) and 91F(4)(e) do not prevent the Commissioner from withdrawing a private or product ruling issued under the Income Tax Act 2004 or the Income Tax Act 2007, and issuing an amended replacement ruling with application for some or all of the same period as the previous ruling (apart from the period that the Commissioner is not able to issue a replacement ruling under the Income Tax Act 2007 for a ruling issued under the Income Tax Act 2004).

### Analysis

6.  The issue is whether the Commissioner may withdraw a ruling that contains an error (as outlined above) and then issue a replacement ruling, or whether this is in breach of sections 91E(4)(e) and 91F(4)(e) when an arrangement has been entered into and the replacement ruling is expressed to apply before the withdrawal of the original ruling. As noted above, this issue does not arise in the case of:
    *   Errors that can be dealt with under section 91GI; or
    *   Material errors subject to section 91EB(2)(a) or section 91FB(2)(a).

7.  An example would be where a ruling is issued on 1 November 2005 with application from 1 November 2005 to 31 October 2007. On 1 December 2005, an error is discovered, and it is established that section 91GI cannot be applied, it does not result in a materially different arrangement, and the correction of the error will not affect the technical conclusions reached. The Commissioner and the taxpayer agree that the error should still be corrected; so on 6 December 2005, the Commissioner withdraws the original ruling, and then reissues the ruling on the following day with retrospective application from 1 November 2005 to 31 October 2007. The question is whether the Commissioner is precluded from issuing the replacement ruling, because in the period 1 November 2005 to 6 December 2005 the original ruling existed.

8.  Section 91E(4)(e) states that the Commissioner may not make a private ruling if:
    
    A private ruling already exists on how the relevant taxation law applies to the person and the arrangement, and the proposed ruling would apply to a period or an income year to which the existing ruling applies.
    

9.  Section 91F(4)(e) states that the Commissioner may not make a product ruling if:
    
    A product ruling already exists on how the taxation law applies to the arrangement, and the proposed ruling would apply to a period or income year to which the existing ruling applies.
    

10.  This issue arises because sections 91E(4)(e) and 91F(4)(e) prevent the Commissioner from issuing a ruling when a ruling "already exists" that "applies" in that particular instance. It is unclear, in cases where the original ruling is withdrawn, whether the replacement ruling (when operating retrospectively) would breach this restriction. This is because it could be argued that when the replacement ruling is retrospective, the original ruling is still in "existence" in respect of that period. This may prevent the replacement ruling from operating retrospectively.

**_Sections 91E(4)(e) and 91F(4)(e)_**

11.  Sections 91E(4)(e) and 91F(4)(e) act as a restriction on the powers of the Commissioner to issue a private or product ruling. Summarising these provisions, the Commissioner cannot rule if a private or product ruling "already exists" and the proposed ruling would "apply" to a period to which the "existing ruling" "applies". This difference in terminology suggests that Parliament intended to make a distinction between these terms. It is important to consider how these sections operate in light of this distinction. This terminology also indicates that it is important to note the point in time at which the Commissioner must have regard to the restriction. Under these provisions, the restriction on the Commissioner operates at the time of issuing the replacement ruling. This means that at that point in time, the Commissioner must consider whether a private or product ruling already exists, and whether the replacement ruling will apply to the same period as applies to the existing ruling.

12.  This is supported by the term "already exists" being coloured by "existing ruling". The term "existing ruling" is in the present tense and suggests that the ruling needs to be in existence at the point in time at which the replacement ruling is to be issued. As both the phrases "existing ruling" and "already exists" are in the present tense, this would indicate that it is only necessary to consider whether a ruling exists at the point in time the Commissioner is about to issue the replacement ruling, not whether it has existed previously.

**_Plain ordinary meaning of "exists" and "applies"_**

13.  The ordinary meanings of the terms "exist", "apply" and "withdraw" are consistent with this view.

14.  The definitions in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (11th ed.) and Shorter Oxford Dictionary (5th ed.) indicate that for something to "exist" it must have an objective reality or being. These dictionaries define "withdraw" as meaning to take something back or away. The relevant definitions also refer to discontinuing or rescinding something so it no longer has effect (e.g. retracting a statement or expression, or rescinding a judgment). On this basis it can be argued that the relevant meaning of a "withdrawn" ruling is one that has been "cancelled" so that it no longer exists. The term "apply" in a legal sense can have a very specific meaning. However, in the context of sections 91EI(3)(b) and 91FJ(4)(b), it means to be relevant or operative in relation to that thing.

15.  Applying the meanings of these terms when considering sections 91E(4)(e) and 91F(4)(e), the Commissioner cannot rule if a private or product ruling "has an objective reality or being" and the proposed replacement ruling would "be relevant or operative" in relation to a period to which the existing ruling applies. If the previous ruling has been withdrawn, then it will no longer "exist", meaning that it will not have "an objective reality" at the point that the Commissioner intends to issue a replacement ruling.

16.  The Commissioner acknowledges that under sections 91EI(3)(b) and 91FJ(4)(b) a withdrawn private or product ruling (respectively) continues to "apply" for the remainder of the period or income year specified in the ruling, if the arrangement was entered into before the date of withdrawal. However, in the Commissioner's view, the continuing application of the withdrawn ruling does not prohibit the Commissioner from issuing a replacement ruling because of the distinction between the terms "exist" and "apply" as discussed above.

**_Wider statutory context_**

17.  It is also notable that the original Rulings legislation included provisions dealing with the situation in which two or more private or product rulings applied to a person in relation to an arrangement (sections 91EA(2) and 91FA(2), now repealed). Under these sections, the taxpayer could choose which ruling the Commissioner would be required to apply. These subsections were repealed with application from 20 May 1999.

18.  The repeal of these sections was explained both in the _Commentary on the Bill_ and in a statement in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999), which stated that these provisions were unnecessary and were repealed on that basis, and that where conflicting rulings exist, the taxpayer has the choice of which ruling to apply. These comments indicate that it was still envisaged that it would be possible to have a situation in which two conflicting rulings apply. That it was envisaged that two rulings could apply further supports the view that it is possible for a replacement ruling to operate retrospectively so that there are two rulings applying at the same time.

**_Purpose of the Rulings regime_**

19.  The approach taken in this item is consistent with the purpose of the Binding Rulings regime, which is to provide certainty to taxpayers about the way the Commissioner will apply taxation laws and to help taxpayers meet their obligations under those laws. A ruling with an error in it may create uncertainty on the part of a taxpayer as to whether or not the ruling applies to their situation. In cases where section 91GI does not apply, the ability to withdraw the original ruling and then issue a replacement ruling that operates retrospectively provides a taxpayer with certainty about the correctness of the ruling.

**_Income Tax Act 2007_**

20.  A particular issue arises for rulings issued under the Income Tax Act 2004 that are saved under the Income Tax Act 2007. The Income Tax Act 2007 came into force on 1 April 2008 and first applies to income derived in the 2008-09 income year.

21.  Section ZA 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 saves private or product rulings issued under the Income Tax Act 2004, if the application for the ruling was made before the beginning of the 2008-09 income year on an arrangement that is entered into, or that an applicant seriously contemplates will be entered into, before the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007. Any ruling saved under section ZA 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 may be withdrawn and replaced if the saved ruling contains an error that cannot be dealt with under section 91GI of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the error is not material, and the Commissioner and the taxpayer consider that the error does not affect the technical conclusion reached, but agree that the error should still be corrected.

22.  However, after a taxpayer's 2008-09 income year begins, the Commissioner will not be able to issue a retrospective replacement ruling under the Income Tax Act 2007 for the same period as the ruling saved under section ZA 4. This is because the Commissioner will require a "fresh" application for the replacement ruling and this will be made after the beginning of the taxpayer's 2008-09 income year. Therefore, the Commissioner will be able to issue a replacement ruling under the Income Tax Act 2007 for a ruling issued under the Income Tax Act 2004 only with effect from, at earliest, the beginning of the taxpayer's 2008-09 income year.

### Conclusion

23.  Therefore, the Commissioner considers that sections 91E(4)(e) and 91F(4)(e) do not prevent the Commissioner from withdrawing a private or product ruling which contains an error of the type outlined above, and then issuing an amended replacement ruling that applies for some or all of the same period as the previous ruling (apart from the period that the Commissioner is not able to issue a replacement ruling under the Income Tax Act 2007 for a ruling issued under the Income Tax Act 2004 as outlined above). This is based on a consideration of the distinction between the terms "exist" and "apply", the timing requirement inherent in sections 91E(4)(e) and 91F(4)(e), and the wider context and purpose of the Rulings regime.

Application for a private ruling or product ruling on an issue dealt with in a mutual agreement made under a Double Tax Agreement - Tax Administration Act 1994, sections 91E(4)(D)(ii) and 91F(4)(D)
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================

QB 08/03 describes the procedure followed by the CIR where an application for a binding ruling is made for an issue involving a double tax agreement.

### Question

1.  We have been asked to clarify the process that the Commissioner will follow when an application for a private ruling or product ruling is sought in relation to a matter that has been dealt with in a mutual agreement between competent authorities under a Double Tax Agreement (DTA).

### Answer

2.  The Commissioner has no authority to give a ruling on the interpretation or application of a mutual agreement and the Commissioner will not give a ruling on an issue if the issue is within the scope of an existing mutual agreement.

### Background

3.  The Commissioner, or his authorised representative, is the New Zealand competent authority under New Zealand's DTAs. The competent authority of the other party to a DTA is a person who holds the equivalent position in the other Contracting State. (Each of the parties to a DTA is a Contracting State.)
4.  All New Zealand's DTAs contain a provision that is substantially the same as Article 25 of the OECD Model Double Tax Convention.
5.  Under Article 25(1) of the Model Double Tax Convention, people who consider that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States will result in taxation "not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention" may present their cases to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which they are a resident or, if the case comes under Article 24(1) (the non-discrimination article), to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which they are a national. The competent authority must endeavour (if the competent authority considers that the objection is justified and the competent authority is not able to arrive at a satisfactory solution) to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State: Article 25(2). Article 25(3) requires the competent authorities of the Contracting States to endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention: Article 25(3) first sentence. Article 25(3) also provides that the competent authorities may consult together "for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention": Article 25(3) second sentence.
6.  Article 25(4) provides that the competent authorities may communicate with each other directly, including through a joint commission consisting of themselves or their representatives, for the purpose of reaching an agreement in terms of Article 25.
7.  Agreements made under the procedures outlined in Article 25 are usually referred to as "mutual agreements".

### Discussion

8.  The Commissioner is authorised to make binding rulings on how a taxation law applies or would apply: sections 91D(1), 91E(1) and 91F(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). A mutual agreement is not a "taxation law" as defined in section 91B of the TAA, as it is not a provision in any of the statutes specified in section 91C(1) of the TAA. Therefore, the Commissioner does not have the power to make a binding ruling on the interpretation or application of a mutual agreement.
9.  Sections 91E(4)(d)(ii) and 91F(4)(d) of the TAA prevent the making of a private or product ruling in respect of a matter that is being dealt with, or in the Commissioner's opinion should be dealt with, by one or both competent authorities of the parties to a DTA. Therefore, in considering an application for a binding ruling, the Commissioner must determine whether an issue relating to the interpretation of a DTA is being dealt with or should be dealt with by the competent authority, rather than in a ruling. Sections 91E(4)(d)(ii) and 91F(4)(d) contemplate that in some circumstances the interpretation of a DTA should be dealt with by the competent authority.
10.  A matter "is being dealt with" by the competent authority where the taxpayer applying for the ruling has also presented a case for consideration by the competent authority under the mutual agreement procedure provisions in a DTA or where, at the time a binding ruling is sought, the competent authority is in the process of negotiating a more general mutual agreement on the matter. Consistent with the purpose underlying the legislation, if the application for a binding ruling relates to a matter that is within the scope of a mutual agreement already entered into by the Commissioner acting as the competent authority, it is considered that the matter should continue to be dealt with by the competent authority and not in the context of a binding ruling application.
11.  Therefore, the Commissioner will not give a binding ruling if a mutual agreement exists and the issue in respect of which a binding ruling is sought is within the scope of the mutual agreement.

Payments made in addition to financial redress under Treaty of Waitangi settlements - income tax treatment
==========================================================================================================

QB 09/01 considers the income tax treatment of payments made by the Crown in addition to financial and commercial redress under a Treaty of Waitangi settlement.

**Sections BD 3, CA 1(2), CC 3(1), CC 4(1) and EW 3-definitions of "interest" and "money lent"-financial arrangement-income under ordinary concepts-Income Tax Act 2007**

### Question

We have been asked whether an amount paid by the Crown in addition to Financial and Commercial Redress under a Treaty of Waitangi settlement, that is calculated on the agreed Financial and Commercial Redress (cash and commercial assets) and that is described in the Deed of Settlement as "interest", is income. This amount is referred to in this item as "settlement interest".

### Answer

Settlement interest is a capital receipt and not taxable.

#### Background

Settlements of claims in respect of historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi ("the Treaty") are generally conditional upon settlement legislation being passed, as legislation is necessary to ensure the finality of the settlement. This usually means that there will be a delay between agreement being reached as to the amount of the Financial and Commercial Redress (that is, cash and commercial assets) to be provided by the Crown, and payment of Financial and Commercial Redress being made to the claimants. In that event, a further payment, calculated on the amount of the agreed Financial and Commercial Redress for the period from the date on which the Deed of Settlement between the Crown and the claimants is signed to the date of payment of the Financial and Commercial Redress, may be paid by the Crown in addition to the agreed Financial and Commercial Redress. Some Deeds of Settlement have provided for the Crown to pay interest on the amount of the agreed Financial and Commercial Redress from the date of the Agreement in Principle until settlement. (An Agreement in Principle (which sets out the broad outline of the terms of settlement negotiated) is entered into before a Deed of Settlement. Following an Agreement in Principle, the details to be incorporated into the final Deed of Settlement are developed and agreed.) Interest on Financial and Commercial Redress is referred to in this item as "settlement interest".

Financial Redress under a Treaty settlement is a capital receipt: refer Interpretation Statement IS0043: "Income tax treatment of Treaty of Waitangi settlements" **Tax Information Bulletin** Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004). We have been asked whether settlement interest is income.

Unless otherwise stated, all legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Whether settlement interest is income under a financial arrangement

As discussed in IS0043, a Treaty settlement is not a financial arrangement.

Treaty settlements that are conditional upon the passing of settlement legislation do not involve a debt or debt instrument (which are specifically included in the definition of "financial arrangement") as the obligation of the Crown to make payment is conditional: **Case Q2** (1993) 15 NZTC 5,005. A Treaty settlement is not a financial arrangement within the definition in section EW 3(2) as the payment made by the Crown is not "in consideration for" a benefit received by the Crown. Treaty settlement payments are made to compensate the claimants for past economic losses suffered as a result of the Crown's breaches of the Treaty rather than in return for anything provided to the Crown under a Treaty settlement. Such payments are not made for undertakings or agreements given by the claimants under a Treaty settlement, which are given as part of the process by which settlement is effected.

Therefore, settlement interest is not income under section CC 3(1).

### Whether settlement interest is "interest" under the statutory definition

Settlement interest (as defined above) is not "interest" within the statutory definition, as it is not a payment "in respect of or in relation to money lent" by the claimants to the Crown: definitions of "interest" and "money lent" in section OB 1.

Money is not lent in any way by the claimants to the Crown under a Treaty settlement (paragraph (a) definition of "money lent"). As the claimants do not provide services, property or rights to property without requiring payment from the Crown, a Treaty settlement does not involve the giving of credit by the claimants (paragraph (b) of the definition of "money lent"). A Treaty settlement does not involve an arrangement or obligation under which money is lent or credit is given by the claimants (paragraph (c) of the definition of "money lent"). Paragraph (d) of the definition of "money lent" does not apply to a Treaty settlement as an amount is not paid to the Crown in consideration for the Crown agreeing to pay a greater amount.

Therefore, settlement interest is not income under section CC 4(1).

### Whether settlement interest is income under section CA 1(2)

In **CIR v Buis Burston** (2005) 22 NZTC 19,278 the High Court held that the statutory definition of "interest" applied for the purpose of section CA 1(2). The court considered that as the statutory definition was exhaustive and as the payment in question (interest paid under section 72 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992) was not interest within the statutory definition, the payment was not income under ordinary concepts on the basis that it was interest under the common law.

The effect of the conclusion in **Buis** that the statutory definition of "interest" is exhaustive is that amounts that would have been income under ordinary concepts (being interest under the common law) may not be income. This result appears to be inconsistent with the relationship between section CA 1(2) and specific provisions defining income. The role of section CA 1(2) is to supplement specific provisions of the Act defining income: see **Tillard v C of T** \[1938\] NZLR 795; **Louisson v C of T** \[1942\] NZLR 30; Discussion Document on **Rewriting the Income Tax Act 1994** (September 1997). This result is also inconsistent with the purpose of the statutory definition of "interest" which was amended in order to widen rather than narrow the meaning of "interest" for income tax purposes: **Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR** (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086.

However, in **Buis** the court went on to consider whether the payment in question was income under ordinary concepts on any other basis, and found in that case that it was not income.

In **Reid v CIR** (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 Richardson J set out three propositions on the meaning of income under ordinary concepts.

The first proposition was that income is something that comes in. This means that to be income, there must be either a payment in money, or a non-cash benefit, that is convertible into money; a saving in expenditure is not income: **Tennant v Smith** \[1892\] AC 150. Settlement interest is a payment of cash. Hence, it is "something that comes in".

The second proposition is that income imports the notion of periodicity, recurrence and regularity. Settlement interest is not paid periodically, recurrently or regularly. However, the periodicity, recurrence or regularity (or the absence of periodicity, recurrence or regularity) of payments is not determinative of itself as to whether the payment is income. It is necessary to consider the relationship between the payer and recipient and the purpose of the payment in order to decide whether the payment is income under ordinary concepts. The judgment of Richardson J in **Reid** makes this clear:

> The major determinant in many cases is the periodic nature of a payment (**FC of T v Dixon** (1952) 86 CLR 540; and **Asher v London Film Productions** \[1944\] 1 All ER 77). If it has that quality of regularity or recurrence then the payments become part of the receipts upon which the recipient may depend for his living expenses, just as in the case of a salary or wage earner, annuitant or welfare beneficiary. But that in itself is not enough and consideration must be given to the relationship between payer and payee and to the purpose of the payment, in order to determine the quality of the payment in the hands of the payee. (p. 5,183)

To similar effect, in **FC of T** v **Dixon** (1952) 86 CLR 540 Fullager J commented:

> It seems to me that the appellant's receipts... must be regarded as having the character of income. They were regular periodical payments - a matter which has been regarded in the cases as having some importance in determining whether particular receipts possess the character of income or capital in the hands of the recipient... **This consideration, while not unimportant, is not decisive. What is, to my mind, decisive is that the expressed object and the actual effect of the payments made was to make an addition to the earnings, the undoubted income of the respondent...** (p 567) \[emphasis added\]

In **FCT v Cooling**90 ATC 4472 Hill J said:

> While the recurrent nature of transactions will suggest that the profit derived from them will be income, **Myer** at p. 210 makes it clear that the fact that a transaction is a one-off transaction will not preclude the profit generated being characterised as income. Similarly, while periodicity is a factor which leads to the conclusion that the periodical receipts are income: **F.C. of T.** v. **Dixon** (1952) 86 C.L.R. 540, the fact that a payment was received as a lump sum or as a once and for all payment will not necessarily result in the payment being received on capital account. Periodicity or the lack of it is but a factor to be taken into account. (p 4480)

The third proposition is that whether a particular receipt is income depends on its quality in the hands of the recipient. This proposition means that it is necessary to determine the character of a receipt from the point of view of the recipient (and not the payer). In **McLaurin v FCT** (1961) 104 CLR 381 the High Court of Australia commented:

> ...in point of law it would plainly be unsound to allow a determination of the character of a receipt in the hands of the recipient to be affected by a consideration of the uncommunicated reasoning which led the payer to agree to pay it. (p. 391)

In determining the character of a payment, it is necessary to consider the relationship between the parties and the purpose of the payment: see **Reid**; **The Federal Coke Company Ltd v FCT** 77 ATC 4255; **Riches v Westminster Bank Ltd** \[1947\] AC 390. The label given to the payment does not determine the true character of the payment: see **Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR** (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271.

Whether compensation is income or capital depends on whether it is paid to compensate for a loss of a capital or revenue nature: see **Case V8** (2001) 20 NZTC 10,092. Compensation for the damage, destruction or loss of a capital asset is capital: **CIR v McKenzies NZ Ltd** (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233. However, compensation for the loss of the right to use a capital asset is income, being compensation for loss of profits: **London and Thames Haven Oil Ltd v Attwooll** \[1967\] 2 QB 772.

The manner in which compensation is calculated does not determine its character. An amount paid to compensate for a loss of a capital nature that is calculated by reference to interest remains an amount of capital: **Glenboig Union Fireclay Co Ltd v IR Commrs** (1922) 12 TC 427; **Simpson v Executors of Bonner Maurice as Executor of Edward Kay** (1949) 14 TC 580.

The principle underlying land compensation cases such as **Marshall v Commissioner of Taxes** \[1953\] NZLR 335, **Public Trustee v CIR** \[1960\] NZLR 365 **Federal Wharf Co Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation** 1 ATD 70 and **Haig v FCT** 94 ATC 5002 is that where a taxpayer has received "interest" by virtue of a statutory power in respect of a sum of money that they would have invested for income purposes, the "interest" is income under ordinary concepts because it compensates for the loss of use of a capital sum during a period in which it would otherwise have earned income. It represents the annual value or flow from that capital. In the **Federal Wharf Company** case Rich J said:

> In my opinion, the character of the interest payable under s. 26 is that of recompense for loss of the use of capital during a period of time in which it would earn income. It represents the annual value of capital. It is paid because the owner has been deprived of a capital asset which he had and has not received the fund which is to be substituted for the capital asset. The interest is the flow of that fund. In my opinion it is income. (p. -73)

In such circumstances, interest for the period before an award of compensation is made would be income under ordinary concepts.

In each case the purpose for which a payment described as "interest" was paid determines whether it is income. In the context of compensation for personal injury interest for the period from the date when the injury is suffered to the date of judgment (referred to in the judgment as "pre-judgment interest") is not regarded as compensation for loss of earnings as it is not paid in circumstances where the compensation would have been invested to derive income: **Whitaker v FCT** 98 ATC 4285. "Pre-judgment interest" in relation to compensation for personal injury does not relate to a foregone investment opportunity. It is an essential and integral element of compensation for the personal injury suffered by the taxpayer (being a payment "awarded for the period until the judgment takes effect which allows the plaintiff to be placed in or restored to the situation, as far as money can do, in which he or she would have been but for the defendant's negligence": **Haines v Bendall** (1991) 172 CLR 60). "Pre-judgment interest" is, therefore, a receipt of capital. However, interest for the period from judgment until payment (referred to in the judgment as "post-judgment interest") is income: **Whitaker v FCT**. "Post-judgment interest" is not paid to compensate the taxpayer for personal injury. The amount of compensation for personal injury was established by the judgment of the lower court in favour of the taxpayer. The court considered that "post-judgment interest" was paid because there was a delay between judgment being given, and payment being made.

The following principles can be drawn from the cases:

*   To be income, there must be a payment in money or a non-cash benefit that is convertible into money: **Tennant v Smith** \[1892\] AC 150.
*   Periodicity, recurrence and regularity may be a characteristic of income but periodicity, recurrence and regularity (or the absence of periodicity, recurrence or regularity) of payments is not determinative as to whether a payment is income: see **Reid v CIR** (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176; **FC of T v** **Dixon**(1952) 86 CLR 540; **FCT v Cooling** 90 ATC 4472.
*   The character of a receipt is to be determined from the point of view of the recipient (and not the payer): **McLaurin v FCT** (1961) 104 CLR 381.
*   In determining the character of a payment, it is necessary to consider the relationship between the payer and recipient and the purpose of the payment: see **Reid v CIR** (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176; **The Federal Coke Company Ltd v FCT** 77 ATC 4255. The label given to the payment does not determine the true character of the payment: **Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR** (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271.
*   Whether compensation is income or capital depends on whether it is paid to compensate for a loss of a capital or revenue nature: **Case V8** (2001) 2 NZTC 10,092. Compensation for the damage, destruction or loss of a capital asset is capital: **CIR v McKenzies NZ Ltd** (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233. However, compensation for loss of profits is income: **London and Thames Haven Oil Ltd v Attwooll** \[1967\] 2 QB 772.
*   The manner in which compensation is calculated does not determine its character: **Glenboig Union Fireclay Co Ltd v IR Commrs** (1922) 12 TC 427; **Simpson v Executors of Bonner Maurice as Executor of Edward Kay** (1949) 14 TC 580.
*   A payment made to compensate for the loss of the use of compensation, during a period in which the compensation would have been invested for income earning purposes, is income under ordinary concepts: **Federal Wharf Co Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation** 1 ATD 70.
*   In the context of compensation for personal injury, interest for the period from the date of injury until the date of judgment ("pre-judgment interest") is not regarded as compensation for lost earnings, as it is not paid in circumstances where the compensation would have been invested for income earning purposes. Pre-judgment interest does not relate to a forgone investment opportunity: **Whitaker v FCT** 98 ATC 4285.
*   If there is no right to compensation, there is also no right to compensation for the loss of the use of compensation. In **Whitaker** (interest for the period from the date of judgment to payment) "post-judgment interest" was treated as income because there was a judgment debt owing. In **Marshall** it was accepted that if the Compensation Court had the power to award interest, the amount awarded was interest income for tax purposes. The majority considered that the Compensation Court had such a power. Therefore, for interest paid in the context of compensation to be income, it must be established that the interest accrued in respect of a period during which the taxpayer had an entitlement to compensation.

#### Nature of settlement interest

If settlement interest is part of the Treaty redress, settlement interest would be a capital receipt for the reasons outlined in IS0048. Settlement interest is not part of the financial redress (as defined) under Deeds of Settlement. However, the description used in the deed does not conclusively determine the nature of settlement interest. In determining the character of a payment, the starting point is the document embodying the transaction. The nomenclature used by the parties does not necessarily determine the nature of a payment and it is appropriate to take into account the surrounding circumstances in order to determine the character of the payment: **Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR** (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271, 61,273-61,274. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the context in which Treaty settlements are made in order to determine whether settlement interest constitutes part of the Treaty redress.

Under the Treaty the Crown guaranteed to Maori "the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties which they may collectively or individually possess so long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession". The Crown has accepted that this obligation was breached in some instances and that land was acquired from Maori in ways that breached the principles of the Treaty. Most historical Treaty claims relate to land loss in circumstances involving a breach of the Crown's obligations under the Treaty. See **Healing the Past, Building a Future: A Guide to Treaty of Waitangi Claims and Negotiations with the Crown** 2nd ed (2002), Wellington: Office of Treaty Settlements ("the OTS publication").

The redress under a Treaty settlement includes the acknowledgement and apology made by the Crown for the wrongs done to the claimant and cultural redress (which is intended to meet the cultural interests of the claimants) as well as redress for economic losses.

The overall value of the redress and the form in which redress for economic losses is provided (cash or property) is a matter entirely for negotiation between the claimants and the Crown. The main factors taken into account in determining the overall redress quantum are the amount of land lost by the claimants, the seriousness of the Crown's breaches and the benchmarks set by previous settlements: the OTS publication p. 89.

The OTS publication notes that full compensation for all economic losses resulting from historical Treaty breaches is not possible given the difficulty of calculating the losses resulting from the Crown's Treaty breaches (due to the time that has elapsed, the complexity of identifying the effects of various causes on the present economic status of the claimant group and overlaps between many claimant groups) and the high burden that full compensation or the "damages" approach to redress would place on present and future generations of taxpayers (p. 89). The aim of financial and commercial redress is to "contribute to re-establishing an economic base as a platform for future development" (p. 87). The OTS publication says (p. 95):

> If settlement legislation is required to make a settlement complete, there may be a significant delay between signing the Deed of Settlement and the payment of cash or transfer of other assets. Depending on the expected length of the delay, the Crown and claimant groups may need to negotiate whether the Deed should provide for interest on the redress quantum from the date of the Deed to when it is actually paid. This will maintain the value of the settlement to the claimant group. **Interest is paid in a lump sum with the settlement quantum, but does not form part of the redress quantum. This is because it is a transaction cost rather than redress.** If the Crown agrees to pay interest, the rate of interest will depend on market conditions and, as with any interest receipt, tax may be payable. \[emphasis added\]

Once the overall value of the redress is agreed, negotiations are carried out in respect of the form in which redress is to be provided (cash or assets). Treaty settlements are intended to be full and final settlements of historical claims and the settlement of historical grievances is intended to put the relationship between the Crown and claimants on a new footing based on the principles of the Treaty: OTS publication p. 84. The Crown recognises that unless settlements are fair and remove the sense of grievance, they will not be durable: OTS publication p. 28.

The terms of the settlement between the claimants and the Crown are recorded in a formal Deed of Settlement that sets out the rights and obligations of the Crown and the claimants. Generally a Deed of Settlement and the settlement itself are conditional on the enactment of settlement legislation and the establishment of a governance entity to receive Financial and Commercial Redress. However, some provisions in a Deed of Settlement (such as the obligation to take steps to enable the conditions in the Deed of Settlement to be satisfied) are binding on execution of the Deed.

No rights arise under a Treaty settlement until settlement legislation is enacted. The enactment of settlement legislation is part of the process by which claimants become entitled to receive redress.

The Commissioner accepts that the true nature of settlement interest is that it is an economic or present value adjustment to maintain the value of the agreed redress. Settlement interest is an integral element in the calculation of compensation for a loss of a capital nature. The payment of settlement interest maintains the economic value of the agreed principal amount. Settlement interest is part of the price for securing settlement. Without such an adjustment to the principal amount to compensate for the delay in payment following settlement being reached between the parties, the claimants' grievances may not be completely addressed.

Therefore, the Commissioner considers that given these factors and the unique nature of the treaty settlement process, settlement interest is a capital receipt, being a further instalment of compensation for a capital loss.

Holiday houses - income tax treatment
=====================================

QB 09/02 considers the correct income tax treatment for when an individual owns a holiday house and rents it out from time to time.

All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Question

We have been asked about the correct income tax treatment when an individual owns a holiday house and rents it out from time to time.

### Answer

The following answer necessarily sets out general principles only. The facts of particular cases always need to be considered carefully, and it may be necessary to obtain advice from a tax advisor.

##### Rental income

Any rental income received is taxable under section CC1 and should be returned in the owner's tax return for the income year in which it is derived. This legislative provision taxes any rental income derived from the leasing or licensing of land (and land includes any house on that land), regardless of whether the activity amounts to a business or whether market rates are charged.

##### Deductibility of expenses

Whether any expenses incurred in owning the holiday house are deductible, depends on their connection with the income earned. Under section DA1, a person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss (including an amount of depreciation) to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is incurred in deriving their assessable income. However, a person is denied a deduction to the extent to which the expenditure is private in nature: section DA2(2). Deductions are also not available for costs that are capital in nature: section DA2(1).

In the case of a holiday house that is rented out for only some of the income year, the owner's ability to deduct expenses such as interest, insurance, depreciation, and rates depends on the specific circumstances of the case and whether the expenses have sufficient connection with the earning of rental income.

If the holiday house is rented to a tenant on an arm's length basis for a long term stay, then the owner is generally able to apportion those costs on a time basis. For example, if the holiday house is rented for six months of the year, then any interest charges that relate to that period and the depreciation costs, insurance, and rates that relate to that period are deductible.

If the holiday house is available for rent for only some parts of a year, the ability to deduct a proportion of those expenses depends on the degree of connection the expenses have with the earning of income (as compared with the private ownership of the holiday house).

If a holiday house is essentially available only to the owner and their family and friends, so it is available to rent to third parties on only a limited basis, then Inland Revenue will apply the following principles.

*   The owner is not entitled to claim a deduction for expenses incurred for the periods the holiday house is not rented.
*   If the holiday house is rented out on an arm's length basis, (unless there are particular circumstances that would suggest the holiday house is not being genuinely used as an income-earning asset), an owner can claim a proportion of the expenses incurred equal to the time that the holiday house was actually rented (unless the nature of the expenses are such that the taxpayer can show that a different basis of apportionment would be appropriate, for example, a power bill that relates to actual useage may be more appropriately spread over the days that the property was actually occupied). If one or more parts of the holiday house are not available to be used by the person renting the holiday house (for example, a room is used to store the owner's personal possessions and it is locked so only the owner can access it), then a deduction is available only for the proportion of the holiday house that is available for use by the person renting the holiday house.
*   In cases where a holiday house is used by friends or family who are not charged rent, but instead make a minor contribution towards the owner's expenses, this payment will generally not be rental income. Consequently, the owner will not be required to return the amount received, but nor will any deductions be allowed for the corresponding period. If a holiday house is rented for less than a full market rental, such as to family and friends, the Commissioner will accept a deduction for that period up to the amount of rent received for that period.

Evidence of a holiday house being available for rent generally needs to be more than a mere statement of its availability, sporadic or limited advertising, or advertising that is of a nature that is unlikely to attract many customers. Rather, there must be evidence of active and regular marketing of the holiday house at market rates and of the availability of the holiday house at times and for periods that demonstrate the holiday house is earning rental income or is genuinely available to earn rental income. Therefore, any expenditure incurred, which is potentially deductible, is not denied because it is private.

If a holiday house is available for only limited and/or undesirable periods and/or at non-competitive rates, such factors tend to indicate that the expenditure is not incurred in deriving assessable income.

In terms of meeting the statutory test, if the holiday house has mixed uses, the ability to deduct expenditure comes down to a case-by-case assessment that weighs all the evidence. Objective evidence is required that the holiday house is genuinely available for rent and that there is a real prospect of occupancy and rental income being earned. This needs to be considered separately in relation to each year (that is, just because a holiday house has been genuinely available for rent and sufficiently marketed and/or actually rented in one income year, does not mean a deduction will be automatically allowed in subsequent income years).

### Example 1

A holiday house in the Coromandel has earned significant rental income after active marketing at competitive rates in newspapers and on internet sites for almost all of the year. However, the owner's family uses the holiday house for two weeks over the Christmas/New Year period. Even though, in this case, the holiday house may not be actually rented out for every day of the remaining 50 weeks, provided it is available for rent during those 50 weeks, it is generally possible to deduct expenses for that period (ie, for 50 weeks out of the full year). Any expenses that are variable in nature (ie incurred when the property is occupied) should be spread on an appropriate basis.

### Example 2

A holiday house in Mount Maunganui is used by its owner and her friends and family for most of the year. However, the holiday house is rented out to a third party for two weeks over the Christmas/New Year period for $3,000. In this case, the owner may deduct expenses (eg, interest charges, depreciation costs, insurance, and rates) for the proportion of the year that the holiday house was actually rented out (ie, for two weeks out of 52 weeks). Any expenses that are variable in nature (ie incurred when the property is occupied) should be spread on an appropriate basis.

### Example 3

A holiday house in Queenstown is available to be rented for eight weeks a year when it is not being used by the owner. For four of those weeks it is rented to members of the public for its market rental of $600 per week. For the remaining four weeks it is rented out to a family friend The friend is charged "mates rates" of $350 per week. In this case, the Commissioner would accept the owner deducting expenses (eg, interest charges, depreciation costs, insurance, and rates) for the proportion of the year that the holiday house was rented to the friend (ie, for four weeks out of 52 weeks) up to a maximum of $1400 (the amount of rent received). Full deductibility would be allowed for the remaining four weeks that the property is rented out.

### Example 4

A holiday house in Papamoa is used by the owner for most of the year. A market rental for the property would be approximately $450 per week. The holiday house is made available for use by a family friend for three weeks during summer. The friend is not charged for staying at the property, but chooses to make a contribution of $200 to the owner towards the cost of power, water, etc for the three weeks. In this case, the amount received is not income of the owner and, consequently, does not need to be returned to Inland Revenue (nor would any tax return need to be filed - unless the owner otherwise had to file one). Similarly, no deductions are available to the owner.

### Item provides general guidance only

This item provides general guidance only. This item also does not consider any possible Goods and Service Tax consequences of renting out a holiday house. Individual circumstances are inevitably different. The Inland Revenue Department suggests that anyone considering purchasing a holiday house and intending to rent it, seeks advice from a tax advisor.

Decisions on application of CA 1(2) - common law interest and income under ordinary concepts
============================================================================================

QB 09/03 considers income under ordinary concepts as applied to 'common law interest' payments following the 2005 High Court decisions in CIR v Buis and Burston.

Replaced by [QB 22/01:Can a payment that compensates for the time value of money be taxable income if it is outside the statutory definition of “interest”?](/questions-we-ve-been-asked/2022/qb-22-01)

All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

### Question

We have been asked whether the Commissioner accepts, as a broader principle, all the reasoning in the High Court decisions _CIR v Buis and Burston_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,278 on the application of section CA 1(2) (income under ordinary concepts) to so-called "common law interest" payments. \[Common law interest payments are payments which might be described as akin to "interest" but are not connected with lending eg, late payment "interest" for settlement of a contract, "interest" awarded as part of a damages claim.\]

In _Buis_ and _Burston_ France J held that section CD 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (now section CA 1(2)) could not apply to tax common law interest payments, because interest could be taxed only under the provision dealing with interest so defined (section CE 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (now section CC 4(1)). In his Honour's view, common law interest payments were not taxable because they did not come within the definition of "interest" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (now section YA 1).

### Answer

While the Commissioner decided not to appeal the decisions in the _Buis_ and _Burston_ cases, he does not accept the correctness of **this aspect** of the decisions as a generally applicable principle. The Commissioner intends to have the matter considered further by the courts when an opportunity arises in the future.

### Explanation

_CIR v Buis and Burston_ concerned the taxation of payments received by the taxpayers under section 72 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 (interest paid in relation to the late payment of earnings related compensation). The Commissioner sought to tax those payments as income under ordinary concepts.

The Commissioner and the taxpayers accepted that the payments did not fall within the definition of "interest", which applies only to payments arising from "money lent" (also a defined term).

In the High Court, France J found that the payments were not income, being in the nature of a penalty imposed on the Accident Compensation Corporation. The Commissioner accepts this aspect of the decision.

However, his Honour also concluded that the payments could not be income under ordinary concepts in any event as the payments were in the nature of interest and interest could be taxed only under the provision dealing with interest as defined (section CE 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (now section CC 4(1)). In France J's opinion, section CD 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (now section CA 1(2)) must be read subject to section CE 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and could not be used to tax any interest payments that did not fall within the general interest provision.

The Commissioner does not agree with this aspect of the decision. Section YA 1 defines "interest" as being a payment made to a person by another person for money lent. The Income Tax Act did not originally define "interest". However, in 1983 a definition was inserted by section 3(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 4) 1983. This definition was inserted to ensure that certain money market transactions that were in the nature of loans, but that in law were not classed as money-lending, would be taxed: _Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR_ (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086. The definition was not a codification of the taxation of all forms of interest.

In many instances payments which might be described as akin to "interest" under common law or ordinary concepts are not connected with "money lent" - late payment "interest" for settlement of a contract being a common example. "Interest as damages" where the damages are a reflection of a loss of profits is another. In the Commissioner's view the inclusion of a definition of "interest" in respect of money lent was not intended by Parliament to have excluded from taxation amounts that are akin to interest and are income under ordinary concepts.

The Commissioner considers that the Act must be read in its entirety and section CC 4(1) must be read as applying to situations falling within the definition of "money lent"; leaving those transactions that do not fit within that definition to be governed under the general charge of income under ordinary concepts: section CA 1(2). In those cases, it would be necessary to consider the true nature of the payment in the hands of the recipient to determine whether it is income and therefore taxable: _IRC v Ballantine_ (1924) 8 TC 595 and _Riches v Westminster Bank Limited_ \[1947\] 1 All ER 469.

The relationship between section 113 of the TAA and the proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act
===============================================================================================

QB 09/04 clarifies the relationship between the Tax Administration and GST Acts when a registered person has not claimed an input tax deduction in an earlier period.

We have been asked to clarify the relationship between section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("section 113") and the proviso to section 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the proviso to section 20(3)") when a registered person ("taxpayer") has not claimed a goods and services tax ("GST") input tax deduction in an earlier taxable period.

In particular, we have been asked whether the Commissioner is required to amend a GST assessment under section 113 to allow a deduction in an earlier taxable period when, under the proviso to section 20(3), the taxpayer can claim a GST input tax deduction in a later taxable period.

We have also been asked to explain the effect of the two-year limitation period specified in paragraph (a) of the proviso to section 20(3).

While the Commissioner is not prevented from exercising the discretion under section 113, the Commissioner's practice is generally not to do so. This is because the proviso to section 20(3) provides a specific mechanism by which taxpayers can correct the failure to claim the input tax deduction themselves. It is the Commissioner's view that a general provision such as section 113 should not be used when a specific provision is available.

However, in certain circumstances the Commissioner will consider exercising the discretion under section 113 and amend the earlier GST assessment, notwithstanding that the taxpayer can alternatively claim a GST input tax deduction in a later period.

### Background

The proviso to section 20(3) allows a taxpayer to include a GST input tax deduction not claimed in an earlier return period in a later return period without having to issue a notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA") to the Commissioner.

The proviso to section 20(3) reads:  
...

*   Provided that a registered person who is entitled to deduct an amount from the output tax attributable to a taxable period may deduct that amount from the output tax attributable to a later taxable period if the amount has not previously been deducted from the output tax of the registered person and -  
      
    
    1.  the later tax period begins on or before the date that is the 2nd anniversary of the earlier of the following:
        1.  the date on which the registered person makes the payment for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates:
        2.  the date on which a tax invoice is issued for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates:
    
      
    2.  the failure of the registered person to make the deduction in the earlier taxable period arises from -
        1.  an inability of the registered person to obtain a tax invoice:
        2.  a dispute over the proper amount of the payment for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates:
        3.  a mistaken understanding on the part of the registered person that the supply to which the deduction relates was not a taxable supply:
        4.  a clear mistake or simple oversight of the registered person.

Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proviso to section 20(3) set out the criteria that apply if a registered person who has not claimed a GST input tax deduction in one taxable period seeks to claim the input tax deduction in a later taxable period. Paragraphs (a) and (b) are not cumulative requirements. They are separate criteria and they apply independently.

Under paragraph (a) a taxpayer has an unqualified two-year period within which a GST input tax deduction omitted from an earlier taxable period can be claimed in a later taxable period. Paragraph (a) sets out the mechanism for determining the two-year limitation period. That is, the period that ends on the second anniversary of the earlier of the payment date or date that the tax invoice was issued for the taxable supply to which the omitted input tax deductions relate.

Paragraph (b) prescribes four potential circumstances when a taxpayer could have failed to claim a GST input tax deduction in an earlier taxable period. If any of the circumstances specified in paragraph (b) apply, the taxpayer will have an unlimited time to claim the input tax deductions in a later taxable period.

The four circumstances specified in paragraph (b) apply independently. That is, the taxpayer does not have to prove that their failure to claim an input tax deduction in an earlier GST period arises because all the circumstances specified in paragraph (b) have occurred.

On the other hand, section 113 gives the Commissioner the discretion to amend an assessment to ensure its correctness when it contains an error.

Section 113 reads:

1.  Subject to sections 89N and 113D, the Commissioner may from time to time, and at any time, amend an assessment as the Commissioner thinks necessary in order to ensure its correctness, notwithstanding that tax already assessed may have been paid.
2.  If any such amendment has the effect of imposing any fresh liability or increasing any existing liability, notice of it shall be given by the Commissioner to the taxpayer affected.

### Discussion

We have been asked whether the proviso to section 20(3) takes precedence over section 113 when a taxpayer has not claimed a GST input tax deduction in an earlier taxable period.

Inland Revenue's practice for exercising the Commissioner's discretion to amend an assessment under section 113 is set out in _SPS 07/03:_ _Requests to amend assessments_.

_SPS 07/03_ states that:

*   The discretion to amend assessments under section 113 enables the Commissioner to act fairly towards all taxpayers including those who get their tax returns or assessments correct the first time and those who have made genuine errors. This also promotes integrity in the administration of the tax system.
*   It is important, however, to recognise that Inland Revenue does not have unlimited resources to undertake lengthy verification processes to determine whether assessments should be amended. When meeting the obligation to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law under section 6A(3), the Commissioner must consider:
    1.  the resources available to the Commissioner,
    2.  promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers, and
    3.  taxpayers' compliance costs.
*   Accordingly, it is consistent with the obligation under section 6A(3) for the Commissioner to limit the amount of time and other resources that will be spent investigating amendment requests. Therefore, at times not all requested amendments will necessarily be corrected. Ensuring a balance between time spent considering amendment requests and other activities is also consistent with the obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system under section 6(1).

Although the Commissioner is not prevented from exercising the discretion under section 113, if the taxpayer can alternatively claim a GST input tax deduction pursuant to the proviso of section 20(3), the Commissioner's practice is generally to not exercise the discretion under section 113.

This is because the proviso to section 20(3) provides a specific mechanism by which the taxpayer can correct the failure to claim the input tax deduction themselves. As such, it is not necessary for the taxpayer to request that the Commissioner amends the assessment under section 113 to claim the input tax deduction.

However, in certain circumstances the Commissioner will exercise the discretion under section 113 notwithstanding that the taxpayer can alternatively claim a GST input tax deduction in a later period. Examples of circumstances where the Commissioner will consider amending the GST assessment under section 113 include if:

*   the tax position taken by the taxpayer that input tax was not deductible in the earlier period was adopted on the basis of incorrect advice given by Inland Revenue; or
*   the Commissioner is already investigating the earlier period to which the GST input tax deduction relates.

Any request for an amendment to the original GST assessment made under section 113 must be considered in terms of Inland Revenue's practice for exercising the Commissioner's discretion to amend assessments under that section, as set out in _SPS 07/03: Requests to amend assessments_.

If a taxpayer is unable to claim the input tax deduction in a later period due to the elapse of the two year limitation period specified in paragraph (a) of the proviso to section 20(3) and paragraph (b) of the proviso does not apply, the Commissioner will consider a request to amend the original GST period under section 113. However, any such request must also comply with the requirements set out in _SPS 07/03:_ _Requests to amend assessments_.

### _SPS INV 490: Correcting minor errors in GST returns_

The question of correcting minor GST errors in subsequent GST returns was previously considered in _SPS INV 490:_ C_orrecting minor errors in GST returns_. _SPS INV 490_ has now been withdrawn. Taxpayers seeking to correct errors made in GST returns should now refer to this item and to _SPS 07/03:_ _Requests to amend assessments_.

Residential investment property or properties in Australia owned by New Zealand resident - NRWT treatment of interest paid to Australian financial institution
==============================================================================================================================================================

QB 09/05 considers Australian residential investment properties owned by NZ residents and the NRWT treatment of interest paid to Australian financial institutions.

**Income Tax Act 2007, sectionYD4(11)(b)(i) - Interest deemed to be derived from New Zealand**

**Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 1995, Schedule, Article 11 - Taxation of interest**

All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

### Background

The Commissioner has been asked to clarify Inland Revenue's position on whether New Zealand residents who borrow money from Australian financial institutions to purchase residential investment properties in Australia are liable for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on the interest payable. Articles have appeared in the media regarding this issue over recent years, and there has been uncertainty as to how the domestic legislation and the double tax agreement ("DTA") with Australia apply.

### Question

If you own one or more residential investment properties in Australia and you have borrowed money from an Australian financial institution to purchase the property or properties, do you have to pay NRWT on the interest paid to the Australian financial institution?

Different fact situations could arise in respect of this question. This item considers the two most common situations, where:

1.  you manage the property or properties yourself (situation A); and
2.  a property manager in Australia manages the property or properties for you (situation B).

### Answer

In every case, you will need to consider your own particular fact situation. However, in general terms the following applies.

1.  If the Australian financial institution to which you pay interest has a branch in New Zealand, in both situations A and B the NRWT rules **will not** apply to the interest because the financial institution has a fixed establishment in New Zealand.  
      
    It is important to note that some Australian financial institutions that operate in New Zealand do so through subsidiaries rather than through branches. The NRWT rules **will apply** if the Australian financial institution from which you borrowed money in Australia operates in New Zealand only through a subsidiary, i.e. it does not also have a branch in New Zealand. If you borrow from a New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian financial institution no NRWT issues will arise, however, because the interest is not paid to a non-resident. If you wish to check which financial institutions operate as branches in New Zealand go to the Reserve Bank website (www.rbnz.govt.nz/nzbanks).

2.  If the Australian financial institution to which you pay interest does not have a branch in New Zealand, the outcomes between situations A and B may differ.  
      
    **Situation A**  
      
    Under situation A, if you manage the property or properties in Australia from New Zealand, you **will** have to pay NRWT on the interest whether or not you are in the business of leasing, because you will not have a fixed establishment or a permanent establishment in Australia.  
      
    **Situation B**  
      
    Under situation B, if you have more than one residential investment property in Australia, you may have a fixed establishment in Australia. If you do have a fixed establishment in Australia, then you **will not** have to pay NRWT on the interest.  
      
    If you employ a property manager who:  
    
    *   works as a property manager only for you; and
    *   has and habitually exercises the authority to enter contracts on your behalf
    
      
    then you **will not** have to pay NRWT on the interest because the property manager will be a dependent agent and you will be deemed to have a permanent establishment in Australia. As you borrowed the funds to purchase the property or properties, there is sufficient connection between the permanent establishment and the indebtedness and the DTA will apply.  
      
    If the property manager acts for you in the ordinary course of their business and is able to act independently of you, it is likely the property manager will be an independent agent and you **will** have to pay NRWT on the interest because you will not have a permanent establishment in Australia.

The following flowchart sets out the questions that need to be answered to determine NRWT liability.

   |     

For further information on the payment of NRWT, see the two Inland Revenue guides _Non-resident withholding tax - payer's guide (IR291)_ and _Non-resident withholding tax reconciliation statement guide (IR67SG)_.

### Transitional residents

If you have become a New Zealand resident since 1 April 2006 and were non-resident here for a continuous period of at least ten years prior to becoming resident, you may qualify as a "transitional resident" under section HR 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

If you qualify as a transitional resident and you pay interest in relation to money borrowed when you were not a New Zealand resident, the amount of NRWT you need to withhold is zero.

You are a transitional resident for four years after you become resident in New Zealand. After that four-year period, you must withhold NRWT at the generally applicable rate (currently 10%).

You may make an irrevocable election not to be a transitional resident (see section HR 8(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007).

### Penalties and interest

As the person who pays the interest to the Australian financial institution, you are required to withhold the NRWT and pay it to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. If you fail to do so, use of money interest, late payment penalties and/or shortfall penalties ranging from 20% to 150% could be imposed on you.

For more information on these penalties, see the Inland Revenue guides _Late payment and late filing penalties (IR741)_ and _Taxpayer obligations, interest and penalties (IR240)_.

### Approved issuer levy

If you are liable to pay NRWT, for the future you could request approval from Inland Revenue to become an approved issuer and have the loan treated as a registered security. You then pay the approved issuer levy of 2% instead of NRWT at 10%.

You will be granted approved issuer status if you have complied with your requirements under all of the Inland Revenue Acts during the two years before you made your application. You must then register all relevant securities with Inland Revenue. Approved issuer status cannot be backdated.

For further information, see the Inland Revenue guide _Approved issuer levy: A guide for payers (IR395)_.

### Analysis

The NRWT rules apply to gross income deemed to be derived from New Zealand that consists of interest (see section RF 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007).

Section YD 4(11)(b)(i) of the of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that interest derived from money lent outside New Zealand to a New Zealand resident is derived from New Zealand unless the resident borrows the money for a business carried on through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand.

However, in three instances NRWT will not be payable. The first two are provided by the domestic legislation. Section RF 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that if the Australian financial institution to which the interest is paid operates through a fixed establishment (i.e. a branch) in New Zealand, the NRWT rules do not apply. Section YD 4(11)(b)(i) of the of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides a further exception that applies if the resident borrows the money for a business carried on through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand. The third instance where NRWT will not be payable is if relief is provided by the DTA. The Australian DTA provides no NRWT will be payable if the New Zealand resident has a permanent establishment in Australia.

Section YD 4(11)(b)(i) applies to you even if you were not a New Zealand resident when you borrowed the money in respect of which you now pay interest from New Zealand. This is because the underlying policy of the provision is that the money used to pay the interest is raised through economic activity in New Zealand - the country in which the payer of the interest now resides - and the person is using public facilities here as a resident, so therefore the interest should be taxed in New Zealand. There is an exception to this general rule though, which is that if you borrowed the money for a business carried on through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand, then the interest is not considered to be sourced in New Zealand. In those circumstances, there is an economic link with the other country through the use of the money in the business carried on there. This is consistent with international treaty practice and is reflected in the DTA provisions discussed in this item.

The transitional residents provisions (referred to above) were introduced to mitigate the effect of the requirement for new New Zealand residents to withhold NRWT in relation to interest paid on money borrowed prior to gaining residency. The provisions were one of the legislative amendments that resulted from the Government Discussion Document _Reducing Tax Barriers to International Recruitment to New Zealand_ published in November 2003.

#### Terminology

The term "fixed establishment" is used in New Zealand's domestic legislation and is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

The term "permanent establishment" is defined in Article 5 of the DTA.

The two terms are used to describe types of business arrangements and can affect a person's tax position, including whether or not the interest paid to an Australian financial institution is subject to the NRWT rules in New Zealand.

A fixed establishment and a permanent establishment have similar features but a fixed establishment requires a _substantial_ business to be carried on.

#### Australian financial institution has a branch in New Zealand - situations A and B

If the Australian financial institution to which the interest is paid operates through a fixed establishment (i.e. a branch) in New Zealand, the NRWT rules will not apply to the interest (see section RF 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007).

#### Australian financial institution has no branch in New Zealand - situation A

In terms of the definitions of "fixed establishment" and "permanent establishment", a property or properties managed by a New Zealand resident ("the New Zealand owner") from New Zealand cannot constitute a "fixed place of business". The property (i.e. an apartment or house) is a fixed place but the business of leasing is not carried on through or in that place. All the management of the business takes place in New Zealand. The property itself is not where the business is carried on, rather it is the _subject_ of the business.

If the lessee carries on a business from the rental property, then the property is the lessee's fixed place of business, not the lessor's. The property is not available to the lessor (the New Zealand owner) throughout the period of the lease, so cannot constitute a fixed establishment or a permanent establishment of the New Zealand owner. The business of leasing is carried on elsewhere; that is, on the facts described above, in New Zealand. This means the exception to NRWT provided by the domestic legislation does not apply.

If the New Zealand owner makes regular trips to Australia to carry out management activities in respect of the residential investment property but carries out those activities from a motel or hotel, there is no fixed place of business - a rented room in such circumstances lacks the required permanence to be a "fixed" place of business. In addition, the business of leasing is not limited to the period when the New Zealand owner is operating in Australia, the New Zealand owner is still required to deal with management issues from New Zealand from time to time.

#### Australian financial institution has no branch in New Zealand - situation B

##### Fixed establishment

If a fixed establishment exists, section YD 4(11)(b)(i) of the Income Tax Act 2007 will not apply and the interest will not be deemed to be derived from New Zealand. Therefore, the New Zealand owner **will not** be liable for NRWT on interest paid.

Unlike the permanent establishment definition in the DTA (discussed below), the definition of "fixed establishment" does not include any provisions relating to the use of dependent or independent agents. However, general principles of agency can still be applied. A fixed establishment will be found to exist only if there is a fixed place of business in Australia through which a substantial business is carried on. The residential property is not itself a fixed place in which the business is carried on; rather it is the _subject_ of the business.

If the property manager is working for the New Zealand owner as their agent and has a fixed place in Australia from where that activity takes place, it could be considered that the business of leasing is carried on through that place and that the New Zealand owner has a fixed establishment in Australia.

However, if the New Zealand owner owns only one property that a property manager manages in Australia, a fixed establishment will generally not exist, as the leasing of one property will generally not amount to a "substantial business". However, this will depend on the nature of the single property: for example, if the single property is an apartment block, the leasing of it may be a substantial business.

If the New Zealand owner owns more than one property, whether there is a substantial business (and therefore a fixed establishment) will depend on the particular facts. It is more likely that there will be a substantial business of renting (and hence a fixed establishment) where several properties are rented out.

While the decided cases (such as _American Leaf Blending Co Sdn Bhd v Director-General of Inland Revenue_ \[1978\] 3 All ER 1185 (PC) and _L D Nathan Group Properties Ltd v CIR_ (1980) 4 NZTC 61,602) do indicate that a business may be more readily found to exist where a rental property or properties is owned by a company (rather than an individual), this will still depend upon the particular circumstances of the case. In addition, for there to be a fixed establishment any such business must be a _substantial_ business.

##### Permanent establishment

If the property manager is a "dependent agent" (see Article 5(7) of the DTA), a permanent establishment will exist and NRWT **will not** be payable by the New Zealand owner provided the indebtedness is attributable to the permanent establishment and the interest is deductible in determining the profits of the permanent establishment (see Article 11(5) of the DTA).

A dependent agent of the New Zealand owner is one who is acting solely for the New Zealand owner and who has and habitually exercises the authority to enter contracts on the New Zealand owner's behalf. Such an agency makes it likely that the New Zealand owner will be deemed to have a permanent establishment under the DTA.

If a permanent establishment exists, the DTA requires that there be a connection between the permanent establishment and the indebtedness in respect of which the New Zealand owner pays interest. As the New Zealand owner borrowed the funds to purchase the property or properties, and the property manager works for the New Zealand owner in respect of that property, a sufficient connection exists between the permanent establishment and the indebtedness, so the DTA will apply.

However, if the property manager is acting in the ordinary course of their own business of managing properties and is independent of the New Zealand owner legally and economically, the New Zealand owner will likely not be deemed to have a permanent establishment. This is so because the property manager will be an independent agent and any interest **will** be subject to NRWT.

If the property manager acts solely for the New Zealand owner in respect of the rental property but also owns another business _unrelated_ to the property management business, the manager could still be considered a dependent agent of the New Zealand owner. The DTA expressly excludes an agent who acts for the New Zealand owner in the _ordinary course_ of the agent's own property management business from being a dependent agent. However, a person who operates a business of their own (which is not related to property management) and who acts for the New Zealand owner _outside_ the ordinary course of that business is able to be considered a dependent agent of the New Zealand owner, if such person has and habitually exercises the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the New Zealand owner.

Note also that the New Zealand owner is not deemed to have a permanent establishment in Australia under Article 5(4)(c) of the DTA. A residential property does not constitute substantial equipment within the meaning of this provision.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Mr Acorn, a New Zealand resident, purchases a residential property on the Gold Coast in Australia as an investment. To finance the purchase, Mr Acorn takes out a loan with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia that is secured by a mortgage over the residential property.

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia operates in New Zealand through a branch. Consequently, the bank is considered to have a fixed establishment in New Zealand and the NRWT rules will not apply to require Mr Acorn to deduct a withholding payment from the interest paid on the loan to the bank.

#### Example 2

Mr Smith, a New Zealand resident, purchases a residential property on the Gold Coast in Australia as an investment. To finance the purchase, Mr Smith takes out a loan with the National Australia Bank that is secured by a mortgage over the residential property.

Mr Smith manages the residential property from his home in New Zealand and organises for maintenance work to be carried out as necessary when advised by his tenants. He does not engage the services of any person to act on his behalf in Australia in relation to the property.

National Australia Bank does not operate through a branch in New Zealand, so does not have a fixed establishment here. Mr Smith will have to deduct NRWT from the interest payments that he makes to the bank and pay them to Inland Revenue.

Mr Smith could request Inland Revenue's approval to become an approved issuer and have his mortgage accepted as a registered security. If accepted, Mr Smith would pay a 2% levy in place of NRWT at 10% from the date of acceptance.

#### Example 3

Ms Worth, a New Zealand resident, purchases 10 apartments in a high-rise apartment tower on the Gold Coast in Australia. She finances the purchases by borrowing funds from National Australia Bank. The loans are secured by mortgages over each of the properties.

Ms Worth does not have time to manage the properties herself from New Zealand, so she engages an acquaintance, Mr Donald, who lives on the Gold Coast, to manage them on her behalf. Mr Donald is retired and undertakes this management role only for Ms Worth. She authorises him to enter into contracts (i.e. tenancy agreements and maintenance contracts) on her behalf, and he does so regularly.

National Australia Bank does not operate through a branch in New Zealand, so does not have a fixed establishment here. However, because Mr Donald has and habitually exercises the authority to enter contracts on behalf of Ms Worth and works as a property manager only for her Mr Donald will be considered a dependent agent. Therefore, Ms Worth will have a permanent establishment in Australia and will not have to deduct NRWT from the interest payments made to National Australia Bank.

#### Example 4

Mrs King, a New Zealand resident, purchases two apartments in a high-rise apartment tower on the Sunshine Coast in Australia. She finances the purchases by borrowing funds from National Australia Bank. The loans are secured by mortgages over each of the properties.

Mrs King does not have time to manage the properties herself from New Zealand so she engages a professional property manager, Mr James, to manage the properties on her behalf. Mr James runs his own property management business on the Sunshine Coast, catering to non-resident owners of property in his area. Mrs King authorises Mr James to enter into contracts (i.e. tenancy agreements and maintenance contracts) on her behalf, and Mr James does so regularly.

National Australia Bank does not operate through a branch in New Zealand, so does not have a fixed establishment here. Mr James operates his own property management business and acts for Mrs King in the ordinary course of that business. Therefore, Mr James is an independent agent. Mrs King will not have a permanent establishment in Australia. Mrs King will not have a fixed establishment either, because, even if she could be considered to be in business through the activities of her agent, the leasing of two properties does not amount to a substantial business. Mrs King will have to deduct NRWT from the interest paid to the bank and pay the NRWT to Inland Revenue.

### Previous legislation

The Commissioner considers that the legal position outlined in this item was the same under the previous income tax legislation.

### Other countries

This item, and the underlying analysis, may also apply to the NRWT liability of New Zealand residents who own investment properties in countries other than Australia, where the purchase of such properties has been financed by a loan from a financial institution in that country. The general principles relating to New Zealand's domestic legislation will apply. However, it is important to note that the outcome may differ because the relevant provisions of New Zealand's double tax agreement with that country may not be the same as those considered in this item.

GST - Apportionment of the cost of bare land for the purposes of a change-in-use adjustment
===========================================================================================

QB 09/06 considers apportionment method for determining the cost of bare land when bought for a taxable purpose and partially used for private or exempt purposes.

All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

### Question

We have been asked to clarify the Commissioner's position on apportioning the cost price of bare land for the purposes of section 10(8)(a). This question arises where land is purchased for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and part is used for non-taxable purposes thereby giving rise to a deemed supply under section 21(1)(a).

### Answer

The Commissioner considers that a pro rata method of apportionment of cost for the purposes of section 10(8)(a) will generally be appropriate for deemed supplies of bare land under section 21(1)(a).

However, where it is not realistic to attribute the same proportion of the cost to all parts of the land, a pro rata method of apportionment will be inappropriate.

Any method adopted, however, must be made on an intelligible basis, must be based on the facts as known at the time of purchase (_Lowe v CIR_ (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006) and must not be too theoretical or artificial (_Lowe v CIR_; _CIR v Walker_ \[1963\] NZLR 339).

### Background

Where a registered taxpayer acquires land for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity in New Zealand, the taxpayer can generally claim 100% of the input tax paid in acquiring that land. If the taxpayer uses part of that land for a non-taxable purpose (such as erecting a residential dwelling or erecting accommodation for farm workers), either in the GST return period in which the land is acquired or in subsequent periods, then they are deemed to have made a supply under section 21(1)(a) and must make an adjustment.

In these circumstances, the adjustment reflects the extent to which the land is used for non-taxable purposes. The taxpayer must return output tax on the deemed supply of land used for non-taxable purposes. Section 10(8) deems the value of any adjustment required under section 21 to be the lesser of the cost of those goods or services to the supplier or the open market value of the deemed supply. The adjustment provisions in effect reduce the amount of any input tax claimed on the original acquisition to reflect any non-taxable use.

### Legislation

Section 21(1)(a) provides:

> |     |     |
> | --- | --- |
> | (1) | Subject to section 5(3), a registered person is treated as supplying goods and services in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity if - |     |
> | (a) | the person acquires or produces the goods and services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies but applies the goods and services for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies... |

Section 21A provides:

> |     |     |
> | --- | --- |
> | (1) | A registered person must determine the extent to which goods and services are applied for the purpose of making supplies other than taxable supplies according to: |     |
> | (a) | actual use; or |
> | (b) | an alternative method approved by the Commissioner if the method results in allocated amounts that are fair and reasonable. |
> | (2) | A registered person must determine the extent to which goods and services are applied for the purpose of making exempt supplies by either applying subsection (1) or using the formula:<br><br> Total value of exempt supplies for taxable period  <br>Total value of all supplies for taxable period. |     |
> | (3) | A registered person must choose a method that ensures a fair and reasonable result. |     |

Section 21C provides:

> |     |     |
> | --- | --- |
> | (1) | A registered person to whom section 21(1) applies must attribute output tax to one of the following times: |     |
> | (a) | in the first taxable period in which goods and services are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies; or |
> | (b) | in each taxable period in which goods and services are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies; or |
> | (c) | in each year in which goods and services are applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. |
> | (2) | A registered person who applies subsection (1)(a) must make output tax attributions to reflect further changes in use of 20% or more. |     |
> | (3) | If subsection (1)(a) or (1)(c) applies, a registered person must reduce the output tax attributable by the amount of the output tax attributed to earlier taxable periods for the supply of the goods and services. |     |
> | (4) | A person may change the time the person attributes output tax only with the Commissioner's approval. |     |

Section 10 provides:

> |     |     |
> | --- | --- |
> | (1) | For the purposes of this Act the following provisions of this section shall apply for determining the value of any supply of goods and services. |     |
> | ... |     |     |
> | (8) | Where goods and services are deemed to be supplied by a person under section 5(3) and the goods and services were acquired before 1 October 1986, or where goods and services are treated as being supplied under section 21, the consideration in money for either supply shall be deemed to be the lesser of- |     |
> | (a) | The cost of those goods and services to the supplier, including any input tax deduction claimed in respect of the supply of those goods and services to that supplier: |
> | (b) | The open market value of that supply. |

### Discussion

A deemed supply of a part of a parcel of bare land under section 21 is valued under section 10(8) to be the lesser of the cost of the goods and services to the supplier and the open market value of the deemed supply. The phrase "the cost of those goods and services to the supplier" in section 10(8)(a) necessarily requires that the cost of the whole land be apportioned in order to determine the cost of the deemed supply.

#### _Meaning of "cost"_

The word "cost" is not defined in the Act. Therefore, it must be given its ordinary meaning. The _Concise Oxford Dictionary_ (11th edition) relevantly defines "cost" as:

> n. the amount that something costs; the effort or loss necessary to achieve something.

In _Wilke v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,923 it was held, in the context of section 10(8), that "cost" means the money or money's worth given up to get something. Panckhurst J in _Wilke v CIR_ adopted the reasoning of the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal in _Kettle River Sawmills Ltd v Minister of National Revenue_ (1993) 64 NR 241, which states (at page 249):

> Cost means the money or money's worth which is given up by somebody to get something. It is generally viewed as an objectively determinable historical fact, the answer to the question 'how much was paid?'

Similarly, in _CIR v Lundy Family Trust & Behemoth_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,637 the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the word "cost" in the context of section 10(8) and stated:

> The term "cost" would be ordinarily understood as the acquisition cost and we consider that is its meaning in the present context.

#### Valuation of which supply?

Section 10(8)(a) states that the value of a deemed supply may be the "cost of those goods and services to the supplier, including any input tax deduction claimed in respect of the supply of those goods and services to that supplier". It is considered that this refers to the original purchase price of the goods or services (in this case, bare land) apportioned to reflect the amount properly attributable to the deemed supply made under section 21(1).

#### Apportionment of "cost"

Section 10(8) operates to value a deemed supply arising out of a change in use adjustment under section 21. Section 21A applies to apportion the goods and services subject to a change in use adjustment between taxable and non-taxable use. Therefore, the Act envisages that sometimes only a part of goods or services acquired for taxable purposes may be applied to a non-taxable use. It is considered that it is possible, and indeed required by the legislation, to determine the cost or value of a part of an undivided whole when only the cost of the whole is known.

It is therefore necessary to consider how to apportion the cost of bare land for the purposes of section 10(8). Section 10(8) does not provide any basis for the apportionment of "cost" and there are no cases on apportioning the cost of land under section 10(8) of the Act, or in a GST context more generally.

Section 21A provides several apportionment methods. However, this section is concerned with how to apportion between taxable and non-taxable use to identify which part of the supply of goods or services (in this case land) has changed in use. Section 10(8), on the other hand, is concerned with valuing the deemed supply. The Commissioner considers that the fact that the land can be divided up between taxable and non-taxable use under section 21A, does not necessarily mean that the cost of the land can be divided up in the same proportions under section 10(8). This is because different parts of a parcel of land may contribute differently to the overall cost of that land. It is therefore considered that section 21A does not provide any direct guidance on apportioning "cost" under section 10(8)(a).

In the absence of any guidance from the Act or any GST cases, it is necessary to look outside the GST context. The leading case on the method of calculating profit for the purposes of income tax is _Lowe v CIR_. The Court in _Lowe v CIR_ held that where the provisions of the Income Tax Act do not specify how to calculate the income of the taxpayer, the income is to be calculated using commercially accepted principles and methods. If there is more than one alternative commercially acceptable method then the method which provides the "truer picture" of the taxpayer's income should be used.

The courts have also said that the method of apportioning cost must be reasonable (_Lowe v CIR_), commercially acceptable (_Lowe v CIR_; Barwick J (dissenting) in _FCT v McClelland_ (1967-1969) 118 CLR 353 at 365; 60 ATC 4001; 15 ATD 204), and made on an intelligible basis (_Lowe v CIR_); but cannot be too theoretical (_CIR v Walker_; _Lowe v CIR_), artificial (_McClelland v FCT_ (1967-1969) 118 CLR 353; 14 ATD 529; _Elsey v FCT_ (1969) 121 CLR 99; 69 ATC 4115) arbitrary (_Lowe v CIR_; _Chapman v FCT_ (1968) 117 CLR 167; _CIR v Walker_) or unjustifiable (_McGuiness v Commissioner of Taxation_ (Cth) (1972) 3 ATR 22; 72 ATC 4023). However, the courts have not provided more guidance on these features. Nevertheless, the case law is useful in so far as it provides judicial comments on the appropriateness of various methods of calculation used in specific circumstances. Ultimately, it would appear that the validity of a method of calculation will depend upon the particular circumstances of each case.

In the context of section 10(8) and bare land, the Commissioner considers the pro rata method would generally give the truer picture. Courts are reluctant to use methods that are too theoretical or artificial. The pro rata method, also called the area method, takes the proportion of land subject to the deemed supply and uses it to apportion the purchase price of the whole block of land in order to calculate the "cost" of the part.

The Commissioner considers that the courts will generally accept a pro rata approach under section 10(8), even when the land is not completely uniform. However, it is possible that the courts may depart from a pro rata approach and accept some other method in situations where there is evidence that it would not be realistic to attribute the same proportion of the cost to all parts of the land.

These situations could include where:

*   a parcel of land is not uniform in nature because it is made up of areas of significantly different features (_Elsey v FCT_). For example, flat pasture land, land bordering on a beach or lake-side, mountainous land, or swamp;
*   part of the land is zoned differently under a district plan (_CIR v Walker_); or
*   a right attaches to a specific part of the land, for example a right of way or easement.

In addition, generally, where the parties explicitly agree in the sale and purchase agreement that part of the total cost of the land attaches to a part disproportionately in relation to its size due to one or more of the factors above, then that will be evidence of the cost of the different parts of the land.

The actual future use of the land will not be a factor that influences whether a particular method of apportionment is appropriate (_Lowe v CIR_).

Any method of apportioning cost under section 10(8) must be based on the original cost price of the land.

#### Whether valuations can be used to determine "cost"

One alternative method to pro rata is where valuations are used to apportion the cost price of land to determine how much should be attributed to the land subject to the deemed supply. The "cost" of the deemed supply would be calculated with reference to the respective land valuations (as at the time of purchase) of the land used for taxable purposes and the land used for non-taxable purposes. The valuations of the different parts of that land would be used to divide up the cost. Such valuations must be based on facts known at the time the land was purchased, and cannot take into account the actual future use of the land. Such valuations may, depending on the particular circumstances, need to take into account the fact that the land is one undivided whole.

It might be argued that using valuations to identify the cost of part of an area of land cannot be correct because it might mean that the two bases for valuation in section 10(8) - cost and open market value - would effectively be the same.

However, the "cost" and "open market value" options are different enquiries. The Commissioner considers that the two bases for valuing the deemed supply under section 10(8) provide distinct methods for determining the value of a deemed supply under section 21(1). The market value is the current market value of the deemed supply at the time of the deemed supply, and the cost is the original cost to the purchaser of the land (deemed later to be supplied) when the whole of the land was purchased. There is no guidance in the Act regarding appropriate methods of apportioning "cost" where only part of the land is subject to a deemed supply. The Commissioner considers that valuations can be used to apportion cost, but only if they reflect the value of the different parts of the land at the time the land was purchased.

### Examples

##### Example 1

A person registered for GST buys a 10 hectare block of bare land for $200,000 (including GST) for his market gardening business. The land is made up of flat pasture land and rolling hills. The new owner claims an input tax deduction for the GST paid on the purchase of the land. Some months after purchasing the property, the owner decides to set aside 1 hectare of the land for a house for his family. The current market value of similar 1 hectare sections in the area is $50,000.

The owner must make an adjustment of the GST input tax deduction claimed on purchasing the land and return an amount of output tax that relates to the land set aside for the family home. Section 21C gives the taxpayer the option to make a one-off adjustment, a periodic adjustment, or an annual adjustment. The taxpayer chooses to make a one-off adjustment. The amount of output tax that must be paid on the deemed supply is calculated by applying the tax fraction to the value of the deemed supply. Under section 10(8), the value of the deemed supply is the lesser of the cost or the market value of the deemed supply of land.

In this situation it would be appropriate to calculate the cost of the land set aside for the family home by apportioning the cost of the whole parcel of land on a pro rata basis.

A pro rata method of calculating the "cost" of the 1 hectare section results in a price per hectare of $20,000. As the "cost" of the section is less than its market value of $50,000, the value of the deemed supply under section 10(8) is $20,000.

##### Example 2

A person registered for GST buys a 150 hectare block of land adjacent to his dairy farm for $1.5 million (including GST) and claims an input tax deduction for the GST paid on the purchase of the land. The land is flat pasture land near the coast close to a popular holiday destination. One year after purchasing the property to extend his farm, the owner decides to set aside the hectare of land that has access to the beach for the family home. The current market value of 1 hectare sections with beach access is $250,000.

The owner must make an adjustment of the GST input tax deduction claimed on purchasing the land and return an amount of output tax that relates to the land used for the family home. Section 21C gives the taxpayer the option to make a one-off adjustment, a periodic adjustment, or an annual adjustment. The taxpayer chooses to make a one-off adjustment. The amount of output tax that must be paid on the deemed supply is calculated by applying the tax fraction to the value of the deemed supply. Under section 10(8), the value of the deemed supply is the lesser of the cost or the market value of the deemed supply of land.

Using a pro rata method, the "cost" of the beach-front section would be $10,000. However, at the time that the property was purchased, similar sized beach-front sections in the area were sold for $200,000, and local dairy-farm land sold for $12,000 per hectare. In this situation, a calculation of "cost" as a price per hectare will be inappropriate because it would not accurately reflect the cost attributable to the land with beach access compared with the rest of the farm land.

A more appropriate method is to identify the respective market values of the farm land and the residential section at the time of the original purchase and calculate what percentage of the aggregate market value of the land relates to the residential land. This percentage is then applied to the original cost of the land to determine the "cost" of the residential land.

The market value of the farm land at the time of purchase (based on the sale prices of local dairy-farm land) was $1.788 million for the 149 hectares of farm land at $12,000 per hectare. The market value of the 1 hectare section at the time of purchase (based on the market value of similar beach front sections at the time of purchase) was $200,000. Therefore the total market value of the land at the time of purchase was $1.988 million. (The owner purchased the property for below market value.)

The market value of the residential land ($200,000) is divided by the total market value of the whole parcel of land ($1.988 million) in order to calculate a percentage. In this situation, the market value of the residential land is 10.06% of the market value of the whole parcel of land. This percentage should then be applied to the purchase price of the whole land ($1.5 million) to identify the proportional values of the farmland and residential land and so calculate the "cost" of the residential land. This results in the "cost" of the 1 hectare section being $150,900.

> |     |     |
> | --- | --- |
> | Market value of 149 hectares of rural land: | $1.788 m |
> | Market value of 1 hectare of residential land: | $200,000 |
> | Total aggregate market value: | $1.988 m |
> | Percentage of the total market value of the land attributable to the residential land: | $200,000 × 100% = 10.06% |
> | $1.988 m |
> | Percentage of the total market value of the land attributable to the residential land applied to the original purchase price: | 10.06% × $1.5 m = $150,900 |

Therefore, under section 10(8), the "cost" of the beach-front section under paragraph (a) is $150,900, and its market value at the time of the deemed supply under paragraph (b) is $250,000. As the "cost" of the section is less than its market value, the value of the deemed supply under section 10(8) is $150,900.

The above answer necessarily sets out general principles only. The facts of particular cases always need to be considered carefully, and it may be necessary to obtain advice from a tax advisor.

Reimbursing shareholder-employees for motor vehicle expenses and the use of the Commissioner's mileage rate
===========================================================================================================

QB 10/01 considers reimbursing of shareholder-employees for motor vehicle expenses using the mileage rate, and clarifies the 'employee criteria'.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

We have been asked whether an employer who reimburses an employee for the business use of their private motor vehicle is able to use the Commissioner's mileage rate as set out in Operational Statement 09/01: _Commissioner's statement of a mileage rate for expenditure incurred for the business use of a motor vehicle_ ("OS 09/01"), published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 21, No 3 (May 2009), and to also clarify the "employee criteria" when it comes to reimbursing shareholder-employees.

We have also been asked whether the 5,000 km limitation on using that mileage rate also applies in these circumstances.

### Summary

An employee may receive reimbursements that are exempt from tax for the use of their private motor vehicle under section CW 17. For the purposes of section CW 17, the meaning of "employee" includes a shareholder-employee of a close company who does not receive PAYE income payments.

The options that an employer has to reimburse an employee, including a shareholder-employee, for the business use of their private vehicle are:

*   actual expenditure incurred by the employee for the distance travelled by the vehicle for work purposes;
*   an employer's own reasonable estimate of expenditure likely to be incurred by the employee. This estimate may be based on a rate published by a reputable independent New Zealand source, eg, the New Zealand Automobile Association Inc.; and
*   the mileage rate set by the Commissioner pursuant to section DE 12. Although the 5,000 km limitation does not apply in these circumstances, an employee whose annual business travel exceeds 5,000 km may need to be reimbursed using an alternative method.

### Discussion

Section CW 17 provides that an employee may be reimbursed an amount that is exempt from tax for the use of their own vehicle for work related purposes.

Employers can reimburse an employee based on actual expenditure incurred by the employee for the distance travelled by the employee's own vehicle for work purposes, or by making a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred under section CW 17(3).

As a reasonable estimate employers may reimburse their employees using the rates published by a reputable independent New Zealand source, such as the New Zealand Automobile Association Inc., provided that the rate represents a reasonable estimate of the expenditure likely to be incurred by the employee. Employers may also use the Commissioner's mileage rate as set out in OS 09/01 as a reasonable estimate to reimburse employees.

### The employee criteria

In regards to reimbursing shareholder-employees, OS 09/01 states that "where shareholder-employees meet the employee criteria, they may be reimbursed using the mileage rate as a reasonable estimate".

In fact, where a shareholder-employee meets the employee criteria as defined in section YA 1, they are entitled to tax-free reimbursements in the same way as an ordinary employee.

Section YA 1 defines the term "employee" as a person who receives a PAYE income payment and includes a person to whom sections RD 3(2) to (4) apply for the purposes of section CW 17.

A person comes within section RD 3(2) if they are a shareholder-employee of a close company and they do not receive salary or wages of a regular amount for regular pay periods of one month or less, or where the payments received by the person as an employee total to less than 66% of that person's annual gross income.

"Close company" is defined in section YA 1 and for the purposes of sections RD 3(2) to (4), it includes a company with 25 or fewer shareholders.

Sections RD 3(3) and (4) provide that the shareholder-employee referred to in section RD 3(2) may choose that the amount paid to them in the current tax year is not PAYE income payment, and that the amounts paid to them in later tax years are deemed not to be PAYE income payments.

Consequently, shareholder-employees, whether or not they receive a PAYE income payment, may come within the meaning of employee for the purposes of receiving tax free reimbursements.

### The 5,000 km limitation

The Commissioner's mileage rate in OS 09/01 was set taking into account the purchase price of a motor vehicle and other expenses such as insurance and registration, as well as running costs (including the cost of fuel, and repairs and maintenance etc). This rate is based on average travel for a motor vehicle of 14,000 km a year, and is primarily intended to be used by self-employed taxpayers whose business travel is 5,000 km or less each year.

While the 5,000 km limitation does not apply to reimbursing employees, it is up to the individual employer who chooses to use the Commissioner's mileage rate to ensure that the rate is suitable and that it represents a reasonable estimate of the employee's expenditure. If an employee's annual business travel exceeds 5,000 km, the Commissioner's mileage rate may no longer represent a reasonable estimate of that employee's expenditure as those costs which are not running costs will have been recovered. In these circumstances the employer may need to use an alternative method to reimburse the employee for the excess kilometres.

GST treatment of futures contracts
==================================

QB 10/02 considers the treatment of futures contracts that are cash-settled, cover physical delivery of a GST exempt commodity, or provide for delivery of money.

All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

### Question

What is the correct GST treatment of futures contracts that:

*   are cash-settled[1](#1)
     ; or
*   provide for the physical delivery of a commodity exempt from GST; or
*   provide for the delivery of money?

### Answer

No GST is chargeable on the provision or assignment of a futures contract in the three circumstances listed above, because the provision or assignment is either an exempt supply or zero-rated.

The provision or assignment of a futures contract is a financial service and therefore an exempt supply when the futures contract:

*   does not provide for physical delivery of a commodity; or
*   provides for physical delivery of a commodity, but that commodity is an exempt supply; or
*   provides for the delivery of money.

(See sections 3(1)(k)(a) and 14(1)(a).)

When a person supplies a cash-settled futures contract to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand when the contract is entered into, that supply will be zero-rated.

This item replaces the Commissioner’s statement on the operation of section 3(1)(k) in _Public Information Bulletin_ 169 (February 1988), p 5 ("PIB 169").

Note that this item does not consider the potential application of elections under section 20F to zero-rate the supply of financial services under section 11A(1)(q) and (r). Elections may result in additional zero-rating.

### Explanation

This section explains how the provision or assignment of a futures contract may be an exempt supply or a zero-rated supply, depending on to whom it is supplied. This section also clarifies the Commissioner’s position on the novation of futures contracts. This is addressed because the Commissioner’s previous statement on the novation of futures contracts in PIB 169 arguably suggested that where a futures contract was novated, GST might be chargeable. The Commissioner considers that this is incorrect.

### Exempt supplies

Section 14(1)(a) provides that a financial service is an exempt supply for GST purposes.

Section 3(1)(k) states:

1.  For the purposes of this Act, the term financial services means any one or more of the following activities:  
    ...

11.  the provision or assignment of a futures contract through a defined market or at arm's length if -
    1.  the contract does not provide for the delivery of a commodity; or
    2.  the contract provides for the delivery of a commodity and the supply of the commodity is an exempt supply; or
    3.  the contract provides for the delivery of money:

Section 3(1)(k) therefore provides that the provision or assignment of a futures contract is a financial service where the futures contract:

### Zero-rating

Section 14(1B)(a) provides that where a financial service can be zero-rated under section 11A, the zero-rating provisions override the exempting provisions.

In this respect, section 11A(1)(k)(i) provides that a supply of services must be zero-rated where those services are:

*   supplied to a person who is a non-resident; and
*   that person is outside New Zealand when the services are performed; and
*   those services are not supplied directly in connection with land (or any improvement to land) in New Zealand or moveable personal property (other than choses in action).

Therefore, the supply of a cash-settled futures contract will be zero-rated when it is supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand when the contract is entered into. The exception is where the performance of services is, or could be, received in New Zealand by another person including an employee of the non-resident or a director of a non-resident company: section 11A(2). However, it is considered unlikely that section 11A(2) will apply to standard cash settled futures contracts.

For all other futures contracts, section 3(1)(k) is the relevant section.

### Novation of futures contracts

Novation in the context of futures contracts is the process whereby a central counterparty interposes itself between the original parties to the futures contract. This is a key feature of derivatives markets as it facilitates market liquidity and allows market participants to trade anonymously without needing to monitor the credit risk of their original counterparty.

The Commissioner considers that the provision of a futures contract under section 3(1)(k) is the supplying or furnishing of a futures contract for entry into such a contract. On this basis, it is the Commissioner’s view that the novation of a futures contract is a financial service, where that futures contract does not provide for the physical delivery of a commodity, or provides for the supply of a commodity exempt from GST or money. No GST will be chargeable where a futures contract is novated in these circumstances.

Where a futures contract is novated to a non-resident central counterparty who is outside New Zealand at the time the futures contract is entered into and that futures contract is cash-settled, then that supply will be zero-rated in accordance with section 11A(1)(k)(i) (and subject to section 11A(2)).

The Commissioner’s previous statement on the novation of futures contracts is set out in PIB 169. PIB 169 appears to suggest that GST could be chargeable in certain situations when futures contracts are novated. This interpretation has been questioned, and issues have been raised about whether this accurately reflects the law. This item replaces the Commissioner’s statement in PIB 169.

1 A cash-settled futures contract is a futures contract that is settled by an exchange of agreed cash flows rather than by the delivery of the underlying commodity.

Fringe benefit tax - Value of motor vehicle previously owned by the employer or by an associated person of the employer
=======================================================================================================================

QB 10/03 discusses when the value of a motor vehicle for FBT will be affected by the vehicle having previously been owned by the employer or associated person.

This item applies to FBT periods beginning on or after the first day of the 2008/2009 income year and replaces the Question we've been asked, "FBT cost price of secondhand motor vehicle obtained from associated person", published in _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995) at page 31 from the same date.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

### Question

1.  For fringe benefit tax (FBT) purposes, in what situations will the value of a motor vehicle owned by an employer be affected by the vehicle having previously been owned by the employer or an associated person of the employer?

### Answer

2.  The value for FBT purposes of a motor vehicle owned by an employer is determined on the basis of either the cost price or the tax value of the vehicle to the employer. Generally, the starting point for both of these bases is the actual cost price of the vehicle to the employer - the cost price is the actual cost price to the employer, and the tax value is the actual cost price to the employer less the total accumulated depreciation of the vehicle.
3.  The appropriate starting point to value the vehicle for FBT purposes will not necessarily be the actual cost price of the vehicle to the employer if, in the two years before the employer most recently acquired the vehicle, the vehicle was owned by:
    *   the employer; or
    *   a person associated with the employer at the time the person owned the vehicle.
4.  If the cost price method is to be used, the starting point will be the highest cost paid for the vehicle by the employer or the associated person on any acquisition.
5.  If the tax value method is used, the appropriate starting point is determined by clause 4 of Schedule 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. More information on the application of clause 4 is in _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007), page 81.

### Explanation

#### Purpose of this item

6.  This item explains the application of clauses 3(c) and 8(b) of Schedule 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (‘the provisions').
7.  Clause 1 of schedule 5 states that the value of the benefit that an employee receives from having a vehicle provided or available for their private use can be determined on the basis of either the cost price or the tax value of the vehicle.
8.  Clause 3(c) applies to employers using the tax value basis and states:
    
    *   3  In this schedule, a motor vehicle's tax value in a quarter, tax year, or income year is-  
        ...  
        (c) determined under clause 4 if, in the period of 2 years before the vehicle's acquisition by the person (person A) providing it to the employee, the vehicle is owned by person A or by a person (person B) associated with them.
    
      
    Clause 4 determines which clause is used to calculate the tax value of the vehicle depending on the basis most recently used to value the vehicle and the owner of the vehicle when that basis was used.
9.  Clause 8(b) applies to employers using the cost price basis and states:
    *   8  To determine the value of a benefit under clause 1-  
        ...  
        (b) if, in the period of 2 years before the vehicle's acquisition by the person providing it to the employee, the vehicle is owned by the person or by someone associated with them, the cost price is treated as being the highest one of the cost prices paid for the vehicle by the person or an associate since its manufacture:
10.  The provisions are anti-avoidance provisions aimed at ensuring FBT liability is not reduced by an employer selling and repurchasing a vehicle at market value so as to take advantage of a lower cost price of the vehicle.
11.  A Question We've Been Asked, "FBT cost price of secondhand motor vehicle obtained from associated person", was published in _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995) at page 31. This Question We've Been Asked stated that the predecessor to clauses 3(c) and 8(b) applied:
    *   when the vehicle is purchased from an associated person within 24 months of the date on which that associated person purchased the vehicle.
12.  The Commissioner considers that the statement quoted above is incorrect and wishes to clarify the situation.
13.  It is timely to do this now, because clause 3(c) was recently amended by section 580 of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance and Remedial Matters) Act 2009.

### How the provisions apply

14.  This section explains how the provisions are interpreted by answering specific questions that have arisen when the provisions have been applied. Three questions are answered below:
    *   What is the relevant period set out by the provisions?
    *   When do the parties need to be associated for the provisions to apply?
    *   Does it matter how the employer acquired the vehicle?

**_What is the relevant period set out by the provisions?_**

15.  The provisions focus on "the period of 2 years before the vehicle's acquisition by the person providing it to the employee". This is the two years immediately before the employer most recently acquired the vehicle. This point is illustrated in example 1.
16.  Previously, clause 3(c) stated the period as "2 years before a person … acquired the vehicle and provided it to the employee". This could have suggested that the relevant period was the two years before the vehicle was provided to the employee. Clause 3(c) was amended by section 580 of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 to clarify that this interpretation is incorrect.

##### _Example 1_

17.  Company A and Company B have been associated since 2001. Company A bought a motor vehicle on 1 July 2006 and sold it to an unrelated party (Company Z) on 1 October 2006. On 1 April 2008, Company B bought the motor vehicle from Company Z. Company B did not begin to provide the vehicle to one of its employees until 1 January 2009. 
18.  The transactions in this example are illustrated in the following timeline.
    
    [Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/a/2/a2808400424464cb927e9f82245c33b7/example-1-large.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203143&hash=43CEF4BC1D1A9BC83EED7C6799C9E293)
    
19.  The relevant period in the situation described above is 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2008. The vehicle was owned by an associated person of Company B during this period, so Company B will need to determine the value of the motor vehicle provided to the employee using:
    *   clause 3(c), if using the tax value basis; or
    *   clause 8(b), if using the cost price basis.
20.  The following are not important in determining the relevant period:
    *   when Company A acquired the vehicle; and
    *   when Company B began to provide the vehicle to one of its employees.

_**When do the parties need to be associated for the provisions to apply?**_

21.  The provisions address the situation of a vehicle that has been previously "owned by" the employer or an associated person of the employer. Therefore, for the provisions to apply, the parties must have been associated at a time that was both:
    *   during the relevant two year period; and
    *   during the time that the associated person owned the vehicle.
22.  The parties do not need to be associated when either one acquires the vehicle or when the employer provides the vehicle to an employee. This point is illustrated in example 2.

##### _Example 2_

23.  Company A purchased a motor vehicle on 1 April 2006. On 1 April 2007, Company A and Company B became associated persons. On 30 September 2007, Company A sold the vehicle to an unrelated party (Company Z). On 31 March 2008, Company A and Company B ceased to be associated persons. On 1 October 2008, Company B purchased the vehicle from Company Z.
24.  For the provisions to apply to this situation, there must have been a time that was:
    *   during the period the parties were associated; and
    *   during the two year period immediately before Company B acquired the vehicle; and
    *   during the period Company A owned the vehicle.
25.  The transactions in this example are illustrated in the following timeline.
    
    [Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/7/37d056804244656692859f82245c33b7/example-2-25-large.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203143&hash=9C1FE80F5E69CDBE8D72A0A6CA70A954)
    
26.  If the period in which Company A and Company B were associated and the relevant period (the two years before Company B acquired the vehicle) are added to the timeline above, then the timeline looks as follows:
    
    [Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/7/6/7692fa80424465c0928c9f82245c33b7/example-226-large.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203142&hash=378040B5F27ABD9D1A4A09A12FF90658)
    
27.  It can be seen that from 1 April 2007 to 30 September 2007 the parties were associated and Company A owned the vehicle. These dates also fall within the relevant period. Therefore, the provisions apply to this situation. Company B will need to determine the value of the motor vehicle provided to the employee using:
    *   clause 3(c), if using the tax value basis; or
    *   clause 8(b), if using the cost price basis.

_**Does it matter how the employer acquired the vehicle?**_

28.  The provisions do not refer to how the employer acquires the vehicle, only to the time of acquisition. The provisions do not require that the employer acquire the vehicle directly from the associated person.
29.  The provisions also cover situations where one or more unrelated parties own the vehicle in between the associated parties owning the vehicle.
30.  The two examples above are both situations where a non-associated person has owned the vehicle between the associated parties. The provisions apply to both of these situations.

Elections for qualifying company status
=======================================

QB 10/06 considers who is required to sign a notice of shareholder election for qualifying company status, where nominees or bare trustees are involved.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Question

If a nominee or bare trustee holds shares in a company for another person, should the nominee or bare trustee shareholder, or the beneficial owner of the shares sign the notice of shareholder election for qualifying company status?

### Answer

A notice of shareholder election for qualifying company ("QC") status for that shareholding will be effective if signed by any one of:

*   the beneficial owner of the shares,
*   a person holding shares as a nominee for the beneficial owner of the shares, or
*   a person holding shares as a bare trustee for the beneficial owner of the shares.

The legislation requires that the beneficial owner make the shareholder election. The beneficial owner can satisfy this requirement by personally making the election. However, the legislative requirements will also be satisfied if the election is made by a nominee or bare trustee acting on instructions and on behalf of the beneficial owner.

The act of a nominee is "looked through". The nominee's act is treated as done by the person on whose behalf the nominee is acting (see s YB 21(1)). Therefore, where a nominee shareholder signs a notice of shareholder election for QC status, the election will be treated as having been made by the beneficial owner of the shares.

A bare trustee is treated as a nominee (see s YB 21(2)). Therefore, when a bare trustee signs a notice of shareholder election for QC status, the election will similarly be treated as having been made by the beneficial owner of the shares.

This item clarifies the Commissioner's statement on who is required to sign a notice of shareholder election for QC status, where nominees or bare trustees are involved (_Tax Information Bulletin (TIB)_ Vol 3 No 7 (April 1992)). That statement is withdrawn with immediate effect to the extent of the following bolded text in relation to "Shareholder elections - Section 393D":

> In determining who has to make the election it is important to note that the look through rules only apply for the count test and not for the election requirements. Where a chain of qualifying companies exists, only the shareholder qualifying company must complete a shareholder election and assume liability. **Similarly, in the case of a nominee interest it is the nominee who elects.**

The Commissioner considers that the same conclusions apply in relation to the newly enacted look-through company regime.

### Explanation

#### Purpose of this item

This item explains who should sign a notice of shareholder election for QC status where a nominee shareholder or bare trustee shareholder is involved. In these situations, the possible signatories are the person holding shares as the nominee or bare trustee for the beneficial owner or the beneficial owner of the shares. The item concludes that an effective shareholder election will be made when a notice of shareholder election is signed by any one of these signatories.

This item does not impact on the rules of general agency where a person could validly instruct an agent to sign an election on their behalf.

#### Who is required to make a shareholder election?

Section HA 1(5) states in relation to entering the QC regime:

> For a company to be a qualifying company or a loss-attributing qualifying company, all the directors of the company, and **every shareholder in the company with legal capacity, must sign an election referred to in section HA 5**. An exception applies for a minority shareholder in the situation described in section HA 29.  
> \[emphasis added\]  

For a company to become a QC, every shareholder in the company with legal capacity must sign an election. Section HA 1(6) then states:

> A shareholder who makes an election referred to in subsection (5) must agree to take personal liability to the extent described in section HA 8.

By electing QC status, the shareholders:

*   elect to enter the QC regime, and
*   elect to be liable for a share of the company's income tax liability, proportional to the shareholder's effective interest in the company.

#### Elections to become a qualifying company

Section HA 5(1) states that:

> A company that meets the requirements of sections HA 6 to HA 9 may be a qualifying company or an LAQC only if all the directors of the company and every shareholder in the company with legal capacity, choose that the company is to become a qualifying company. Every director and every shareholder with legal capacity must sign a notice of election and give it to the Commissioner.

To make the election to be a QC, every shareholder with legal capacity must:

*   choose that the company is to become a QC,
*   sign a notice of election, and
*   give that notice to the Commissioner.

When these legislative requirements are considered in detail along with the discernible policy intent of the QC and LAQC regimes, the "shareholder" referred to in these sections is the beneficial owner of the shares. It is the beneficial owner who must make a shareholder election. Given that the beneficial owner must make the shareholder election, the issue is whether the beneficial owner must do this personally or whether a nominee or bare trustee could do so on behalf of the beneficial owner.

#### Can nominees or bare trustees elect on behalf of beneficial owners?

##### _Definition of nominees_

"Nominee" is defined in s YB 21:

> **Treatment of nominee**
> 
> |     |     |
> | --- | --- |
> | (1) | In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, if a person holds something or does something as a nominee for another person, the other person holds or does that thing and the nominee is ignored. |
> 
> **Who is a nominee?**
> 
> |     |     |
> | --- | --- |
> | (2) | A person holds or does something as a nominee for another person if the person acts on the other person's behalf. However, a trustee is a nominee only if the trustee is a bare trustee. |

For the purposes of the Act, a nominee is a person who holds something or does something for another person on that other person's behalf. Usually a nominee will be directly instructed to take a particular action. A nominee acts within the limits allowed by the person on whose behalf and as whose representative the nominee is acting. The nominee can only act as directed by the beneficial owner. Therefore, the nominee's action is implicitly or explicitly approved by the person for whom they are acting.

Unless the context requires otherwise, if a nominee holds or does something for another person, the nominee is ignored. The person, on whose behalf the nominee was acting, is treated as having taken the action. The nominee is looked through.

##### _A nominee shareholder_

Where a person uses a nominee to hold shares in a company, the nominee is the shareholder on the company's share register. However, the nominee holds the shares for the other person (the beneficial owner of the shares).

If the nominee shareholder does something on behalf of the beneficial owner of the shares and as instructed by the beneficial owner, that action is treated as the action of the beneficial owner of the shares.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| _Example 1:_ | Adam holds shares in a company, as Bella's nominee. Adam is the shareholder on the company's share register. Adam, as Bella's nominee shareholder, signs an election for QC status in relation to that shareholding as directed by Bella. Adam has acted on behalf of Bella and as Bella's representative. For the purposes of the QC regime, Adam is ignored. Bella, the beneficial owner of the shares, is treated as having made the shareholder election. |

In summary, where a nominee shareholder acts on behalf of the beneficial owner of the shares in relation to those shares and as instructed by the beneficial owner, the nominee is ignored and the action is treated as that of the beneficial owner of the shares.

##### _A bare trustee shareholder_

Section YB 21(2) states that "a trustee is a nominee only if the trustee is a bare trustee." As such, a bare trustee is a "nominee" under the Act.

Therefore, if a bare trustee holds shares in a company, the bare trustee holds those shares for and on behalf of the beneficial owner of the shares. Where the bare trustee shareholder acts on behalf of and as instructed by the beneficial owner of the shares, the bare trustee (then acting as a nominee) is ignored. The action is treated as that of the beneficial owner of the shares.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| _Example 2:_ | Alice is the shareholder of a company. She holds the shares in the company as a bare trustee for Ben. Ben is the beneficial owner of the shares. Ben instructs Alice to sign the form to elect QC status in relation to those shares. Alice, as shareholder, signs a shareholder election form for QC status. Alice has acted on behalf of Ben and as instructed by Ben. For the purposes of the QC regime and by the application of section YB 21, Alice is ignored. Ben, the beneficial owner of the shares, is treated as having made the shareholder election. |

#### Look-through Companies

The Commissioner considers that the same result is reached in relation to the newly enacted look-through company ("LTC") regime. Section HB 13 states in relation to electing to become an LTC:

> **HB 13 LTC elections**
> 
> |     |     |     |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | (1) | For the purposes of section HB 1, an LTC election (the election) is a notice that- |     |     |
> |     | (a) | is signed and dated by a director of the company that becomes a look-through company (the LTC) or other agent with appropriate authority; and |     |
> |     | (b) | is in the form prescribed by the Commissioner; and |     |
> |     | (c) | specifies an income year beginning on or after 1 April 2011 for which it may first operate; and |     |
> |     | (d) | has attached to it notices |     |
> |     |     | (i) | signed and dated by all persons who, on the date of signing the election, own look-through interests in the LTC; and |
> |     |     | (ii) | evidence unanimous agreement of the owners in choosing to apply section HB 1. |

The QC and LAQC regime requires notices of shareholder elections. Under the LTC regime, s HB 13(1)(d)(i) requires all persons who own "look-through interests" in a LTC to make an election. A "look-through interest" is defined as meaning a person's shares in an entity or look-through company (subject to the requirements of that definition). For the same reasons as for the QC and LAQC regimes, the election required under s HB 13(1)(d)(i) must be made by the beneficial owner of the shares. The beneficial owner can satisfy this requirement by personally making the election. However, the legislative requirements will also be satisfied if the election is made by a nominee or bare trustee acting on instructions and on behalf of the beneficial owner under s YB 21.

Therefore, a notice of election for LTC status made by the owner of a look-through interest will be effective if signed by any one of:

*   the beneficial owner of the shares,
*   a person holding shares as a nominee for the beneficial owner of the shares, or
*   a person holding shares as a bare trustee for the beneficial owner of the shares.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| _Example 3:_ | Arthur is the shareholder of a company. He holds the shares in the company as a nominee for Brenda. Brenda is the beneficial owner of the shares. Brenda instructs Arthur to sign the form to elect LTC status in relation to those shares. Arthur, as Brenda's nominee shareholder, signs a shareholder election form for LTC status. Arthur has acted on behalf of Brenda and as instructed by Brenda. For the purposes of the LTC regime and by the application of s YB 21, Arthur is ignored. Brenda, the beneficial owner of the shares, is treated as having made the election for LTC status. |

Residential investment property or properties in Australia owned by New Zealand resident - NRWT treatment of interest paid to Australian financial institution

QB 11/01 discusses whether NZ residents borrowing money from Australian institutions to purchase Australian investment properties are liable for NRWT on interest.

**Income Tax Act 2007, s YD 4(11)(b)(i) - Interest deemed to be derived from New Zealand**

**Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 2010, Schedule, Article 11 - Taxation of interest**

All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

The Commissioner has been asked to clarify Inland Revenue's position on whether New Zealand residents who borrow money from Australian financial institutions to purchase residential investment properties in Australia are liable for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on the interest payable. Articles have appeared in the media regarding this issue over recent years, and there has been uncertainty as to how the domestic legislation and the double tax agreement ("DTA") with Australia apply.

This item considers the same issues as QB 09/05, which is on the same topic. QB 09/05 is based on Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 1995. A new DTA between New Zealand and Australia came into force on 19 March 2010 and commenced in New Zealand from 1 May 2010 for withholding taxes. This 'Question We've Been Asked' is substantially the same as QB 09/05 but has been updated for the new DTA and related domestic legislative amendments.

### Question

1.  If you own one or more residential investment properties in Australia and you have borrowed money from an Australian financial institution to purchase the property or properties, do you have to pay NRWT on the interest paid to the Australian financial institution?
  
3.  Different fact situations could arise in respect of this question. This item considers the two most common situations, where:
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | (a) | you manage the property or properties yourself (situation A); and |
    | (b) | a property manager in Australia manages the property or properties for you (situation B). |
    

### Answer

*   **Australian financial institution has a fixed establishment in New Zealand**

3.  In every case, you will need to consider your own particular fact situation. However, in general terms the following applies.
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | (1) | If the Australian financial institution to which you pay interest has a branch in New Zealand, in both situations A and B the NRWT rules **will not** apply to the interest because the financial institution has a fixed establishment in New Zealand. |
    | It is important to note that some Australian financial institutions that operate in New Zealand do so through subsidiaries rather than through branches. The NRWT rules **will apply** if the Australian financial institution from which you borrowed money in Australia operates in New Zealand only through a subsidiary, ie, it does not also have a branch in New Zealand. If you borrow from a New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian financial institution no NRWT issues will arise, however, because the interest is not paid to a non-resident. If you wish to check which financial institutions operate as branches in New Zealand go to the Reserve Bank website ([www.rbnz.govt.nz](http://www.rbnz.govt.nz)<br>). \[Link updated 20 September 2016: [www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation-and-supervision/banks/register](http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation-and-supervision/banks/register)<br>\] |
    | (2) | If the Australian financial institution to which you pay interest does not have a branch in New Zealand, the outcomes between situations A and B may differ. |
    

*   **Australian financial institution does not have a fixed establishment in New Zealand**

*   _Situation A_

4.  Under situation A, if you manage the property or properties in Australia from New Zealand, you will not have a fixed establishment or a permanent establishment in Australia. You **will** have to pay NRWT on the interest whether or not you are in the business of leasing.

*   _Situation B_

5.  Under situation B, if you have more than one residential investment property in Australia, you may have a fixed establishment in Australia. If you do have a fixed establishment in Australia, then you **will not** have to pay NRWT on the interest.
  
7.  If you do not have a fixed establishment in Australia and you employ a property manager who:
    
    *   works as a property manager only for you; and
    *   has and habitually exercises the authority to substantially negotiate or conclude contracts on your behalf
    
    then under the DTA you **will not** have to pay NRWT on the interest because the property manager will be a dependent agent and you will be deemed to have a permanent establishment in Australia. As you borrowed the funds to purchase the property or properties, there is sufficient connection between the permanent establishment and the indebtedness and the DTA will apply.
  
9.  If the property manager acts for you in the ordinary course of their business and is able to act independently of you, it is likely the property manager will be an independent agent and you will have to pay NRWT on the interest because you will not have a permanent establishment in Australia.
  
11.  The following flowchart sets out the questions that need to be answered to determine NRWT liability.

    **
  
13.  For further information on the payment of NRWT, see the two Inland Revenue guides _Non-resident withholding tax payer's guide_ (IR291) and _Non-resident withholding tax reconciliation guide_ (IR67SG).

*   **Transitional residents**

10.  If you have become a New Zealand resident since 1 April 2006 and were non-resident here for a continuous period of at least ten years prior to becoming resident, you may qualify as a "transitional resident" under s HR 8.
  
12.  If you qualify as a transitional resident and you pay interest in relation to money borrowed when you were not a New Zealand resident, the amount of NRWT you need to withhold is zero.
  
14.  If you meet the requirements, you become a transitional resident at the same time as you become, or are treated as becoming, tax resident in New Zealand. You will become resident in New Zealand if you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or when you are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period (you will be treated as resident in New Zealand from the first day of the 183 days). Generally speaking, the period of transitional residence lasts for four years from the end of the month when the requirements for being a resident are first met (being the earlier of the date from which you first have a permanent place of abode, or the date when you were personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days). After that four-year period, you must withhold NRWT at the generally applicable rate (currently 10%).
  
16.  You may make an irrevocable election not to be a transitional resident (see s HR 8(4)).

*   **Penalties and interest**

14.  As the person who pays the interest to the Australian financial institution, you are required to withhold the NRWT and pay it to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. If you fail to do so, use of money interest, late payment penalties and/or shortfall penalties ranging from 20% to 150% could be imposed on you.
  
16.  For more information on these penalties, see the Inland Revenue guides _Late payment and late filing penalties_ (IR741) and _Taxpayer obligations, interest and penalties_ (IR240).

*   **Approved issuer levy**

16.  If you are liable to pay NRWT, for the future you could request approval from Inland Revenue to become an approved issuer and have the loan treated as a registered security. You then pay the approved issuer levy of 2% instead of withholding NRWT at 10%.
  
18.  You will be eligible to elect to pay AIL if you borrow, have borrowed, or will borrow money in relation to a security. You must notify the Commissioner if you wish to have approved issuer status. Approved issuer status cannot be backdated. You must then register all the securities to which AIL is to apply. The Commissioner may revoke your approved issuer status if you have been responsible for serious default or neglect in complying with your obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts in the two year period leading up to the revocation of approved issuer status.
  
20.  For further information, see the Inland Revenue guide _Approved issuer levy: A guide for payers_ (IR395).

### Analysis

19.  The NRWT rules apply to gross income deemed to be derived from New Zealand that consists of interest (see s RF 2(1)).
  
21.  Section YD 4(11)(b)(i) provides that interest derived from money lent outside New Zealand to a New Zealand resident is derived from New Zealand unless the resident borrows the money for a business carried on through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand.
  
23.  However, in three instances NRWT will not be payable. The first two are provided by the domestic legislation. Section RF 2(1) provides that if the Australian financial institution to which the interest is paid operates through a fixed establishment (ie, a branch) in New Zealand, the NRWT rules do not apply. Section YD 4(11)(b)(i) provides a further exception that applies if the resident borrows the money for a business carried on through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand. The third instance where NRWT will not be payable is if relief is provided by the DTA. The DTA provides that no NRWT will be payable if the New Zealand resident carries on a business through a permanent establishment in Australia and the debt is effectively connected to that permanent establishment.
  
25.  Section YD 4(11)(b)(i) applies to you even if you were not a New Zealand resident when you borrowed the money in respect of which you now pay interest from New Zealand. There is an exception to this general rule though, which is that if you borrowed the money for a business carried on through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand, then the interest is not considered to be sourced in New Zealand. In those circumstances, there is an economic link with the other country through the use of the money in the business carried on there. This is consistent with international treaty practice and is reflected in the DTA provisions discussed in this item.
  
27.  The transitional residents provisions (referred to above) mitigate the effect of the requirement for new New Zealand residents to withhold NRWT in relation to interest paid on money borrowed prior to gaining residency. The provisions were one of the legislative amendments that resulted from the Government Discussion Document _Reducing Tax Barriers to International Recruitment to New Zealand_ published in November 2003.

*   **Terminology**

24.  The term "fixed establishment" is used in New Zealand's domestic legislation and is defined in s YA 1.
  
26.  The term "permanent establishment" is defined in art 5 of the DTA.
  
28.  The two terms are used to describe types of business arrangements and can affect a person's tax position, including whether or not the interest paid to an Australian financial institution is subject to the NRWT rules in New Zealand.
  
30.  A fixed establishment and a permanent establishment have similar features but a fixed establishment requires a _substantial_ business to be carried on.

*   **Australian financial institution has a branch in New Zealand - situations A and B**

28.  If the Australian financial institution to which the interest is paid operates through a fixed establishment (ie, a branch) in New Zealand, the NRWT rules will not apply to the interest (see s RF 2(1)).

*   **Australian financial institution has no branch in New Zealand - situation A**

29.  In terms of the definitions of "fixed establishment" and "permanent establishment", a property or properties managed by a New Zealand resident ("the New Zealand owner") from New Zealand cannot constitute a "fixed place of business". The property (ie, an apartment or house) is a fixed place but the business of leasing is not carried on through or in that place. All the management of the business takes place in New Zealand. The property itself is not where the business is carried on, rather it is the _subject_ of the business.
  
31.  If the lessee carries on a business from the rental property, then the property is the lessee's fixed place of business, not the lessor's. The property is not available to the lessor (the New Zealand owner) throughout the period of the lease, so cannot constitute a fixed establishment or a permanent establishment of the New Zealand owner. The business of leasing is carried on elsewhere; that is, on the facts described above, in New Zealand. This means the exception to NRWT provided by the domestic legislation does not apply.
  
33.  If the New Zealand owner makes regular trips to Australia to carry out management activities in respect of the residential investment property but carries out those activities from a motel or hotel, there is no fixed place of business - a rented room in such circumstances lacks the required permanence to be a "fixed" place of business. In addition, the business of leasing is not limited to the period when the New Zealand owner is operating in Australia, the New Zealand owner is still required to deal with management issues from New Zealand from time to time.

*   **Australian financial institution has no branch in New Zealand - situation B**

*   _Fixed establishment_

32.  If a fixed establishment exists, s YD 4(11)(b)(i) will not apply and the interest will not be deemed to be derived from New Zealand. Therefore, the New Zealand owner **will not** be liable for NRWT on interest paid.
  
34.  Unlike the permanent establishment definition in the DTA (discussed below), the definition of "fixed establishment" does not include any provisions relating to the use of dependent or independent agents. However, general principles of agency can still be applied. A fixed establishment will be found to exist only if there is a fixed place of business in Australia through which a substantial business is carried on. The residential property is not itself a fixed place in which the business is carried on; rather it is the _subject_ of the business.
  
36.  If the property manager is working for the New Zealand owner as their agent and has a fixed place in Australia from where that activity takes place, it could be considered that the business of leasing is carried on through that place and that the New Zealand owner has a fixed establishment in Australia.
  
38.  However, if the New Zealand owner owns only one property that a property manager manages in Australia, a fixed establishment will generally not exist, as the leasing of one property will generally not amount to a "substantial business". However, this will depend on the nature of the single property: for example, if the single property is an apartment block, the leasing of it may be a substantial business.
  
40.  If the New Zealand owner owns more than one property, whether there is a substantial business (and therefore a fixed establishment) will depend on the particular facts. It is more likely that there will be a substantial business of renting (and hence a fixed establishment) where several properties are rented out.
  
42.  While the decided cases (such as _American Leaf Blending Co Sdn Bhd v Director-General of Inland Revenue_ \[1978\] 3 All ER 1185 (PC) and _L D Nathan Group Properties Ltd v CIR_ (1980) 4 NZTC 61,602) do indicate that a business may be more readily found to exist where a rental property or properties is owned by a company (rather than an individual), this will still depend upon the particular circumstances of the case. In addition, for there to be a fixed establishment any such business must be a _substantial_ business.

*   _Permanent establishment_

38.  If the property manager is a "dependent agent" (see art 5(8) of the DTA), a permanent establishment will exist and NRWT **will not** be payable by the New Zealand owner provided the indebtedness is attributable to the permanent establishment and the interest is deductible in determining the profits of the permanent establishment (see art 11(7) of the DTA).
  
40.  A dependent agent of the New Zealand owner is one who is acting solely for the New Zealand owner and who has and habitually exercises the authority to substantially negotiate or conclude contracts on the New Zealand owner's behalf. Such an agency makes it likely that the New Zealand owner will be deemed to have a permanent establishment under the DTA.
  
42.  If a permanent establishment exists, the DTA requires that there be a connection between the permanent establishment and the indebtedness in respect of which the New Zealand owner pays interest. As the New Zealand owner borrowed the funds to purchase the property or properties, and the property manager works for the New Zealand owner in respect of that property, a sufficient connection exists between the permanent establishment and the indebtedness, so the DTA will apply.
  
44.  However, if the property manager is acting in the ordinary course of their own business of managing properties and is independent of the New Zealand owner legally and economically, the New Zealand owner will likely not be deemed to have a permanent establishment. This is so because the property manager will be an independent agent and any interest **will** be subject to NRWT.
  
46.  If the property manager acts solely for the New Zealand owner in respect of the rental property but also owns another business _unrelated_ to the property management business, the manager could still be considered a dependent agent of the New Zealand owner. The DTA expressly excludes an agent who acts for the New Zealand owner in the _ordinary course_ of the agent's own property management business from being a dependent agent. However, a person who operates a business of their own (which is not related to property management) and who acts for the New Zealand owner _outside_ the ordinary course of that business is able to be considered a dependent agent of the New Zealand owner, if such person has and habitually exercises the authority to substantially negotiate or conclude contracts on behalf of the New Zealand owner.
  
48.  Note also that the New Zealand owner is not deemed to have a permanent establishment in Australia under art 5(4)(c) of the DTA. A residential property does not constitute substantial equipment within the meaning of this provision.

### Examples

*   **Example 1**

44.  Mr Acorn, a New Zealand resident, purchases a residential property on the Gold Coast in Australia as an investment. To finance the purchase, Mr Acorn takes out a loan with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia that is secured by a mortgage over the residential property.
  
46.  The Commonwealth Bank of Australia operates in New Zealand through a branch. Consequently, the bank is considered to have a fixed establishment in New Zealand and the NRWT rules will not apply to require Mr Acorn to deduct a withholding payment from the interest paid on the loan to the bank.

*   **Example 2**

46.  Mr Smith, a New Zealand resident, purchases a residential property on the Gold Coast in Australia as an investment. To finance the purchase, Mr Smith takes out a loan with the National Australia Bank that is secured by a mortgage over the residential property.
  
48.  Mr Smith manages the residential property from his home in New Zealand and organises for maintenance work to be carried out as necessary when advised by his tenants. He does not engage the services of any person to act on his behalf in Australia in relation to the property.
  
50.  National Australia Bank does not operate through a branch in New Zealand, so does not have a fixed establishment here. Mr Smith will have to deduct NRWT from the interest payments that he makes to the bank and pay them to Inland Revenue.
  
52.  Mr Smith could request Inland Revenue's approval to become an approved issuer and have his mortgage accepted as a registered security. If accepted, Mr Smith would pay a 2% levy in place of NRWT at 10% from the date of acceptance.

*   **Example 3**

50.  Ms Worth, a New Zealand resident, purchases 10 apartments in a high-rise apartment tower on the Gold Coast in Australia. She finances the purchases by borrowing funds from National Australia Bank. The loans are secured by mortgages over each of the properties.
  
52.  Ms Worth does not have time to manage the properties herself from New Zealand, so she engages an acquaintance, Mr Donald, who lives on the Gold Coast, to manage them on her behalf. Mr Donald is retired and undertakes this management role only for Ms Worth. She authorises him to enter into contracts (ie, tenancy agreements and maintenance contracts) on her behalf, and he does so regularly.
  
54.  National Australia Bank does not operate through a branch in New Zealand, so does not have a fixed establishment here. However, because Mr Donald has and habitually exercises the authority to substantially negotiate or conclude contracts on behalf of Ms Worth and works as a property manager only for her, Mr Donald will be considered a dependent agent. Therefore, Ms Worth will have a permanent establishment in Australia and will not have to deduct NRWT from the interest payments made to National Australia Bank.

*   **Example 4**

53.  Mrs King, a New Zealand resident, purchases two apartments in a high-rise apartment tower on the Sunshine Coast in Australia. She finances the purchases by borrowing funds from National Australia Bank. The loans are secured by mortgages over each of the properties.
  
55.  Mrs King does not have time to manage the properties herself from New Zealand so she engages a professional property manager, Mr James, to manage the properties on her behalf. Mr James runs his own property management business on the Sunshine Coast, catering to non-resident owners of property in his area. Mrs King authorises Mr James to enter into contracts (ie, tenancy agreements and maintenance contracts) on her behalf, and Mr James does so regularly.
  
57.  National Australia Bank does not operate through a branch in New Zealand, so does not have a fixed establishment here. Mr James operates his own property management business and acts for Mrs King in the ordinary course of that business. Therefore, Mr James is an independent agent. Mrs King will not have a permanent establishment in Australia. Mrs King will not have a fixed establishment either, because, even if she could be considered to be in business through the activities of her agent, the leasing of two properties does not amount to a substantial business. Mrs King will have to deduct NRWT from the interest paid to the bank and pay the NRWT to Inland Revenue.

### Other Countries

56.  This item, and the underlying analysis, may also apply to the NRWT liability of New Zealand residents who own investment properties in countries other than Australia, where the purchase of such properties has been financed by a loan from a financial institution in that country. The general principles relating to New Zealand's domestic legislation will apply. However, it is important to note that the outcome may differ because the relevant provisions of New Zealand's double tax agreement with that country may not be the same as those considered in this item.

Deductibility of expenditure incurred by bloodstock breeders in respect of horses that they race
================================================================================================

QB 11/02 clarifies the deductibility of expenditure incurred by bloodstock breeders for horses they race or prepare for racing as part of their breeding business.

**Section DW 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007**

### Question

We have been asked to clarify the deductibility of expenditure incurred by bloodstock breeders in respect of horses that they race, or prepare for racing, as part of their breeding business.

### Answer

A person who is in the business of breeding bloodstock and races horses as part of that business (for example, to enhance the value of those horses, or the stud), can claim a deduction for non-race related ("holding") costs, but none of the costs more directly associated with racing these horses.

### Analysis

Under section DW 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the Act") a person is denied a deduction for expenditure or loss they incur -

*   on the racing of bloodstock; or
*   in relation to the racing of bloodstock.

Viewed in isolation, the effect of this subsection would mean that any costs incurred in racing a horse would not be deductible. This would include not only those costs directly attributable to racing the horse, but also those costs that would be incurred irrespective of whether the horse was being raced.

A limited exception to this general rule is provided by section DW 2(2) of the Act. This applies when a horse is being prepared for both racing and sale; for instance, the horse is being prepared for a "ready to race" sale. In this circumstance, if a breeder incurs expenditure that is preparatory to the racing and sale of the horse, that expenditure will be deductible so long as the breeder does not actually go on to race the horse for stake money.

Further, where a person is in the business of breeding bloodstock, any expenditure incurred in carrying on that business will be deductible in terms of the general deductibility provisions of subpart DA of the Act. Where horses are raced by a breeder as part of the breeding business a deduction will be permitted in respect of those costs that would ordinarily be incurred by the breeder, irrespective of the fact that the horses are being raced. Examples of these "holding costs" are insurance, non-race feed and veterinary costs, and agistment. However, any costs more directly related to the racing of these horses will not be deductible by virtue of section DW 2(1) of the Act. Examples of these "direct" racing costs are the racing proportion of the trainer's account, track fees, nomination and acceptance fees, riding/driving fees, race day transportation, race feed and veterinary costs.

Invoices received from trainers may contain both "holding" and "direct racing costs". The proportion of the trainer's account that will be deductible in these circumstances will be dependant on the particular circumstances of the case and in particular, whether there is a factual basis for the apportionment of the expenses. Unless there is a factual basis for apportionment, no deduction will be able to be claimed by the breeder.

This item corrects _Public Information Bulletin_ No.162, Part III - Bloodstock, April 1987 ("the PIB"). To the extent that the PIB could imply that feeding, maintenance and agistment costs are deductible even when the horse is not being raced as part of the breeder's breeding business, but as part of the breeder's racing activities (as a hobby for instance), it is incorrect.

Income tax - look through companies and interest deductibility
==============================================================

QB 11/03 considers interest deductibility where a loss-attributing qualifying company becomes a look-through company.

### Income tax - Look-through companies and interest deductibility

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

This QWBA considers ss DB 6 and HB 1.

### Question

1.  We have been asked whether interest will still be deductible where a loss-attributing qualifying company (LAQC) becomes a look-through company (LTC) if:
    *   a person had previously sold their family home to a LAQC as a rental asset, to be rented to a third party on an arm’s length basis;
    *   the person owned 100% of the shares in the LAQC;
    *   the sale was at market value;
    *   the LAQC borrowed from a bank to fund the purchase;
    *   the person then used the funds raised from the sale to purchase a new family home;
    *   the LAQC becomes a LTC.

### Answer

2.  If all that has changed is that the LAQC has become a LTC, then interest deductions previously allowed will continue to be allowed, subject to the limitations on deductions in ss HB 11 and HB 12 that apply to LTCs.
3.  The position would be the same where a person sells their family home at market value directly to a LTC and the LTC holds it as a rental asset and rents it to a third party on an arm’s length basis. (See paragraph 23 and example 2 of this item.)

### Explanation

#### Background

4.  The Commissioner has received inquiries from taxpayers asking whether previously allowed interest deductions made by a LAQC will continue to be allowed where a LAQC becomes a LTC./li>
5.  The issue has arisen because some taxpayers have interpreted “look-through” to mean that you simply ignore all transactions between the LTC and the owner of an effective look-through interest in the LTC (“the owner”). This would mean that you look through the LTC (essentially ignoring it and disregarding the use to which the LTC put the borrowed funds) to look at the owner’s use of the funds. On the facts outlined in the question above, the owner would be considered to have used the funds to acquire a private asset (the new family home), not for deriving assessable income. The result of this interpretation is that the test for interest deductibility would not be satisfied.
6.  The Commissioner considers the above interpretation to be incorrect. The Commissioner’s view is that the owner’s use of the funds received on the sale of the rental asset to the LAQC is not relevant to the issue of interest deductibility on the borrowing by the LAQC (and later the LTC). The correct interpretation is outlined below.

### Discussion

#### Interest deductibility

7.  Usually a company would be entitled to an automatic interest deduction under s DB 7. However, neither LAQCs nor LTCs qualify for the deduction under s DB 7.
8.  A deduction for interest incurred may be made under s DB 6. Section DB 6 allows a deduction for interest incurred provided the general permission in s DA 1 is satisfied. Section DA 1 allows a deduction for interest incurred by a taxpayer in deriving their assessable income or incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving their assessable income.
9.  The Commissioner’s view is that the interest deductibility test is satisfied where a sufficient connection exists between the interest incurred and the assessable income. Where borrowed funds are used to acquire an income-earning asset (such as a rental property) and the property continues to be used as an income-earning asset, then that would establish a sufficient connection.
10.  In terms of the LTC regime, s HB 11 operates to limit the deductions that a person with an effective look-through interest can deduct in an income year. This is known as the loss limitation rule and applies to all deductions, including interest. Section HB 12 applies to allow a person with an effective look-through interest to carry forward any limited deductions into future years, subject to the loss limitation rule in s HB 11. Broadly speaking, the loss limitation rule ensures an owner can offset losses only to the extent these reflect their economic losses.

#### _Look-through companies and tax transparency_

11.  LTCs are generally transparent for income tax purposes. Tax transparency is achieved by s HB 1(4). The effect of s HB 1(4) is that the LTC’s income, expenses, tax credits, gains and losses are passed on to its owners in proportion to their effective look-through interest. Some taxpayers have expressed concern that the effect of these provisions is that interest, in the circumstances set out in the question, will be treated as private and non-deductible. The Commissioner does not agree with this interpretation.
12.  Section HB 1(1) states:  
    **_HB 1 Look-through companies are transparent_**  
    _When this section applies_
    1.  This section applies for the purposes of this Act, other than the PAYE rules, the FBT rules, the NRWT rules, the RWT rules, the ESCT rules, and the RSCT rules, for a person in their capacity of owner of an effective look-through interest for a look-through company (the LTC), for an income year, if––
        1.  for the LTC, an LTC election described in section HB 13(1) and (2) has been received by the Commissioner under section HB 13(3) and (4) for the income year; and
        2.  the LTC meets the requirements in the definition of “look-through company” at all times in the income year; and
        3.  the election has not been revoked for the income year by an owner of a look-through interest for the LTC by notice received by the Commissioner before the start of the income year

13.  Section HB 1(4) states:  
    _**Look-through for effective look-through interest**_
    4.  For a person, unless the context requires otherwise,—
        1.  the person is treated as carrying on an activity carried on by the LTC, and having a status, intention, and purpose of the LTC, and the LTC is treated as not carrying on the activity or having the status, intention, or purpose:
        2.  the person is treated as holding property that the LTC holds, in proportion to the person’s effective look-through interest, and the LTC is treated as not holding the property:
        3.  the person is treated as being party to an arrangement to which the LTC is a party, in proportion to the person’s effective look-through interest, and the LTC is treated as not being a party to the arrangement:
        4.  the person is treated as doing a thing and being entitled to a thing that the LTC does or is entitled to, in proportion to the person’s effective look-through interest, and the LTC is treated as not doing the thing or being entitled to the thing.

14.  Section HB 1(4) attributes the actions of the LTC to its owners. This means that the owners are treated as carrying on the activities of the LTC; having the same status, intention and purpose as the LTC; holding property that the LTC holds; being party to any transactions entered into by the LTC; and doing a thing that the LTC does. The LTC is treated as not doing those things or having that status, intention or purpose.
15.  The Commissioner is of the view that the use to which the LTC puts the borrowed funds is “a thing” under s HB 1(4)(d).
16.  The effect of s HB 1(4) is to treat the LTC’s actions as being those of the owner for income tax purposes. Section HB 1(4) does not work in reverse (ie, the LTC regime does not operate to substitute the owner’s actions for those of the LTC). Legislative support for this position can be found in s HB 1(1), which refers to “a person in their capacity of owner of an effective look-through interest”. This implies that an owner can have more than one capacity. It is the use of the borrowed funds by the LTC, attributed under s HB 1(4)(d) to the person (in their capacity as owner) that is relevant to the issue of interest deductibility, not the use of the funds by the person in their personal capacity.

#### _Application to the question_

17.  The LAQC borrowed funds to acquire the rental property. The LAQC used this property to derive assessable income. Interest incurred on the borrowed funds was deductible for income tax purposes.
18.  When the LAQC becomes a LTC, interest previously deductible will remain so. The rental property becomes an income-earning asset of the LTC. The LTC’s use of the borrowed funds is the same as that of the LAQC – to fund an income-earning asset. It is important to remember that by becoming a LTC the company itself does not change; it remains the same company as before, but it is now taxed differently.
19.  Section HB 1(4) then operates to treat the LTC’s actions as being those of the owner, in that person’s capacity as owner of the effective look-through interest. The provision does not apply to treat the owner’s use of the funds in their personal capacity (in this case, to purchase a new family home) as the LTC’s use.
20.  Therefore, the interest on the borrowed funds is incurred by the LTC in funding an income-earning asset. The person, in their capacity as owner of an effective look-through interest, is treated as having incurred the interest for the same use. Accordingly, the interest deductibility test will be satisfied and the interest will be deductible under s DB 6, subject to the limitations in ss HB 11 and HB 12
21.  The deductibility of interest by the LTC is determined by considering the use made by the LTC of the borrowed funds. The fact the person sold the family home and received a non-taxable amount does not result in the denial of deductibility. The extra amount over and above what the person originally bought the property for reflects an increase in the market value of the property.
22.  This interpretation would also apply where a qualifying company becomes a LTC in the same circumstances.
23.  Further, the position would be the same where a person sells their family home at market value directly to a LTC, which holds it as a rental asset and rents it to a third party on an arm’s length basis.
24.  This answer applies to the facts set out above. The Commissioner is satisfied that in these circumstances, interest would be deductible. If the facts were to vary materially from those in the question, then the Commissioner may need to consider the matter further and a different outcome might apply.

### Examples

#### Example 1

25.  The facts of example 1 are as follows:
    *   In June 2003, Jamie bought his house, Ivy Cottage, for $400,000 with a loan from the bank for $350,000. The loan was secured by a mortgage over Ivy Cottage. The remainder of the purchase price was funded from his savings.
    *   In May 2009, Jamie decided to rent Ivy Cottage and purchase a new family home, Rose Cottage.
    *   After taking advice, Jamie sold Ivy Cottage at its fair market value of $500,000 to a LAQC for use as a rental property. Jamie owned 100% of the shares in the LAQC.
    *   The bank lent the LAQC $450,000, partially secured by a mortgage over Ivy Cottage. The LAQC contributed the remaining amount of $50,000 from its own funds. Jamie also provided a personal guarantee as further security for the loan.
    *   Jamie repaid the balance of the $350,000 mortgage to the bank from the proceeds of the sale of Ivy Cottage to the LAQC. Jamie then borrowed a further $250,000 from the bank to purchase Rose Cottage.
    *   Jamie is now living in his new private residence, Rose Cottage. The LAQC owns Ivy Cottage, and it is being used as a rental property, rented to a third party on an arm’s length basis, to derive assessable income.
    *   In April 2012, the LAQC becomes a LTC. Is the interest that the LTC pays to the bank deductible for tax purposes?
26.  Interest that was previously deductible when Ivy Cottage was owned by the LAQC will remain deductible after the LAQC becomes a LTC, subject to ss HB 11 and HB 12.
27.  The LAQC borrowed the funds to acquire Ivy Cottage as a rental property. When the LAQC becomes a LTC the use of the funds does not change. The only thing that changes is how the company is taxed.
28.  Under the LTC provisions, Jamie, in his capacity as owner of an effective look-through interest, is treated as doing a thing that the LTC does. The LTC continues to use the amounts borrowed to fund Ivy Cottage as a rental asset to derive assessable income. Section HB 1(4)(d) treats Jamie as using the funds in the same way. As a result, interest incurred by the LTC on the borrowed funds is deductible.
29.  It is irrelevant that Jamie used some of the funds that the LAQC paid him on the sale of Ivy Cottage to purchase his private residence, Rose Cottage.
30.  The fact the market value price the LAQC paid for Ivy Cottage was higher than the market value price Jamie paid when he first bought the property does not make a difference to the question of interest deductibility.

#### Example 2

31.  Example 2 concerns the situation where a person sells their family home directly to a LTC.
32.  The facts in example 2 are as follows:
    *   In March 2002, Anne purchased her family home, Seaview Lodge, for $300,000. The bank loaned Anne $200,000, secured by a mortgage over Seaview Lodge, and she funded the remainder of the purchase price from her savings.
    *   In August 2011, Anne decided to sell Seaview Lodge directly to a LTC at its fair market value of $400,000 for use as a rental property.
    *   Anne is the 100% owner of all the shares in the LTC.
    *   Anne purchases a new family home, Mountain Lodge.
    *   The bank lends the LTC $350,000 to fund the purchase secured by a mortgage over Seaview Lodge. The remaining purchase price is funded from the LTC’s funds.
    *   Anne repays the balance of the $200,000 mortgage to the bank and borrows a further $300,000 to purchase Mountain Lodge.
    *   Anne now lives at Mountain Lodge, and the LTC owns Seaview Lodge. Seaview Lodge is being used as a rental property and is rented to a third party on an arm’s length basis. Is the interest the LTC pays to the bank deductible for tax purposes?
33.  The fact Anne sold Seaview Lodge directly to the LTC does not affect interest deductibility. The interest incurred by the LTC is deductible, for the same reasons as given in example 1. The LTC has borrowed the funds to acquire a rental property. Anne, in her capacity as owner of an effective look-through interest, is treated as having incurred the interest for the same use. The use to which Anne puts the sales proceeds does not affect the connection with the assessable income. The LTC’s actions are attributed to Anne and not the other way around.

Income tax - deductibility of expenditure on replacing and extending an inlet race to a dairy shed
==================================================================================================

QB 12/01 set out the CIR's sets out the view on the deductibility of expenditure on the construction of an inlet race to a dairy shed.

### Income tax - deductibility of expenditure on replacing and extending an inlet race to a dairy shed

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

This QWBA applies in respect of s DO 4 and Sch 20.

This item updates and replaces the item "Inlet Race to Milking Shed, Renewed and Extended" published in the _Public Information Bulletin_ No 22, p 9 (May 1965). The current relevance of this information was identified during an ongoing review of content published in _Public Information Bulletins_ and _Tax Information Bulletins_ before 1996. For more information about the review, please see "Review of Public Information Bulletins" in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011).

### Question

1.  An inlet race that connects a stock race to a dairy shed complex is inadequate and in very poor condition. The dairy farmer is replacing and extending the old inlet race in concrete. How is the expenditure on replacing and extending the inlet race treated for income tax purposes?

### Answer

2.  The cost of constructing the new inlet race is a capital expense that can be amortised on a diminished value basis at 6% under s DO 4 and Sch 20, Part A, Item 4 as "construction of access roads or tracks to or on the land".
3.  The inlet race to the dairy shed yard is a separate item to the dairy shed complex itself. It is physically separate. In addition, it performs a separate function in that the race is a form of road or path used for the herd to walk to and from the dairy shed complex, ending at the entrance to the dairy shed holding yard. The dairy shed complex itself, including the yard, is the actual setting for milking. For further information on this point please see Interpretation Statement IS0025 "Dairy farming – Deductibility of certain expenditure" published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000) at p 10.
4.  There is no question that this is, in the circumstances, capital expenditure and not repairs and maintenance.

### Explanation

5.  A stock race is the track or path along which the cows walk from the paddocks to the dairy shed (and vice versa), ending at the entrance to the dairy shed holding yard. This race may run for some considerable distance through the farm and along farm road frontages. It is designed to confine the herd during its daily treks to and from the dairy shed, and prevent undue damage to pastures. A stock race may be constructed of a variety of materials such as shingle, or compacted limestone or pumice rock. Sometimes a stock race will end in an inlet race, which connects the stock race to the dairy shed complex. An inlet race generally requires a more hard-wearing surface because of frequent and intensive use. Sometimes an inlet race may have a concrete surface. For further discussion about stock races see IS0025 (at p 18-19).
6.  Several provisions are relevant in determining whether farm expenditure is deductible. If the expenditure is revenue in nature it is deductible under the general permission (s DA 1). Expenditure that is capital in nature cannot be deducted under the general permission because of the capital limitation (s DA 2(1)). Various factors are relevant in determining whether expenditure is capital in nature: _BP Australia Ltd v FCT_ \[1965\] 3 All ER 209; _CIR v Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australasia) Ltd_ (1992) 14 NZTC 9,101 (CA); _Christchurch Press Company Ltd v CIR_ (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206; _CIR v Wattie_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991 (PC); and _CIR v Birkdale Service Station Ltd & Ors_ (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981 (CA). It is considered in general:  
    *   The cost of work done to an asset to make good ordinary wear and tear and restore it to its former condition will usually be deductible.
    *   Where the work done replaces or renews the whole, or substantially the whole, asset or changes the character of the asset the cost of that work will be capital expenditure.Therefore, if a taxpayer incurs expenditure on maintaining or repairing an inlet race the expenditure will be deductible under s DA 1.
7.  In this situation, however, the farmer incurs expenditure on replacing and extending the inlet race in concrete. This expenditure is capital in nature and is not deductible under the general permission. Under s DO 4 (Improvements to farmland) a person carrying on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand is allowed a deduction for certain types of expenditure listed in Part A of Sch 20. Such expenditure will be deductible where it meets the requirements of s DO 4. In particular, such expenditure will be deductible when it is incurred in developing land and is of benefit to the business in the income year in which the person is allowed the deduction. Section DO 4 overrides the capital limitation: s DO 4(7).
8.  Section DO 4 allows a certain percentage of the expenditure to be deducted on a diminished value basis. The particular percentage for the item of expenditure is specified in Sch 20, Part A. Schedule 20, Part A (Farming) lists at Item 4 the "construction of access roads or tracks to or on the land". The percentage of diminished value of improvement allowed as a deduction for the construction of access roads or tracks to or on the land is 6%. Section DO 4 therefore does not allow a full deduction of the cost of constructing access roads or tracks to or on the land in the year in which it is incurred, but as specified in Sch 20, Part A, Item 4, a deduction of 6% of the diminished value is available in each year.
9.  This treatment of the expenditure on replacing and extending the inlet race can be contrasted with the treatment that applied at the time the original PIB item was published. At that time, s 119D of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 permitted a deduction for expenditure on the construction of access roads or tracks to or on the land in the year incurred. This section has been superseded by several legislative amendments. As explained above, under current legislation, a deduction is now allowed for expenditure incurred in relation to construction of access roads and tracks on farms on an amortised basis.

Income tax - Treatment of quad bikes for depreciation purposes
==============================================================

QB 12/02 considers how quad bikes are treated for depreciation purposes and concludes that quad bikes be treated as 'motor vehicles' are designed for passengers.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

This QWBA applies in respect of section EE 29

### Question

1.  As quad bikes are not specifically listed in the Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates, we have been asked to clarify how they are to be treated for depreciation purposes.

### Answer

2.  For the purposes of the depreciation regime, quad bikes are treated as "motor vehicles" that are designed mainly to carry persons. This being so, the rate of depreciation applicable to them is set by section EE 29(3). This section prescribes depreciation rates of 30% DV or 21% SL.

### Explanation

3.  A quad bike is similar in nature and size to a motor cycle, but with four wheels. Commercially, they are predominantly used in the agriculture and leisure industries. Although they are able to be registered for road use, quad bikes are generally used "off road".
4.  Economic depreciation rates for the various items of depreciable property are set in accordance with sections EE 26 - 30. In particular, section EE 29(3) sets the depreciation rate for motor vehicles that are designed exclusively or mainly to carry persons. Because of this, determinative of how quad bikes are treated for depreciation purposes is whether a quad bike is a "motor vehicle" and if it is, whether it is designed at least mainly to carry persons.
5.  While section YA 1 contains a definition of motor vehicle, this definition relates only to subpart DE (motor vehicle expenditure) and the FBT rules. Motor vehicle is not defined for the purposes of the depreciation regime. This being so, we need to consider the words ordinary meaning.
6.  The _Concise Oxford Dictionary_ defines a "motor vehicle" as:  
    **_n_**_. a road vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine_.  
      
    This same dictionary defines a "motorcycle" as:  
    **_n_**_. a two-wheeled vehicle that is powered by a motor_  
      
    and "quad bike" as:  
    **_n_**. _a motorcycle with four large tyres, for off road use._  
      
    
7.  The dictionary definition of "motor vehicle" places emphasis on the vehicle being a "road vehicle". While a quad bike is able to be registered for road use, its principal use is as an off road vehicle.
8.  Despite this, most New Zealand motor vehicle legislation potentially includes quad bikes within their definition of "motor vehicle". In particular, because a quad bike is _"...a vehicle drawn or propelled by mechanical power..."_, the Land Transport Act 1998, Motor Vehicle Securities Act 1989, Motor Vehicle Dealers Act 1975, and the Road User Charges Act 1977 would all include a quad bike within their definitions of a motor vehicle.
9.  For legislative purposes, the fact that a quad bike may not be used principally as an on-road vehicle does not appear to be decisive in considering it a "motor vehicle". It is sufficient that it is a vehicle propelled by a motor.
10.  On balance, the Commissioner considers that quad bikes are "motor vehicles" for the purposes of the depreciation regime on the basis that they are vehicles drawn or propelled by mechanical power and may be registered for use on the road.
11.  To come within the ambit of section EE 29(3) not only must a quad bike be a "motor vehicle", it must also be a motor vehicle that "...is designed exclusively or mainly to carry persons..." Most quad bikes are equipped with front and/or rear steel racks that are capable of carrying goods. However the steel racks are not intended to carry anything other than light, low or secured loads and carrying anything further requires the use of a small trailer. Despite this limited capability to carry goods, it cannot be said that a quad bike is designed exclusively to carry persons.
12.  The Labour department publication, _Guidelines for the safe use of quad bikes,_ states that where these vehicles are used on the farm, they can safely be used for inspecting the farm and stock, mustering work, spraying (when used in conjunction with a purpose built spray unit) and maintenance work. All of these uses require only the rider and do not involve the carrying of anything other than very light loads. On this basis it can be said that the carrying of goods is an ancillary purpose, to the quad bikes principle function of carrying the rider, in much the same way as a motor car has a boot to carry light loads. For all of these reasons it is the Commissioner's view that quad bikes are designed mainly to carry persons.
13.  Having reached the conclusion that a quad bike is a "motor vehicle that is designed exclusively or mainly to carry persons", the economic rate of depreciation to be used by taxpayers must be that set by section EE 29(3); 30% DV or 21% SL.
14.  It should be noted that this rate does not apply to quad bikes that are available for hire for a period of 1 month or less. These are depreciated using the rates included in either the _Transportation_ asset category as _Motor vehicles (for transporting people, up to and including 12 seats and used for short-term hire of 1 month or less only)_, or the _Hire equipment (short-term hire of one month or less only)_ asset category as _Motor vehicles (for transporting people, up to and including 12 seats)_. In both cases the quad bike has an estimated useful life of 4 years and is depreciated at the rate of either 50% DV or 40% SL.
15.  It is proposed to add "quad bikes" as a general asset class to the _Leisure_ and the _Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture_ industry categories and the _Transportation_ asset category.

Income tax - deductibility of expenditure on cattle stops
=========================================================

QB 12/03 looks at the deductibility of expenditure incurred on the construction of a cattle stop.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

This question we've been asked applies in respect of s DO 1(1)(f).

The item "Expenses Allowable To Farmers Who Convert To Tanker Collection" was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ No 20, p 11 (March 1965) ("the old PIB item"). This QWBA updates and replaces the parts of the old PIB item that relate to new cattle stops. The current relevance of this information was identified during an ongoing review of content published in _Public Information Bulletins_ and _Tax Information Bulletins_ before 1996. The Commissioner's view on the other parts of the old PIB item that are still relevant are set out in the following items: QB 12/04 - Income tax - deductibility of expenditure on widening or metalling a farm access road or track; Operational Statement 007 - Income tax treatment of certain expenditures on conversion of one farming or agricultural purpose to another; and Interpretation Statement IS0025 - Dairy farming - deductibility of certain expenditure. As a result, the old PIB item is no longer current and should not be relied on. For more information about the review, please see "Review of Public Information Bulletins" in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011).

### Question

1.  A farmer is constructing a new cattle stop as part of a fence where it crosses a farm track. How is the expenditure treated for income tax purposes?

### Answer

2.  Where a cattle stop is constructed in an opening in a fence, the cost of constructing the cattle stop is deductible in the year in which it is incurred. The deduction is available under s DO 1(1)(f) as expenditure incurred on the construction on the land of fences for farming or agricultural purposes (assuming the expenditure was incurred in carrying on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand).

### Explanation

3.  Specific farming deductions are available in subpart DO. Section DO 1 (Enhancements to land, except trees) allows an immediate deduction for the expenditure incurred in constructing fences. Section DO 1 overrides the capital limitation. Section DO 1(1) relevantly provides:  
    *   **DO 1 Enhancements to land, except trees**  
        _Deduction_
        1.  A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure that they incur on the following in carrying on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand:  
            ...
            6.  the construction on the land of fences for farming or agricultural purposes, including buying wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit-proof:

4.  Assuming the expenditure was incurred in the carrying on of a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand, the ability to deduct the expenditure incurred in constructing the cattle stop under s DO 1(1)(f) depends on whether the cattle stop falls within the meaning of "construction on the land of fences" in that section.

### What is a cattle stop?

5.  _The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary_ (Oxford University Press, Australia, 2005) defines the term "cattle grid" (another term for "cattle stop") as follows:  
    *   **cattle grid** (on a road, in an opening in a fence) a set of metal rails fixed on the ground over a shallow trench and so spaced as to allow vehicles to pass over but not cattle, sheep, etc.

6.  This suggests that a cattle stop is an alternative to a gate: it prevents stock from leaving an enclosed area but allows vehicles and people to pass through without the need to open and close a gate. When located in an opening in a fence, both (closed) gates and cattle stops continue the line of barrier provided by a fence.

### What is a "fence"?

7.  _The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ (6th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007) relevantly defines "fence" as follows:  
    *   **fence** noun...3 a railing or barrier constructed of posts of any of various materials connected by wire, planks, etc., used to enclose and prevent entry to and exit from a field, yard, etc.

8.  The dictionary definition of "fence" shows that the ordinary meaning of the word "fence" is an upright structure that is comprised of posts (of any of various materials) connected by wire or wood. The definition also shows that the purpose of a fence is to enclose an area to prevent or control access to and from that enclosed area.

9.  _Halsbury's Laws of England_, (5th ed, 2011) Vol 4, Boundaries, in relation to the rights, duties and liabilities of owners of fences, provides the following definition of fences at \[350\]:  
    *   Although fences are frequently used to mark the situation of boundaries, none the less they are primarily guards against intrusion, or barriers to prevent persons or animals straying out, and therefore in this sense the term includes not only hedges, banks, and walls, but also ditches. But an external party wall forming part of a building and alongside or on the boundary of land is not usually regarded as a fence.

10.  The word "fence" is also defined in other New Zealand Acts. For example, the Fencing Act 1978 provides the following definitions:  
    *   **Fence** means a fence, whether or not continuous or extending along the whole boundary separating the lands of adjoining occupiers; and includes all gates, culverts, and channels that are part of or are incidental to a fence; and also includes any natural or artificial watercourse or live fence, or any ditch or channel or raised ground that serves as a dividing fence.  
        **Adequate fence** means a fence that, as to its nature, condition, and state of repair, is reasonably satisfactory for the purpose that it serves or is intended to serve

11.  While not decided in a tax context, the following cases are useful because they discuss the ordinary meaning of the word "fence".

12.  In the New Zealand Environment Court case of _Collins v Wooff_ \[2010\] NZEnvC 227, the court was prepared to contemplate a wider range of fences than typical post and wire fencing when considering what the phrase "standard rural fencing" meant. This was in the context of a resource consent that contained a fencing covenant requiring the defendant to erect only "standard rural fencing" on his property. However, the defendant's case failed because he could not show that the 8 metre stone wall he had erected next to his driveway performed the function of a fence. The court was not persuaded that the fencing covenant necessarily ruled out stone walls because such structures were commonly used as fences on farms in other parts of New Zealand. However, in this case, the wall was not a "fence" because it did not form a barrier or enclose anything. In the court's view (seemingly based on the dictionary definition) the function of a fence is to form a barrier or enclose an area of land.

13.  Similarly, in _Kontikis v Schreiner_ (1989) 16 NSWLR 706, 68 LGRA 301 the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales considered that for a structure to be a fence, the structure must not merely bound land in fact but must be there functionally or essentially for that purpose. In addition, the court considered that a "fence" may have overlapping purposes or perform other functions.

14.  In _Lahey v Hartford Fire Insurance Co_ \[1968\] OR 727 at \[6\], the Ontario High Court of Justice considered that "fence" referred to "a structure which encloses wholly or partially some piece of property so as to impede ingress and egress. It may be composed of anything so long as it creates a line of obstacle serving this purpose." This was confirmed by Clancy J in the British Columbia Supreme Court in the case of _Barrow v Landry_ \[1998\] BCJ No 1601.

15.  In addition, in _Barrow v Landry_, Clancy J stated at \[21\] to \[22\]:  
    *   To take the narrow view suggested by Mr. Landry would not be of assistance in attaining the objects of the Act. **I see no reason to limit the definition of "fence" as that word is used in the Act to some upright, above ground, structure that encloses an area of property. I conclude that a structure of any kind, provided it serves the purpose of either enclosing property or separating contiguous estates is a fence within the meaning of the _Act_.** I find as well that it is unnecessary, as contended by Mr. Landry, that the fence be constructed for the specific purpose of dividing the property into two distinct portions. It seems to me to be sufficient if the structure serves that purpose. \[Emphasis added\]

16.  In the old case of _Ellis v Arnison_ (1822) 1 B&C 70, 107 ER 27, the court considered whether a ditch was a fence according to an Inclosure Act. The court concluded (at 74):  
    *   Whatever provisions the General Inclosure Act may have very wisely introduced, **yet we cannot say that a ditch may not be in legal construction a fence;** and if it may be, then the jury in this case have found that this ditch was a sufficient fence, in the judgment of the commissioners. The verdict must, therefore, be entered for the defendant on this issue. \[Emphasis added\]

17.  In _Helding v Davis_ \[1911\] VLR 74 the plaintiff and the defendant owned adjoining blocks of land. Mr Davis's land was enclosed on three sides by post and wire fences, and on the fourth side by a gully 8 to 15 feet deep. The gully was impassable to ordinary cattle, except at one place where a track had been cut across it and fenced with barbed wire. The gully formed the boundary between the plaintiff's and defendant's lands. One of Mr Helding's heifers was found in Mr Davis's crop of peas. Mr Davis impounded the heifer and refused to release it to Mr Helding until Mr Helding paid the trespass rate for "trespasses on land enclosed with a substantial fence". Mr Helding argued that the gully was not a substantial fence and therefore a lesser trespass rate was payable (for trespass on land not tillage land enclosed with a substantial fence). Hood J in the Supreme Court of Victoria decided:  
    *   I cannot say that my mind is entirely free from doubt, but I think that the justices were at liberty to say that this was a fence....The authorities referred to by Mr. Ah Ket show that a ditch may be a fence, and the _Inclosure Act_ referred to in _Ellis v Arnison_ speaks of land bounded "by any river or other sufficient fence." I think, therefore, the word fence is used in the Pounds Act 1890 to describe an obstruction to the passage of trespassing cattle of such a kind as in the opinion of the magistrates is a substantial barrier to their ingress.

18.  In _Bass Coast SC v Coastal Estates Pty Ltd_ \[2008\] VCAT 1518, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal cited the above passage in _City of Greater Geelong v Herd_ and stated (at \[57\]):  
    *   The cases referred to included discussion of the purposes of fences including that they are normally to enclose specific areas, or to define them. Such areas may not be limited to the area within a title boundary. **Orchard fences, internal paddock fences, cattleyards, tennis courts and so on may enclose particular areas.** \[Emphasis added\]

19.  These cases show that the purposes of a fence include any (or a combination) of the following:  
    
    *   to enclose an area;
    *   to define boundaries; and
    *   to provide a barrier and prevent ingress or egress.
    
      
    In addition, these cases show that the ordinary meaning of "fence" need not be limited to some upright, above ground, structure, and that any kind of structure may potentially be a fence as long as it forms a barrier or encloses land (_Barrow v Landry; Lahey v Hartford Fire Insurance Co._).

### Does a cattle stop come within the meaning of "construction on the land of fences" under s DO 1(1)(f)?

20.  The purpose of a cattle stop is to form a barrier for stock while still allowing people and vehicles access to the area without the need to open and close a gate. The main function of a cattle stop, when used in conjunction with a fence, is to form a barrier for stock and prevent their escape (even though people and vehicles can still enter and exit the enclosed area). In the context of a farming or agricultural business, a means of entry and exit is generally a necessary part of a fenced enclosure.
21.  Section DO 1 refers to certain costs incurred in carrying on a farming or agricultural business in New Zealand. Section DO 1(1)(f) allows a deduction for expenditure incurred on the construction on the land of fences for farming or agricultural purposes. Apart from the expenditure needing to be for the "construction" of fences, the provision neither places any restrictions on, nor provides any further guidance as to, the meaning of "fence". As discussed above, dicta in the case law suggest that the ordinary meaning of "fence" need not be limited to upright, above ground structures (_Barrow v Landry, Ellis v Arnison, Helding v Davis_). Based on the case law, it would seem that a structure, such as a cattle stop, may come within the meaning of "fence" as long as it encloses land or forms a barrier to ingress or egress. However, it is not entirely free from doubt. In such cases it is necessary to consider the scheme and purpose of the legislation.
22.  The Commissioner considers that there is nothing in the Act to suggest that a cattle stop constructed in an opening of a fence cannot come with the meaning of "construction on the land of fences" in s DO 1(1)(f). When a cattle stop is used, as part of a fence, to bar stock from entering and exiting a fenced enclosure, the Commissioner considers that the cattle stop is sufficiently fence-like to come within the meaning of "construction on the land of fences". This is because, in that situation, the cattle stop is an integral part of the barrier formed by the fence.
23.  In addition, a cattle stop may be considered an alternative to a gate. A gate, when shut, continues the line of a fence and bars entry or exit. A cattle stop also continues the line of the fence, but it bars only livestock from entering or exiting the fenced area. In addition, the definition of "fence" in the Fencing Act 1978 shows that gates (and, by analogy, cattle stops) may be considered to come within the meaning of "fence" in some contexts. 24. A strict view of the meaning of the word "fence" might not include cattle stops (or gates). However, when the case law and the scheme and purpose of the legislation is considered, the Commissioner is satisfied that a wider definition applies in s DO 1(1)(f), provided that the cattle stop is used "to fence" and is part of a fence. Where a cattle stop is constructed in an opening in a fence, expenditure on the cattle stop will be deductible under s DO 1(1)(f) as being "construction on the land of fences".

Income tax - deductibility of expenditure on widening or metalling a farm access road or track
==============================================================================================

QB 12/04 considers the deductibility of expenditure on the widening and/or metalling of an existing farm road.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007) unless otherwise stated.

This Question We've Been Asked applies in respect of s DO 4 and sch 20.

The item "Expenses Allowable To Farmers Who Convert To Tanker Collection" was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ No 20, p 11 (March 1965) ("the old PIB item"). This QWBA updates and replaces the parts of the old PIB item that relate to metalling and widening of farm roads and tracks. The current relevance of this information was identified during an ongoing review of content published in _Public Information Bulletins_ and _Tax Information Bulletins_ before 1996. The Commissioner's view on the other parts of the old PIB item that are still relevant are set out in the following items: QB 12/03: Income tax - deductibility of expenditure on cattle stops; Operational Statement 007 - Income tax treatment of certain expenditures on conversion of one farming or agricultural purpose to another; and Interpretation Statement IS0025 - Dairy farming - deductibility of certain expenditure. As a result, the old PIB item is no longer current and should not be relied on. For more information about the review, please see "Review of Public Information Bulletins" in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011).

### Question

1.  A farmer decides to improve a farm road or track by laying metal or widening the road or track. How is the expenditure treated for income tax purposes?

### Answer

2.  The cost of widening or metalling the farm road or track is a capital expense because it substantially alters the nature of the track. Section DO 4 allows for an amortisation-type deduction for capital farm expenditure listed in sch 20. Item 4 in sch 20 refers to the "construction of access roads or tracks to or on the land". The widening or metalling of the farm road or track is the construction of an access road or track under item. So the cost of widening or metalling the farm road or track can be deducted on a diminished value basis at 6%.
3.  If a farmer relays metal on a previously metalled farm road or track, or re-widens a farm road or track to return it to its former condition, the expenditure will be deductible under s DA 1.

### Explanation

4.  Several provisions are relevant in determining whether farm expenditure is deductible. If the expenditure is revenue in nature it is deductible under the general permission (s DA 1). Expenditure that is capital in nature cannot be deducted under the general permission because of the capital limitation (s DA2(1)). Various factors are relevant in determining whether expenditure is capital in nature: _BP Australia Ltd v C of T (Cth)_ \[1965\] 3 All ER 209; _CIR v Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australasia) Ltd_ (1992) 14 NZTC 9,101 (CA); _Christchurch Press Company Ltd v CIR_ (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206; _CIR v Wattie_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991 (PC); and _CIR v Birkdale Service Station Ltd_ (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981 (CA). It is considered in general:
    *   The cost of work done to an asset to make good ordinary wear and tear and restore the asset to its former condition will usually be deductible.
    *   Where the work done replaces or renews the whole, or substantially the whole, asset or changes the character of the asset the cost of that work will be capital expenditure.

5.  Therefore, if a taxpayer relays metal on a previously metalled farm road then the expenditure will be deductible under s DA 1. Likewise, if a taxpayer re-widens a road to return it to its former condition the expenditure will be deductible under s DA 1. The re-widening may be needed due to a slip or plant growth.
6.  There are also some specific deduction provisions for farm expenditure in subpart DO. The specific provisions override the capital limitation. As a result, if the farm expenditure is capital in nature, it may be deductible under one of the specific provisions.
7.  Section DO 4 allows for an amortisation-type deduction for farm expenditure listed in sch 20. The requirements to obtain a deduction under s DO 4 are as follows (as relevant):

*   **DO 4 Improvements to farm land**  
    **When this section applies**
    1.  This section applies when -
        1.  a person carries on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand; and
        2.  an improvement described in schedule 20, part A (Expenditure on farming, horticultural, aquacultural, and forestry improvements) has been made to the land; and
        3.  the expenditure on the improvement is not expenditure to which sections DO 5 to DO 7 apply.
        4.    
            
*   **Deduction: expenditure: owner of land**  
    
    2.  A person who owns the land is allowed a deduction for expenditure to which all the following apply:
        1.  it is incurred on making the improvement; and
        2.  it is incurred by the person or by another person; and
        3.  it is not incurred on anything described in any of sections DO 1 to DO 3; and
        4.  it is incurred in the 1995-96 income year or in a later income year, not including the income year in which the person disposes of the land, the income year being the income year of the person who owns the land; and
        5.  it is incurred in developing the land; and
        6.  it is of benefit to the business in the income year in which the person is allowed the deduction.
        7.    
            
    
    **Deduction: expenditure: non-owner of land**  
    3.  A person who does not own the land is allowed a deduction for expenditure to which all the following apply:
        
        1.  it is incurred on making the improvement; and
        2.  it is incurred by the person; and
        3.  it is not incurred on anything described in any of sections DO 1 to DO 3; and
        4.  (it is incurred in the 1995-96 income year or in a later income year, not including the income year in which the person ceases to carry on the business on the land; and
        5.  it is incurred in developing the land; and
        6.  it is of benefit to the business in the income year in which the person is allowed the deduction.
        
        ...  
        
*   **Link with subpart DA**  
    7.  This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply.

8.  Item 4 in sch 20 provides as follows: 4 construction of access roads or tracks to or on the land
9.  The ordinary meaning of item 4 includes the construction of a new farm road or track (including metalling the road or track) within s DO 4. This is consistent with an answer to a previous question on the deductibility of expenditure for establishing an access track in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 7, No 13 (May 1996): 24.
10.  However, an issue arises whether the widening or metalling of an existing farm road or track comes within the term construction; in item 4. The issue turns on whether the term construction:
    *   is limited to the initial building of the road or track, or
    *   extends to any subsequent improvements to the road or track.

#### Ordinary meaning of "construction"

11.  The ordinary meaning of construction; (_The Oxford English Dictionary_ (online ed March 2012, 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 1989, accessed 21 March 2012)) is:
12.    
    
    **construction, n.** I. The action of constructing. 1. a. The action of framing, devising, or forming, by the putting together of parts; erection, building.  
    **construct, v**. 1. a. trans. To make or form by fitting the parts together; to frame, build, erect.
    
      
    
13.  A similar definition was adopted by the Environment Court in _Waitakere City Council v Minister of Defence_ \[2006\] NZRMA 253 in the context of the Resource Management Act 1991.
14.  Therefore, the ordinary meaning of construction; has a broad meaning that includes building, erecting and fitting parts together. It is considered that the ordinary meaning of construct; extends to building a subsequent addition to an asset or thing.

#### Does the purpose of the farming expenditure regime indicate a meaning of "construction"?

14.  The phrase construction of access roads or tracks to or on the land; was initially enacted in 1950 as part of a previous regime for farm expenditure. The original purpose behind the farming expenditure provisions was to encourage primary production and the development of farm land. It is arguable that the initial focus was on the development of newly acquired land or land that was being broken in for a farm. The farm expenditure regime was subsequently amended in 1963 and then again in 1986 and 1991. It appears that by 1963 (and even more so by 1991) the focus seems to have broadened to encourage specific types of farm expenditure. In other words, it appears that the incentive was no longer limited to breaking in farm land. Therefore, the Commissioner considers the re-enactment of the farm expenditure regime in the ITA 2007 was to continue to encourage the specific types of farm expenditure. The nature of the incentive is arguably more supportive of a broad definition of construction;. In other words, as Parliament wanted to encourage farm expenditure it is more likely that Parliament intended additional improvements be included within the scope of construction.

#### Does the context of the relevant provisions suggest a meaning of "construction"?

15.  The context of the relevant provisions suggests the word construction; extends to any subsequent improvements to a road or track. Specifically:
    *   Section DO 4 refers to improvements to farm land. A subsequent widening or metalling of a road or track could be seen as a farm improvement.
    *   Section DO 1 is another farm expenditure provision. Section DO 1 allows for the deduction of certain farm expenditure. Section DO 1(1)(f) uses the term construction; in relation to rabbit-proofing an existing fence. Schedule 20 sets out the various types of farm expenditure and the relevant rates. Schedule 20 also uses the term construction; in relation to rabbit-proofing an existing fence. Therefore, s DO 1 and sch 20 arguably link the word construction; with the upgrading of an existing fence. Such an interpretation tends to support the conclusion that the word construction; is not limited to initial construction.
    *   The various definitions of construction; and construct; in other enactments are broad. Specifically, the definitions of construction; or construct; in s 2 of the Electricity Act 1992, s 2 of the Public Works Act 1981, s 2 of the Local Government Act 1974 and s 7 of the Building Act 2004 appear to extend to subsequent additions.

#### Consequences of a narrow interpretation of "construction"

16.  The likely consequence of a narrow interpretation of construction; is that the cost of the widening or metalling would be black hole expenditure. Given the incentive nature of the farm expenditure regime, it is unlikely that Parliament intended the cost of the widening or metalling to be black hole expenditure. So the consequence of the narrow interpretation is also supportive of a broader interpretation of the term "construction".

Income tax - deductibility of expenditure on stock yards
========================================================

QB 12/05 considers the deductibility of expenditure incurred on the construction of stock yards.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

This Question We've Been Asked applies in respect of s DO1(1)(f).

This item updates and replaces part of the item "Allowances on Covered Stock Yard" published in _Public Information Bulletin_ No 21, p10 (April 1965) that relates to the cost of fencing new stock yards. The current relevance of this information was identified during an ongoing review of content published in _Public Information Bulletins_ and _Tax Information Bulletins_ before 1996. As to the remainder of that item, please see the item "Stockyard roof - depreciation" published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996) and paragraph 24 of this QWBA. For more information about the review, please see "Review of Public Information Bulletins" _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No1 (February 2011).

### Question

1.  A farmer is constructing new stock yards. How is the expenditure on the stock yards treated for income tax purposes?

### Answer

2.  Where stock yards are not an integral part of a wider asset, the cost of constructing the stock yards is deductible in the year in which it is incurred. Assuming the expenditure was incurred in carrying on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand, the deduction is available under s DO1(1)(f) as construction on the land of fences .
3.  However, where stock yards are an integral part of a wider asset, such as a shearing shed or dairy shed, the stock yards are not "fences" within s DO1(1)(f). Therefore a deduction is not available for expenditure on the construction of the stock yards incurred in the income year under s DO 1(1)(f). For further information on whether a fence forms part of a wider asset, and discussion of the principles of deductibility in relation to certain farming expenditure, see IS0025 "Dairy farming - Deductibility of certain expenditure" published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000): 17.

### Explanation

4.  Specific farming deductions are available in subpart DO. Section DO1 (Enhancements to land, except trees) allows an immediate deduction for the expenditure incurred in constructing fences. Section DO 1 overrides the capital limitation. Section DO1(1) relevantly provides:  
      
    **DO 1 Enhancements to land, except trees**  
    _Deduction_
    1.  A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure that they incur on the following in carrying on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand:  
        ...  
        6.  the construction on the land of fences for farming or agricultural purposes, including buying wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit-proof:
5.  Assuming the expenditure was incurred in the carrying on of a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand, the ability to deduct the expenditure incurred in constructing the stock yards under s DO 1(1)(f) then depends on whether the stock yards are a collection of "fences" within that section. If the stock yards are not a collection of fences, then the deductibility of the expenditure on stock yards is considered under the general rules of deductibility.

#### What are stock yards?

6.  Stock yards are structures that enclose an area to keep livestock within for a particular purpose. Stock yards are built and used for a wide variety of purposes. Such purposes may include loading out (for sales) or receiving (from purchases), for care (such as trimming hooves, veterinary care, drenching, injecting etc), and stock take (counting). Stock yards can be built of different materials, but usually would be of wood, wood and wire or metal (reinforced steel) construction.
7.  Depending on the purpose and use of the stock yards, they may be adjacent to a shed (eg, a wool or dairy shed) or some other farm facility. In such a case, it is necessary to determine whether the stock yards and the barrier surrounding the stock yards are part of a wider asset.

#### What is a "fence"?

8.  The _Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ (6th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007) relevantly defines "fence" as follows:
    *   **fence** _noun_…**3** a railing or barrier constructed of posts of any of various materials connected by wire, planks, etc., used to enclose and prevent entry to and exit from a field, yard, etc.
9.  The dictionary definition shows that the ordinary meaning of the word "fence" is an upright structure that is comprised of posts (of any of various materials) connected by wire or wood. The definition also shows that the purpose of a fence is to enclose an area to prevent or control access to and from that enclosed area.
10.  In relation to the rights, duties and liabilities of owners of fences, _Halsbury's Laws of England,_ (5th edition, 2011) vol 4, Boundaries, provides the following definition of fences at \[350\]:
    *   Although fences are frequently used to mark the situation of boundaries, none the less they are primarily guards against intrusion, or barriers to prevent persons or animals straying out, and therefore in this sense the term includes not only hedges, banks, and walls, but also ditches. But an external party wall forming part of a building and alongside or on the boundary of land is not usually regarded as a fence.
11.  The word "fence" is also defined in other New Zealand Acts. For example, the Fencing Act 1978 provides the following definitions:
    *   **Fence** means a fence, whether or not continuous or extending along the whole boundary separating the lands of adjoining occupiers; and includes all gates, culverts, and channels that are part of or are incidental to a fence; and also includes any natural or artificial watercourse or live fence, or any ditch or channel or raised ground that serves as a dividing fence.
    *   **Adequate fence** means a fence that, as to its nature, condition, and state of repair, is reasonably satisfactory for the purpose that it serves or is intended to serve
12.  While not decided in a tax context, the following cases are useful in that they discuss the ordinary meaning of the word "fence".
13.  In the New Zealand Environment Court case of _Collins v Wooff_ \[2010\] NZEnvC 227, the court, was prepared to contemplate a wider range of fences than typical post and wire fencing when considering what the phrase "standard rural fencing" meant. This was in the context of a resource consent that contained a fencing covenant requiring the defendant to only erect "standard rural fencing" on his property. However, the defendant's case failed because he could not show that the 8 metre stone wall he had erected next to his driveway performed the function of a fence. The court was not persuaded that the fencing covenant necessarily ruled out stone walls because such structures were commonly used as fences on farms in other parts of New Zealand. However, in this case, the wall was not a "fence" because it did not form a barrier or enclose anything. In the court's view the function of a fence is to form a barrier or enclose an area of land.
14.  Similarly, in _Kontikis v Schreiner_ (1989) 16 NSWLR 706, 68 LGRA 301 the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales considered that for a structure to be a fence, the structure must not merely bound land in fact but must be there functionally or essentially for that purpose.
15.  In _Lahey v Hartford Fire Insurance Co_ \[1968\] OR 727 at \[6\], the Ontario High Court of Justice considered that "fence" referred to "a structure which encloses wholly or partially some piece of property so as to impede ingress and egress. It may be composed of anything so long as it creates a line of obstacle serving this purpose". This was confirmed by the British Columbia Supreme Court in the case of _Barrow v Landry_ \[1998\] BCJ No 1601.
16.  In _City of Greater Geelong v Herd_ 94 LGERA 149, Batt J, in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Victoria), considered the ordinary meaning of "fence" and stated (at 172-173):
    *   To my mind, the two essential features are the function of enclosing or barring and location along or serving to define a boundary: cf _Kontikis v Schreiner_ (1989) 16 NSWLR 706; 68 LGRA 301, which, I acknowledge, was concerned with the definition in the dividing fences legislation of New South Wales. **Lest I be misunderstood I hasten to say that the boundary need not be that of a total property or parcel of land, but can be the boundary of some lesser unit. However, it must be, in my view, the boundary of something that has or at any rate once had physical unity. Thus one can have within a domestic property a fence along the boundary of a vegetable patch, a tennis court, a swimming pool or a chicken coop, to take a few examples.** \[Emphasis added\]
17.  In _Bass Coast SC v Coastal Estates Pty Ltd_ \[2008\] VCAT 1518, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal cited the above passage in _City of Greater Geelong v Herd_ and then stated (at \[57\]):
    *   The cases referred to included discussion of the purposes of fences including that they are normally to enclose specific areas, or to define them. Such areas may not be limited to the area within a title boundary. **Orchard fences, internal paddock fences, cattleyards, tennis courts and so on may enclose particular areas**. \[Emphasis added\]
18.  These cases show that the purposes of a fence include any (or a combination) of the following:
    *   to enclose an area;
    *   to define boundaries; and
    *   to provide a barrier and prevent ingress or egress.  
        In addition, the cases show that a boundary defined by a fence need not be the entire parcel of land or total property; it can be the boundary of some lesser unit (_City of Greater Geelong v Herd; Bass Coast SC v Coastal Estates Pty Ltd_).

#### Are stock yards a collection of "fences" for the purposes of s DO 1(1)(f)?

19.  The above discussion shows that a "fence" could be any structure that performs the function or has the purpose of a fence, or it could refer only to structures that are commonly called fences and that fit the dictionary definition of "fence". The Commissioner considers that there is nothing in the Act to suggest that stock yards cannot come within the reference to "fences" in s DO 1(1)(f). Section DO1 refers to certain costs incurred in carrying on a farming or agricultural business in New Zealand. Apart from the expenditure needing to be for the "construction of fences" the provision neither places any restrictions on, nor provides any further guidance as to, the meaning of "fence". In addition, dicta in the case law suggest that a small enclosure, such as a cattle yard, can be described as being surrounded by "fences".
20.  Stock yards are an area of land enclosed by what are essentially fences. Stock yards can be smaller than some paddocks, but according to case law the size of an enclosure does not affect whether something is a fence: _City of Greater Geelong v Herd; Bass Coast SC v Coastal Estates Pty Ltd_. This is consistent with the definition of "fence" in the _Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_, which states that a fence is "used to enclose and prevent entry to and exit from a field, yard, etc". In addition, in _Bass Coast SC v Coastal Estates Pty Ltd_, the Tribunal made some obiter comments on the nature of fences and specifically referred to cattle yards as falling within the meaning of "fence".
21.  Therefore, the Commissioner considers that stock yards will be a collection of "fences" for the purposes of s DO 1(1)(f).
22.  However, as identified in IS0025, sometimes stock yards are attached to other assets, such as dairy sheds or shearing sheds. IS0025 was concerned with ss DO3 and DO 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994, the precursors to ss DO 1 and DO 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (s DO 4 no longer provides for fences). IS0025 concluded (at 30):
    *   Separate expensing for the pipe work, bails and rails, in terms of section DO 3, is not available. Although it is accepted that the word "fence" has a wide ordinary meaning, it is necessary to take into account the context in which the word is used in the legislation, the nature of a dairy shed, views expressed in cases regarding the integrated nature or entirety of assets, and the legislative background. Given these considerations, on balance, the pipe work forms part of the dairy shed asset itself and is not a "fence" under section DO 3 or section DO 4 \[of the Income Tax Act 1994\].
23.  The Commissioner considers that where stock yards form part of a wider asset, the stock yards would not satisfy s DO1(1)(f).

#### Covered stock yards

24.  Sometimes, a roof or cover is constructed over a stock yard. The item "Allowances on Covered Stock Yard", published in _Public Information Bulletin_ No 21, p 10 (April 1965), was primarily about covered stock yards. For the Commissioner's view on the tax treatment of a stock yard roof, please see the item "Stockyard roof - depreciation" in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996). Please note that the calculation method in s DO 4 and the rate in Sch 20 have changed since _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996) was published. Under the current legislation, the cost of constructing a stock yard roof can be amortised on a diminished value basis at 12% under s DO4 and Sch 20, Item 13, as expenditure incurred on the construction of a structure for shelter purposes.

Fringe benefit tax - "Availability" benefits
============================================

QB 12/06 considers whether the mere availability of a good or service provided by an employer to an employer makes it a fringe benefit.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

This QWBA applies in respect of ss CX 2(1) and CX 37.

### Question

1.  If an employer makes a good or service available to an employee, will the mere availability of the good or service be a fringe benefit?

### Answer

2.  No. Fringe benefits arise when a benefit is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment. Once a benefit has been provided to an employee, it is irrelevant if it is never used, it will be a fringe benefit (subject to any exclusions in subpart CX applying). However, the "mere availability" of goods or services that have not been provided will not be a fringe benefit.
3.  Motor vehicles are dealt with differently to other goods or services; the availability for private use of a motor vehicle will give rise to a benefit by virtue of s CX 6.
4.  Whether or not the availability for private use of a business tool (which by definition has been provided to an employee) is a fringe benefit depends on whether it falls within the exclusion in s CX 21.

### Explanation

5.  A fringe benefit is, broadly speaking, a benefit that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment.
6.  We have been asked whether, under the Act, the mere availability of a good or service to an employee is sufficient to be a fringe benefit.

### Legislation

7.  The relevant provisions of the Act, ss CX 2(1), CX 6, CX 21 and CX 37, are as follows:

*   **CX 2 Meaning of fringe benefit**  
    _Meaning_  
    (1) A fringe benefit is a benefit that-
    1.  is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and
    2.  either-
        1.  arises in a way described in any of sections CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16; or
        2.  is an unclassified benefit; and
    3.  is not a benefit excluded from being a fringe benefit by any provision of this subpart.

*   **CX 6 Private use of motor vehicle**  
    _When fringe benefit arises_  
    (1) A fringe benefit arises when-
    1.  a motor vehicle is made available to an employee for their private use; and
    2.  the person who makes the vehicle available to the employee-
        1.  owns the vehicle:
        2.  leases or rents the vehicle:
        3.  has a right to use the vehicle under an agreement or arrangement with the employee or a person associated with the employee.
*   _Exclusion: work-related vehicles_
*   (2) Subsection (1) does not apply when the vehicle is a work-related vehicle.

*   _Exclusion: emergency calls_
*   (3) Subsection (1) does not apply when the vehicle is used for an emergency call.

*   _Exclusion: absences from home_
*   (4) Subsection (1) does not apply when the employee is absent from home, with the vehicle, for a period of at least 24 hours continuously, if the employee is required, in the performance of their duties, to use a vehicle and regularly to be absent from home.

*   _Use on part of day_
*   (5) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the whole of the day on which a motor vehicle is used as described in the applicable subsection is treated as a day on which the vehicle is not available for private use.

*   **CX 21 Business tools**  
    _When use of business tool not fringe benefit_  
    (1) The private use of a business tool that an employer provides to an employee, and the availability for private use of such a business tool, is not a fringe benefit if-
    1.  the business tool is provided mainly for business use; and
    2.  the cost of the business tool to the employer, including the amount of any deduction for the cost of the business tool that the employer may make under section 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, is no more than $5,000.

*   _Use away from employer's premises_
*   (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a business tool that is not taken to and used on the employer's premises may nevertheless be provided mainly for business use if the employee performs a significant part of the employee's employment duties away from the premises.

*   **CX 37 Meaning of unclassified benefit**
*   **Unclassified benefit** means a fringe benefit that arises if an employer provides an employee with a benefit in connection with their employment that is-
    1.  not a benefit referred to in any of sections CX 6 to CX 16; and
    2.  not a benefit excluded under this subpart.

### Application of the legislation

8.  The provision of a benefit by an employer to an employee will only be a "fringe benefit" for the purposes of the Act if it comes within s CX 2. This section requires that:
    *   a benefit must be provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment; and
    *   the benefit must fall within s CX 2(1)(b), and not be excluded from being a fringe benefit by any other provision.
9.  To fall within s CX 2(1)(b), a benefit must either arise as described in any of ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16 of the Act, or be an unclassified benefit. Sections CX 9, CX 10 and CX 12 to CX 16 deal with the actual provision of particular specified benefits, and an unclassified benefit arises if an employer provides an employee with a benefit in connection with their employment. However, s CX 6 states that a motor vehicle that is made available to an employee for their private use will give rise to a fringe benefit. The issue we have been asked to consider is whether other goods or services that are merely made available for an employee to use privately will also give rise to a fringe benefit. In other words, where goods or services are made available for an employee to use, has a benefit been provided by the employer to the employee in connection with their employment?

### Requirement for there to be a "benefit"

10.  The Act does not define the term "benefit" for the purposes of the fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules. Therefore, this word is to be read as having its ordinary meaning.
11.  "Benefit" is defined (relevantly) in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th edition, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) as "an advantage or profit gained from something".
12.  This broad definition of "benefit" could cover a situation where an employer makes something available to an employee, even though the employee may not yet have used the thing in question. Even if something has not been used, the fact of it being available is an advantage or benefit, in contrast to it not being available.
13.  However, there is judicial authority which indicates that there are limits to when something which is, strictly speaking, an "advantage" will be considered to be a benefit for FBT purposes.
14.  In Case M9 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,069, the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) considered the FBT status of contributions to a superannuation fund and the provision of motor vehicles that were available for the private use and enjoyment of two employees.
15.  The TRA noted that the legislation specifically provided that the availability for private use or enjoyment of a motor vehicle would be a fringe benefit. The TRA went on to say, on the general meaning of "benefit" (at 2,074):
    *   The section itself to an extent explains what is a benefit, for the purposes of a fringe benefit; so long as something is provided by an employer to an employee that can be reasonably, practically and sensibly understood as a benefit to the employee in itself and is not expressly excluded, \[that\] would be sufficient for it to be a benefit for the purposes of the definition of "fringe benefit" as provided by the section. \[Emphasis added\]
16.  While the legislative provision considered in Case M9 was a predecessor to s CX 2, the principles remain relevant as the definition of "fringe benefit" still requires that a benefit be provided by an employer to an employee.
17.  Accordingly, the Commissioner is of the view that a particular "advantage" must be sufficiently clear and definite that it can reasonably, practically and sensibly be understood as a tangible benefit.

### Requirement for the benefit to be "provided"

18.  The term "provided" is also not defined in the Act and so is to be read as having its ordinary meaning.
19.  "Provide" is defined (relevantly) in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as "v. 1 make available for use; supply. **\>(provide someone with)** equip or supply someone with".
20.  A number of cases have discussed the meaning of the word "provide".
    *   These cases show that the meaning of "provide" depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, in Ginty v Belmont Building Supplies Ltd \[1959\] 1 All ER 414 at 422, Pearson J stated: I do not think that there is any hard and fast meaning of the word "provided"; it must depend on the circumstances of the case as to what is "provided" and how what is "provided" is going to be used.
21.  In Norris v Syndi Manufacturing Co Ltd \[1952\] 1 All ER 935 at 940, Romer LJ stated:
    *   The primary meaning of the word "provide" is to "furnish" or "supply" ...
22.  In Pierce v FCT 98 ATC 2,240, the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal considered whether a car had been provided to an employee. At 2,247, BJ McMahon (Deputy President) stated:
    *   There is no reason why "provides" should not be given its ordinary English meaning, namely "to furnish or supply" (Macquarie Dictionary).
23.  Accordingly, for something to have been "provided" to an employee for the purposes of s CX 2, it must be supplied, furnished or made available for use by the employee.

### Is the mere availability of a good or service a fringe benefit?

24.  The term "availability", or reference to something having been "made available" or being "merely available", could be used to describe a number of different scenarios where the benefit may or may not have been provided for the purposes of the FBT rules. Common scenarios where people might consider that the concept of "availability" arises, and may regard this as relevant to determining whether FBT is payable, include:
    *   Where goods or services have been provided by an employer and the employee may or may not use them;
    *   Where goods or services are potentially available to an employee (but not yet provided); and
    *   Where business assets may also be used by an employee for private purposes.
25.  Each of these scenarios will be considered in turn.

_Where goods or services have been provided and the employee may or may not use them_

26.  If goods or services have been provided by an employer, it is irrelevant whether they are in fact used. The goods or services are a benefit that has been provided and they will be a fringe benefit (the other requirements of s CX 2(1) being satisfied).
27.  An example of this is where an employer purchases a number of sports season tickets and provides them to its employees to use. It does not matter whether, or how frequently, the employees use the tickets; the benefits (the tickets) have been provided.
28.  Similarly, if an employer purchased gym memberships for its employees, benefits (the memberships) have been provided. It is not accurate to describe the memberships as being merely available; they have been purchased and provided to the employees. Whether a benefit has been provided to the employees is not dependent on whether any given employee actually goes to the gym. The benefits are the memberships and they have been provided.

_Where goods or services are potentially available to an employee (but not yet provided)_

29.  If no benefit has been provided, there can be no fringe benefit. The availability of a good or service must be considered in a reasonable, practical, and sensible way to determine whether it is, in itself, a benefit (Case M9).
30.  Arguably the availability of goods or services on offer from an employer is itself a benefit. However, the Commissioner considers that where there is simply the option of accessing goods or services, a fringe benefit does not arise until that option is taken up and the goods or services in question are provided. While there is some benefit in having something available to be taken up, this cannot reasonably, practically or sensibly be considered a benefit for the purposes of the FBT rules.
31.  For example, if an employer makes the option of purchasing discounted goods available to its employees, this would not constitute the provision of a benefit in terms of s CX 2. There is merely an opportunity for the employees to be provided with something that would be a benefit for FBT purposes. If an employee takes advantage of the offer to purchase discounted goods, a benefit in terms of s CX 2 would be provided at that point.
32.  This is consistent with the conclusion in the discussion document Streamlining the Taxation of Fringe Benefits (Government discussion document, Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, 11 December 2003) that discounted goods need to be purchased to trigger the taxable benefit. The discussion document states (at page 16):
    *   **Availability for use versus actual use**
    *   3.6 If an asset is provided by an employer to an employee, its fringe benefit value is determined by whether it is available for private use. In the case of motor vehicles, the availability test is applied on a daily basis. Whether a vehicle is available for private use can be determined by keeping a log book for a three month test period (see section CI 11). If the vehicle is available for private use at any time during the day, such as for home-to-work travel, availability for such use is considered to exist for the whole day.
    *   3.7 If the benefit relates to a service rather than the provision of an asset, the benefit is valued according to the actual use of that service, with no value being attributed to having access to the subsidised service. Discounted goods are similarly treated - even though the discount may be available to the employee at all times, goods have to be purchased to trigger the taxable benefit.
    *   3.8 Arguably, the availability of a discount or access to services has some value, but it is very difficult to determine and will vary from employee to employee, depending on whether they intend to purchase the goods or services. Given these difficulties, it is sensible to treat the availability aspect as irrelevant and apply "use" as the appropriate test.  
        \[Emphasis added\]
33.  As noted in the discussion document, the availability of a discount, or access to services, is of some value and is arguably therefore a benefit. However, consistent with Case M9, it is necessary to consider the availability of a good or service in a reasonable, practical, and sensible way to determine whether a benefit can be said to have been provided. The Commissioner considers that the mere availability of a discount, or access to services, cannot reasonably, practically or sensibly be regarded as a benefit in these circumstances.
34.  As noted above, motor vehicles are treated differently to other goods or services; the availability for private use of a motor vehicle will give rise to a fringe benefit by virtue of s CX 6.

Where business assets may also be used by an employee for private purposes

35.  Some assets of a business that are used by an employee in the performance of their work duties may also be capable of being used for private purposes. In such cases, it is considered that a benefit is only provided when the goods are actually used for private purposes. While the possibility of obtaining a private benefit exists, the business assets are not provided to the employee, and no benefit is provided, until they are actually used for private purposes.
36.  For example, a yacht charter company owns a number of yachts. If the yacht charter company allows its employees to use its yachts on Mondays, when the company is closed for business, the yachts will not be provided to the employees until they actually take them out for private use. Until then there is simply an opportunity to use the yachts for private purposes. This is arguably a benefit which has been "provided" and is of some value.
37.  However, again consistent with Case M9, it is necessary to consider whether the "availability" of the yachts for private use can be reasonably, practically and sensibly regarded as a benefit provided. As with the availability of discounts, or access to services, the Commissioner considers that the mere availability of a business asset for private use cannot reasonably, practically or sensibly be regarded as a benefit provided. On those days when an employee actually uses a yacht for private purposes, however, a benefit will be provided and it will be a fringe benefit.
38.  Another example of business assets that may also be used for private purposes are DVDs available for staff at a DVD store to take home free of charge as they wish. The mere availability of the DVDs for private use would not be considered a benefit provided. It would only be on occasions when employees took DVDs home that a benefit would be provided, and would constitute a fringe benefit.
39.  As already noted, the availability for private use of a motor vehicle is different. The availability for private use of a motor vehicle will give rise to a fringe benefit under s CX 6 (subject to the exclusions in that section).

### Business tools exclusion

40.  Some business assets may be provided to employees for business purposes, and also be available for private use. Such an asset would be a "business tool", which is defined in s YA 1 as "an item that is used by an employee in the performance of their work duties and in the absence of s CX 21 (Business tools) would give rise to an unclassified benefit". Examples of business tools include items such as mobile phones or laptops given to employees that are also able to be used for private purposes.
41.  Whether the availability for private use of a business tool is a fringe benefit depends on whether it falls within the exclusion in s CX 21. Section CX 21 provides that neither the private use nor the availability for private use of a business tool will be a fringe benefit if: (1) the business tool is provided mainly for business use; and (2) the (GST-inclusive) cost of the business tool to the employer is no more than $5,000. Business tools that do not fall within this exclusion will be subject to FBT.

### _Tax Information Bulletin_ item from 1995

42.  The item "FBT - Meaning of 'availability for private use or enjoyment'" _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 6, No 10 (March 1995), considered whether benefits, other than a motor vehicle, that were available for private use and enjoyment would be fringe benefits under the Income Tax Act 1976 ("the 1976 Act").
43.  The 1995 item concluded that the mere availability for private use or enjoyment of an employee benefit other than a motor vehicle would not be a fringe benefit under the 1976 Act. The item stated that a benefit other than a motor vehicle would be a fringe benefit only if the employee had actually "used, enjoyed, or received" the benefit in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employee's employment.
44.  For the reasons discussed above, a good (not being a motor vehicle) or service that has not been provided but is "merely available" will not constitute a fringe benefit. This QWBA clarifies what was meant in the 1995 item by the term "mere availability".
45.  Fringe benefits arise when a benefit is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment. Once a benefit has been provided, it is irrelevant if it is never used. The crucial question is whether the benefit has been provided by the employer to the employee. The concept of "availability", or something having been "made available" or being "merely available", could be used to describe a number of different scenarios where the benefit may or may not have been provided for the purposes of the FBT rules. However, if a good or service has in fact been provided, it is inaccurate to describe it as being "merely available".

### BR Pub 09/07

46.  The commentary to BR Pub 09/07 "Provision of benefits by third parties - fringe benefit tax consequences - section CX 2(2)" touches briefly on the question of what constitutes a benefit. Paragraphs \[100\], \[101\] and \[103\] of that discussion may be read as suggesting that in order for there to be a "benefit" for FBT purposes something must be provided to the employee, and the employee must actually use or takes advantage of the thing provided. Those paragraphs of the commentary to BR Pub 09/07 should not be relied on to the extent that they may suggest this and be inconsistent with this QWBA.
47.  It is noted that the comments in the commentary to BR Pub 09/07 which incorrectly suggest that something provided must be used or taken advantage of to be a benefit do not in any way alter the conclusions reached in BR Pub 09/07.

### Conclusion

48.  If goods or services have been provided to an employee by an employer, it is irrelevant whether they are in fact used. The goods or services are a benefit that has been provided, and they will be a fringe benefit (the other requirements of s CX 2(1) being satisfied, and subject to any exclusion applying).
49.  Where goods or services are potentially available to an employee (but not yet provided), there is simply the option of accessing those goods or services. A benefit is not provided until that option is taken up and the goods or services in question are provided.
50.  Where business assets (which are neither business tools provided to an employee, nor motor vehicles) may also be used by an employee for private purposes, a benefit is only provided when the goods are actually used for private purposes. While the possibility of obtaining a private benefit exists, the goods are not provided to the employee as a benefit until they are actually used for private purposes; rather, the goods are provided for work purposes and the benefit is provided when they are used privately.
51.  Whether the availability for private use of a business tool that has been provided to an employee is a fringe benefit depends on whether it falls within the exclusion in s CX 21. Section CX 21 provides that neither the private use nor the availability for private use of a business tool will be a fringe benefit if: (1) the business tool is provided mainly for business use; and (2) the (GST-inclusive) cost of the business tool to the employer is no more than $5,000.
52.  The availability for private use of a motor vehicle (whether a business asset or not) will generally give rise to a fringe benefit under s CX 6.

Goods and services tax - treatment of transitional services supplied as part of the sale of a business (that includes the supply of land)
=========================================================================================================================================

QB 12/07 considers the GST treatment of transitional services provided by the vendor as part of the sale of a business including 'same' and 'separate' supply.

All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated.

This Question We've Been Asked applies in respect of ss 5(24) and 11(1)(mb) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

### Question

1.  We have been asked whether transitional services provided by the vendor as part of the sale of a business (that includes the supply of land) will be zero-rated for GST purposes where:
    *   the services and the sale of the business form part of the same contractual arrangement, and
    *   the services are not provided for a separately identifiable consideration.

### Answer

2.  Whether transitional services provided by the vendor as part of a sale of a business (that includes the supply of land) will be zero-rated will depend on whether the transitional services and the business/land are part of the same supply.
3.  Most often the business and related land will be part of the same supply. Transitional services will also be part of that same supply (and therefore zero-rated) where they are not an aim in themselves for the recipient, but rather are a means of better enjoying the business supplied. This will include situations where the transitional services provide merely ancillary, incidental, minor or peripheral benefits and are not in any real or substantial sense part of the consideration for which the payment is made. Whether the transitional services are an aim in themselves for the recipient is a question of fact that must be determined in each case.

### Explanation

4.  Section 11(1)(mb) provides that a supply of goods that is chargeable with tax under s 8 is zero-rated if:
    *   (mb) the supply wholly or partly consists of land, being a supply-
        1.  made by a registered person to another registered person who acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and
        2.  that is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c)...

5.  The key elements of s 11(1)(mb) are:
    *   There must be a "supply".
    *   That "supply" must consist "wholly or partly" of land (ie it will apply no matter how small the land component part of the supply is).
    *   The "supply" must be "made by a registered person to another registered person who acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies".
    *   The land must not be intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient or an associated person.
6.  Where these requirements are satisfied, the supply of land and goods will be zero-rated.
7.  Where services are provided as part of a supply for the purposes of s 11(1)(mb), s 5(24) applies to treat the services as a supply of goods. It states:
    *   If a supply that wholly or partly consists of land is made, and the supply includes the provision of services, the supply of the services is treated as a supply of goods for the purposes of section 11(1)(mb).
8.  The following analysis assumes the third and fourth requirements in paragraph \[5\] are met and that there is the sale of a business that includes the sale of the land. Where transitional services are supplied as part of the sale of a business that includes the supply of land, whether the transitional services are zero-rated will depend on whether they and the sale of the business/land are part of the same "supply".

#### What is a "supply" in terms of ss 11(1)(mb) and 5(24)?

9.  It has been suggested that the concept of "supply" in ss 11(1)(mb) and 5(24) is wider than "supply" in the rest of the GST Act. However, the Commissioner's view is that "supply" in these sections should be given the same meaning as in the rest of the Act. Section 11(1)(mb) applies where "**the supply** wholly or partly consists of land". This suggests that it is necessary to first find a "supply" and then to determine whether land forms the whole, or a part of, that supply. Further, a zero-rating provision only applies where a supply would otherwise be taxable. The primary provision in the GST Act is s 8. Section 8 charges GST on "the supply" of goods and services. Section 11 then applies to zero-rate "a supply of goods that is chargeable with tax under section 8". This suggests that the supply being considered in s 8 is the same supply that is zero-rated under s 11. "Supply" should, therefore, be given the same meaning in both sections.
10.  The courts have developed a number of principles to help determine the relevant "supply" (or supplies) made as part of a transaction. The leading New Zealand case on whether something is a separate supply or part of a larger supply is _Auckland Institute of Studies v CIR_ (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC). This case concerned a taxpayer, the Auckland Institute of Studies (AIS), that specialised in providing educational services to overseas students. A subsidiary was incorporated to carry out AIS's overseas activities. The subsidiary was entitled to charge the students an "overseas assistance fee" for assistance provided to the students prior to their arrival in New Zealand. The students were not charged separately for the overseas assistance fee. Instead, it was part of the fee charged for tuition and other services. The issue was whether the overseas assistance fee was for a separate supply from the supply of tuition services such that the overseas assistance fee would be zero-rated as being for services performed outside New Zealand.
11.  Hansen J reviewed the case law on the principles of apportionment, concluding that the cases in the United Kingdom under the Value Added Tax Act 1983 were of assistance. He observed that the approach of the United Kingdom courts had been to sever zero-rated or exempt supplies where it was "practicable and realistic" to do so (_Rayner & Keeler Ltd v CEC_ \[1991\] VATTR 532 at 538). He stated that, for this purpose, an enquiry is made into "the true and substantial nature" of the consideration given for the payment (_Bophuthatswana National Commercial Corp Ltd v CEC_ \[1993\] STC 702 (CA) at 708). In particular, Hansen J considered the following four cases:
    *   _British Airways plc v CEC_ \[1990\] BTC 5124 (CA)
    *   _CEC v United Biscuits (UK) Ltd_ \[1992\] BTC 5045 (IH acting as the Court of ExD)
    *   _CEC v Wellington Private Hospital Ltd_ \[1997\] BTC 5140 (CA)
    *   _Card Protection Plan Ltd v CEC_ \[2001\] 2 All ER 143 (HL).
12.  Ultimately Hansen J found that the pre-arrival services were ancillary to the supply of tuition services to overseas students in that they helped to facilitate that supply. Therefore in that case the pre-arrival services were not a separate supply and the overseas assistance fee could not be zero-rated.
13.  In _College of Estate Management v CEC_ \[2005\] 4 All ER 933 (HL) the House of Lords clarified that a distinct element could be a separate supply even if it was not ancillary to the dominant element of the supply (see also _CIR v Motorcorp Holdings Ltd_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,126). _College of Estate Management_ involved the provision of distance-learning courses. The College provided students with written materials, face to face teaching and examination services. The issue was whether the written materials were a separate supply. The tribunal found that the written materials were not an end in themselves for the students. Further, although the means of educating the students relied principally on the provision of the written materials that did not detract from the College providing overall a single supply of education.  The tribunal concluded that the College made a single supply of the provision of education and that the supply of the printed materials was an ancillary element and a means of better enjoying the provision of education.  The decision was upheld by the High Court and then overturned by the Court of Appeal. On appeal the House of Lords agreed with the tribunal's conclusion that the written materials were not an end in themselves for the students and that the College was making a single supply of education services. However, their Lordships disagreed with the tribunal's conclusion that the supply of written materials was ancillary to the provision of education. They stated at \[12\]:
    *   But the mere fact that the supply of the printed materials cannot be described as ancillary does not mean that it is to be regarded as a separate supply for tax purposes.  One has still to decide whether, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the College should properly be regarded as making a separate supply of the printed materials or, rather, a single supply of education, of which the provision of the printed materials is merely one element.
14.  And further at \[30\]:
    *   ... there are other cases (including the _Faaborg_ case_,_ the _Dr Beynon_ case and the present case) in which it is inappropriate to analyse the transaction in terms of what is ‘principal' and ‘ancillary', and it is unhelpful to strain the natural meaning of ‘ancillary' in an attempt to do so.  Food is not ancillary to restaurant services; it is of central and indispensable importance to them; nevertheless there is a single supply of services (see the _Faaborg_ case). Pharmaceuticals are not ancillary to medical care which requires the use of medication; again, they are of central and indispensable importance; nevertheless there is a single supply of services (see the _Dr Beynon_ case).
15.  The relevant principles taken from the above cases can be summarised as follows:
    *   It is necessary to identify the essential features of the transaction to determine the nature of a supply. This requires consideration of the contract between the parties including identifying the true and substantial nature of the consideration provided for the payment made by the recipient of the supply. The true and substantial nature of the consideration is to be determined objectively.
    *   All the circumstances in which the transaction takes place must be considered.
    *   Where the supply involves one or more major elements and one or more other elements, the enquiry is to determine whether those non-major elements of the transaction (or consideration given) are:
        *   a necessary or integral part of the major elements; or
        *   merely ancillary to or incidental to those other elements.In either case there will be one supply (including both the dominant and ancillary elements).
    *   Where more than one element is major, it is necessary to consider whether the elements are so closely linked as to form a single supply.
    *   In either case, where an element is an aim (or an end) in itself for the recipient (rather than a means of better enjoying the overall supply) then it will be a separate supply.
16.  Consequently, where a business is being supplied, most often the supply will include all of the elements that make up that business. For example, the supply of a farm may include land, farm buildings, stock, farm vehicles and miscellaneous farm equipment. However, there are circumstances where a single agreement and consideration could involve multiple supplies. An example may be where the agreement for the sale of the above farm also included the sale of a luxury yacht.
17.  The following examples illustrate how these principles have been applied by the courts in different fact situations:

**_Examples from case law_**

*   _British Airways_ dealt with a transaction involving air transport. The court considered whether the in-flight catering was a separate supply from the air transport or whether it was merely ancillary/incidental to the air transport such that there was only one supply of air transport. The court accepted the supply of food and beverages was not necessary or essential to the supply of air transport but was merely an optional extra. The cost of the food and beverages was reflected in the price of the ticket but the food and beverages supplied were not in any real and substantial sense part of the consideration (objectively ascertained) for the payment made by passengers. The food and beverages were an ancillary, incidental, minor, or peripheral element of the transaction. Therefore, the court held there was only one supply of air transport.
*   _Sea Containers Ltd v CEC_ \[2000\] BVC 60 (QB) dealt with a transaction involving train travel. The court considered whether the food and drink provided on the day train excursions was a separate supply from the supply of transport. The court considered the catering was an important part of what the customer was paying for. The importance of the catering was demonstrated by the references in the marketing brochures (for the train travel) to "a unique series of lunch and dinner excursions". The court held that the significance of the catering went beyond the point where it could merely be seen as a way of better enjoying the transport element of the transaction. Instead, it was an aim in itself for the customers. Therefore, the court decided the food and drink provided was a separate supply from the supply of transport.
*   In _CEC v British Telecommunications_ \[1999\] BVC 306 (HL) the issue was whether a car and the delivery of the car were separate supplies. It was held that there was a single supply of a delivered car. The supply contracted for was a delivered car and the delivery of the car enabled the completion of the transaction.
*   In _Card Protection Plan_, the House of Lords considered whether a card protection plan offered to credit cardholders was a single supply with some ancillary services or two independent supplies comprising an exempt insurance supply and a non-exempt card registration service. It was held that there was a single supply of insurance. The essential feature of the transaction was insurance against loss arising from the misuse of credit cards. The other features in the transaction (the maintenance of a register of credit cards, the ordering of replacement cards, a change of address service, lost key location tags and luggage stickers to ensure the quick return of lost keys and luggage) merely assisted in the administration of the insurance scheme.
*   In _Dr Beynon v CEC_ \[2004\] 4 All ER 1091 the House of Lords found that the personal administration of a drug (such as a vaccine) by a doctor was a single supply of medical services. Their Lordships held that the reality was that the transaction was the patient's visit to the doctor and should not be artificially split into the supply of medical services and the supply of a drug.
*   In _Tumble Tots (UK) Ltd v R & C Commrs_ \[2007\] BVC 179 (ChD) it was held there was a single supply of membership of a club that conferred on a child the right to attendance at classes involving structured physical play. Other benefits received on admission to membership (a DVD, CD, gym bag, membership card, T-shirt, personal accident insurance for a child while attending a class and a subscription for a magazine) were not separate supplies.

**_Application to transitional services_**

18.  The following factors will be useful for determining whether transitional services are a separate supply or part of the supply of the business/land:
    *   The length of time the transitional services are to be provided for.
    *   The nature and extent of the services (for example if they are in the nature of a vendor being made available for "trouble-shooting", this is more likely to suggest that they are part of the same supply. On the other hand if they are more like the provision of a full-time consultant/manager this is more likely to suggest that they are an end in themselves).
    *   Whether the services are provided for in a separate contract with the payment of a separately identifiable fee. This item assumes that the services are provided in the same contract and without a separately identifiable consideration. A separate contract and consideration may suggest a separate supply. However, this would not be determinative.
    *   Where the agreement to provide transitional services is entered into subsequent to settlement of the sale of the business/land. This would suggest that the transitional services are provided as a separate supply.

### Examples

19.  The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law.

**Example 1 - Basic services provided as part of the sale of a business**

20.  Valerie Snips (a registered person) enters into an agreement with Sally Shears (a registered person) to sell her hairdressing business. The sale and purchase agreement includes the sale of the land and building where the hair salon is located. The agreement also provides that Valerie will be onsite for a week from the day of transfer to show Sally how the business operates, to answer any questions that Sally has and to facilitate a smooth transfer of the business. No separate consideration is provided for these transitional services in the agreement. How should these services be treated for GST purposes?
21.  The transitional services are part of the supply of the business and should be zero-rated under ss 11(1)(mb) and 5(24) along with the land and business. The dominant element of the agreement is the supply of the business (including land). The services are not extensive and are provided for only a short period of time. Further, the nature of the services is to facilitate a smooth transfer of the business to Sally. Consequently, the services provided are ancillary and incidental to the supply of the business. They do not constitute an aim in themselves, but rather are a means for Sally to better enjoy the supply of the business.

**Example 2 - Extensive services provided as part of the sale of a business**

22.  Sam Dryer (a registered person) enters into an agreement with Tim Cleaner (a registered person) to sell his dry cleaning business. The agreement includes the land and premises where the dry cleaning business is situated. Tim lives overseas and does not intend to run the dry cleaning business himself. Consequently, as part of the agreement Sam will manage the dry cleaning business for Tim for an initial period of 12 months. These services are included in the purchase price of the business. How should these services be treated for GST purposes?
23.  There are two supplies - one of the land/business and one of transitional services. The supply of these transitional services should be standard rated, as ss 11(1)(mb) and 5(24) do not apply. The services are relatively extensive and are provided over a 12 month period. They are an aim in themselves for Tim who requires someone to run the dry cleaning business on an on-going basis.
24.  As noted, no amount of consideration has been attributed to the transitional services. Therefore, the total consideration provided for under the agreement will need to be apportioned between the zero-rated supply (the business/land) and the standard rated supply (the transitional services).

Income tax - look-through companies: interest deductibility on funds borrowed to repay shareholder current accounts
===================================================================================================================

QB 12/08 considers interest deductibility when a look-through company borrows money on arm's length terms to repay current account loans from shareholders.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

This Question We've Been Asked applies in respect of ss DB 6 and HB 1.

### Question

1.  We have been asked whether interest is deductible where a look-through company (LTC) borrows money on arm's length terms to repay current account loans from its shareholders.

### Answer

2.  Interest will be deductible to the extent the borrowing replaces current account loans from shareholders that were used directly in the LTC's assessable or excluded income earning activity or business. This is subject to ss HB 11 and HB 12 and to paragraphs \[3\] and \[4\] below.
3.  The LTC must be carrying on an income earning activity or business for the purpose of deriving assessable or excluded income both at the time the funds are borrowed and at the time interest on those funds is payable.
4.  Interest will not be deductible to the extent the borrowed funds are used to replace current year income.

### Explanation

5.  The Commissioner has received inquiries from taxpayers asking when interest will be deductible where an LTC borrows to repay current account loans from its shareholders. This issue has arisen because some taxpayers have interpreted "look-through" to mean you simply ignore all transactions between the LTC and the owner of an effective look-through interest in the LTC. This would mean you look through the LTC to the owner's use of the funds. In many cases, this would mean the requirements for interest deductibility would not be satisfied.
6.  However, the Commissioner considers the above interpretation is incorrect. The Commissioner's view is that the owner's use of the funds received from the LTC for the repayment of a current account loan is not relevant to the issue of interest deductibility.

#### Discussion

_**Interest deductibility**_

7.  Usually a company would be entitled to an automatic interest deduction under s DB 7. However, LTCs are not companies for the purposes of s DB 7.
8.  A deduction for interest incurred may be available under s DB 6. Section DB 6 allows a deduction for interest incurred provided the general permission in s DA 1 is satisfied. Section DA 1 allows a deduction for interest incurred by a taxpayer in deriving their assessable income or incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving their assessable income. Section HB 1(4) provides that the LTC's activity is treated as being carried on by persons holding "effective look-through interests" in the LTC. Consequently, persons with effective look-through interests in the LTC will be entitled to any interest deductions that the LTC would have been entitled to (in the absence of s HB 1) in proportion to that person's effective look-through interest.
9.  The Commissioner's view is that the interest deductibility test is satisfied where a sufficient connection exists between the interest incurred and the assessable income. A sufficient connection will be established where borrowed funds are used to **replace** amounts invested in income-earning activities and to **repay** those amounts to the persons who invested them.
10.  This is established by _FC of T v Roberts; FC of T v Smith_ 92 ATC 4380. In this decision, the Full Federal Court of Australia held that a partnership could deduct interest payments to the extent it used the borrowed money to replace and repay amounts actually invested in it by the partners. By contrast, the court held that interest payments could not be deducted to the extent the partnership used the borrowed money to make payments out of unrealised asset revaluations or internally generated goodwill. This was because unrealised asset revaluations and internally generated goodwill were not amounts tangibly invested by the partners into the partnership - they were only account entries.
11.  In Public Rulings - BR Pub 10/14 - BR Pub 10/19 "Interest Deductibility ­- _Roberts and Smith_ \- Borrowing to replace and repay amounts invested in an income earning activity or business", published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 22, No 10 (December 2010), the Commissioner took the position that _Roberts and Smith_ is good law in New Zealand. The Commentary to Public Rulings - BR Pub 10/14 - BR Pub 10/19 extensively considers _Roberts and Smith._ Readers should consult the Commentary to better understand the Commissioner's view of _Roberts and Smith._ BR Pub 10/18 is the most relevant to the issues considered in this QWBA.
12.  Applying the principles in _Roberts and Smith_ to the scenario outlined in the question, the LTC has used the borrowed funds to replace and repay amounts the shareholders have invested in it by way of the current account loans. Therefore, in accordance with _Roberts and Smith,_ an interest deduction would be allowed.
13.  For completeness, it is necessary to note the effect of the expense limitation rule s HB 11 (commonly known as the "loss limitation rule"). This provision applies to LTCs. It operates to limit the deductions a person with an effective look-through interest can deduct in an income year. It applies to all deductions, including interest. Section HB 12 applies to allow a person with an effective look-through interest to carry forward any limited deductions into future years, subject to the expense limitation rule in s HB 11. Broadly speaking, the expense limitation rule ensures an owner can offset losses only to the extent these reflect their economic losses.

Income tax - look-through companies: interest deductibility where funds are borrowed to make a payment to shareholders to reflect an asset revaluation
======================================================================================================================================================

QB 12/09 considers look-through companies and interest deductibility where funds are borrowed to make a payment to shareholders to reflect an asset revaluation.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

This Question We've Been Asked applies in respect of ss DB 6 and HB 1.

### Question

1.  We have been asked whether interest is deductible where a look-through company (LTC) borrows money in the following circumstances:
    *   the LTC purchases an asset from which it derives income;
    *   the asset is subsequently re-valued above its purchase price; and
    *   the LTC uses the borrowed money to make payments to its shareholders reflecting the increase in the asset's value.

### Answer

2.  The principle from _FC of T v Roberts; FC of T v Smith_ 92 ATC 4380 will not justify a deduction for interest payments.  The borrowed money is making a payment out of an unrealised asset revaluation and, therefore, is not replacing and repaying amounts tangibly invested in the LTC by the shareholders.
3.  A deduction may be available under general interest deductibility principles where the relevant nexus is met (for example if the funds were advanced to shareholders at a market rate of interest).

### Explanation

4.  The Commissioner has received inquiries from taxpayers asking whether interest will be deductible where an LTC borrows to make payments to shareholders that reflect the increase in value in an asset owned by the LTC.

#### Discussion

_**Interest deductibility**_

5.  Usually a company would be entitled to an automatic interest deduction under s DB 7. However, LTCs do not qualify for the deduction under s DB 7.
6.  A deduction for interest incurred may be available under s DB 6. Section DB 6 allows a deduction for interest incurred provided the general permission in s DA 1 is satisfied. Section DA 1 allows a deduction for interest incurred by a taxpayer in deriving their assessable income or incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving their assessable income. Section HB 1(4) provides that the LTC's activity is treated as being carried on by persons holding "effective look-through interests" in the LTC. Consequently, persons with effective look-through interests in the LTC will be entitled to any interest deductions that the LTC would have been entitled to (in the absence of s HB 1) in proportion to that person's effective look-through interest.
7.  The Commissioner's view is that the interest deductibility test is satisfied where a sufficient connection exists between the interest incurred and the assessable income. A sufficient connection will be established where borrowed funds are used to **replace** amounts invested in income-earning activities and to **repay** those amounts to the persons who invested them.
8.  This is established by _FC of T v Roberts; FC of T v Smith_ 92 ATC 4380. In this decision, the Full Federal Court of Australia held that a partnership could deduct interest payments to the extent it used the borrowed money to replace and repay amounts actually invested in the partnership by the partners. By contrast, the court held that interest payments could not be deducted to the extent the partnership used the borrowed money to make payments out of unrealised asset revaluations or internally generated goodwill. This was because unrealised asset revaluations and internally generated goodwill were not amounts tangibly invested by the partners into the partnership - they were only account entries.
9.  In Public Rulings - BR Pub 10/14 - BR Pub 10/19 "Interest Deductibility -- _Roberts and Smith_ \- Borrowing to replace and repay amounts invested in an income earning activity or business", published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 22, No 10 (December 2010), the Commissioner took the position that _Roberts and Smith_ is good law in New Zealand. The Commentary to Public Rulings - BR Pub 10/14 - BR Pub 10/19 extensively considers _Roberts and Smith._ Readers should consult the Commentary to better understand the Commissioner's view of _Roberts and Smith._
10.  Applying the principles in _Roberts and Smith_ to the scenario outlined in the question_,_ the borrowed money has been used to make payments out of an unrealised asset revaluation.  As the revaluation has not been realised by sale, the increased value is only an account entry. Consequently, the borrowed funds have not been used to replace and repay amounts tangibly invested in the LTC by the shareholders. Therefore, in accordance with _Roberts and Smith,_ no interest deductions would be allowed.
11.  A deduction may be available under general interest deductibility principles where the relevant nexus is met. An example of this is where the funds borrowed were advanced to shareholders at a market rate of interest. In these circumstances deductibility does not rely on an application of the replace and repay principle from _Roberts and Smith_.

Do the historic depreciation rates continue to apply to grandparented structures acquired before 1 April 2005?
==============================================================================================================

QB 12/10 considers whether historic depreciation rates continue to apply to grandparented structures acquired before 1 April 2005.

### Question

1.  We have been asked whether the historic depreciation rates continue to apply to grandparented structures acquired before 1 April 2005, following the issue of determinations DEP79: _Remedial matters relating to the depreciation of buildings Depreciation Determination Number 79_ (“DEP79”) and DEP81: _Fertiliser storage facilities and remedial matters relating to the depreciation of buildings and grandparented structures_ (“DEP81”).

### Answer

2.  Yes. The historic depreciation rates continue to apply to grandparented structures acquired before 1 April 2005. DEP79 and DEP81 do not replace the historic depreciation rates. The historic depreciation rates that are published in IR 267 will always continue to apply to items acquired before 1 April 2005 (or to buildings acquired before 19 May 2005).

### Discussion

3.  Grandparented structures are items that have been regarded and treated as “structures” in the past for depreciation purposes, but now come within the meaning of “buildings” following the issue of Interpretation Statement IS 10/02: _Meaning of “building” in the depreciation provisions_ (“IS 10/02”).
4.  “Grandparented structure” is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”):
    *   **Grandparented structure** means, for a person, any item on the following list, if the person acquired the item, or entered into a binding contract for the purchase or construction of the item, on or before 30 July 2009:
        1.  barns, including barns (drying):
        2.  carparks (buildings):
        3.  chemical works:
        4.  fertiliser works:
        5.  powder drying buildings:
        6.  site huts
5.  The definition of “building” in section YA 1 of the ITA specifically excludes a grandparented structure for the purposes of subparts EE and EZ of the ITA.  So for depreciation purposes, those items listed as grandparented structures that were acquired, or entered into a binding contract for the purchase or construction of the item, on or before 30 July 2009 are not treated as buildings, despite them coming within the meaning of “buildings” in IS 10/02.  Any of these items acquired after that date are treated as a building.
6.  DEP79 and DEP81 set the rates applicable to these items acquired after 30 July 2009, by using the formula for calculating depreciation rates for buildings, to apply from the 2011-12 income year. DEP79 and DEP81 also clarify the rates that continue to apply to items acquired on or before 30 July 2009, by separating the asset classes into those acquired on or before 30 July 2009 and those acquired after that date.
7.  However, these two determinations do not replace the historic depreciation rates. The historic depreciation rates published in IR 267 are calculated using a different formula that must be applied to any items acquired before 1 April 2005 (or to buildings acquired before 19 May 2005).
8.  The following table is a compilation of the depreciation rates that correspond to the acquisition periods, applicable to the items listed as a “grandparented structure”:

|     | **Estimated useful life** | **Acquired before 1 April 2005** |     | **Acquired between 1 April 2005, and 30 July 2009 (both dates inclusive)** |     | **Acquired on or after 31 July 2009** |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Diminishing value % | Straight-line % | Diminishing value % | Straight-line % | Diminishing value % | Straight-line % |
| **Barns** | 20  | 9.5 | 6.5 | 10  | 7   | 8.5 | 5   |
| **Barns (drying)** | 20  | 9.5 | 6.5 | 10  | 7   | 8.5 | 5   |
| **Chemical works** | 33.3 | 6   | 4   | 6   | 4   | 4.5 | 3   |
| **Fertiliser works** | 33.3 | 6   | 4   | 6   | 4   | 4.5 | 3   |
| **Powder drying buildings** | 15.5 | 12  | 8   | 13  | 8.5 | 11  | 6.5 |
| Note: The asset classes "Carpark (buildings and pads)" and "Site huts" have been reviewed following the issue of IS 10/02. The asset class "Carpark (buildings and pads)" has been split into "Carparking buildings" (treated as a building) and "Carparking pads" (continues to be treated as a structure). Site huts, by their very nature, will be either portable huts or portable buildings. Therefore, two new asset classes replace the asset class "Site huts": "Buildings (portable)" and "Portable huts (not buildings)". See the notes to DEP79 for more information. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| **Carparking buildings** | 50  | 4   | 3   | 4   | 3   | 0   | 0   |
| **Carparking pads** | 50  | 4   | 3   | 4   | 3   | 4   | 3   |
| **Buildings (portable)** | 12.5 | 15  | 10  | 16  | 10.5 | 13.5 | 8   |
| **Portable huts (not buildings)** | 12.5 | 15  | 10  | 16  | 10.5 | 16  | 10.5 |

Income tax - look-through companies, rental properties and avoidance
====================================================================

QB 12/11 confirms that section BG 1 would not apply to a particular arrangement involving look-through companies and rental properties.

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.

This question we've been asked applies in respect of s BG 1.

### Question

1.  We have been asked whether s BG 1 would apply to the following arrangement:
    *   a person sells their family home to a look-through company (LTC);
    *   the home is used by the LTC as a rental asset and is rented to a third party on an arm's length basis;
    *   the person owns 100% of the shares in the LTC;
    *   the sale of the home is at market value;
    *   the LTC borrows from a bank to fund the purchase;
    *   the person then uses the funds raised from the sale to purchase a new family home;
    *   the person, in their capacity as holder of an effective look-through interest in the LTC, is able to deduct the interest incurred by the LTC on the loan.

### Answer

2.  As the property has been rented to a third party on an arm's length basis, the Commissioner's view is that s BG 1 would not apply to the above arrangement.
3.  If an arrangement were to vary materially from the arrangement outlined in the question above, or if there were other relevant facts that might materially affect how the arrangement operates, then the Commissioner would need to consider the matter further and a different outcome might apply.

### Explanation

#### Background

4.  In 2011, the Commissioner published QB 11/03: "Income tax - look-through companies and interest deductibility" _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No 10 (December 2011):16.
5.  This item considered whether interest deductions previously allowed would continue to be allowed where a loss-attributing qualifying company (LAQC) becomes a LTC if:
    *   a person had previously sold their family home to a LAQC as a rental asset;
    *   to be rented to a third party on an arm's length basis;
    *   the person owned 100% of the shares in the LAQC;
    *   the sale of the home was at market value;
    *   the LAQC borrowed from a bank to fund the purchase;
    *   the person then used the funds raised from the sale to purchase a new family home;
    *   the LAQC becomes a LTC.
6.  QB 11/03 concluded that interest deductions previously allowed would continue to be allowed, subject to the limitation on deductions in ss HB 11 and HB 12. The item also commented that the position would be the same where a person sells their family home at market value directly to the LTC.
7.  Since the publication of QB 11/03, we have been asked whether s BG 1 would apply where a person sells their family home at market value directly to a LTC.

### Discussion

#### Interest deductibility

8.  QB 11/03confirms that, on the facts set out in the item, interest is deductible under s DB 6. This is because, in the Commissioner's view, there is a sufficient connection between the interest incurred and the assessable income.
9.  The fact that the LTC is tax transparent for income tax purposes does not affect deductibility. Section HB 1(4) attributes the actions of the LTC to the person in their capacity as holder of an effective look-through interest. This means that for income tax purposes the person is treated as borrowing the funds to acquire the rental property. As a result, the person is entitled to the interest deductions, subject to the limitation on deductions in ss HB 11 and HB 12.
10.  Section HB 1(4) does not operate in reverse. The person's use of the borrowed funds in their personal capacity (in this case, to purchase a new family home) is not attributed to the LTC. The person's use of the borrowed funds in their personal capacity is irrelevant to the issue of interest deductibility on the borrowed funds.

#### Section BG 1 - tax avoidance

11.  Section BG 1 applies to void a tax avoidance arrangement. It is the Commissioner's view that s BG 1 will not apply to the arrangement outlined in the question above. However, if an arrangement were to vary materially from that outlined, or if there are other relevant facts that would materially affect how the arrangement operates, then the Commissioner would need to consider the matter further and a different outcome might apply.
12.  The Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd & Ors v CIR; Accent Management Ltd & Ors v CIR_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, (2009) 24 NZTC 23,188, set out the approach to be used to determine whether an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement under s BG 1. The approach, known as the "Parliamentary contemplation test", is to ask whether the tax outcomes are what Parliament would have intended for the provisions used or circumvented, having regard to the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement.
13.  The first step in this test is to identify the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement.In the arrangement outlined in the question above, a LTC borrows from a bank to buy a rental property. The rental property is purchased by the LTC at market value. The LTC then carries on a genuine rental activity, renting to a third party on an arm's length basis. The reality is that interest is incurred on funds borrowed to purchase a rental property. The interest is economically incurred, in that the arrangement is not structured in a way that allows the person to be reimbursed for the interest paid out. This is not a situation where the loan or the interest paid is not at arm's length or not at market value. In other words, the loan really is used to purchase a rental property and the interest is genuinely incurred.
14.  The second step is to identify Parliament's purpose for the provisions used. Parliament's purpose for the general deductibility provision was discussed in _Accent Management Limited & Ors_ v _CIR_ \[2007\] NZCA 230, (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323. The Court of Appeal said the deductibility provision applies when a person "incurs real economic consequences" of the type contemplated by Parliament when the rules were enacted. Case law has established that there must be a sufficient nexus between the expenditure incurred and the income earning process for the expenditure to be deductible (see, for example, _CIR v Banks_ (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236). Therefore, the purpose of the deductibility provision is that income that is otherwise taxable should be reduced by any expenses that are truly incurred in deriving that income to arrive at the amount of net income received.
15.  Parliament's purpose in enacting the LTC regime was to introduce an income tax treatment for closely-held companies that allows an owner of a company to obtain the benefits of limited liability while permitting that owner to be taxed at their own marginal tax rate. Shares in a LTC can only be held by individuals, trusts or other LTCs. Furthermore, a LTC can only have five or fewer look-through owners. So it was clearly envisaged that LTCs would be used by taxpayers (some who might own 100% of the shares in the LTC) who wanted the protection of limited liability while at the same time being able to take advantage of lower personal tax rates.Parliament intended that the LTC regime apply to closely-held companies and that, despite the entity being "transparent" for income tax purposes, the company would be recognised as a separate entity.
16.  Putting the two steps of the "Parliamentary contemplation test" together: the reality is that the LTC suffers a real economic cost in incurring interest, and it is incurred in the derivation of income. The shares in the LTC are held by one person so the company is closely-held. This is the type of shareholding that the LTC regime was intended to apply to. Accordingly, the commercial reality and economic effects are within Parliament's purpose for the deductibility provision and the LTC regime.
17.  The nature of the asset (the house) fundamentally changes for tax purposes. It changes from a private asset (accommodation for the person and their family) to an income-earning asset (a rental property). This is so, even though the funds borrowed by the LTC are ultimately used by the person to purchase a new family home, and even though, were it not for the existence of the LTC in this case, the interest deductions would not be allowed.
18.  The arrangement outlined in the question above can be contrasted with the arrangement in Revenue Alert RA 07/01 where a person rents their family home back to themselves. In more detail, the facts in Revenue Alert 07/01 were that a person, who was also the sole shareholder of the LAQC, sold their family home to a LAQC. The person then rented back their family home from the LAQC at a market rate. Following this, the LAQC tried to claim income tax deductions for the related property costs. It is the Commissioner's view that s BG 1 would apply in this situation. The commercial reality and economic effects of this arrangement is to make private expenses deductible by purporting to engage in a rental activity. The Act does not intend that private expenses should be deductible. Therefore the deductibility provision is not being used as Parliament intended.
19.  The Commissioner's view is that the situation in the Revenue Alert is quite different from the facts in the present question. In this question, the person has structured their arrangement in a way that achieves deductibility. The person has sold their family home to a LTC. The property is then used by the LTC as a rental property, rented to a third party on an arm's length basis. The borrowing to fund the purchase is deductible because the property is used by the LTC to derive assessable income.

2012
Date of issue: 4 December 2018 UNCLASSIFIED Question When will goods and services supplied in connection with the repatriation of human remains from New Zealand be zero-rated? Answer Services supplied in connection with the repatriation of human remains (such as cremation and embalming services) will be zero-rated where: • The services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand when the services are performed; and • The remains will not be received by a third party in New Zealand (and it was not reasonably foreseeable when the contract was entered into that a third party would receive the remains in New Zealand). Goods (such as caskets and urns) exported by the supplier are zero-rated. Explanation 1. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. 2. Public Information Bulletin (PIB) 168 “GST on Human Remains for Repatriation” (January 1988: 5) stated that work performed on human remains to be repatriated overseas could not be zero-rated. The reason given was that human remains are “moveable personal property” situated in New Zealand when the services are performed. The Commissioner is now of the view that this is not correct and, in certain circumstances, the goods and services can be zero-rated. QB 18/15 GST - When will goods and services supplied in connection with the repatriation of human remains from New Zealand be zero-rated? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED As part of our review of Public Information Bulletins, this QWBA updates and replaces PIB 168 “GST on Human Remains for Repatriation” (January 1988: 5). Key provisions Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: ss 11(1)(a)–(e), (4) and (5), 11A(1)(k), 11A(2), and 11A(3). QB 18/15: 4 Dec 2018 2 UNCLASSIFIED When services can be zero-rated 3. The relevant provision in this context is s 11A(1)(k) (which is subject to s 11A(2)). For the types of services being considered, s 11A(1)(k) will apply where: • the services are supplied to a non-resident; • the recipient is outside New Zealand when the services are performed; • the services are not supplied directly in connection with land in New Zealand; • the services are not supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property; and • the performance of the services will not be received in New Zealand by a third party (and it is not reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement is entered into that the performance of the services will be so received). 4. These requirements are considered below. Services supplied to a non-resident outside New Zealand 5. The services will be supplied to a non-resident if the contract for services is entered into with a non-resident. 6. As well as being a non-resident, that person must be “outside New Zealand” at the time the services are performed. For a non-resident company or unincorporated body, “outside New Zealand” includes a minor presence in New Zealand, or a presence that is not effectively connected with the supply (s 11A(3)). 7. For a natural person, “outside New Zealand” includes a minor presence in New Zealand that is not directly in connection with the supply. Services not supplied directly in connection with land in New Zealand 8. Services supplied “directly in connection with land” are not able to be zero-rated. Certain services provided “in connection with land” are also unable to be zero-rated; however, these are unlikely to be relevant in this context. 9. In the context of the repatriation of human remains, it is unlikely that any of the services provided would be directly in connection with land. However, if instead of repatriating the remains, the funeral home arranges for burial in New Zealand, that service would be directly in connection with land. Consequently, it would not be zero-rated. Services not supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property in New Zealand 10. Services are not able to be zero-rated if they are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand. PIB 168 stated that work performed in New Zealand by funeral directors on human remains that are to be repatriated could not be zero-rated because the services are performed on moveable personal property (being the human remains) which are in New Zealand when the services are performed. The correctness of this has been questioned. 11. “Property” is relevantly defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed) as “a thing or things belonging to someone” and “ownership”. There is case law considering whether there is “property” in a dead body. 12. In Takamore v Clarke \[2011\] NZCA 587; \[2012\] 1 NZLR 573, the Court of Appeal considered who had the right to determine where a body would be buried. In the course QB 18/15: 4 Dec 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED of the judgment the Court discussed the issue of whether there is property in a body (footnotes omitted): \[199\] At common law an executor has the duty to dispose of the body of the deceased. The application of this common law duty has not been modified by statute in New Zealand. Section 24 of the Administration Act 1969 states that all of the estate of a deceased person vests in the administrator of the estate. This provision does not alter the clear common law position that the estate does not include the body of the deceased, and that the obligation to dispose of the body is an obligation imposed under the common law. \[200\] It is generally accepted that there is no property in the body of a deceased. However, as the executor has the duty to dispose of the body of the deceased, he or she therefore has the right to possession of the deceased’s body for the purpose of final disposal. The right to possession of the dead body is directed towards the ancillary duty of ensuring a proper burial, providing an exception to the “no property in a dead body” rule. \[Emphasis added\] 13. Similar observations were made in Re JSB (A Child) \[2010\] 2 NZLR 236 (HC). And in Public Trustee v Kapiti Coast Funeral Home Ltd \[2004\] 3 NZLR 560 (HC), the Court stated: \[11\] Some discussion of the law as to rights and duties in relation to a dead body is desirable as background to the analysis of liability for funeral expenses. At common law, there is no property in a deceased body, and a person cannot by will dispose of his or her dead body – Williams v Williams (1882) 20 Ch D 659 at p 665. There is no statutory provision which would modify this position in New Zealand. \[Emphasis added\] 14. Therefore, under the common law, there is no property in a dead body. There are no statutes that change this as a general proposition. In the Commissioner’s view, as there is no property in a human body, the body cannot be property. No one can own a body and a body cannot belong to anyone. If a body cannot be property, it follows that it cannot be “moveable personal property”. As such, services provided in connection with a human body will not be excluded from zero-rating under s 11A(1)(k)(ii). Performance of the services will not be received in New Zealand by a third party 15. Section 11A(2) will apply to prevent zero-rating where the performance of services will be received in New Zealand by a third party (ie, not the contractual recipient of the services). Section 11A(2) will also apply where it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement is entered into that the performance of the services will be received in New Zealand by a third party (regardless of whether this, in fact, occurs). 16. In the Commissioner’s view, a person will receive the performance of cremation or embalming services where they take possession of the remains. The performance of the services will not be received in New Zealand if the remains are exported overseas by the funeral home. 17. In some cases a service will be held in New Zealand before the repatriation. In the Commissioner’s view, performance of the associated services (venue hire, celebrant etc) will be received in New Zealand by those attending the service and cannot be zero-rated. In the Commissioner’s view these services will generally be separate supplies from the supply of embalming or cremation services. However, if there is any uncertainty, the principles to be applied are set out in Interpretation Statement IS 17/03 “Goods and Services Tax – Single Supply or Multiple Supplies” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017)). QB 18/15: 4 Dec 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED When goods can be zero-rated 18. The main goods that could be supplied in relation to the repatriation of human remains are caskets and urns. The standard rules for zero-rating exported goods in s 11 apply. Section 11(1)(a)-(e), 11(4) and 11(5) are particularly relevant. 19. In summary, the supply of goods will be zero-rated where they have either been exported (by the supplier) or will be exported (by the supplier) in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply. The applicable time period for exporting goods is 28 days from the time of supply (or a longer period that the Commissioner has allowed). 20. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Examples Example 1 – Relative in New Zealand contracts for repatriation services 21. Sally and John moved to New Zealand 10 years ago when they retired. However, when the time comes, both want to be buried in England where they were born. When John dies, Sally contracts with ABC Funeral Home (ABC) to have John embalmed and his remains repatriated to England. 22. The services provided by ABC are standard-rated as Sally is a New Zealand resident and is in New Zealand when the services are performed. The sale of the casket to transport John’s body will be zero-rated if it is exported by ABC. Example 2 – No presence in New Zealand 23. Sally (from Example 1) dies a year later. Sally’s sister Edith from Liverpool arranges for a Liverpool funeral home to contract with ABC to repatriate Sally’s remains. ABC performs the embalming, obtains the necessary permits and documentation, and repatriates Sally’s remains to England. 24. The services provided by ABC are zero-rated as the contract is entered into with a non-resident. Also, the services are not received by the third party in New Zealand. The sale of the casket to transport Sally’s body will also be zero-rated as it is exported by ABC. Example 3 – Performance of services received in New Zealand 25. Sid is on holiday from Perth when he dies while travelling around New Zealand. Sid’s travel insurance provider contracts with ABC to have Sid cremated. Sid’s wife Penny flies to New Zealand to collect Sid’s ashes from ABC and fly home with them. 26. The services provided by ABC are standard-rated as the performance of the services is received in New Zealand by Penny. The sale of the urn to carry Sid’s ashes is also standard-rated as it is not exported by ABC. Example 4 – Person in New Zealand not receiving performance of the services 27. Mario and Luca are travelling in New Zealand when Mario dies. Mario’s travel insurance provider (a UK resident) contracts with ABC to have Mario QB 18/15: 4 Dec 2018 5 UNCLASSIFIED embalmed and his remains repatriated to Scotland. ABC performs the embalming, obtains the necessary permits and documentation, and repatriates Mario’s remains to Scotland. 28. Luca remains in New Zealand throughout the process and arranges to fly home on the same flight as Mario’s body. 29. The services provided by ABC are zero-rated. The contract is entered into with a non-resident (the insurance company) who has no presence in New Zealand. Also, although Luca is in New Zealand while the services are being performed and accompanies Mario’s body on the flight home, he does not receive the performance of the services in New Zealand. The sale of the casket to transport Mario’s body will also be zero-rated as it is exported by ABC. Example 5 – Funeral services performed in New Zealand 30. Margaret has been living in New Zealand for the past 20 years. When she dies her brother from Canada contracts with ABC to organise a small funeral service for Margaret so that her friends can say goodbye. Following the service, Margaret’s body will be cremated and her ashes sent back to Canada. 31. The services in relation to the funeral are standard-rated as their performance is received in New Zealand by Margaret’s friends. The cremation services are zero-rated as no one receives the performance of those services in New Zealand (the remains are sent back to Margaret’s brother in Canada). The sale of the urn is also zero-rated as it is exported by ABC.

The farmland exclusion will apply where the land is, or could in its current state, be used for a farming or agricultural business carried on by the owner. Lifestyle blocks are generally not farmland. 2. The main home exclusion will apply where: • More than 50% of the area of the land has been used for the seller’s main home. This includes curtilage and other land used for residential purposes; and • The land has been used in that manner for more than 50% of the time the seller owned it. Explanation The bright-line test 1. The bright-line test taxes residential land sold within the bright-line period. QB 18/17 Income tax — bright-line test — farmland and main home exclusions — sale of lifestyle blocks This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) explains when lifestyle blocks sold within the bright-line period will be excluded from the bright-line test. It will be of interest to sellers seeking to rely on the farmland or main home exclusions. Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007, ss CB6A, CB 16A and YA 1 definitions: “farmland”, “residential land” Key terms Bright-line period: The bright-line period is 2 years or 5 years, depending on the rules in place when the seller acquired the land. Bright-line test: The bright- line test applies to tax sales of residential land occurring within the bright-line period. Curtilage: An area of land attached to a dwelling and forming one enclosure with it, such as a yard or garden. Main home: A dwelling that is mainly used as a home by the seller and, if the seller has more than one, the home with which the seller has the greatest connection. QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 18/17: 19 December 2018 2 UNCLASSIFIED 2. The bright-line test applies to residential land that a person first acquired an interest in on or after 1 October 2015. The period of the bright-line test increased from 2 years to 5 years for residential land that a person first acquired an interest in, on or after 29 March 2018 (see s 6(2) of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018). Therefore, this QWBA refers to the “bright-line period” which will be 2 years or 5 years, depending on when the seller first acquired an interest in the land. Scope of this QWBA 3. This QWBA is about when the sale of a lifestyle block is excluded from the bright-line test. It considers the farmland and main home exclusions as these are the most relevant exclusions in this context. The business premises exclusion is not discussed in this QWBA. 4. In this QWBA it is assumed that: • there was a dwelling on the land that was the seller’s main home; • none of the other land rules in ss CB 6 to CB 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to the sale of the land (eg, s CB 6, which applies to the sale of land acquired for the purpose of re-sale). The bright-line test potentially applies only where the sale is not taxed under any of the other land rules; and • none of the exceptions to the main home exclusion apply (see \[40\]). 5. Additionally, for simplicity this QWBA assumes that the person disposing of the land is not the trustee of a trust. However, the analysis and conclusions in this QWBA are equally applicable if: • The person disposing of the land is the trustee of a trust, and • The dwelling was the main home for a beneficiary of the trust; and either o A principal settlor of the trust does not have a main home; or o The dwelling was the main home of a principal settlor. 6. The flowchart summarises the main steps when determining whether the bright-line test applies to a lifestyle block. These steps address the question of whether the land is farmland and the application of the main home exclusion. The flowchart assumes that the lifestyle block is residential land if it is not farmland, and that none of the exceptions to the main home exclusion apply. QB 18/17: 19 December 2018 3 UNCLASSIFIED Flowchart: Steps to determine whether the bright-line test and main home exclusion apply to a sale of a lifestyle block within the bright-line period Is the seller carrying on a farming or agricultural business? Is the lifestyle block being worked in the seller’s farming or agricultural business? Does the lifestyle block include an area of land that is presently suitable to be worked as a farming or agricultural business, without significant investment or modification? Has more than 50% of the area of the lifestyle block been used for, in connection with, or for the benefit of a dwelling that was the seller’s main home? Has the condition above been true for more than 50% of the time the seller has owned the lifestyle block? Main home exclusion does not apply. Bright-line test applies to disposal. The lifestyle block is farmland. The disposal is not subject to the bright-line test. Main home exclusion applies. The disposal is not subject to the bright-line test. No No No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes QB 18/17: 19 December 2018 4 UNCLASSIFIED Is a lifestyle block “farmland”? 7. The bright-line test applies to sales and other disposals of “residential land”. The definition of residential land relevantly excludes “farmland”. Therefore, if a lifestyle block is “farmland”, it is not subject to the bright-line test. 8. “Farmland” is defined. To be “ farmland”, an area of land needs to be land that: • is being worked in the farming or agricultural business of the land’s owner; or • because of its area and nature, is capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business. 9. The first limb of the “farmland” definition focuses on the actual use of the land, while the second limb focuses on the qualities of the land. The criteria in the definition of farmland are objective. The onus is on the seller to prove the land is farmland and, therefore, that the bright-line test does not apply. Because “residential land” is defined for the bright-line test only, it follows that the time for testing whether land is farmland is when the bright-line test applies; that is, at the time the land is sold. 10. Farmland can include land that has a dwelling on it. In determining if the land is farmland there is no apportionment between the area of land used for the dwelling and the area of land used for farmland. Land is either farmland or not farmland. Therefore, if a lifestyle block is farmland, it is not subject to the bright-line test because it is not residential land. When is a lifestyle block being worked in the farming or agricultural business of the seller? 11. Under the first limb of the definition, a lifestyle block will be farmland if it is being worked in the farming or agricultural business of the seller. T his requires the seller to be able to show that: • they are carrying on a farming or agricultural business, and • the lifestyle block is being worked in that business. 12. The Commissioner considers that in the context of the bright-line test and the definitions of residential land and farmland, a farming or agricultural activity is being carried on when a lifestyle block is being used for: • cultivating and growing crops, including horticulture and viticulture, • breeding or rearing livestock, including poultry and bee keeping, or • forestry. 13. In addition, t he farming or agricultural activity must be carried on as a business. 14. The leading case on the meaning of “business” is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA). Grieve concerned a farming activity that, ultimately, did not generate profits. Richardson J interpreted “business” as meaning an activity carried on in an organised and coherent way with an intention to make a profit. A person’s intention to make a profit will be evidenced by their conduct. Factors that are relevant for determining if a person is carrying on a business include: • the nature of the activity being engaged in; • the period over which the activity is engaged in; • the scale of operations; • the volume of transactions; QB 18/17: 19 December 2018 5 UNCLASSIFIED • the commitment of time, money and effort; • the pattern of activity; and • the financial results. 15. Whether a lifestyle block is being worked in the farming or agricultural business of the seller is a question of fact. Many owners of lifestyle blocks will keep animals or grow crops or trees on their land, but if the livestock or produce of the activity is not sold (or not intended to be sold), then there will be no business activity. Even if the livestock or produce is sold, the owner may not be able to demonstrate that they are carrying on that activity in an organised and coherent way with the intention to profit from the activity, as is required for the activity to be a business. For many lifestyle block properties, the size and nature of the property will limit the scale of operations that can be carried on, which will make it difficult to satisfy the business test. 16. The first limb of the “farmland” definition requires that the land is “being worked in the farming or agricultural business of the land’s owner”. This means the seller of the lifestyle block must be engaged in a farming or agricultural business and the land must be “being worked” in that business. The business requirement can be satisfied if the lifestyle block is being worked, in conjunction with other land that is owned or leased by the seller, in their business. However, this requirement would not be satisfied where the land is merely being rented to someone else who carries on a farming or agricultural business. When is a lifestyle block, because of its area and nature, capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business? 17. The second limb of the “farmland” definition includes land that, “because of its area and nature”, is capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business. This requires consideration of both the area and the nature of the land together to determine if the land is capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business. 18. Whether a lifestyle block is an area capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business depends on the proposed activity the seller considers it capable for. The seller needs to evaluate whether the area of the lifestyle block is sufficient to enable it to be worked as a farming or agricultural business when considering the proposed activity. The larger the area of the lifestyle block, then potentially the larger the scale of any farming or agricultural activity and the greater the likelihood that the proposed activity will constitute a business. It would be difficult for the seller to show a lifestyle block is capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business if the area of the block means it would not be capable of producing a profit when used for the proposed activity. In establishing whether the land being sold has an area and nature capable of being worked in a farming or agricultural business it needs to be considered in isolation from other parcels of land. 19. The Commissioner considers, based on CIR v Bruhns (1989) 11 NZTC 6,075 (CA), that the words “is capable of being” in para (b) focus on the existing or present nature of the lifestyle block at the date of sale, rather than any unrealised potential in the lifestyle block. This means a lifestyle block that requires significant investment or modification to be used in the proposed activity does not have the nature to make it capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business, and the lifestyle block would not qualify as farmland. 20. The onus is on the seller to prove that the lifestyle block at the date of sale has an area and nature presently capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business and is, therefore, farmland not subject to the bright-line test. In practice, the seller would need to have a particular farming or agricultural business that they argue the lifestyle block is capable of being used for. They would also have to show QB 18/17: 19 December 2018 6 UNCLASSIFIED that any investment or modification needed to carry on that activity is not significant. This will be a question of fact. 21. There may be situations where the owner of land that is farmland lives in the farm house and leases the majority of the land to someone else to farm. In such cases, all of the land, including the farm house, will be generally regarded as farmland and the sale of the land will not be taxed under the bright-line test. Is a lifestyle block “residential land”? 22. The definition of residential land includes: • land that has a dwelling on it; • land for which the owner has an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling; or • bare land that is allowed to have a dwelling on it under the relevant operative district plan. 23. And, as noted above, the definition of residential land relevantly excludes farmland. Can the main home exclusion apply to a lifestyle block? 24. The main home exclusion can apply to a lifestyle block. The main home exclusion will apply if the lifestyle block has been used predominantly, for most of the time the seller owns it, for a dwelling that was the seller’s main home. The onus is on the seller to prove the main home exclusion applies and, therefore, that the bright-line test does not apply. 25. The main home exclusion in s CB 16A(1) provides: CB 16A Main home exclusion for disposal within 5 years Main home exclusion (1) Section CB 6A does not apply to a person who disposes of residential land, if the land has been used predominantly, for most of the time the person owns the land, for a dwelling that was the main home for— (a) the person; or (b) a beneficiary of a trust, if the person is a trustee of the trust and— (i) a principal settlor of the trust does not have a main home; or (ii) if a principal settlor of the trust does have a main home, it is that main home which the person is disposing of. \[Emphasis added\] 26. The main home exclusion has a number of elements, which are discussed below. 27. The land in the lifestyle block must have been used predominantly for a dwelling that was the seller’s main home for more than 50% of the seller’s period of ownership. “Main home” is defined in s YA 1 . 28. There are three points to note about the “main home” definition: • A person can only have one “main home” under this definition. • To be the “main home” of a person, a dwelling must be mainly used as a residence by the person (ie, a home). • If the person has more than one home, the main home is the home with which the person has the greatest connection. QB 18/17: 19 December 2018 7 UNCLASSIFIED 29. The Commissioner’s guidance on the “permanent place of abode” test can assist in determining which property the seller has the greatest connection with. That guidance is in “IS 16/03: Tax residence” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2. 30. Land that is “used... for a dwelling” is not limited to the land on which the dwelling is situated or to the surrounding curtilage (like a yard and garden). Land used for a dwelling can also include other areas the seller uses frequently, repeatedly or customarily in connection with or for the benefit of the dwelling. In the Commissioner’s view, for an area of land to be “used for a dwelling” the land must be actually used for the dwelling. It is the actual use of the land, rather than any intended use, that is relevant. 31. The extent to which residential land is used in connection with or for the benefit of a dwelling is a question of fact that turns on the circumstances of each case. Factors that may indicate land is being used for a dwelling include whether the land is: • set aside exclusively for private residential purposes, • being used for an activity that complements or adds to the enjoyment of the dwelling, • clearly identifiable as being used in connection with or for the benefit of the dwelling, and • incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling. 32. In the case of a lifestyle block, examples of land that is used for a dwelling (other than the house and curtilage) are: • areas set aside for growing food for domestic use, • areas for pet animals, and • areas used to enhance the enjoyment or aesthetic value of the dwelling (eg, in the context of an average-sized (4 ha) lifestyle block, a reasonable amount of park land or covenanted native bush that is used to provide a green vista, retaining or shelter would be an area that enhances the enjoyment of a dwelling). 33. Another example of land used for a dwelling is land used for hobby farming on a lifestyle block. For the purposes of this QWBA, hobby farming refers to a farming or agricultural activity undertaken by the seller on land that does not m eet the definition of “farmland” (eg, because the area of the land used for the activity is too small to sustain a farming or agricultural business). 34. For the main home exclusion to apply, the land in the lifestyle block needs to have been used predominantly for a dwelling that was the seller’s main home. This is a question of fact and the test is a physical area test. The test involves a comparison of the physical area of land used for the dwelling and the total area. “Predominantly” in this context means more than 50%. 35. The leasing or licencing of part of the lifestyle block to another person will not necessarily mean that that part is not used for the dwelling, as long as the other person’s use of the land is complementary to the seller’s enjoyment of the property (eg, where a neighbour has grazed some animals on the seller’s land to keep the grass down) and the seller continues to use the land as a matter of fact. 36. However, in some cases, the leasing or licencing of part of the lifestyle block may mean that the seller is effectively excluded from using that part of the land as a matter of fact. QB 18/17: 19 December 2018 8 UNCLASSIFIED 37. The Commissioner considers that it will typically be difficult for the seller to show that part of the seller’s lifestyle block that is leased to someone else with exclusive possession is used for the seller’s dwelling. If the area of land not used for the seller’s dwelling exceeds 50% of the total area of the land the sale will be subject to the bright-line test. 38. From time to time, particularly where the split between the seller’s private residential use of the land in the lifestyle block and their use of the land in the lifestyle block for other purposes is close, the nature and the importance of the different uses could be taken into account to determine the seller’s predominant use. The Commissioner considers this is the best interpretation of the exclusion because it is consistent with the scheme of the land rules and the purpose of the provision. It also takes into account case law on the interpretation of words like “predominantly” in the context of the land rules. 39. The words “for most of the time the person owns the land” require a comparison between the length of time the land was predominantly used for a dwelling by the seller and the length of time the seller owned the land. “Most” means more than 50%. Exceptions to the main home exclusion 40. There are two exceptions that may prevent the main home exclusion applying (see s CB 16A(2)). 41. These exceptions are considered in “QB 16/07: Income tax – land sale rules – main home and residential exclusions – regular pattern of acquiring and disposing, or building and disposing” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 9 (October 2016): 4. Briefly, the exceptions are where: • The seller has already used the main home exclusion two or more times within the two years immediately preceding the bright-l ine date (eg, in the case of a sale of land, within 2 years of the date the sale agreement is entered into). • The seller has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential property that was their main home. QB 18/17: 19 December 2018 9 UNCLASSIFIED Examples The following examples assume that the property has been used as the seller’s main home for all the time they owned the property and that the exceptions to the main home exclusion do not apply. Example 1: Land that because of its area cannot be used as farmland Marama had a 1 hectare property that she sold within the bright-line period. The property had a house that she used as her main home. The property also had a small area of grazing land and a larger area of native bush. She kept a few sheep on the grazing land to keep the grass down. The property was not farmland because it wasn’t being worked in a farming or agricultural business carried on by Marama. Nor, given the size of the property, could Marama argue it was capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business. The property was a hobby farm, not farmland. The main home exclusion is available to Marama because more than 50% of the area of the property was used for her dwelling. The grazing land was an area for her hobby-farming activity, and the area of native bush was used to enhance her enjoyment and the aesthetic value of her dwelling. Therefore, the sale of Marama’s property within the bright-line period will not be taxed under the bright-line test. Example 2: Plot of land that is farmland Uri had a 5 hectare property that he used for a commercial rose growing business. A small area of the land is used for his house and the garden around it. The property is farmland because it was being worked in Uri’s agricultural business. The sale of Uri’s property (including the house) within the bright-line period will not be taxed under the bright-line test because the land is not residential land. Example 3: Part of property leased to an avocado grower Tom and Jess had a 2 hectare property that they sold within the bright-line period. The land included 1.5 hectares of avocado trees with shelter belts. The balance of the land was used for a house that Tom and Jess used as their main home as well as a flower garden, a vegetable garden and a paddock for grazing Jess’s two horses. The avocado trees were leased to an avocado-growing company that looked after the trees including spraying the trees, mowing between the rows of trees and picking the fruit. The lease gives exclusive possession to the avocado-growing company and Tom and Jess do not go into the avocado orchard. The property was not farmland because: • It was not being worked in an agricultural business carried on by Tom and Jess (rather, it was being worked in the avocado-growing company’s agricultural business); and • In this case, the 1.5 hectares of avocado trees was not of sufficient scale to be capable of being carried on as an avocado-growing business given the number of avocado trees on the land. The main home exclusion is not available to Tom and Jess because less than 50% of the area of the property is used for their dwelling. The dwelling, its flower garden, the vegetable garden and the land for grazing the horses are all physically used for purposes in connection with the enjoyment of the dwelling, QB 18/17: 19 December 2018 10 UNCLASSIFIED rather than for any other purposes. However, most of the land (75%) was leased to the avocado-growing company and was not used for Tom and Jess’s dwelling. Therefore, the sale by Tom and Jess of the property within the bright- line period will be taxed under the bright-line test.

19 March 2019 UNCLASSIFIED Question What are the requirements for claiming tax deductions for payments to family members for services? Answer To claim a tax deduction for payments to family members for services: • the family member must provide services to your business; • the amount paid must not be excessive; and • if the family member is your spouse or partner, you must have the Commissioner’s prior approval for a deduction unless you run your business through a company. Explanation 1. You cannot split the income you earn between your family members for income tax purposes. To claim a tax deduction for payments to a family member for services, the family member must provide services to your business and the amount paid must not be excessive. You must not pay the family member more than what you would pay a non-family member for the same services. In addition, if the family member is your spouse or partner, you must have the Commissioner’s prior approval for a deduction unless you run your business through a company. 2. This QWBA replaces three items: • “Wages paid to spouse who cooks for permanent employees—deductibility” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 1 (July 1994): 5; Key terms Your business means any business or other income earning activity carried on by you on your own account, in partnership, or through a company. Close company means a company controlled by five or fewer natural persons. Partner means civil union partner or a de factor partner Spouse means a married partner QB 19/01 What are the requirements for claiming tax deductions for payments to family members for services? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) is about claiming tax deductions for payments to family members for services. It will be of interest to those paying family members for services from a business or other income earning activity. Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007, ss DC 5, GB 23 and GB 25. Note: Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. QB 19/01: 19 March 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED • “Details to be supplied to Inland Revenue when seeking a deduction for payments to spouse” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 7 (December 1994): 2-3; and • “Reasonable wages—payments to spouse” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996), 28. Family members 3. Family members are: • your spouse or partner; • your parents, children, sisters, brothers, grandchildren, and grandparents and the spouses and partners of those persons; • your spouse or partner’s parents, sisters, brothers, grandchildren, and grandparents; • yours and your spouse or partner’s adoptive parents, adopted siblings, children, and grandchildren; • the trustee of a trust that any of these people has or can benefit under. Family member must provide services to your business 4. You must be able to show that the family member provided services to your business. This is even if you have the Commissioner’s prior approval to deduct the payment (see \[9\]-\[17\]). Depending on the circumstances, the types of evidence that might be relevant include: • a wage book or diary (manual or electronic) recording the dates, hours worked, and nature of the services provided by the family member; • a vehicle log book recording the dates and nature of business travel undertaken by the family member and other documentation supporting the purpose of the travel such as invoices for parking and other services or goods acquired or provided on the dates travelled; • copies of any PAYE payment information; • an employment contract or contract for services; • if the family member is an independent contractor or otherwise in business on their own account, invoices detailing the nature and extent of the services provided; • bank statements or other documents showing the amounts you paid to the family member for the services provided. Payments must not be excessive 5. The amount paid must not be excessive for the services the family member provides. This includes where you have the Commissioner’s prior approval for a deduction and subsequently the amount you pay your spouse or partner, or the hours they work, or the nature of the services they provide changes (see \[9\]-\[17\]). If the amount paid is excessive, the Commissioner may reallocate the income of the business based on what is considered reasonable and, in the case of a company, treat the excess as a dividend derived by the family member (ss DC 5(3), GB 23, GB 24, and GB 25). QB 19/01: 19 March 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED 6. The Commissioner considers payments to family members for services to be excessive when the amount paid is more than a reasonable amount for the services provided. This is explained in “QB 14/09: Income tax – meaning of ‘excessive remuneration’ and ‘excessive profits or losses’ paid or allocated to relatives, partners, shareholders or directors” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 9 (October 2014): 22. 7. Exemptions may apply in the case of: • contracts of employment, engagement, or partnership meeting certain requirements (s GB 24); • an adult employed substantially full-time in the business of a close company and who manages or administers the company, provided the amount they are paid is not influenced by their relationship with a shareholder or director (s GB 25(3)). 8. The exemptions are explained in QB 14/09 at \[20\] and \[52\]. Commissioner’s prior approval 9. If the family member is your spouse or partner, you must have the Commissioner's prior approval for a deduction, unless you run your business though a company (s DC 5−see \[11\]). Approval is required whether you pay your spouse or partner a salary or wages, a commission, or another amount for services. 10. Approval may be granted only if: • the Commissioner considers the payment is for services rendered; • the services are not domestic services or otherwise services connected with the home, although, if you are a farmer, the Commissioner may approve a deduction for amounts you pay your spouse or partner to cook for farm employees; • the services are provided in earning income from your business; • a deduction for the payment has not been claimed. 11. Section DC 5 provides: DC 5 Payments to spouses, civil union partners, or de facto partners: services No deduction without approval (1) A person is denied a deduction for a payment to their spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner for services without the Commissioner’s approval. When Commissioner can give consent (2) The Commissioner may approve the deduction only if— (a) the Commissioner considers that the payment is for services rendered; and (b) the services are not domestic services or otherwise services connected with the home; and (c) the payment is incurred by the person exclusively in deriving their assessable income; and (d) the approval is granted before the deduction is claimed. Relationship with section GB 23 (3) This section is overridden by section GB 23 (Excessive remuneration to relatives). QB 19/01: 19 March 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED Link with subpart DA (4) This section overrides the general permission. 12. You may apply for approval to deduct payments you have already made during an income year. You have up until the time you file your tax return to get approval. However, it may be a good idea to apply before you start paying your spouse or partner. The Commissioner cannot backdate approval after a deduction has been claimed in your tax return. Even if the amount paid is not excessive, a deduction claimed without prior approval is denied and your spouse or partner will still need to treat the payment as income. 13. You must make a new application for approval if you increase the amount you pay your spouse or partner. Otherwise, you do not have to make a new application for approval every year. 14. To apply for approval, you need to send the Commissioner details of: • the nature of your business; • full details of the services your spouse or partner provides; • the average number of hours your spouse or partner works each week and the number of weeks worked each year; • if others provide the same services to your business as your spouse or partner, details of the services the others provide and the payments you make for them; and • the amount you pay your spouse or partner and how the amount is paid (for example, at regular intervals or periodically or by crediting an account). 15. Whether your spouse or partner provides services as an employee or independent contractor, similar details are required. Send the details to Inland Revenue using your preferred method of contact (see Inland Revenue’s website for contact details: www.ird.govt.nz). 16. The Commissioner will grant approval if satisfied the payments are for services rendered and if the other requirements of s DC 5 are met (see \[10\]). 17. If you run your business through a company, prior approval is not required to deduct payments to your spouse or partner for services. However, services must be provided and the amount paid must not be excessive. Examples 18. The following four examples explain how the law applies. QB 19/01: 19 March 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED Examples Example 1 – Payments made to spouse or partner for services Year 1 Jan carries on a business as a florist. Jan employs spouse Sam to help with deliveries during weekends. Jan keeps a diary and records the hours Sam works and the deliveries Sam performs and pays Sam a market wage. Jan deducts PAYE and ACC premiums and pays the net amount to Sam electronically at the end of each month. At the end of the income year, before filing an income tax return, Jan applies to Inland Revenue for approval to deduct the payments made to Sam. Inland Revenue grants approval for Jan to deduct the wage paid to Sam because: • Jan supplies the required details about Sam’s employment to Inland Revenue; • the services Sam provides are not domestic services and Jan incurs the payment exclusively in deriving assessable income; • the payments are not excessive compared with the amount of wages paid to delivery drivers performing similar kinds of deliveries. Jan files an income tax return claiming a deduction for the payments. Year 2 In the next income year, Sam agrees to do bookwork for Jan’s business as well as helping with deliveries. Jan increases Sam’s wages for the additional hours and services Sam provides. Jan does not get Inland Revenue’s approval to deduct the increased payment before filing an income tax return claiming a deduction. A new application for approval is required because the increase in Sam’s wages is due to additional hours and services Sam provides. A deduction for the increased payment is not allowed because Jan did not receive Inland Revenue’s prior approval. Sam must still treat the increased payment as income. Example 2 – Amounts paid to children Talla and Filo operate a dairy farm in partnership. They employ their 13-year old son to help on the farm and pay him monthly. Talla and Filo advise their son helps with milking, weed control, calf rearing, bringing in cows for milking, and farm maintenance about 10 hours per week. Talla and Filo keep a wage book for other employees. However, it does not contain any record of work done by their son. Without wage book entries or other evidence to support the work done by their son, Talla and Filo have not shown they are entitled to deduct the amounts they pay him. Their son must still treat the amounts Talla and Filo pay him as income. QB 19/01: 19 March 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED Example 3 – Amount paid by company to director and shareholder’s partner Jed carries on a printing business through his company Zeb Ltd. Jed works full time in the business. His civil union partner Soul is primarily responsible for their four children. Zeb Ltd employs Soul and pays him fortnightly. Zeb Ltd files its tax return claiming a deduction for the amount paid to Soul. Soul files his tax return including the amounts received from Zeb Ltd as income. During an audit, Inland Revenue asks what services Soul provided to the business. Jed responds with a list of tasks, including preparing GST returns, banking, issuing invoices, taking phone inquiries and following up debtors. Jed has kept a diary of the hours Soul spent preparing Zeb Ltd’s GST returns. However, neither the diary nor any other available evidence shows Soul having undertaken any of the other tasks. Zeb Ltd is allowed a deduction for a reasonable portion of the amount paid to Soul, based on the nature and value of services Soul has provided. The excess will be treated as a dividend derived by Soul as he is related to Zeb Ltd’s director and shareholder Jed. Example 4 – Amount paid by real estate agent to spouse Ashley is a licensed real estate agent. Ashley employs de facto partner Mel, a licensed salesperson. Mel assists Ashley with open homes, phone inquiries, cold calling and other real estate agency work. Ashley does not pay Mel a regular wage but shares real estate commissions from property sales with Mel. Ashley and Mel file income tax returns for the year: • Ashley returns real estate commissions received as income and claims a deduction for the amount paid to Mel. • Mel returns the amount received from Ashley as income. Ashley has not obtained Inland Revenue’s prior approval to deduct the amount paid to Mel. Therefore, Ashley cannot deduct the share of commission paid to Mel.

13 June 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What is required to establish and maintain a fund under s LD 3(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007? Answer In the Commissioner’s view, a fund under s LD 3(2)(c) requires or involves the following: • The fund must be established and maintained by a non- profit entity. • The fund must comprise an actual stock of money or other assets set aside for the purpose of providing money for one or more specified purposes within New Zealand. • A non-profit entity can set up such a fund by making book entries in its financial accounts but it must ensure the entries are supported by an actual stock of money or other assets and show that the fund has been set up on a “firm or permanent basis” for the required purpose. Best practice suggests a fund is established and maintained through a combination of book entries and a document setting out terms for the establishment, operation and winding up of the fund (either as part of the rules of the non-profit entity or as a stand-alone document). QB 19/10 Donations: What is required to establish and maintain a fund under s LD 3(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED A person donating money to a donee organisation can receive tax benefits. A donee organisation includes a fund established and maintained exclusively for providing money for specified purposes within New Zealand. This item considers what is required to establish and maintain such a fund so it qualifies as a “donee organisation”. The item complements the Commissioner’s statement IS 18/05: Income tax: donee organisations – meaning of wholly or mainly applying funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. Key provision Section LD 3(2)(c): A donee organisation includes a fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for one or more specified purposes within New Zealand. The fund must be established and maintained by a non-profit entity. Key terms Donee organisation means an entity or fund described in s LD 3(2) or listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. New Zealand does not include Niue, the Cook Islands, Tokelau or the Ross Dependency of Antarctica. Non-profit entity is a society, institution, association, organisation or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. Required purpose means the provision of money for a s LD 3(2)(c) fund’s specified purposes within New Zealand. Specified purposes means charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes. Key tax benefit If a person makes a gift of money of $5 or more to a donee organisation, they can receive a refundable tax credit or an income tax deduction. QB 19/10: 13 June 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED • Maintaining the fund requires maintaining the actual stock of money or other assets consistent with any book entries, as t he fund’s actual stock of money or other assets at its establishment may change over time. Best practice suggests movements of the money or other assets in the fund are tracked and specifically reported on in the non- profit entity’s financial accounts. • The fund’s money must be used for, or used to provide money for, the required purpose. Whether money is used for the required purpose is determined by where the specified purposes are advanced (ie, within New Zealand) and not where the fund’s money is spent. The fund’s money may be used: o for purposes other than the required purpose, but only if those other purposes are subordinate or incidental to the required purpose and are not independent purposes; o by the non-profit entity to meet or reimburse costs it incurs specifically in administering the fund. This includes a contribution to meet a reasonable share of the non-profit entity’s administration costs where such costs include the costs of administering the fund; or o by the non-profit entity to meet or reimburse costs it incurs furthering the entity’s own purposes, provided these are exclusively specified purposes within New Zealand and are consistent with the purposes of the fund. • The fund must be maintained for the required purpose throughout its lifetime, including the disposal of the fund’s money or other assets if wound up. Explanation Introduction 1. This item is about donee organisation status under the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act). Taxpayers who make gifts of money to an entity or fund with donee organisation status under the Act can generally get tax advantages. Subject to limits, the tax advantage for an individual is a refundable tax credit of one-third of their gifts of $5 or more to donee organisations each year, under ss LD 1 and LD 2. Companies and Māori authorities making such gifts can get a deduction for the gift under ss DB 41 or DV 12. 2. Donee organisation status can apply to an entity or a fund. For example, a society, institution, association, organisation or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual (a non-profit entity) can be a donee organisation under s LD 3(2)(a) of the Act if the entity applies its funds “wholly or mainly” to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes (specified purposes) within New Zealand. (For more details on qualifying under s LD 3(2)(a), see Interpretation Statement IS 18/05: Income tax: donee organisations – meaning of wholly or mainly applying funds to specified purposes within New Zealand (September 2018) (IS 18/05).) 3. A fund established and maintained by a non-profit entity can also have donee organisation status under s LD 3(2)(c) of the Act, provided the fund is established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for one or more specified purposes within New Zealand (the required purpose). It may be an option where a non-profit entity’s situation is such that qualification for donee organisation status under s LD 3(2)(a) may not be possible. A fund held on trust could qualify for donee organisation status under either s LD 3(2)(a) or s LD 3(2)(c) (although, in the latter case, the fund has to be exclusively for specified purposes within New Zealand). QB 19/10: 13 June 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED 4. This item only concerns the donee organisation status of a fund under s LD 3(2)(c) of the Act (the key provision). The key provision applies to: (c) a fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand set out in paragraph (a), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual: 5. The key provision refers to certain purposes within New Zealand set out in another paragraph of the legislation: s LD 3(2)(a). These purposes are “charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes” (ie, specified purposes). 6. This item considers the following terms used in the key provision: • Fund (see \[12\] to \[20\]) • Established (see \[21\] to \[25\]) • Maintained (see \[26\] to \[28\]) • Exclusively (see \[29\] to \[31\]). 7. None of these terms are defined in the Act. Nor have their meanings been judicially considered in the context of s LD 3(2) or any corresponding predecessor provisions. Some of the terms have, however, been judicially considered in other contexts and jurisdictions as noted below. The relevance of these authorities must be considered in light of the context and purpose of the key provision. 8. The practical implications of the key terms are considered under the heading “what this means in practice” from \[32\]. These include: • how a non-profit entity can establish a fund that qualifies as a donee organisation under s LD 3(2)(c) (see \[32\] to \[36\]); • what the non-profit entity must do to maintain such a fund (see \[ 37\] to \[43\]); and • whether a donee organisation under s LD 3(2)(a) could establish: o a s LD 3(2)(c) fund (see \[45\] to \[48\]) ; or o an “overseas fund” (see \[49\] to \[50\]). 9. Following that, there is an example of the matters that should be considered when establishing and maintaining a s LD 3(2)(c) fund. 10. This item does not consider the following terms: • “charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes”; and • “a society, institution, association, organisation or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual”. 11. T his item also does not consider whether the establishment of a s LD 3(2)(c) fund is permitted under the governing documents or terms applicable to the relevant entity. Analysis Fund 12. The ordinary meaning of the term “fund” suggested by the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) is “a sum of money saved or made available for a particular purpose”. QB 19/10: 13 June 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED 13. The United Kingdom Court of Appeal decision in Allchin v Coulthard \[1942\] 2 All ER 39 is a commonly cited authority on the meaning of the term. In Allchin v Coulthard, Lord Greene considered “fund” had two meanings (at 44): The word “fund” may mean actual cash resources of a particular kind (e.g., money in a drawer or at a bank) or it may be a mere accountancy expression used to describe a particular category which a person uses in making up his accounts. ... A fund in the second sense is merely an accountancy category. It has a real existence in that sense, but not in the sense that a real payment can be made out of it as distinct from being debited to it. 14. In Rapid Metal Developments (NZ) Ltd v Rusher (1987) 2 PRNZ 85, McGechan J in the New Zealand High Court considered (at 93) dictionary definitions of “fund”, including the following definition in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary ( vol 1, p 817 (1972)): 3. Sources of supply; a permanent stock that can be drawn upon 4(a) sing. A stock or sum of money, esp. One set aside for a particular purpose (b) Pecuniary resources. 15. McGechan J considered that in Allchin v Coulthard Lord Greene’s second meaning of fund as an accountancy category extended the dictionary definition. McGechan J also considered that the applicable meaning, including whether Lord Greene’s extended meaning applied, depended on the context. McGechan J stated (at 93): The meaning of “fund” is not necessarily restricted to such dictionary sense of actual stock or sum of money set apart. It can be “a mere accountancy expression used to determine a particular category which a person uses in making up his accounts” Allchin v Coulthard \[1942\] 2 KB 228, 234, per Lord Greene MR. ... In short, to constitute an \[sic\] “fund” it is not necessary to set aside actual coin. An accountancy device will suffice. ... The word “fund” can vary in meaning according to context. 16. McGechan J considered that, under any meaning, the essential features of a fund are purpose and retention (at 94): The underlying feature of a “fund” so exemplified is that it is an aggregation of money or an accounting device directing money to a particular purpose, and that such money is still so held or still so allocated for that purpose. On this common usage approach, the essential features are purpose and retention. 17. Where the fund in question involves an actual stock of money or other assets, the assets of the fund need not be static, and the fund’s composition may be subject to additions, reductions or alterations (see Case NT 96/409 \[1998\] AATA 895 at \[35\] and Scottish Widows plc v Revenue and Customs Commissioners \[2012\] 1 All ER 379 (SC) at \[55\]). This means, at any time, a fund under s LD 3(2)(c) may comprise not only money received from donations that qualified for tax advantages, but also other money and other assets donated or acquired. 18. An example where the context limits the meaning of the term fund to the first of Lord Greene’s meanings, in preference to his extended meaning of the term, is found in the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision in Newcastle City Council v Caverstock Group Pty Ltd \[2008\] NSWCA 249. Referring to Allchin v Coulthard (CA), the court decided that the word “fund” in the relevant context did not include a mere accounting entry (at \[23\] to \[24\]). See also, the Australian cases referred to in \[23\] below. 19. In the Commissioner’s view, the context of s LD 3(2)(c) and its purpose suggest a meaning of “fund” limited to that of the dictionary, in preference to Lord Greene’s extended meaning of the term. That is, a s LD 3(2)(c) fund must be an actual stock of money or other assets set aside for the required purpose. This includes, for example, a fund represented by a credit balance in a bank account. 20. The Commissioner considers the purpose of the legislation is to encourage giving in society and to relieve government of some of the burden of providing the goods and services to society that are delivered by entities and funds with donee organisation QB 19/10: 13 June 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED status (see: IS 18/05 at \[123\] to \[135\]). This purpose suggests a fund in the sense of actual money or assets, comprising or including gifts of money to the fund, from which a real payment can be made to provide goods and services to society, rather than an accounting entry. Established 21. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines the ordinary meaning of “establish” as including to “set up on a firm or permanent basis” or to “initiate or bring about”. 22. Case law in the context of Australian legislation, which allows a deduction for amounts an employer “sets apart as or to a fund” for the benefit of employees, is considered helpful in the current context. This is because setting apart amounts as or to a fund seems analogous to what is required to “establish” a fund. 23. The Australian cases in this context suggest it may be possible to establish a fund by way of accounting entries, without the need for legal separation of the money or other assets of the fund (eg, into a trust). However, actual benefits secured in favour of the employees must exist (or, in the current context, an actual stock of money or other assets comprising the fund must exist). See, for example, Winchcombe Carson v FCT (NSW) (1938) 5 ATD 69 (NSWSC) (at 73–74), Northern Timber and Hardware (1960) 103 CLR 650 (HCA) (at 657) and FCT v P Iori and Sons Pty Ltd 87 ATC 4775 (FCAFC) (at 4789). 24. Case law also suggests that where a fund and its terms are evidenced by a written document (such as a deed of trust), the fund will not be “established” until there is an actual stock of money or other assets, despite the document being executed. See, for example, Walstern Pty Ltd v FCT \[2003\] FCA 1428 (FCA) (at \[51\]), JD Mahoney v FCT (1965) 13 ATD 519 (HCA) (at 525), Lend Lease Corporation Ltd v FCT (1990) 21 ATC 402 (FCA) (at 409) and British Insulated & Helsby Cables v Atherton \[1926\] AC 205 (PC) (at 214). 25. The Commissioner also considers that the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in Re Greenpeace New Zealand Incorporated (\[2012\] NZCA 533 (CA), \[2014\] NZSC 105 (SC)) applies in the context of s LD 3(2)(c). In these cases, an organisation was accepted as being capable of changing its rules to become “established” as a charity. This means that an existing fund that may not have been eligible for donee organisation status under s LD 3(2)(c) when first established, could become eligible when it could be shown that the fund was now established exclusively for the required purpose. Maintained 26. In s LD 3(2)(c), the term “maintained” bears its ordinary meaning suggested by, for example, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary definition of “maintain”, which is to “cause or enable (a condition or state of affairs) to continue”. This suggests that a fund established exclusively for the required purpose must continue to exist for that purpose. This would be shown by considering the use or uses to which the fund’s money or other assets are put. Maintaining the fund also suggests maintaining on an ongoing basis the existence of the actual stock of money or other assets, consistent with any book entries recording the fund’s continued existence. 27. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers it appropriate, in the context of whether a s LD 3(2)(c) fund is being maintained for the required purpose, to consider the use or uses made of the fund’s money or other assets. In this context, whether the money is used for the required purpose is determined by where the specified purposes are advanced (ie, within New Zealand) and not where the fund’s money is spent (see: IS 18/05 at \[218\] – \[223\]). New Zealand in this context does not include Niue, the Cook Islands, Tokelau or the Ross Dependency of Antarctica. QB 19/10: 13 June 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED 28. Also, in the Commissioner’s view, the need to maintain the fund for the required purpose applies at all times throughout the lifetime of the fund and in the event of the fund’s cessation. In the latter case, this means that if the fund was wound up, the fund’s money and other assets would need to be used for the required purpose. This could include the money and assets being passed to, or used to establish, another fund under s LD 3(2)(c). Exclusively 29. In s LD 3(2)(c), the term “exclusively” bears its ordinary meaning suggested by, for example, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary of “limited to a specific thing or group” or “excluding or not admitting other things”. 30. This would mean the required purpose (ie, providing money for one or more specified purposes within New Zealand) must be the sole purpose of the fund. 31. However, case law in the context of whether an organisation is exclusively charitable suggests that purposes other than the required purpose could be ignored if they are subordinate or incidental to the required purpose and are not independent purposes of the fund. See, for example, The Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales v Attorney-General \[1971\] 3 All ER 1029 (CA) (at 1047), CIR v New Zealand Council of Law Reporting (1981) 5 NZTC 61,053 (CA) (at 61,057) and Latimer v CIR (2004) 1 NZTR 14-003 (PC) (at \[36\]). See also, s 5 (3) of the Charities Act 2005 (Meaning of charitable purpose and effect of ancillary non-charitable purpose). What this means in practice Establishing a fund 32. A non-profit entity looking to establish and maintain a fund that qualifies as a donee organisation under the key provision must be able to show that the fund meets the requirements of an actual stock of money or other assets set aside on a firm and permanent basis for the required purpose. The establishment and maintenance of the fund also needs to be within the purposes and powers of the non-profit entity. 33. As a general matter, establishing a fund does not necessarily require written documentation. However, it is unlikely that the Commissioner would be satisfied that a fund meets the requirements of the key provision in the absence of written documentation. 34. The Commissioner also considers that it is preferable for there to be more than just book entries to support the establishment of the fund. The Commissioner’s view is that best practice would be to have, in addition to book entries, a founding document setting out terms for the establishment, operation and winding up of the fund, to show that the specific requirements of the key provision are met. This could be in the form of changes to the non-profit entity’s own founding or governing documents, or a separate document or documents detailing the terms of the establishment, operation and winding up of the fund. The documents would help satisfy the Commissioner that the fund’s establishment and intended operation meet the key provision’s requirements (see the example below). This practice may also give greater confidence to the fund’s potential donors and help reduce the possibility that they will have to demonstrate their donation is eligible for tax benefits. 35. From 1 April 2020, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the requirements of the key provision are met by the fund for it to be included on the list of donee organisations published by the Commissioner under s 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. From that date, the fund’s name must be on this list for it to qualify as a donee organisation under the key provision. The onus will be on the entity to ensure that it satisfies the requirements of the key provision in order to obtain and maintain its listing. QB 19/10: 13 June 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED 36. Also from 1 April 2020, a donee organisation ( including a fund under s LD 3(2)(c)), must be registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, it is eligible to register. Guidance on the application of these additional requirements applying from 1 April 2020 is to be published separately. Maintaining a fund 37. Once established, the fund must be maintained for the required purpose. Adequate record keeping on an ongoing basis must show any changes in the composition of the fund and how the fund’s money or other assets have been used for the required purpose. As the money or other assets of the fund at its establishment may change over time, maintaining the fund requires maintaining the actual stock of money or other assets comprising the fund, consistent with book entries showing movements of the fund’s money and other assets. A suggested approach would be for the movements in the fund to be specifically reported on in financial accounts of the non-profit entity by showing the balance of the fund brought forward from the prior year, donations and other additions to the fund, expenditure and transfers out of the fund, any other gains or losses and the closing fund balance. 38. The records kept may include accounting entries in the financial accounts of the non- profit entity. However, it may be preferable to keep the fund, and in particular the fund’s money, separate from the non-profit entity’s other money and assets, for instance, by having a separate bank account fo r the fund. This would make it easier to show that there is an actual stock of money and show that the purposes of the fund have been maintained over time (by seeing how the money in the account has been used). 39. It would also be preferable for donors to clearly indicate they are intending to make a donation to the fund, to avoid any doubt over whether the donation is to the fund or to the non-profit entity (if the circumstances are such that doubt could arise). 40. As to the uses of the money in the fund, the fund must be used for, or used to provide money for, the required purpose. This would include providing money to the non-profit entity that maintains the fund provided this is exclusively for the advancement of specified purposes within New Zealand and consistent with the fund’s purposes. 41. The Commissioner is also aware of the following questions that have been raised about the use of the fund’s money: • Can the non-profit entity use the fund’s money to meet or reimburse costs it incurs specifically relating to administering the fund? • Can the non-profit entity make a charge against the fund’s money to reimburse it for a reasonable share of the non-profit entity’s administration costs, where such costs include the costs of administering the fund? • Can the fund’s money be used to meet any other costs incurred by the non-profit entity? 42. The Commissioner considers that the fund’s money can be used to meet or reimburse costs specifically relating to administering the fund. The Commissioner also considers that the fund’s money can be used to meet a charge for a share of administration costs incurred by the non-profit entity apportioned to the fund on a reasonable basis where those costs include the costs of administering the fund. In all cases, the Commissioner considers these uses of the fund’s money would not jeopardise the fund’s donee organisation status. In the Commissioner’s view, the use of the fund’s money for such administration costs advances, or is subordinate or incidental to advancing, the required purpose. QB 19/10: 13 June 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED 43. Use of the fund’s money to meet any other costs incurred by the non-profit entity may advance the required purpose, but only if the fund’s terms permit this and the costs advance purposes that are exclusively specified purposes within New Zealand and consistent with the fund’s purposes. Care would be needed if the non-profit entity’s purposes included purposes other than specified purposes within New Zealand. This is because using the fund’s money to contribute to the non-profit entity’s costs could mean the fund’s money advances a purpose or purposes other than the required purpose. This would be contrary to the key provision’s requirement for the fund to be “exclusively” for the required purpose and the donee organisation status of the fund would be jeopardised. For more information on when money is considered to be applied to specified purposes within New Zealand (including apportionment issues) see IS 18/05 at \[245\] to \[280\] and examples on 51 – 56. Issues concerning s LD 3(2)(a) donee organisations operating a fund 44. The Commissioner is also aware of two issues concerning funds and donee organisations under s LD 3(2)(a). The issues are whether such donee organisations could establish and maintain: • a fund under s LD 3(2)(c); or • a fund specifically for purposes outside of New Zealand (an “overseas fund”). Whether a donee organisation under s LD 3(2)(a) could establish a s LD 3(2)(c) fund 45. An entity that is a donee organisation under s LD 3(2)(a) could establish a fund under s LD 3(2)(c) if it wished to do so (subject to the terms of its founding or governing documents). The entity would need to weigh the benefits of doing so against the possibility that establishing the fund may detract from the entity’s ability to qualify as a donee organisation under s LD 3(2)(a). 46. If the s LD 3(2)(c) fund is not legally separated from the funds of the s LD 3(2)(a) donee organisation, the fund still belongs to that donee organisation. This means the fund would still be counted when determining whether the donee organisation applies its funds “wholly or mainly” to specified purposes within New Zealand, as required by s LD 3(2)(a). In relation to meeting the latter requirement, in IS 18/05 the Commissioner has confirmed that a “safe harbour” of 75% or more will be applied, so that an entity will generally be accepted as meeting the “wholly or mainly” requirement if that safe harbour threshold is met. Creating a s LD 3(2)(c) fund would not alter how the “wholly or mainly” requirement and safe harbour applies to the s LD 3(2)(a) donee organisation. 47. If the s LD 3(2)(c) fund is legally separated from the funds of the s LD 3(2)(a) donee organisation (eg, the fund is a separate trust fund), the fund would not be counted as part of the donee organisation’s funds under s LD 3(2)(a). However, this may then make it difficult for the s LD 3(2)(a) donee organisation to meet the “wholly or mainly” requirement and the safe harbour threshold. 48. In some circumstances, it may be beneficial f or an entity that is currently a s LD 3(2)(a) donee organisation to establish a fund under s LD 3(2)(c) so that the entity does not need to maintain its current donee organisation status. For example, if the entity has non-donation income, it could then apply all or any of this income to overseas purposes, while accepting donations to a s LD 3(2)(c) fund established and maintained exclusively for specified purposes within New Zealand. Depending on the relative amounts of the income streams, this may allow the entity to apply more funds to overseas purposes than it could otherwise have done if all of its funds were subject to the “wholly or mainly” requirement under s LD 3(2)(a). Another outcome would be that the entity is relieved of the need to maintain its compliance with that requirement. QB 19/10: 13 June 2019 9 UNCLASSIFIED Whether a donee organisation under LD 3(2)(a) could establish an “overseas fund”? 49. The converse situation to that just discussed is where a donee organisation under s LD 3(2)(a) establishes a separate bank account as an “overseas fund”. That is, the s LD 3(2)(a) donee organisation establishes a fund for purposes other than the required purpose. As with the previous situation, unless the money comprising the overseas fund is legally separated from the funds of the donee organisation the money in the overseas fund stays that of the donee organisation. As a result, establishing the overseas fund would not alter the extent to which the donee organisation applies funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. In other words, the organisation’s ability to meet the 75% or more “safe harbour” set out in IS 18/05 would be unaltered by setting up the separate overseas fund. This is because the funds in the overseas fund’s bank account would still count as funds belonging to the donee organisation when it comes to working out under s LD 3(2)(a) how much of the organisation’s funds have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. 50. If the s LD 3(2)(a) donee organisation’s overseas focus has become such that it can no longer meet the “wholly or mainly” requirement of s LD 3(2)(a), it may wish to consider whether it can seek listing in sch 32 of the Act as an “overseas donee organisation”. For more information on sch 32 listing see: IS 18/05 at \[112\]. QB 19/10: 13 June 2019 10 UNCLASSIFIED Example The following example is included to help explain the application of the law. It gives an indication of the matters that need to be considered when establishing and maintaining a s LD 3(2)(c) fund. XYZ Inc is a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005 whose rules let it pursue its charitable purposes within New Zealand and overseas. The Board of XYZ Inc, which governs the charity and is entitled to exercise the charity’s powers, decides to set up a fund to pursue its charitable objects within New Zealand. The Board intends for the fund to have donee organisation status under s LD 3(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Board resolves to change XYZ Inc’s rules (subject to member approval if required under the rules) to provide for the establishment of the fund and set the rules by which the fund is to be maintained. The changes to the rules cover the following matters: Establishment of the fund • A fund (the “NZ Purposes Fund”) is to be established and maintained exclusively for providing money for charitable purposes within New Zealand that fall within XYZ Inc’s charitable purposes. • For donors to the NZ Purposes Fund to get tax benefits under the Income Tax Act 2007 and its amendments, the fund must be established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes within New Zealand. • From 1 April 2020, the name of the fund must appear on the list published by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under s 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 so donors to the fund can continue to receive tax benefits. The Board must take all reasonable measures to make sure the name of the fund appears and remains on the list. • The Board will make sure the fund is established and maintained by arranging a separate bank account for the fund ( called the “NZ Purpose Fund Account”) and making sure that: o all donations to the fund, and any other moneys intended for the fund are deposited to the NZ Purposes Fund Account; o all moneys in the NZ Purposes Fund Account are applied exclusively to advancing XYZ Inc’s charitable purposes within New Zealand; and o no moneys in the NZ Purposes Fund Account are transferred or withdrawn and deposited to any other bank accounts used by XYZ Inc, unless such money’s are to be used by XYZ Inc to advance charitable purposes within New Zealand consistent with the purposes of the NZ Purposes Fund. Maintaining the fund – record keeping, reporting and issuing of receipts • The Board will make sure that adequate records are kept on the setting up and operation of the fund. These will show the date, amount and source of all donations and other moneys deposited to the NZ Purposes Fund Account and the date, amount, nature and purpose of all debits and withdrawals from the NZ Purposes Fund Account. Records will also be kept of the basis for, and calculation of, any contribution charged against the NZ Purposes Fund Account to meet a reasonable share of XYZ Inc’s administration costs where such costs include the costs of administering the fund. • Movements of the money or other assets in the fund are to be tracked and specifically reported on in XYZ Inc’s financial accounts. QB 19/10: 13 June 2019 11 UNCLASSIFIED • The Board will make sure that where gifts of money of $5 or more are deposited to the NZ Purposes Fund Account, the donors are given a receipt that: o has XYZ Inc’s official stamp or letterhead; o is signed by an authorised person; o bears the words “Donation”; o ha s the donor’s full name; o includes the date and amount of the donation; o includes the relevant IRD number and/or Charities Registration number (preferably both); o has an endorsement that the donation is “Exclusively for XYZ Inc’s NZ Purposes Fund Account”. • Where any donation has been received partly for the NZ Purposes Fund and partly for other purposes, the Board will make sure that the donation is deposited accordingly, that separate receipts are issued and that the receipt for the NZ Purposes Fund Account meets the above requirements. • Where a receipt for the NZ Purposes Fund Account is re-issued as a replacement, it must be clearly marked “copy” or “replacement”. Closure of the fund • The Board will make sure that if the NZ Purposes Fund Account is closed, all money in the account at closure will be transferred to another account or accounts established and maintained under the same rules as set out for the NZ Purposes Fund Account. • Alternatively, if the NZ Purposes Fund Account is closed and its money is not transferred to any other such account, the funds must be applied in their entirety for charitable purposes within New Zealand. Changes affecting the tax status of the fund • The rules concerning the establishment and maintenance of the fund cannot be altered or removed in a manner that would adversely affect the availability of tax benefits to donors under the Income Tax Act 2007. Nor can the operation of the NZ Purposes Fund Account (or any replacement account or accounts) change without the Board obtaining assurance that the alteration, removal or change does not affect the status of the fund under the Income Tax Act 2007 and the availability of tax benefits to donors. • If there is any change that adversely affects the status of the fund under the Income Tax Act 2007 and the availability of tax benefits to donors, the Board will make sure: o the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is notified of the change; and o XYZ Inc stops giving receipts to donors to the NZ Purposes Fund Account.

QB 19/12: 28 August 2019 UNCLASSIFIED Question What is the FBT, GST and income tax treatment of an employee contribution to a fringe benefit? Answer The answer depends on: • whether the employee makes a full or partial contribution to the value of the fringe benefit; and • who the employee makes the payment to. The consequences are summarised below: Partial contribution Full contribution Fringe benefit tax The taxable value of the fringe benefit is reduced by the contribution. The reduced taxable value of the benefit is subject to FBT and is included in the employer’s FBT return. The taxable value of the fringe benefit is reduced to nil so there is no FBT liability. GST on the fringe benefit GST is imposed on the taxable value of the fringe benefit (the value of the fringe benefit less the contribution). This amount is paid in the employer’s FBT return and is deemed to be FBT. The taxable value of the fringe benefit is reduced to nil so there is no GST liability. GST on contributions to employers A contribution made to the employer is consideration for a supply by the employer and must be accounted for in the employer’s GST return. A contribution to a third party will not be consideration for a supply by the employer. Income tax A contribution made to the employer is income of the employer and must be included in the employer’s income tax return, net of GST. The employer may claim relevant deductions relating to the fringe benefit. A contribution to a third-party will not be income of the employer. Key terms Employee contribution: an amount an employee pays for receiving a fringe benefit Taxable value: the value of a fringe benefit for income tax and GST QB 19/12 What is the fringe benefit tax, GST and income tax treatment of an employee contribution to a fringe benefit? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This item will be of interest to employers who provide fringe benefits to their employees, where the employees contribute to the value of the benefit. Employees may make a full or partial contribution to the value of the fringe benefit. Employee contributions may affect the GST, fringe benefit tax (FBT) and income tax returns of employers. Key provisions Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: ss 2A, 8(1), 9(2) and (3), 10(2), 21I(1) and (2), 23A Income Tax Act 2007: ss CA 1(2), CB 1, CX 20, RD 54-57 Tax Administration Act 1994: ss 46B(2), 46C QB 19/12: 28 August 2019 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation 1. This Question We’ve B een Asked explains how an employer must treat an employee contribution to a fringe benefit for FBT, GST and income tax purposes. Employee contributions 2. An employee contribution is an amount an employee, including a shareholder- employee, pays for receiving a fringe benefit. It includes any amount a person associated with that employee pays for receiving a fringe benefit. Where an employee (or associate) pays an amount for receiving a fringe benefit, the taxable value of that benefit is reduced by the amount paid up to the value of the benefit (s RD 54(1) and (2) of the Income Tax Act 2007). 3. An employee may make a partial contribution or a full contribution to the value of the fringe benefit. 4. An employee contribution may be made in different ways. For an employee, payment might involve meeting an expense that would otherwise be an expense of the business. For example, an employee with a company vehicle might sometimes pay for petrol for that vehicle. For a shareholder-employee, payment might occur by debiting the shareholder-employee’s current account with the employer company. 5. An effective salary sacrifice arrangement is not treated as an employee contribution to a fringe benefit. An effective salary sacrifice arrangement is where an employee agrees to reduce their salary by an agreed amount in recognition of their employer providing them with a fringe benefit. FBT treatment of contributions 6. The taxable value of a fringe benefit is the value of the benefit, less any employee contributions (s RD 54(1) and (2) of the Income Tax Act 2007). 7. If the employee contribution is a partial contribution, the taxable value of the fringe benefit is the value of the fringe benefit, less the amount of the contribution. The reduced taxable value of the benefit is subject to FBT and must be included in the employer’s FBT return. 8. If an employee contribution is 100% of the taxable value of the fringe benefit, then the value of the fringe benefit is reduced to nil so the FBT liability is nil. However, a nil FBT return must be filed as a fringe benefit has still been provided (ss 46B(2) and 46C of the Tax Administration Act 2004). GST treatment of contributions 9. When an employer supplies an employee with a fringe benefit, that supply is deemed to be a supply of goods and services by the employer in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity (s 21I(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST A ct)). The supply will be valued under s 10(7) of the GST Act using the FBT taxable value. However, the provision of a fringe benefit will be a supply only to the extent that the employee has not paid an amount for the receipt or enjoyment of the fringe benefit (s 21I(2) of the GST A ct). 10. There will also be no supply of a fringe benefit for GST purposes if the fringe benefit arises out of an exempt or zero-rated supply (s 21I(2)(b) and (c) of the GST Act and Example 2). Partial contribution 11. If an employee makes a partial contribution to the employer for receiving the fringe benefit, the supply must be split into two supplies – a supply of a fringe benefit and a supply of the good or service the employee has paid for (a “general supply”). QB 19/12: 28 August 2019 UNCLASSIFIED 12. This occurs because s 21I(1) of the GST A ct deems the provision of a fringe benefit to be a supply of goods and services. However, s 21I(1) does not apply to the extent that the employee pays an amount for the receipt or enjoyment of the fringe benefit (s 21I(2)). This means s 21I(1) does not apply to the general supply. The supply of a fringe benefit 13. The value of the supply of a fringe benefit under s 21I(1) is its taxable value under the FBT rules (see s 10(7)(a) of the GST Act and s CX 20 and ss RD 54 to 57 of the Income Tax Act 2007). The GST on the taxable value of the fringe benefit is paid in the employer’s FBT return and is deemed by s 23A of the GST A ct to be a payment of FBT for the purposes of filing the FBT return. The general supply 14. The employee contribution (if paid to the employer) is treated as consideration for a separate supply by the employer under the GST A ct. The contribution is GST-inclusive. As a result, the employer must include any contributions received from the employee in their GST return. 15. If the employee contribution is consideration for an exempt or zero-rated supply, no GST needs to be returned on this general supply and the employer cannot claim any input tax on this supply. However, a contribution that is consideration for a zero-rated supply will still need to be included in the employer’s GST return. 16. If the employee contribution is paid directly to a third-party it will not be consideration fo r a supply by the employer for GST purposes. Also, the employer cannot claim any input tax on this supply as there was no cost incurred by the employer. Full c ontribution 17. If an employee makes a full contribution to the employer for receiving the fringe benefit there will be no deemed supply of a fringe benefit under s 21I(1) of the GST A ct. 18. However, the employee contribution (if paid to the employer) is treated as consideration for a general supply by the employer under the GST A ct. The contribution is GST-inclusive. As a result, the employer must include any contributions received from the employee in their GST return (s ee Example 5). 19. If the employee contribution is consideration for an exempt or zero-rated supply, the employer will not be able to claim any input tax on this supply as it would not have paid any GST on the supply. A contribution that is consideration for a zero-rated supply will still need to be included in the employer’s GST return. 20. If the employee contribution is paid directly to a third-party it will not be a consideration for a supply by the employer for GST purposes. Also, the employer cannot claim any input tax as there was no cost incurred by the employer. Associated supplies 21. Where an employer and an employee are associated, the supply of a fringe benefit by the employer is an “associated supply” (ss 2(1) and 2A(1) of the GST Act). It might be assumed that the associated supply is valued at open market value, rather than taxable value. This is not the case. Section 10(3)(c) of the GST Act excludes the provision of a fringe benefit from the valuation rules for associated supplies. Therefore, the value of a supply of a fringe benefit between associated parties is its taxable value (s 10(7)). The time of supply is when the fringe benefit is or is deemed to be provided (s 21I(3)). 22. Similarly, where the employer and the employee are associated, any general supply (for which an employee contribution is consideration) is valued under the general GST valuation rules (s 10(2)). It might be assumed that as the supply is an “associated supply” it should be valued under s 10(3). However, the associated supply valuation rules in s 10(3) do not apply, because the goods or services being supplied are still a QB 19/12: 28 August 2019 UNCLASSIFIED fringe benefit under the Income Tax Act 2007 (even where a full contribution is made), so s 10(3)(c) is not satisfied (see “The meaning of “benefit” for FBT purposes” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 2 (March 2006):26). 23. The time of supply of an associated supply will be determined under either ss 9(2) or 9(3) of the GST Act, depending on whether the supply is a supply of goods or a supply of services and whether those goods or services are supplied periodically or progressively. Where goods are supplied under an agreement to hire or where services are supplied under any agreement or enactment which provides for periodic payments, the time of supply is generally when a payment becomes due or is received. Income tax treatment of contributions 24. If an employer receives an employee contribution, the amount will be either business income of the employer (s CB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) or income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007). The amount is consideration received by the employer for the provision of a fringe benefit to the employee. It must be included as income in the employer’s income tax return, net of GST. The employer may claim relevant deductions relating to the fringe benefit. If the employer does not receive the contribution, (because it is paid directly to a third party) the amount will not be income of the employer and should not be included in the employer’s income tax return (see Example 3). Examples Example 1 – Partial contribution towards the cost of a fringe benefit Marjorie is the top salesperson at Bob’s Discount Furniture Ltd for 2018. As part of an incentive programme, Marjorie is to be awarded a brand new 49-inch TV, valued at $2,000 (GST inclusive). However, Marjorie would like something a little larger. She has her eye on a 65-inch smart TV currently selling for $3,000 (GST inclusive). Before Bob goes to purchase the TV for Marjorie (from a third-party supplier) she asks if she can pay the difference, so she can get the TV of her dreams. Bob is happy to oblige, so Marjorie transfers $1,000 into the company account and Bob buys her the $3,000 TV. FBT: Bob’s accountant takes the total amount of Marjorie’s employee contribution ($1,000, GST-inclusive) and deducts this from the value of the TV fringe benefit ($3,000, GST-inclusive). She then calculates both GST and FBT payable on the taxable value of the fringe benefit less the contribution and includes both the GST and the FBT in the FBT quarterly return. Bob’s Discount Furniture files quarterly using the single rate option so the FBT payable on this fringe benefit is $985 ($2,000 x 49.25%). The GST payable is $260.87 ($2,000 x 3 ÷ 23). GST: Marjorie’s contribution is consideration for the general supply of the TV. Bob’s Discount Furniture can claim GST back on the full price of the TV ($3,000). The accountant then includes the GST-inclusive amount of Marjorie’s employee contribution ($1,000) as income in the company’s next GST return. Income Tax: The accountant claims a deduction for $2,608.70, being the full GST- exclusive cost of the TV and includes the GST-exclusive amount of Marjorie’s contribution as income of the company for income tax purposes. Example 2 – Partial contribution towards the cost of a zero-rated fringe benefit Gustaf is the top salesperson at Gianni’s House of Wigs for 2018. To recognise this stellar achievement, the company has decided to award him an overseas holiday. The award includes return flights for two and five nights’ accommodation at a luxury resort in Fiji. The total cost of the award is $2,500. Gustaf is delighted at this recognition but would like to know if he could stay a bit longer. Gustaf asks the Managing Director if he could pay for an extra five nights’ accommodation. The Managing Director agrees, and Gustaf pays Gianni’s the difference which works out to be a further $1,500. There is no QB 19/12: 28 August 2019 UNCLASSIFIED GST component to this contribution because the supply of accommodation takes place offshore and is therefore zero-rated. FBT: The overseas travel is a fringe benefit. The taxable value of the fringe benefit is $2,500 (being the total cost of $4,000 less Gustaf’s contribution of $1,500). This amount needs to be returned in Gianni’s quarterly FBT return. No GST is paid in the FBT return because the supply is zero-rated and therefore s 21I(2)(c) of the Act applies. The provision of the overseas travel is not treated as a supply of a fringe benefit for GST purposes. GST: For GST purposes, Gustaf’s employee contribution (paid to Gianni’s) is consideration for a zero-rated supply of overseas travel and accommodation. The zero- rated amount will still need to be included in Gianni’s next GST return. However, Gianni’s cannot claim any input tax on the cost of the holiday as it did not pay any GST on the supply. Income Tax: The accountant claims a deduction for $4,000 being the total cost of the holiday package and includes Gustaf’s contribution of $1,500 as income of the company for income tax purposes. Example 3 – an employee pays a third-party for petrol Supreme Carpet Ltd allows its employee Tony to take home a work van for private use in the weekend as long as he pays for his own petrol. Tony must fill up on the business account on Friday night and then fill up again using his own funds on Sunday evening. He records the value of his petrol payments in a log book. FBT: The taxable value of the fringe benefit is the value of the benefit as determined under the motor vehicle fringe benefit rules in sch 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This value is an approximation of the capital and running costs of the vehicle and includes petrol. Therefore, when Tony pays for petrol (either directly to Supreme or to a third party like a petrol station), this will reduce the value of the benefit. The Supreme accountant takes Tony’s petrol payments (including GST) and deducts this from the value of the van that has been made available to him for private use over the quarter. She then calculates both FBT and GST payable on the taxable value and includes both the FBT and GST in the FBT quarterly return. GST: Supreme providing the van to Tony is a fringe benefit and is treated as being a supply of goods and services under s 21I(1). However, it is not treated as a supply to the extent that Tony paid an amount for the receipt or enjoyment of the benefit (s 21I(2)(a)). Further, there is no supply between Supreme and Tony for which the petrol payments could be consideration for GST purposes. Supreme cannot claim any input tax on the cost of the petrol paid by Tony as that was a cost that was incurred by Tony and was not reimbursed by Supreme. Income Tax: The payments made by Tony to the petrol station for petrol are not included in Supreme’s income tax return. Supreme did not receive or otherwise earn this amount, so it is not Supreme’s income. Example 4 – an employee pays for petrol on a work petrol card and then reimburses the employer The facts are the same as above, however instead of using his own money, Tony fills up the van with petrol using a work petrol card and then reimburses Supreme for the petrol. FBT: The FBT outcome is the same as in example 3. The payment made by Tony to Supreme to reimburse them for the petrol used is deducted from the taxable value of the van that has been made available to Tony for private use over the quarter. The Supreme accountant then calculates both FBT and GST payable on the taxable value less the petrol reimbursement and includes both the FBT and GST in the FBT quarterly return. GST: Supreme can claim input tax on the petrol charged to the work petrol card. However, Supreme must account for output tax on the reimbursement payment made by QB 19/12: 28 August 2019 UNCLASSIFIED Tony in its next GST return. This is because the reimbursement payment is part consideration for the supply of the fringe benefit. Income Tax: The reimbursement payment made by Tony to Supreme is income for income tax purposes and must be included in Supreme’s income tax return. However, the income is effectively cancelled out, because Supreme can claim an income tax deduction for the petrol payment. Example 5 – Shareholder-employees make a 100% contribution towards the cost of the fringe benefits and are not associated persons Anton is one of five shareholder-employees who own Zanadoo Construction Ltd. Anton and Zanadoo are not associated persons for the purposes of s 2A(1)(b) of the GST Act. The five shareholders agree that the business will make available to each of them a ute of their own choosing. To equalise matters, they agree to each pay an annual amount equivalent to the taxable value of their vehicle to Zanadoo for FBT purposes. The accountant advises the five shareholder-employees what the FBT taxable value is for each ute. This amount is then debited from their current accounts and credited to Zanadoo. The accountant makes the appropriate journal entries to document this transaction. FBT: The accountant files the annual FBT return, including a nil value for the five utes. GST: For GST purposes, the contribution paid by Anton and the other shareholder- employees is consideration for a general supply of the use of a ute. The accountant includes the total amount of the five contributions in the next GST return for Zanadoo. Income Tax: He also includes that amount as income in the tax return, after deducting the GST returned on the contributions made. The accountant had previously factored in an estimate of the contributions into the income budget when considering provisional tax options for the relevant tax year. Example 6 – Shareholder-employees make a 100% contribution towards the cost of the fringe benefit and are associated persons The facts are the same as in Example 5, however Anton is now one of three shareholder- employees who own Zanadoo Construction Ltd. Anton and the other two shareholder- employees are associated persons of Zanadoo Construction Ltd for the purposes of s 2A(1)(b) of the GST Act. The outcome for FBT and income tax is the same as in Example 5. For GST purposes, the contribution paid by Anton and the other shareholder-employees is consideration for a general supply of the use of a ute. The supply is also an associated supply. The value of this supply is determined under s 10(2). The value of the supply of the use of a ute is the consideration paid by the employee (which is the taxable value for FBT purposes). The associated supply valuation rules in s 10(3) do not apply, because the supply of the use of the ute (a motor vehicle) is still a fringe benefit under the Income Tax Act 2007, so s 10(3)(c) is not satisfied. The time of supply for the supply of the use of the ute is when the payments made by Anton and the other shareholder/employees are due and received under the agreement with Zanadoo. The accountant then includes the total amount of the three contributions in the next GST return for Zanadoo. QB 19/12: 28 August 2019 UNCLASSIFIED Example 7: An effective salary sacrifice is not an employee contribution George is due to start work at Business Co. He has been offered a starting salary of $150,000 or $145,000 plus a car park, valued at $5,000 per annum. George needs to commute from the country so gladly takes up the offer that includes the carpark, agreeing to forgo $5,000 of his salary in exchange for the car park. The car park is in a public car park building near the offices of Business Co. It is accessed with a parking permit and there are no designated spaces for permit holders. The agreement between George and his employer is an effective salary sacrifice arrangement. George’s salary is reduced by an agreed amount in recognition of Business Co providing him with a car park. As the car park is offsite and not owned or leased by Business Co, it is a fringe benefit and is not excluded under s CX 23. However, George’s salary sacrifice is not treated as an employee contribution to that fringe benefit so Business Co must return FBT on the $5,000 cost of the car park.

29 August 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question When does the business premises exclusion to the bright-line test apply? Answer Land that has been used predominantly as business premises is not subject to the bright-line test, even if the land has a dwelling on it. “Business premises” means land, typically including a building, together with any surrounding associated land, from which a person carries on a business. In some cases, land can be business premises even if there is no building on the land. Land will be used predominantly as business premises where: • more than 50% of the area of the land has been used as business premises; and • the land has been used as business premises for more than 50% of the time the seller owned it. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) explains the business premises exclusion that applies for the purposes of the bright-line test. It will be of interest to anyone selling their business premises on what might be residential land. QB 19/13 Income tax – When does the business premises exclusion to the bright-line test apply? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007: ss CB 6A and YA 1 (definition of “residential land”). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. Key terms Bright-line period: The bright-line period is 2 years or 5 years, depending on the rules in place when the seller acquired the land. Bright-line test: The bright- line test applies to tax sales of residential land occurring within the bright-line period. Business premises: means land, typically including a building, together with any surrounding associated land, occupied by a person mainly to carry on a business. However, in some cases, land without a building may also qualify as business premises. Sale: The bright-line test applies to all types of disposals, including sales. QB 19/13: 29 Aug 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation The scope of this QWBA 1. This QWBA focuses on the business premises exclusion to the bright-line test. There is a separate business premises exclusion that is relevant where the sale of land is potentially taxable under other land taxing provisions in the Act (ss CB 6 to CB 11). These two business premises exclusions are briefly compared at \[24\]. The exclusion from ss CB 6 to CB 11 is discussed in more detail in “QB 19/14: Income tax – When does the business premises exclusion in s CB 19 apply to preclude land sales from being taxed under ss CB 6 to CB 11?”. Bright-line test 2. The bright-line test under s CB 6A taxes the sale of residential land within the bright- line period. 3. The bright-line test applies to residential land that a person first acquired an interest in on or after 1 October 2015. The period of the bright-line test increased from 2 years to 5 years for residential land that a person first acquired an interest in, on or after 29 March 2018 (see s 6(2) of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018). Therefore, this QWBA refers to the “bright-line period” – which will be either 2 years or 5 years, depending on when the seller first acquired an interest in the land. 4. The bright-line test under s CB 6A applies only where none of the land taxing rules in ss CB 6 to CB 12 apply (for example, s CB 6, which applies to the sale of land acquired for the purpose or with the intention of re-sale). Definition of “residential land” 5. “Residential land” is defined in s YA 1 as meaning: • land with a dwelling on it; • land for which the owner has an arrangement to erect a dwelling; or • bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the relevant operative district plan. 6. However, “residential land” does not include land “used predominantly as business premises”. 7. In most cases, a person selling business premises will not need to rely on the business premises exclusion because usually the land will not meet the requirements to be “residential land”. This is because: • business premises land will not usually have a dwelling on it; • the landowner will not usually have an arrangement to erect a dwelling on the land; and • business premises land will not usually be “bare land” (which would come within the definition of “residential land” if it may be used for erecting a dwelling under the relevant operative district plan). 8. Because most business premises land being sold will not meet the criteria to potentially be “residential land”, the carve out for business premises will not usually need to be considered, and the land will not be subject to the bright-line test in s CB 6A. QB 19/13: 29 Aug 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED 9. The most likely situation where the business premises exclusion needs to be considered is where a person sells land that has both a dwelling and business premises on it. The presence of a dwelling means the land may fall within the definition of “residential land” and potentially be subject to the bright-line test. However, if the land is used predominantly as business premises, it will not be “residential land” as defined. Another situation where a person may need to consider the business premises exclusion is where business premises are on bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the relevant operative district plan. Situations in which a person sells business premises land for which they have an arrangement to erect a dwelling are likely to be rare. Meaning of “dwelling” 10. A “dwelling” is defined in the Act as being “any place used predominantly as a place of residence or abode, including any appurtenances belonging to or enjoyed with the place”. However, for the purposes of s CB 6A and the definition of “residential land”, a “dwelling” does not include any of the following, in whole or part: • a hospital; • a hotel, motel, inn, hostel or boardinghouse; • a convalescent home, nursing home, or hospice; • a rest home or retirement village; or • a camping ground. Meaning of “business premises” 11. Business premises is not defined in the Act for the purposes of the bright-line test and the definition of “residential land”. “Premises” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) as: A house or building, together with its land and outbuildings, occupied by a business or considered in an official context. 12. At common law, “business premises” can refer to a variety of places from which a business is carried on, whether just buildings, buildings and associated land, or bare land. (Case Y10 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,097 (TRA); Thames Water Ltd v Hampstead Homes Ltd \[2003\] 1 WLR 198 (CA); Gardiner v Sevenoaks Rural District Council \[1950\] 2 All ER 84 (QB); C of T v Nightcaps Coal Company (Ltd) (1909) 29 NZLR 885 (SC)). 13. The Commissioner considers that while business premises will typically include a building, there may be instances where land without a building is business premises. For instance, a quarry may be business premises even if it does not have a building on it. It will be up to the taxpayer to show that the land is business premises. 14. As noted above, “business premises” is a place from which a business is carried on. Whether there is a “business” will be determined using the business test set out in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA). “Carrying on” a business from a location, requires some or all of the activities of the business to be conducted continuously or habitually from there. For the purposes of the s CB 6A business premises exclusion, the business premises may be those of the landowner or of a third party such as a tenant or tenants. 15. Once the land is found to have business premises on it, the s CB 6A business premises exclusion requires that the land as a whole must have been used predominantly as business premises. “Predominantly” in this context means more than 50%. Land will have been used predominantly as business premises where: QB 19/13: 29 Aug 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED • the physical area of land used as business premises is more than 50% of the total land area; and • that land has been used as business premises for more than 50% of the time the landowner has owned the land. 16. Where a building has multiple storeys, the floor area of each storey is included in the calculation of total land area. 17. From time to time, particularly where the split between the business premises use of the land and the land’s other uses is close, the nature and the importance of the land’s different uses should be considered to determine which of the uses is the predominant use. This is the approach the courts have taken to the meaning of “predominantly” (see, for example, Paddico (267) Ltd v Kirklees Metropolitan Council \[2011\] EWHC 1,606 (Ch)). 18. Because the definition of “business premises” requires the land to have been used “predominantly” as business premises, the Commissioner considers the exclusion applies on an all or nothing basis. Therefore, if the land is predominantly used as business premises, all of the land is excluded from the meaning of residential land. If the land is not used predominantly as business premises, then the exclusion does not apply, and all of the land is residential land and potentially subject to the bright-line test. Conclusion 19. In most cases, a person selling business premises will not need to consider the business premises exclusion to the bright-line test. This is because for most business premises, it is unlikely that: • there will be a dwelling on the land; • the landowner will have an arrangement to erect a dwelling on the land; or • the land will be bare land (which would come within the definition of “residential land” if it may be used for erecting a dwelling under the relevant operative district plan). 20. However, even if one of the above is the case, the land will fall out of the definition of “residential land” if it is used predominantly as business premises, so the sale would not be subject to the bright-line test. 21. Using land as business premises means business activities are continuously or habitually conducted from that land. The business premises do not need to be the landowner’s own business premises; they can, for example, be the business premises of a tenant or tenants. 22. Land will be used predominantly as business premises if more than 50% of the total land area is used as business premises for more than 50% of the time the landowner has owned the land. 23. The exclusion applies on an all or nothing basis. If the land is used predominantly as business premises, then all of the land is excluded from the bright-line test. If the land is not used predominantly as business premises, the exclusion will not apply to any part of the land. Comparison of the s CB 6A and s CB 19 business premises exclusions 24. As noted at \[1\], the business premises exclusion to the bright-line test is not the only business premises exclusion in the land taxing rules. There is a separate business QB 19/13: 29 Aug 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED premises exclusion relevant where the sale of land is potentially taxable under other land taxing provisions in the Act (ss CB 6 to CB 11). Although these two exclusions are both described as “business premises exclusions”, they are not the same. “QB 19/14: Income tax – When does the business premises exclusion under s CB 19 apply to preclude land sales from being taxed under ss CB 6 to CB 11?” discusses the application of the s CB 19 exclusion in more detail. In short, the main differences between the business premises exclusion to the bright-line test and the s CB 19 business premises exclusion are as follows: • Section CB 19 relates to the land taxing provisions from ss CB 6 to CB 11. The bright-line business premises exclusion applies only to s CB 6A (the bright-line test). • Section CB 19 applies only to land that is the landowner’s business premises (and land reserved with the premises for the use of the business). The bright-line business premises exclusion potentially applies where someone uses the land as business premises. • Section CB 19 specifically requires the landowner to have acquired and occupied or erected and occupied the relevant business premises mainly to carry on a substantial business. For the bright-line business premises exclusion, the premises do not have to be those of the landowner and the business does not have to be substantial. • Section CB 19 applies to the extent that the land is business premises (or land reserved with the premises for the use of the business), while the bright-line business premises exclusion applies to all of the land sold, or not at all. • Section CB 19 does not apply where the landowner has engaged in a regular pattern of buying or building business premises and selling them. The bright-line business premises exclusion does not have such an exception. Examples 25. The following examples explain how the law applies. Examples Example 1: Business premises exclusion not relevant as requirements to be “residential land” not met On 1 August 2018, Raj, a dentist, purchases a property with a villa on it. The previous owner had lived in the villa for many years. Raj fits the villa out as a dentist surgery and carries on his dentistry business from there. Three years later, Raj sells his dentistry practice and the villa and moves overseas. During the time Raj owned the villa, nobody lived in it, and Raj did not have an arrangement to erect a dwelling on the property. Shortly after selling the villa, Raj hears about the bright-line test and asks his lawyer, Ruby, whether the sale might be subject to tax since the villa was previously a residential home. Ruby explains that the sale of the villa is not subject to the bright-line test because the property does not meet the definition of “residential land”. This is because: • the property did not have a dwelling on it; • Raj did not have an arrangement to erect a dwelling on the property; and • the property was not “bare land” that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the relevant operative district plan. QB 19/13: 29 Aug 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED Ruby explains that although the villa might look like a dwelling, it was fitted out as a dentist surgery not as a place of residence or abode. Ruby also notes there is a business premises exclusion to the definition of “residential land”, but in Raj’s case, this exclusion is not relevant because the property did not fall within the requirements to potentially be “residential land” in the first place. Example 2: Land with a building that is partly business premises and partly a dwelling excluded from bright-line as predominantly business premises Dave purchases a building in the suburbs that has a downstairs retail space and a single bedroom flat upstairs. The downstairs retail space is just over twice the size of the upstairs flat. Dave leases the retail space to Andy, who runs a florist business from it. The upstairs flat is rented to Mary under a residential tenancy. A year later, Dave decides to move overseas and sells the building. The property meets the first requirement of the definition of “residential land” because the upstairs flat is a dwelling. However, the downstairs retail space is the business premises of the florist. Because the business premises is more than twice the size of the upstairs flat, the property is used predominantly as business premises. Accordingly, the property is not “residential land”. Therefore, the sale of the property is not subject to the bright- line test. Example 3: Land with business premises and stand-alone residence excluded from bright-line as business premises Milk Mixer Ltd buys a large milk-processing factory. On the property is a small house where the factory’s caretaker lives. Because there is a dwelling on the property (the house), the land is potentially “residential land”, so potentially subject to the bright- line test. However, because the land is predominantly (more than 50%) used as Milk Mixer Ltd’s business premises, all of the land is excluded from the definition of “residential land”, so the bright-line test would not apply if the property were sold within the bright-line period. Example 4: Land with business premises and stand-alone residence excluded from bright-line as predominantly business premises Wayne buys a property that has a three-bedroom house and large stand-alone workshop on it. Wayne lives in the house with his family and operates a surfboard- building business from the workshop. Wayne’s workshop and associated land make up 60% of the total land area of the property and has been his business premises since he purchased the property. Because the property has a dwelling on it (the house), the property meets the initial definition of “residential land”. Wayne sells the property within the bright-line period. Although the property meets the initial part of the definition of “residential land”, it subsequently falls outside the definition because the land is predominantly used as business premises. This means the sale of the property is not caught by the bright-line test. If the land was not predominantly used as business premises, it is still possible that the property sale would nonetheless be excluded from the bright-line test under the “main home” exclusion (s CB 16A). For details on how the “main home” exclusion in s CB 16A applies, see “QB 18/16: Income tax – bright-line test – main home exclusion – sale of subdivided section”. However, if the property was owned by Wayne’s family trust, the “main home” exclusion would only be available if the principal settlor of the trust does not have a main home (e.g. if Wayne’s late father settled the trust), or if the principal settlor does have a main home, then that main home is the one being sold (e.g. if Wayne settled the trust and lives in the house as a beneficiary of the trust). In this context, the principal settlor is the settlor whose settlements on the trust are the greatest or equal greatest, by market value. QB 19/13: 29 Aug 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED Example 5: Land with business premises and stand-alone residence not excluded from bright-line as not predominantly business premises Jerome buys an investment property with a stand-alone studio at the front and a three-bedroom house at the rear. Jerome immediately rents the property to Denise. Denise uses the studio for her legal practice and lives in the house with her family. The studio makes up 30% of the total land area of the property and is used as Denise’s business premises 100% of the time Jerome owns the property. Because the property has a dwelling on it (the house), the property meets the initial definition of “residential land”. Jerome sells the property within the bright-line period. Although the property is used as business premises, it is not used “predominantly” (more than 50%) as business premises. Therefore, the property is not excluded from the definition of “residential land”, so is caught by the bright-line test. Unlike Wayne in Example 4, Jerome does not live in the house on the property. Accordingly, the “main home” exclusion (s CB 16A) is not available.
