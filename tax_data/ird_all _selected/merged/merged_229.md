The FIF rules tax the income earned by foreign entities on behalf of a New Zealand resident when the controlled foreign company rules do not apply. The deemed rate of return is set annually and is one of the four methods for calculating FIF income or loss. The rate of 10.46% will apply to all types of investments, including interests in superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. The rate was set by Order in Council on 20 May 2002.

FRINGE BENEFIT TAX: PRESCRIBED RATE OF INTEREST ON LOW-INTEREST EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LOANS The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate fringe benefit tax for low-interest, employment-related loans has increased from 6.7% to 7.5% for the quarter beginning 1 July 2002. The new rate was approved by means of an Order in Council signed on 20 May 2002. The rate is reviewed regularly to ensure it is in line with the Reserve Bank’s survey of first mortgage interest rates. It was last changed with effect from the quarter beginning 1 January 2002.

There is currently an asset class “Prints” in the industry category “Hotels, Motels, Restaurants, Cafes, Taverns and Takeaway Bars”. The new asset class “Prints (including limited edition prints)” specifies a rate for such assets in the office environment. The proposed depreciation rates are 18% DV and 12.5% SL, based on an estimated useful life of 10 years. These rates are the same as those currently provided for the general asset class “Prints” in the industry category “Hotels, Motels, Restaurants, Cafes, Taverns and Takeaway Bars”. The general asset class “Paintings and drawings” is a new introduction. The depreciation rates proposed are 9.5% DV and 6.5% SL, based on an estimated useful life of 20 years. The estimated useful life of 20 years was established on the basis of advice that the majority of property falling in this general asset class would be oil paintings. However it is acknowledged that this general asset class will encompass works (including painted or drawn reproductions) in a variety of media and on a variety of substrates. The proposed general depreciation rates will apply only where the property in question is “depreciable property” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994. In particular, it must be property that might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Artwork that is not reasonably expected to decline in value is not depreciable property. 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 6 (June 2002) EXPOSURE DRAFT—GENERAL DEPRECIATION DETERMINATION DEP\[X\] This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP\[x\]: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number \[x\]”. 1.

We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. GST ON SERVICES PROVIDED TO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS The “overseas assistance fee” was not separately charged to the student. Instead, a global fee was charged for “tuition, assistance with various pre-arrival matters and related services”. The Commissioner accepted that some of the services supplied by International to overseas students may be zero rated for GST purposes. The Commissioner acknowledged that certain pre-arrival services, ie, interpreting and translating services, assistance with formalities relating to immigration procedures and with travel to, and accommodation in, New Zealand, are arguably sufficiently separate from the provision of tuition in New Zealand to attract a zero-rating to that part of the fee charged to students for those services. The Commissioner had difficulties in quantifying this part of the fee for overseas assistance but was prepared to agree to 10% of the overall fee to cover this service. The Commissioner was not prepared to accept that any other services provided by International, either by itself or through its agents, were part of that separate supply. AIS did not accept the 10% concession and argued an all or nothing approach in the High Court. Decision First issue:First issue: First issue:First issue: First issue: Hansen J reviewed the English and New Zealand authorities in this area and considered that the following were the key principles to be taken from them: a. In determining whether a supply may be apportioned for GST purposes, it is necessary to examine the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to determine whether there is a sufficient distinction between the allegedly different parts to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion them accordingly.

Apportionment, Timebar. sections 5(14), 8(1), 9, 10(18) 11(2)(d) and (e) GTSA 1985, section 108A TAA 1994 Summary The services provided by the taxpayer to its international students comprised a single supply of tuition services. No portion of the service could be apportioned as zero- rated. However, by using a “seriously arguable” test the Commissioner had applied the wrong legal test to his determination and that led him to hold an opinion which he might not otherwise have reached, so the decision needed to be reconsidered. Facts Auckland Institute of Studies (“AIS”) is a private educational institute which is primarily engaged in providing tuition to overseas students. In 1993 it incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, AIS International Limited (“International”) to conduct the overseas activities of AIS. The new structure sought to isolate services performed outside New Zealand. Such services were zero-rated for GST purposes. Previously AIS had been required to account for GST on the full amount of its tuition fees. There was an introduction of an “overseas assistance fee” charged by International to the students. The introduction of this fee was intended to cover services performed overseas which would be GST-exempt. 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 6 (June 2002) b. The enquiry is to determine whether one element of the transaction (or consideration given) is a necessary or integral part of another or whether it is merely ancillary to or incidental to that other element. c. A service will be ancillary to a principal service if it does not constitute for customers an aim in itself, but a means of enjoying the principal service supplied. Hansen J stated that he needed to examine the supply from the point of view of the consumer and not to focus on the arrangements between AIS and International as that focus fails to consider the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to the consumer. The importance of examining the services provided under the contract between the supplier and the recipient emerges clearly from the decision of the CA in Wilson & Horton v Commissioner (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325. The English VAT cases accord with this approach and His Honour found them not only applicable but also persuasive. The entire focus is on what the customer sought and was given. Therefore, a distinction must be drawn between what is supplied to a consumer and the goods or services acquired for the purpose of providing that supply. The marketing and promotional services provided by International are goods and services provided to enable it (or AIS) to better perform the services supplied to students. Students did not contract for the provision of those services. It may be argued that the students benefited from them but, as Richardson J pointed out in Wilson & Horton, that is not the test. In regards to the services provided by International’s agents, His Honour stated that the duties identified as provided overseas by the agents include services which, by their very nature, are not provided to the students. They include arranging advertising, organising promotional activities and organising and hosting visits by AIS staff. They are services provided to International for the purpose of promoting and marketing tuition services. They could not possibly be part of a separate supply to students. The remaining services performed by the agents include many which, in His Honour’s opinion, are ancillary or incidental to the provision of tuition services. All are for the purpose of facilitating the students undertaking a course of study which is, of course, the core business of AIS to provide. His Honour went on to state that, notwithstanding the Commisioner’s concession that pre-arrival services constitute a separate supply, he is of the view that all of the services provided by International/AIS to students overseas are an integral part of the supply of tuition services. His Honour would regard those services as not constituting an aim in itself but as a means of better enjoying the principal service. The evidence of individual students is that they regard the payments they make to AIS as tuition fees. They are unaware that they are being supplied with, and paying for, the services of the agent. Evidence is also that any services provided by an agent which go beyond assistance with enrolment and arrangements for travel to, and accommodation in, New Zealand are separately paid for by the students. His Honour held that the evidence of the students serves only to confirm what emerges from an analysis of the services themselves, ie the dominant element of the transaction between AIS and a student is the provision of a course of education that is the true and substantial nature of the consideration given for the payment. His Honour also found that the expert evidence given by an economist called by AIS was consistent with this analysis. In this case what the student wanted was tuition in New Zealand. The pre-arrival services were necessary but incidental. The relevant perspective is that of the consumer. His Honour therefore concluded that the services provided by AIS/International to students comprises a single supply of tuition services. VV VV V alue of Supplyalue of Supply alue of Supplyalue of Supply alue of Supply Given the Commissioner’s concession His Honour felt it necessary to offer some comment in regards to attributing a value to the supply of the conceded “zero- rated supplies”. His Honour stated that where possible he could see no reason why values should not initially be assessed on the basis of the actual cost of providing the separate supply plus a reasonable allowance for profit. However, ultimately the appropriate value for a separate supply would have to be tested against the market. For the purposes of this case, Counsel for the Commissioner’s submission was accepted that the value of a separate supply could not exceed the sum which a hypothetical consumer was prepared to pay. As His Honour was not provided with any information which would enable him to depart from the Commissioner’s assessment that pre-arrival services should be valued at 10% of the first year’s tuition fees, the principle in Buckly and Young Limited v Commissioner was applied and the 10% value was accepted. 12 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 6 (June 2002) Second issue – time of supplySecond issue – time of supply Second issue – time of supplySecond issue – time of supply Second issue – time of supply At which point in time does liability arise to account for GST on tuition fees? Pursuant to section 236A of the Education Act 1989, a teaching institute must hold fees in trust until a student has attended a course for more than seven days, except for a non-refundable sum which is the lesser of $500 or 10%. AIS has been accounting for GST on the non-refundable portion on receipt but has not accounted for GST on the balance until it becomes entitled to payment in terms of the statute. The Commissioner argued that section 9(1) deems a supply to take place when the student pays. Even though the AIS is entitled to receive only the lesser of $500 or 10% of the fees at the time of receipt, payment triggers liability for the full amount. His Honour went through an analysis of Commissioner v Dormer (1997) 18 NZTC 13,446, L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391 and N24 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,199 and stated that he agreed with them all. His Honour held that when a student pays tuition fees AIS has an immediate right to receive the lesser of 10% or $500 therefore it is in the same position as the vendors in Case L67 and Case N24. It has received a payment in respect of a supply of services therefore section 9(1) applies. The supply of those services is deemed to take place on receipt of the payment. Their full value is therefore liable for GST at that time. There was also a preliminary ground of opposition where the Commissioner claimed that AIS were barred from challenging the time of supply adjustment because AIS had not specifically rejected the adjustment in its Notice of Response – section 89(H)(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. His Honour held that he could not accept the Commissioner’s claim in this regard. He held that it was true that the response from AIS does not expressly reject the Commissioner’s position but the limited terms of the concession leaves room for no other implication. Third issue – reopening the GST periodThird issue – reopening the GST period Third issue – reopening the GST periodThird issue – reopening the GST period Third issue – reopening the GST period The narrow issue was whether the Commissioner had applied the right test in seeking to reopen the time bar pursuant to section 108A(3) of the TAA to enable GST to be reassessed for the periods ending 28 February 1994 to 31 October 1996 on the basis that the plaintiff by omitting to include zero-rated supplies in its returns for those periods knowingly failed to make full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary to determine the amount of GST payable in those periods. His Honour went through the few authorities in this area and stated he had taken the following principles from those authorities: 1. The critical issue is whether the Commissioner was honestly of the opinion that the plaintiff knowingly failed to make full and true disclosure of all material facts. 2. The onus of proving that the opinion was not honestly held is on the plaintiff. 3. In order to successfully challenge the decision of the Commissioner to assess or reassess outside the four- year period the plaintiff must show: (i) The Commissioner did not honestly hold the opinion. (ii) The Commissioner misdirected himself as to the legal basis on which the opinion was to be formed. (iii) The opinion was one which was not reasonably open to the Commissioner on the information available to him. His Honour held that by using a “seriously arguable” test the Commissioner had applied the wrong legal test to his determination and that led him to hold an opinion which he might not otherwise have reached. As a result the decision cannot stand. This finding made it unnecessary for His Honour to consider in detail whether the opinion was one which it was reasonably open to the Commissioner to hold. His Honour did however, state that he did consider that there was a sufficient factual basis for the Commissioner to form an honest opinion that the plaintiff had knowingly failed to make disclosure. His Honour couldn’t however, be satisfied that the Commissioner would have formed that opinion if “he had not introduced the irrelevant and potentially misleading concept of seriously arguable”. Therefore the appropriate course was for His Honour to set aside that decision and remit the question back to the Commissioner for reconsideration. 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 6 (June 2002) GST REFUND PAYABLE TO STRUCK-OFF COMPANY Case:Case: Case:Case: Case:TA 96/58 Decision date:Decision date: Decision date:Decision date: Decision date:15 May 2002 Act:Act: Act:Act: Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Keywords: Keywords:Keywords: Keywords: GST refund, Companies Act, Company struck off Summary The Authority directed that the small GST refund which the Commissioner had conceded as owing to the objector company be paid, notwithstanding that the objector had not been restored to the register of companies. Facts This case related to a GST refund of $573.46. The objector company was struck off the Companies Register on 13 February 1991. However, the objector continued to file GST returns. By letter of 25 March 1994 the Commissioner wrote to the objector saying that all figures on the GST returns filed after the date of the objector being struck off would be reassessed to zero, as there was no legal entity capable of conducting a taxable activity. It was also noted that there was no entity capable of objecting to the reassessment. Justice Potter conditionally restored the objector to the Companies Register on 2 March 1998. However, as the conditions were never met the objector remained struck off. On 21 January 2000, Judge Barber allowed the objection relating to the $573.46 by consent (the Commissioner having conceded the case). However, the Commissioner refused to refund the sum until the objector was restored to the Register. The objector argued that as the Commissioner had conceded the case and consented to an order allowing the objection, the Commissioner should give effect to that order by reassessing the objector to show a refund of $573.46 in respect of the GST period ended 31 August 1992. The Commissioner argued that he was not required to (and indeed could not) pay the refund until the objector was restored to the Register. The Commissioner argued that the matter could be resolved immediately by ex-directors paying outstanding filing fees to the Companies office. In submissions, the Commissioner argued: “The Commissioner has agreed in principle to allow the company its refund of $573.46 and has accordingly consented to an order allowing the objection. The Commissioner stands ready and willing to issue an assessment on restoration of the company to the Register...” The Commissioner submitted that the orders made by the Authority on 21 January 2000 were made in relation to a taxpayer that had no legal existence. The Commissioner submitted that the Authority recall the judgment of 21 January 2000 and vary it as the Commissioner could not, as a matter of law, comply with the order until the objector was restored. The Commissioner did concede, however, that he had dealt with struck off taxpayers on previous occasions. The objector submitted that the Commissioner’s arguments were simply manoeuvring to avoid paying the small refund that he had agreed to in January 2000. Decision Judge Barber took a pragmatic approach. His Honour concluded that the Commissioner’s attitude had been unhelpful in this case. His Honour stated: “The short point is that on 21 January \[2000\], I allowed the objector’s objection by consent. I expected that to lead to a reassessment, but certainly, in any event, to a refund cheque of $573.46 being promptly paid to the objector or to \[a director\]. It is disturbing that this had not happened...” Judge Barber agreed that the Commissioner was probably correct in his submission that he could not issue a reassessment to a company which remains struck off but ordered a refund to be issued in terms of sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. His Honour noted: “I do not know why the Commissioner consented to my order of 21 January 2000 allowing the objection if he (i.e. someone among his staff) did not intend to make the said refund of $573.46. Frankly, this Authority has got better things to do with its time than waste it on such a petty dispute.” Judge Barber ordered the Commissioner to dispatch a cheque for $573.46 to dispose of the matter. Judge Barber criticised the Commissioner for his actions in this case. His Honour noted that the case had put the State to the expense of many thousands of dollars, many times greater than the tax in dispute. His Honour also noted that it was not pointed out to him that there was any issue of precedent in the case. 14 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 6 (June 2002) GST PAYABLE TO MORTGAGEE AHEAD OF COMMISSIONER comprehensive reply and also disputed Edgewater’s standing under the GST Act in what was a matter between himself and Belman. Another NOPA followed reiterating Edgewater’s arguments. The Commissioner simply referred them to his previous responses and stated that the appropriate means of challenging the matter was by way of judicial review. Edgewater then claimed that this was not a proper response to their purported NOPA and claimed a deemed acceptance by the Commissioner of their adjustment. The Commissioner bluntly rejected this logic, referred to previous correspondence and repeated his opinion that any claim Edgewater may have should be pursued outside the disputes resolution process. Thereupon Edgewater commenced proceedings seeking summary judgment for the sum paid to the Commissioner by Belman. The Commissioner opposed the application and sought orders striking out Edgewater’s claim. Decision: The priority issueThe priority issue The priority issueThe priority issue The priority issue The plaintiffs argued that section 104 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 (“LTA”) overrides the plain words of section 17 GST Act. The former states: 104104 104104 104 Application of purApplication of pur Application of purApplication of pur Application of pur chase moneychase money chase moneychase money chase money (1) The purchase money to arise from the sale by the mortgagee of any mortgaged land, estate, or interest shall be applied- (a) Firstly, in payment of the expenses occasioned by the sale: (b) Secondly, in payment of the money then due or owing to the mortgagee: (c) Thirdly, in payment of subsequent registered mortgages or encumbrances (if any) in the order of their priority: (d) Fourthly, the surplus (if any) shall be paid to the mortgagor. Whereas the GST Act, having deemed by section 5(2), any such seller to be supplying goods in the course or furtherance of the mortgagor’s taxable activity, states at section 17(1)(b) that the seller must “pay to the Commissioner the amount of tax charged on that supply”.

Summary On sale by the first mortgagee of land of a mortgagor registered under the GSTA 1985, the second mortgagee was entitled to payment of its debt and expenses ahead of the GST owing to the Commissioner. Facts: The plaintiffs (“Edgewater”) were collectively second mortgagees of a property known as Westwood Meadows (“Westwood”). The first mortgagee (“Belman”) sold the property in satisfaction of debts owed by Westwood. Following the sale, Belman paid out of the proceeds the GST of $117,000 to the Commissioner along with form GST 121; “Return for Goods Sold in Satisfaction of Debt”. The form was endorsed in handwriting in two places: “Payment made under protest”. Having paid the GST, Belman retained the balance of the proceeds which was $12,000 short of the priority to which it was entitled. No part of the proceeds was left to pay Edgewater. At no material time was Westwood in liquidation or receivership. Edgewater wrote to the Commissioner claiming an immediate refund of the $117,000 paid by Belman. The Commissioner replied that he considered the GST properly payable by Belman and that no issue of priority arose as there was a clear liability on the part of a mortgagee selling in satisfaction of a debt (sections 5, 17 GST Act). Edgewater issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) which the Commissioner denied they had a right to do. He replied with a comprehensive rebuttal of the argument and rejected Edgewater’s entitlement to invoke the disputes provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). He added that, if he was wrong in holding such a view, that the contents of his letter was to be treated as a Notice of Response (“NOR”). Considerable detailed correspondence ensued wherein Edgewater pressed the Commissioner for a decision as to the priority he considered applied to the GST paid by Belman. The Commissioner refused to be drawn further into the argument having already provided a 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol, No 6 (June 2002) Baragwanath J noted that in order to reach such a conclusion as urged by the plaintiff one must construe the plain words of section 17 in a strained manner. His Honour canvassed case law and commentaries which sanctioned such an approach and noted in his decision that: “while the text is central, it is necessary to discern the purpose of the statute in order to include not only “the indications provided in the enactment” but others that lie beyond it. ... “The relevant context necessarily includes the expression of Parliament’s will in other legislation – here section 104” His Honour noted that the GST Act itself subordinates the collection of GST to secured charges in the event of liquidation (section 42(2)) and the plaintiff argued that it was absurd to claim that a mortgagee sale should be treated differently notwithstanding the GST Act’s silence on the matter. The Commissioner submitted that such silence was prescriptive and no restrictive reading was required as GST ought to be considered a consequence of doing business while a taxable activity continues, as in the present case. His Honour was disinclined to adopt such reasoning and preferred to leave the conventional interpretation of section 104 undisturbed. In so doing he held: •section 5(2) and section 17(1) of the GST Act are to be read in the same way as section 42(2)(b) and (ba) of the GST Act, and section 104 PLA, which accord priority to mortgagees. •The mortgagee is liable to the Commissioner for GST to the extent of any surplus on sale, thereafter the Commissioner must seek the balance from the mortgagor. •The Commissioner has the option under section 27(1) GST Act to pursue either the person deemed to supply or any person required to furnish any return. •section 17 is essentially a machinery provision “giving effect to the general policy of section 104 and the GST Act”. •such a construction however, must be taken to amend section 104 in part by imposing an obligation on the mortgagor to account for GST after discharging all mortgages. •the above conclusion requires a strained interpretation of the GST Act which should be redrafted with “language that deals clearly and simply with the various contingencies”. •The fact that the payment was made by Belman “under protest” made it difficult to advance a defence to a restitutionary claim. The Commissioner’s application to strike out the claim was dismissed. His Honour held that the sum in dispute was paid in error and the plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment with interest and costs.

CROWN FORESTRY RENTAL TRUST LACKS CHARITABLE STATUS Case:Sir Graham Latimer & Ors (Crown Forestry Rental Trust) v CIR Decision date:4 June 2002 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, Income Tax Act 1994 Keywords:Charitable purpose, whether exclusive Summary The appellants were unsuccessful in their appeal of the High Courtís decision that the Trust is not entitled to the income tax exemption under section 61(25) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Facts This was an appeal from the judgment of the High Court reported at \[2002\] 1 NZLR 535. On 20 July 1989 the Crown, the New Zealand Maori Council, and the Federation of Maori Authorities Inc executed an agreement to provide for the terms and conditions upon which the Crown would sell existing tree crops on Crown forestry land to commercial purchasers together with a licence to use the land on an ongoing basis. The rent payable by each purchaser was to be put in a fund administered by a rental trust. The interest earned by the investment of the rent was to be made available to assist Maori making claims involving land before the Waitangi Tribunal. The Crown Forestry Rental Trust (ìthe Trustî) was established in 1989. Under clause 2.1 of its Trust Deed it is stated as being established to: a)Receive the Rental Proceeds from the Licences; b)Make the interest, earned from investment of those Rental Proceeds, available to assist Maori in the preparation, presentation and negotiation of claims before the Waitangi Tribunal which involve, or could involve, Licensed Land. The question in the case was whether the Trust is entitled to income tax exemption under section 61(25) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (ìthe Actî). The issues before the High Court were: ïWhether the income derived by the Trust is derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes; ïWhether the charitable focus of section 61(25) is on the income or the Trust; ïWhether the Trustís stakeholder role is a purpose or a power; ïWhether the Trustís stakeholder purpose is ancillary; ïWhether the Trustís stakeholder purpose is charitable; ïWhether the purpose of assisting Maori claimants is charitable. The High Court held that the Trust had two purposes, only one of which was charitable (assisting Maori claimants) so that it was not entitled to tax exemption under section 61(25). The High Court accepted the Commissionerís submission that the Trustís stakeholder role of retaining and investing capital funds was different from the ìreceive and holdî obligation of other trusts, that therefore it was a purpose and not just an administrative power, that it was not a purpose ancillary only to its other purpose, and that it was non-charitable. 5 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14. No 07 (July 2002) The Trust appealed against the conclusion that section 61(25) does not apply and the Commissioner cross-appealed against the finding that the assistance purpose is charitable. Decision The Court of Appeal concluded that the first limb of section 61(25) does not require that the Trust be established for charitable purposes, merely that the income in question be received for such purposes, in the sense that the trustees are not empowered to hold or apply it for any other purpose. This would be so even in circumstances where the Trustís capital could be applied to a non-charitable purpose, so long as the income already generated was still to be used for a charitable purpose. On the Commissionerís first cross-appeal issue regarding the purpose of assisting Maori claimants, the Court stated that it was common ground that there must be a two step inquiry. First, whether the purpose is for the public benefit and, if so, whether the purpose is charitable in the sense of coming within the spirit and intendment of the preamble to the Statute of Charitable Uses 1601 (43 Eliz. c4). The Court held that the assistance purpose is of public benefit and that the Maori beneficiaries are a section of the public for trust purposes. On the second step in the inquiry, the Court held that the public benefit was of a charitable character, as it considered the purpose was directed towards racial harmony in New Zealand. On the second cross-appeal issue regarding payment of the surplus to the Crown, the Court held that this was a purpose for which the income is potentially derived as from the time of its receipt by the trustees, and that, as a matter of law, the purpose could not be regarded as so minor as to be considered merely ancillary to the assistance purpose. The Court was not persuaded by the comparison of the provision to bona vacantia because it was not a matter of vesting in the Crown of property which had no owner. It held that the accumulated interest is not given to the Crown for a charitable purpose and that therefore the Trustís purposes are not exclusively charitable. The Court expressed reluctance at reaching that conclusion but was conscious of the potential for abuse of the charitable exemption in section 61(25) in other cases if it were to uphold a tax exemption for income of a trust which need not be applied in the year of receipt for charitable purposes, and could be accumulated from year to year and ultimately paid over for a non-charitable purpose. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14. No 07 (July 2002) 6 COMMISSIONER ORDERED TO PAY TRA COSTS Case:TRA 33/00 Dec No 11/2202 Decision date:11 June 2002 Act:Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 Keywords:Costs, TRA Summary The Commissioner was ordered to contribute to the TRAís costs due to delay in conceding the case. Facts This was a costs hearing as a result of a previous decision of the TRA (reported as Case V15 (2002) 20 NZTC 10,174). In that case the Commissioner conceded the case but was compelled to go to the Authority by the taxpayerís agent who wished to obtain orders as a result of the concession. The Authority declined to make any orders as the case had been conceded and there was no reason to make any orders. At the end of that case the Authority invited the taxpayer to file a memorandum for costs. The Points of Objection Notice had been filed with the Commissioner in December 1996. In February 1997 the Crown Solicitor had been instructed that the CIR wished to concede the case but due to the perceived effects of BASF v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,136 (that the request for a case stated left the CIR without powers other than to put the matter before the Authority), it was considered that the Authorityís approval to do this was required before it could be conceded. Through oversight, the Crown solicitor failed to inform the Authority. The objector, in October 2000, sought the allowing of its objection based upon the Commissionerís failure to state a case. By this time the effects of the so-called BASF principle had been trammelled by the Court of Appeal in Miller v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,961 so that it was clear the Commissioner could concede a case without the involvement of the TRA and he did so immediately upon getting the application. The Commissioner pointed out that the TRA has no jurisdiction to award costs between parties, only costs to be paid to the Authority (see section 16(3) and section 22 Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994). Of the possible grounds that costs could be awarded, only the failure to give adequate notice of concession seemed possible and it was submitted that, in the circumstances outlined above, it was inappropriate to make any order for costs. The taxpayer argued that the Commissionerís delay should be considered from December 1996 and was inexcusable. Reliance was placed upon section 6 TAA and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Decision Barber J agreed that there could not be an award of costs to the objector as this was statutory prohibited. He did consider that the Commissioner, through the ìover-technical view of the situationî taken by his advisors, had failed to concede the case at the earliest possible time. In the Authorityís view: ìthe sensible course for the \[Commissioner\] would have been to advise Mr Russell in about December 1996Öthat it conceded the case, rather than doing so 5 years later. That was inadequate notice of the concession in all the circumstances. It defies common sense for the advisors of the \[Commissioner\] to have thought that once an objector has requested a case stated, the \[Commissioner\] became unable to concede the matter.î \[paragraph 6\] This was because to concede a case could never be to exercise powers inconsistent with the Authorityís having assumed control of the matter. Costs of $1,000 were ordered payable to the Authority. 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14. No 07 (July 2002) COMMISSIONER SUCCESSFUL ON APPEAL: TAXPAYER AFFECTED BY AN AVOIDANCE ARRANGEMENT Case:Richard Dale Peterson v CIR (No 2) Decision date:14 June 2002 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Tax Avoidance, section 99(3), Person affected Summary The taxpayer was a person affected by a tax avoidance arrangement and his tax assessment could be adjusted under section 99(3) even though he was not a party to the ìmeeting of mindsî creating the arrangement. Facts This was an appeal from the TRA (now reported as Case U32 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,302). The case involved a tax avoidance scheme based upon the production of the film UTU. The Commissioner was successful before the TRA. The taxpayer appealed. The taxpayer invested in the production of UTU by way of equity and debt financing. Some of the alleged debt financing was borrowed from UTU Funding Limited which, in turn, borrowed most of the funding from Glitteron Films, some $1,142,000 (the balance was from NZ Film Commission (as to $400,000) and a private individual). The taxpayer claimed a deduction for his share of the expenditure and for the costs of borrowing. The funding was paid to UTU Productions under a ìproduction deedî and UTU Productions made the actual film. The TRA considered the loans from Glitteron Films to be a sham and a fraud on both investors and the CIR as the alleged funding was circular and the loans were never actually made. Thus expenses relating to those loans were non-deductible (regardless of any application of section 99 ITA 1976) as were certain alleged expenses incurred. On appeal, it was argued by the taxpayer that he had entered the production deed to buy a film for a fixed price. That he (and the other investors) were purchasers of a film under the production deed and not the makers of one. Thus what the actual costs of the film were (regardless of any sham or fraud in its funding) are irrelevant as he was buying that completed film at an agreed price. The Commissioner argued two points: ïThat the production deed between the taxpayer and ìUTU Productionsî was to make a film, not merely buy one. That the relationship between the investors (the taxpayer) and UTU Productions was an agency one, meaning the taxpayer made the film by his agent UTU Productions; and ïThat, notwithstanding the first point, that section 99(3) applied as the taxpayer was a person affected by a tax avoidance arrangement even if he was not a party to that arrangement or did not know of the fraudulent behaviour of Glitteron Films and UTU Funding. The tax arrangement was the funding from UTU Funding and the artificially inflated expenses. Decision The Production Deed Justice Hammond noted the business concerns at the time the production deed was entered into for deductibility of expenses incurred by ìpassiveî investors (the expenses were incurred in 1982 and 1983, predating Grieve) while noting the deductibility of film expenses to actual makers of films. He then examined the Production Deed. His Honour identified ìthe flaw in the Commissionerís argument, \[that\] agency is not an ëall or nothingí thing. That is, it may not cover all the aspects of a relationship.î (at paragraph 54) Justice Hammond considered that a limited, specific agency could co-exist with a fixed price contract: ìTo my mind, this composition arrangement was an agreement to purchase the film, at a fixed price, but with the management of the making of the film in the hands of the Production Company under the overall supervision of the Executive Committee for these investors. Such ìadditionalî agency powers as were conferred on the Production Company were collateral, and quite specific, and limited. Hence, basically the production Company was supplying a service on a commercially adverse basisófor the best price it could obtain. In the result, in my view it goes too far to make the blanket statement that there was somehow an overarching principal and agency relationship (albeit in the context of a joint venture) between the Equity Participants \[the taxpayer\] and the Production Company. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14. No 07 (July 2002) 8 For myself, I find no difficulty in saying that there was a fixed price contract with the Production Company to supply certain services, but also having specific authority (within the terms of that service arrangement) to undertake certain designated agency functions. But those agency functions do not of themselves alter the character of the fixed price arrangement.î (at paragraph 56-57) The taxpayer was successful on this ground. Section 99(3) Turning to the arrangement, Justice Hammond acknowledged the impact of BNZI but concluded there was no dispute between the parties that there was a tax avoidance arrangement, albeit that the taxpayer was not a party to that arrangement. Making specific mention of Blanchard Jís dicta from BNZI (at paragraph 175) to the effect a non-party can be affected by an arrangement, His Honour then went on to consider the impact of section 99(3): ìAt the end of the day, or so it seems to me, there is no escaping from the proposition that the equity Partners in this case filed accounts and tax returns for the \[film\] project and those accounts and returns included the correctly) disallowed items by the Commissioner. Ö It is difficult, if not impossible, therefore to see how the objector could now go back on the way in which the matter was accounted for by him. In the result, in my view, Mr Peterson did obtain an advantage, albeit indirectly, through a share of the inflated price of the film.î The Commissioner was successful on this ground. Hammond J accepted the correctness of the Commissionerís adjustment. 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14. No 07 (July 2002) Case:TRA 032/01 ñ Interlocutory Decision Decision date:11 June 2002 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994, Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 Keywords:District Court Rules, enlargement of time Summary A successful application by the Commissioner for an enlargement of time under Rule 6 of the District Court Rules for the filing and service of a notice of defence. Facts The Commissioner on 5 November 2001 received a notice of claim. The date for filing the notice of defence by the Commissioner was incorrectly calculated as 29 January 2002. The actual date by which the Commissioner had to file his notice of defence was 24 January 2002. The notice of defence was sent on 25 January 2002, served on the disputant on 26 January and received by the Taxation Review Authority on 28 January 2002. The Commissioner sought an enlargement of time under Rule 6 of the District Court Rules to file his notice of defence. The disputant opposed the application. Decision Issue One The Commissioner argued that Regulation 11 provided for two scenarios. First, where the Commissioner has not issued a disclosure notice, Regulation 11 provided that a notice of defence contain such information he would have included in his statement of position had a disclosure notice been issued. Second, where a disclosure notice has been issued, the partiesí arguments have crystallised in the statements of position issued. While the disputant must file a notice of claim to initiate the jurisdiction of the Authority, under Regulation 11 there is no requirement on the Commissioner to file a notice of defence. In this case, a disclosure notice had been issued. ENLARGEMENT OF TIME His Honour held that Regulation 11 does not abrogate from the general requirements regarding forms and procedures set out in the District Court Rules. It merely makes it clear that, if the Commissioner has not issued a disclosure notice, then the Commissionerís notice of defence must contain such information as the Commissioner would have had to include in his statement of position had such a disclosure notice been served. That was the point of Regulation 11, not that a notice of defence is not otherwise required. His Honour did comment that Regulation 11 is not happily drafted. Issue Two His Honour accepted that Regulation 11(2) is intended to be supplementary to the District Court Rules on statements of defence. The application of the District Court Rules to proceedings before the Authority is specifically addressed in Regulation 4. Under the District Court Rules, failure to file and serve a statement of defence within the required time frame does not in itself preclude the defendant from late filing and service. A judgment obtained by default runs the risk of being set aside. It is settled law that late filing will not necessarily nullify the statement of defence. Rule 5 of the District Court Rules provides that non-compliance with them will be treated as an ìirregularityî and the Court has a discretion as to how that irregularity is treated. Rather than consider the exercise of his discretion under Rule 5, His Honour focused on the exercise of his discretion under Rule 6. Issue Three His Honour saw no inconsistency to preclude the application of Rule 6. While Regulation 11 governs the filing and service of a notice of defence in certain cases, no provision is made within the Regulations (or the Tax Administration Act 1994 or the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994) to extend the time for filing and service. Previous Court of Appeal judgments that the Authority had no jurisdiction to waive compliance with time limits must now be read against Regulation 4. Rule 6 provides for situations where time limits are imposed but for which there is no specific provision to extend that time. It is settled law that Rule 6 gives an unfettered discretion to enlarge the time for doing any act if that is in the interests of justice. His Honour held it was in the interests of justice that this dispute be determined on its merits. The Commissioner has provided an adequate explanation for the delay, which was minimal and due to understandable human error. The enlargement of time for filing until 29 January 2002 was granted. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14. No 07 (July 2002) 10 In granting this enlargement His Honour did not accept the disputantís argument that ìexceptional circumstancesî were required before such an enlargement of time could be granted. The ìexceptional circumstancesî test is from the pre-litigation dispute resolution procedures set out in the Taxation Administration Act 1994 and general District Court Procedures are not governed by that. If Parliament had intended that the failure to file a notice of defence in response for a tax case was to be fatal to the defendantís case, then it would have said so in the clearest of terms. 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14. No 07 (July 2002) Case:Hieber et al v CIR Decision date:19 June 2002 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Effective service, ìPlace of abode or businessî, see section 14 TAA Summary Service to the tax agentís PO Box was effective as the PO Box was the place of business for receiving mail. Facts This was a review of a decision of Master Kennedy- Grant regarding the effective service of notices upon the taxpayer (reported as Hieber & Ors v CIR; London Continental Limited v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,562). The Commissioner had sent section 17 notices (and a letter referring to the effects of section 21 TAA 1994) to a tax agentís PO Box number. Failure to comply with the notices meant that the taxpayers could not adduce any evidence regarding overseas payments due to the operation of section 21(2) TAA. The taxpayers challenged this and had argued that there was no effective service, as section 14 TAA 1994, which the taxpayers argued was mandatory, did not recognise posting to a PO Box number as an effective method of service. The taxpayers also argued that as the notices were not sent to the taxpayers themselves but to their tax agent, then there was no service on them. Before the Master, the taxpayers were successful on the first ground (that the service was ineffective) but not the second (that the tax agent could not accept the notices effectively). Both parties appealed. Decision Justice Baragwanath accepted the Commissionerís submissions and dismissed the taxpayersí submissions. Service on the PO Box Relying upon the Interpretation Act 1999 and Lord Simon in Maunsell v Olins \[1975\] AC 373 at 391 who said: ìstatutory language must always be given presumptively the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstancesî. MAIL TO TAX AGENTíS PO BOX EFFECTIVE SERIVCE Baragwanath J referred to the ìeloquent expression of the truism that the meaning of a word can only be understood in its contextî (at paragraph 18). Thus he considered a PO Box was a place of business (within section 14) for the purpose of receiving mail: ìThere is in my opinion no impediment, logical or verbal, to treating an accounting firmís post office box as a -or indeed the- ìplace of businessî for the purposes of receiving mail.î (at paragraph 19, emphasis Judgeís own) His Honour went on to speculate, in obiter dicta, that use of email would also be within section 14 as a place of business of receiving mail (at paragraph 20). Baragwanath J continued to conclude that section 14 was facilitative (at paragraph 31) but issued the warning that ìthe Commissioner would be ill advised to stray off the beaten path of section 14.î (at paragraph 33) But because he concluded the PO Box was a place of business for receiving mail the Commissioner had not strayed from section 14. Effective notice on the taxpayers He then rejected the taxpayersí arguments that no other person was authorised to act for them noting that Mr Hieber had, by letter, elected to use the tax agent as the address for service for all his interests) paragraphs 34 to 37). He noted that service was made on tax counsel for the taxpayers and there was deliberate decision not to comply. He concluded: ìThe plaintiffs \[the taxpayersí\] having made their election are committed to it.î (paragraph 26) He considered that service on one partner of a terminated partnership was effective service on them all (paragraphs 38 to 45), saying: ìthe policy of the law that the rind should accompany the fruit applies in this context: the former partners may not have the benefit of being able to mount a full case on relationship to the partnership without accepting the burden of the application of section 21 \[subsection section 21(5) TAA 1994\] to that former partnership.î (paragraph 43) He also considered notice to one trustee was notice to all (paragraphs 46 to 50) and notice to the directors of a company was notice to the company (paragraph 51). 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 02/05 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Foodstuffs (South Island) Limited (“Foodstuffs”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 2 and 8. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of certain rebates by members of Foodstuffs. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.Foodstuffs was incorporated on 20 July 1988 as part of the merger of Foodstuffs (Christchurch) Limited and Foodstuffs (Otago Southland) Limited, which was effected in October 1988. 2.Foodstuffs has since been re-registered under the Companies Act 1993. It is also registered under the Co-operative Companies Act 1996. Foodstuffs has, as part of that registration process, adopted a constitution that complies with the Co-operative Companies Act 1996. 3.Foodstuffs mainly operates as a distributor of groceries and other items to banner group supermarkets which are owned and operated by members of Foodstuffs. The banner groups include the following supermarkets: •Foursquare •Pak ‘N Save •On the Spot, and •New World. 4.In addition to the banner group supermarkets, Foodstuffs supplies goods to non-banner group retail outlets and food service customers. Those non-banner group outlets are also owned and operated by persons who became members of Foodstuffs upon entering into a Trading Membership Agreement with Foodstuffs. 5.Foodstuffs only trades with its members who hold either ordinary shares in Foodstuffs or redeemable shares, or both. However, through a subsidiary of Foodstuffs, Trents Wholesale Limited, it also operates a cash and carry warehouse, which is available to persons involved in catering industries, such as schools, catering companies, churches, and various other similar types of organisations. These organisations are not members of Foodstuffs, and have no entitlement to any rebates. Non-members generally purchase goods at a higher price than those paid by trading members except where bulk discounts are negotiated. Rebates 6.Members receive two types of rebates from Foodstuffs. That is, “monthly trading rebates”, which are paid monthly in arrears and “yearly rebates” which are paid after the end of the financial year. Both the monthly trading rebates and the yearly rebates are divided among the members, based on the level of trading undertaken with Foodstuffs by each member. 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) 7.The rebates are determined by resolution of the directors and are calculated with reference to the level of trading in particular types of goods in addition to the profits made by Foodstuffs overall. 8.The payment of two types of rebates evolved over a number of years in order to meet the changing commercial environment in which Foodstuffs’ members operate. Historically, Foodstuffs paid only a year end rebate, calculated with reference to the profits of the company. However, as volumes increased and margins at that retail level compressed, it became necessary to pay regular rebates to members to preserve their competitiveness in the marketplace and their cash flow positions. 9.Notwithstanding that the trading rebates and the year end rebates are distinguished, they are essentially the same rebate. The year end rebates are calculated at the end of the financial year once the profit of Foodstuffs has been established. The Board then determines the level of profit which will be rebated back to the members, and the total profit is then divided between the members in proportion to the total purchases made by the members during the year. This gives the entitlement of each member to a rebate from Foodstuffs. However, some of this amount has already been paid to the members through the monthly rebates which have been paid throughout the year. Therefore, the total amount of rebates already paid is deducted from the annual entitlement to provide the balance of rebate payable. 10. The restrictive credit terms that Foodstuffs imposes on members (compared to those received by other similar companies) have made it necessary to pay monthly rebates to members to ensure that they have adequate cash flow throughout the year. 11. The company does not pay dividends on its ordinary shares and distributes most of its profits each year by way of rebates based on members’ purchases. 12. There is no contractual entitlement to the rebates and the quantum of the rebates is determined in the sole discretion of the Directors. 13. Two factors determine the right to receive a rebate. Firstly, Foodstuffs must derive surplus funds from its trading with its members before any rebates will be paid. Secondly, rebates will only then be paid to persons who are “members”. 14. After paying out rebates the balance of the trading profit (after tax) is retained by the Applicant to pay redeemable preference share dividends and to increase the working capital of the Company. 15. Trading rebates that have been paid out can be demanded back from members and yearly rebates can be withheld or forfeited. The constitution specifically provides for these possibilities in clauses 22.1(h)(vi) and (viii) which state: 22.0Powers and Duties of Board 22.1Specific Powers Without limiting the general powers conferred upon the Board by this Constitution or by law conferred upon the Board, the Board shall have the following powers: ... (h)Rebates To adopt any scheme for rebates to Foodstuffs’ members in respect of the purchase of goods and services from the Company and to make rules to give effect to such scheme and to determine, declare and pay such rebates. Any such scheme may provide for: ... (vi)The power for the Board to require any Foodstuffs’ member to repay to the Company any amount(s) paid by the Company in advance during any financial year on account of anticipated year end profit and final rebate; ... (viii)The power of the Board to withhold or forfeit any rebates; ... 16. Foodstuffs may require a member to repay any amounts paid by the company by way of trading rebates or in the case of yearly rebates forfeit the payment. However, the action of demanding the repayment of trading rebates would be an extremely difficult process and for the reasons outlined below, unlikely ever to be required. •Foodstuffs has developed sophisticated management systems to monitor profit on a monthly basis, and in some respects, on a weekly basis. The system enables them to be acutely aware of profits at any particular time, and enables them to establish, with confidence, a regular pattern of rebates to members. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) 8 •The rebate policy is to distribute only a specified percentage of the expected profits by monthly rebates. The remaining profit is retained and distributed by way of the year end rebates. This practice provides further assurance to Foodstuffs’ members that they will not be required to pay back any monthly rebates in the event of declining profitability. •The lead time between the commencement of the rebate period and the actual payment of the rebates provides ample time, in conjunction with Foodstuffs’ sophisticated management systems, to cancel or reduce future rebates in the event of declining profitability. •Foodstuffs is a professionally managed organisation which has full insurance to cover most unexpected eventualities; should an unexpected event or a significant expense occur, this would be covered by their insurance policies, thereby preventing any drop in profitability. •The Directors require a solvency test to be done at every board meeting to ensure that Foodstuffs can afford to pay the rebate. 17. In the event that rebates paid to members exceed Foodstuffs’ annual profits from member transactions, the Foodstuffs Board of Directors will require that any such amount exceeding the end of year profits is repaid. 18. Historically rebates have never needed to be adjusted for the reasons detailed above. In any event, if rebates needed to be adjusted, this adjustment would occur during the relevant income year. Trading rebates (monthly) 19. The level of the monthly trading rebates payable is determined by the directors of Foodstuffs with reference to: •the gross level of profit achieved by Foodstuffs on the goods •whether the goods are supplied in bulk or repack form •the nature of the goods supplied to the individual member, and •the frequency of turnover of the particular goods. 20. The Directors set the rate of the monthly rebates which are ratified at Foodstuffs’ AGM each year. If necessary, the Directors may review the rate of these rebates during any one financial year. 21. Goods which produce a high gross profit margin to Foodstuffs carry a trading rebate entitlement whereas those which produce a low gross profit margin to Foodstuffs may not carry any trading rebate entitlement. Not all goods carry an entitlement to a rebate. Yearly rebates 22. The year end rebates are determined by the Directors with reference to a combination of the annual profit of Foodstuffs and the product mix purchased by members. The bulk of the year end rebates must be used to subscribe for five year redeemable preference shares. Paragraph 1.10 of the prospectus makes it clear that some of the year end rebates will not be payable to members who do not elect to re-invest all of those rebates in redeemable preference shares. The remainder of the year end rebates are paid out in cash. 23. At the end of each financial year the Directors assess the likely cash requirements of the Co-operative for the next year(s) trading. It may well be that after providing for the trading rebates and existing year end rebates that there are still undistributed trading profits. In such instances the Directors may resolve to distribute some of these funds to members in a cash rebate that could promote particular trading patterns amongst members. This has a three-fold effect. It distributes surplus cash from the Co-operative to members, encourages members to trade with the Co-operative in a certain way and provides members with extra cash flow to pay tax on their allocation of redeemable preference shares. Ownership structure of Foodstuffs 24. There are four different types of share ownership in Foodstuffs. 25. Ordinary “A” shares are held by long-standing banner group members. These shares entitle the holder to vote at any meeting of the company, entitle a member to become a director and vote in elections for directors and share any profit on the ultimate winding up of Foodstuffs. 26. “B” redeemable shares (“BRS”) confer no voting rights on the shareholder. When each member joins the co-operative, they are immediately allocated one “B” redeemable share. These shares provide a mechanism for Foodstuffs to make rebates to members as a member must be a shareholder in order to receive rebates but beyond this, contrary to the payment of dividends by a traditional company, the calculation of rebates does not have any regard to the holding of shares and is instead based upon the level of transactions that members have with the Applicant. 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) All “A” shareholders hold “B” redeemable shares; however not all “B” redeemable shareholders hold “A” shares. As noted above, only banner group members can hold “A” shares as the level of trading of other members, with Foodstuffs, is not significant enough to entitle them to hold voting rights. 27. Redeemable preference shares are described in the Constitution as “C” class shares and are issued to all trading members on the basis that they are in place for five years, rank ahead of other classes of shares on issue, do not share in any profit on liquidation, carry a fully imputed dividend and are not subject to early redemption. A dividend is payable on them each year. These shares effectively provide funding to the co-operative. 28. Ordinary “D” shares are held by the Foodstuffs Protection Trust and carry voting rights. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions. a)All rebates are calculated with reference to profits (or anticipated profits) derived by Foodstuffs. b)There are no other agreements between the members and Foodstuffs, concerning the rebate scheme, other than the Trading Membership Agreement. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The rebates are a supply of money and not a supply of “goods” or “services” as those terms are defined in section 2. •The receipt of the rebates, by the members of Foodstuffs, is not subject to GST under section 8. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 December 2000 to 31 November 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11 th day of June 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) 10 NEW LEGISLATION VALIDATION OF RIGHT TO BE EMPLOYED IN NEW ZEALAND Immigration Amendment Act 2002 - Amendment to the Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The Immigration Amendment Act 2002, which received its Royal assent on 17 June 2002, amends the Income Tax Act 1994 by inserting a new section NC 8A. This new section will require Inland Revenue to ensure that its tax code declaration forms contain a means for an employee to state that he or she is entitled under the Immigration Act 1987 to undertake employment in New Zealand. This new requirement will apply for tax code declarations provided after 31 March 2003. Background The Immigration Act 1987, amongst other things, sets out the requirements for determining whether a person may undertake employment in New Zealand. To undertake employment in New Zealand, someone who is not a New Zealand citizen must be: •a holder of a residence permit •a holder of a work permit •a holder of any other type of temporary permit which allows the holder to undertake employment •a holder of a limited purpose permit granted for employment purposes, or •exempt under the Immigration Act from the requirement to hold a permit. Under this Act, an employer commits an offence if the employer, knowing that someone is not entitled to undertake such employment, allows or continues to allow that person to do so. The Immigration Amendment Act 2002 amends the principal Act to provide that an employer commits an offence who, without reasonable excuse, allows a person who is not entitled to undertake employment to do so. The Amendment Act also provides that an employer will have a reasonable excuse from such an offence if the employer holds a tax code declaration that states that the person is entitled under the Immigration Act to undertake employment and the declaration is signed by the employee before starting employment. Parliament’s Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee added the new provision to the Transnational Organised Crime Bill, which resulted in six Acts, including the Immigration Amendment Act 2002. The new Immigration Amendment Act is not yet in force and will come into force by way of an Order in Council. Key features A new section NC 8A has been inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994. It requires Inland Revenue to ensure that all tax code declaration forms (IR 330–the form for employees to complete when starting employment or changing their tax code) contain a means for the employee to state that he or she is entitled under the Immigration Act to undertake employment in the service of the employer concerned. This requirement will provide a mechanism for employers to have a reasonable excuse from the offence of employing someone who is not entitled to undertake employment under the Immigration Act. The onus will be on the employer to retain the tax code declaration form for Immigration Act purposes. Application date The new tax code declaration forms including the immigration employment status statement must be available after 31 March 2003. Inland Revenue is allowed to provide these forms before 1 April 2003. 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) 12 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. REQUESTS TO AMEND ASSESSMENTS Introduction This Standard Practice Statement sets out the circumstances when the Commissioner may exercise the discretion to amend assessments to ensure correctness. Application This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) applies from 1 September 2002. This SPS applies to the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (referred to as “section 113” in this SPS) and section 27(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (referred to as “section 27(2)” in this SPS). This SPS replaces all previous statements on the Commissioner’s practices when exercising the discretion under section 113, including those contained in SPS INV-300 Acceptance of late objections under section 126 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (March 1997). SPS INV-500 Taxpayer amendments to tax returns (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 9 (October 1999)) is withdrawn from the above application date. This SPS should be read in conjunction with SPS INV-490 GST returns - correcting minor errors (and clarification) (Tax Information Bulletins Vol 10, No 6 (June 1998) and Vol 11, No 2 (February 1999) respectively) and SPS INV-251 Voluntary Disclosures (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 4). Legislation Section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides: 113Commissioner may at any time amend assessments. 113(1)\[Amendments at any time\] The Commissioner may from time to time and at any time make all such alterations in or additions to an assessment as the Commissioner thinks necessary in order to ensure its correctness, notwithstanding that tax already assessed may have been paid. 113(2)\[Fresh liability\] If any such alteration or addition has the effect of imposing any fresh liability or increasing any existing liability, notice of it shall be given by the Commissioner to the taxpayer affected. Section 27(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides: 27(2)\[Alterations\] Subject to sections 108A and 108B and Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner may from time to time and at any time make all such alterations in or additions to an assessment made under this section as the Commissioner thinks necessary to ensure the correctness of the assessment, notwithstanding that tax already assessed may have been paid. Summary Section 113 and section 27(2) enable the Commissioner to amend assessments to ensure correctness. This allows the Commissioner to amend assessments when the Commissioner considers an assessment contains an error or following the application of the disputes provisions contained in Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Inland Revenue considers section 113 and section 27(2) operate alongside the disputes resolution process provisions (disputes provisions) contained in Part IVA of the TAA. The disputes provisions provide the procedures for resolving disputes between the Commissioner and taxpayers. Accordingly it is not appropriate for the Commissioner to exercise his discretion under section 113 and section 27(2) when the amendment is the subject of a dispute, however an assessment can be amended following completion of the disputes process or to reflect an agreed adjustment. When the Commissioner considers an assessment contains a genuine error, and there is no dispute, the Commissioner can exercise the discretion to amend the assessment to correct the error. Inland Revenue considers section 113 and section 27(2) provide the power to amend assessments where genuine errors have been made. This SPS is directed at those instances where genuine errors have been made. It does not provide a mechanism for circumventing the disputes resolution process. 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) The Commissioner will amend an assessment, on a case by case basis, when the Commissioner is satisfied that a genuine error was made and that none of the limitations outlined in this SPS apply. This SPS has been prepared to assist with consistency and understanding of how the Commissioner will exercise the discretion to amend assessments following taxpayer requests. Discussion Section 113 and section 27(2) contain a broad discretion allowing the Commissioner to amend assessments to ensure correctness. They provide little guidance as to how the Commissioner should exercise this discretion in practice. Accordingly it is also necessary to look at the scheme of the legislation and at case law. Decision to consider request Case law indicates the Commissioner cannot be compelled to either amend an assessment or investigate a claim that an assessment is in error. The power in that regard is for the Commissioner to voluntarily exercise. See Commonwealth Agricultural Services Engineers Ltd (In Liquidation) v CIR \[1926\] 38 CLR 289, CIR v Wilson (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 and Lawton v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,531. Where the Commissioner is not satisfied that an assessment contains an error, the Commissioner cannot be compelled to amend an assessment. See Wood v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,255. Case law also indicates that if the Commissioner does decide to consider a claim by a taxpayer that an assessment is in error the Commissioner does not have an absolute obligation to amend the assessment when an error has been verified. See CIR v Wilson (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 and Lawton v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,531. Case law further indicates section 113 can be invoked after a dispute has been initiated or where there is no dispute that an assessment is in error. See O’Neil & Ors v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,051. These cases refer specifically to section 113, however the principles are applicable to the exercise of the discretion in section 27(2). Limitations The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains provisions that impose time limits on increasing assessments. •sections 107A & 108 (time bar for amendment of assessments)–the Commissioner cannot increase tax assessments after four years from the end of the income year in which the taxpayer provides the tax return. Section 113 is subject to these legislative time limitswhen increasing tax liabilities. •section 108A (time bar for assessment of GST)– the Commissioner cannot increase an assessment of GST after four years from the end of the GST period for which the return was provided or assessment made. Furthermore, through the operation of section MD 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), the Commissioner is prevented from refunding amounts of overpaid tax (excluding GST) after eight years from the end of the year in which the original assessment was made. Any refunds arising from the operation of section 113 are also subject to this legislative time limit. Section 45 of the GST Act prevents the Commissioner refunding amounts of overpaid GST after eight years from the end of the taxable period in respect of which the assessment was made. Refunds arising from the reduction of a GST liability under section 27(2) are also subject to this legislative time limit. In broad terms, the Commissioner cannot be compelled to action a taxpayer’s request to amend an assessment. However, the Commissioner does have a duty to correct errors verified by the Commissioner where to do so is consistent with the Commissioner’s duty under sections 6 and 6A (care and management provisions) of the TAA and such amendment is within the limits set out in this Standard Practice Statement. Care and management considerations It is important to recognise that the Commissioner does not have unlimited resources to undertake lengthy verification processes to determine whether assessments should be amended. When meeting the duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, section 6A(3) of the TAA requires the Commissioner to consider: the resources available to the Commissioner; promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers; and compliance costs. Accordingly it is consistent with the Commissioner’s duty under section 6A(3) for the Commissioner to limit the amount of time that will be spent investigating a request for an assessment to be amended. Ensuring a balance between time spent considering requests to amend assessments and other activities is consistent with the duty to protect the integrity of the tax system under section 6 of the TAA. By providing full information to evidence their requests, taxpayers are assisting the Commissioner to uses resources efficiently. By having a practice of amending assessments to ensure correctness where genuine errors have been made, the Commissioner is ensuring fairness to all taxpayers—to those taxpayers who have made a genuine error and to those taxpayers who get their returns or assessments correct the first time. This also promotes integrity in the administration of the tax system. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) 14 Principles The following principles have been established as the basis for the Standard Practice set out below. •Generally, arithmetic, transposition and other types of genuine errors verified by the Commissioner will be corrected—subject to statutory time limits, care and management considerations and other limitations set out in this SPS. •Where a taxpayer is requesting the Commissioner to amend an assessment, the taxpayer must provide all relevant information with the request. •All relevant factors must be taken into account when the Commissioner is considering a taxpayer’s request to amend an assessment. In some cases the length of time that has passed since the error was made may be a relevant factor, however it may not necessarily determine whether the Commissioner will amend or not. •Taxpayers cannot compel the Commissioner to amend an assessment. •If the Commissioner is satisfied that an assessment contains a genuine error the Commissioner does not have an absolute obligation to amend the assessment. •Whether something is a genuine error is determined by the Commissioner. A genuine error in an assessment is something that has resulted in the taxpayer paying the incorrect amount of tax—either too much or too little. •Generally the Commissioner will not amend an assessment while the proposed amendment is the subject of a dispute. However an assessment can be amended to reflect an agreed adjustment. •Interest will apply to tax that has been underpaid or overpaid. •A taxpayer is liable to a shortfall penalty where they have not met the requisite standards of care. Standard Practice The following standard practice has been developed from the above principles. Taxpayer’s requests A taxpayer or their agent requesting the Commissioner amend an assessment to correct a genuine error, is required to supply the Commissioner with all relevant information to evidence the claim at the time the request is made, including: •tax type and period containing the error •amount of tax in error •nature of the error •how the error occurred •how and why the error was identified •action required to ensure correctness. Types of errors Common errors may be arithmetic or transposition errors. There may also be other types of errors which are clear and genuine. Considering requests When considering taxpayer requests to amend assessments the Commissioner must take into account all relevant factors on a case by case basis. Where a taxpayer or their agent claims an assessment contains a genuine error, Inland Revenue will: •determine whether the request is clear •request the taxpayer or their agent clarify a request that is not clear. The Commissioner will amend an assessment when the Commissioner considers all of the following are met: •the request is clear •all information has been provided •the error has been verified by the Commissioner •the amendment is within the time limits (see below) •none of the other limitations apply (see below). Where the Commissioner is not satisfied that a genuine error exists or considers one or more of the limitations apply, the Commissioner will not amend an assessment. Where such a decision is made, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer or agent of the decision and the reasons for the decision. Limitations The following are limitations on the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion to amend assessments. Time limits The Commissioner can only increase a tax assessment within four years from the end of the income year in which the taxpayer provided the tax return. For GST, the four year period runs from the end of the GST return period for which the GST return was provided or the assessment was made. The Commissioner can only make a refund of excess tax/GST within eight years from the end of: •the year in which the assessment was made in the case of tax (excluding GST), or •the taxable period in respect of which the assessment was made in the case of GST. 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) Interpretation of legislation in issue When the interpretation of legislation is in issue, the Commissioner does not consider it appropriate to amend an assessment outside the disputes resolution process. Interpretations of legislation should properly be considered in the disputes resolution process. Not a genuine error If, after considering all relevant information, the Commissioner is not satisfied that a genuine error was made, the Commissioner will not amend an assessment. For example, the facts may indicate a tax position was adopted rather than a genuine error having occurred. Requests following Court, TRA or adjudication decisions, or Rulings When a taxpayer requests amendment of an assessment to reflect a decision affecting the same or another taxpayer, the Commissioner will generally not amend the assessment. However when exercising the discretion, the Commissioner will take into account all relevant factors including: •whether the taxpayer has consistently asserted that they are entitled to a deduction (in contrast to a taxpayer who never sought a deduction in the past, but who becomes aware of a decision affecting another taxpayer and tries to avail themselves of it) •whether the taxpayer has been associated with a claim or action against Inland Revenue on an issue relevant to the request •whether Inland Revenue has told the taxpayer that the outcome of a particular issue would be applied to the taxpayer. Requests following change in Commissioner’s practice When a taxpayer requests amendment of an assessment to reflect a change in Commissioner’s practice, the Commissioner will generally not amend the assessment. However, the Commissioner will take into account all relevant factors and taxpayers will be notified when the Commissioner will exercise his discretion to amend assessments in these circumstances. Current dispute When the requested amendment is the subject of a current dispute the Commissioner will not make the amendment unless the amendment is to reflect an agreed adjustment. Regretted choice (choice between valid options) Where a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to change an assessment from one valid option to another, there is no error to correct. Accordingly the assessment will not be amended. This is a matter of regretted choice. An example of regretted choice is where a taxpayer chooses one of several options for the calculation of a tax liability and subsequently requests to change that option. If however, the taxpayer can prove that the taxpayer’s return erroneously reflected their choice then the Commissioner may consider the request to amend the assessment. Amended returns Although a taxpayer’s request does not have to be in any particular form, Inland Revenue will not accept amended returns to correct errors. However, an amended tax calculation may be provided in support of a request to amend. When correcting minor errors in GST returns, see Standard Practice Statement INV-490 GST returns—correcting minor errors (and clarification) (Tax Information Bulletins Vol 10, No 6 (June 1998) and Vol 11, No 2 (February 1999) respectively). Tax agents may use the Inland Revenue form Tax agents’ request form (IR 796) when requesting amendment of assessments. However, to ensure all relevant information is provided to Inland Revenue, it may be necessary to provide information in addition to the information provided on the form. General Shortfall penalties Where the request to amend an assessment meets the requirements for a voluntary disclosure, any applicable shortfall penalties will be reduced pursuant to section 141G of the TAA. Fresh liability If any alteration or addition to an assessment imposes a fresh liability or increases an existing liability, then the Commissioner will give notice to the taxpayer affected.

We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. DISCOVERY AWARDED AGAINST THE COMMISSIONER Case:Glenharrow Holdings Limited v CIR Decision date:3 July 2002 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Section 138G (evidence exclusion rule), discovery Summary Master Venning awarded discovery against the Commissioner, though not in respect of documents already provided by him under Official Information Act requests. Facts This case was an interlocutory hearing before Master Venning. Glenharrow Holdings Ltd (“Glenharrow”) sought orders for general discovery against the Commissioner and particular discovery against certain non-parties (the Commissioner’s expert witnesses). The Commissioner opposed the applications because the case had been through the disputes resolution procedure. At an initial telephone conference Glenharrow indicated that it wanted discovery from the Commissioner. The Commissioner indicated that such an application would be opposed because section 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the decision of CIR v Dick (2001) 20 NZTC 17,396 meant that discovery was not necessary or appropriate. The Commissioner considered that as section 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 limited the parties to raising in the challenge only the facts and evidence, and the issues arising from them, and the propositions of law, contained in their respective statements of position discovery would not be appropriate. Any documents obtained from the discovery process could not be used in the substantive hearing, so it would not be appropriate to order discovery. Glenharrow argued that an order for general discovery was necessary, discovery was not precluded by section 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and that it was irrelevant that numerous Official Information Act requests had been responded to. Decision Master Venning accepted Glenharrow’s submission that the discovery process is a more general process than the disclosure process in Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and that discovery may disclose documents relevant to the facts and evidence, and the issues arising from them, already stated in the statements of position. The Master considered that an order for discovery should not be seen as offending, or as contrary to, the purpose of section 138G. The Master also noted that Dick related to an application for particular discovery as opposed to the application for general discovery in this case. Master Venning ordered the Commissioner to provide a list of documents relating to the matter in question, though not documents that had already been supplied in relation to Official Information Act requests. 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) ABUSE OF PROCESS Case:CIR v Abattis Properties Limited Decision date:31 July 2002 Act:Judicial Review Keywords:Issue Estoppel and Abuse of Process Summary Strike out application granted. Facts 1.The detailed background of this case can be found in the Court of Appeal proceedings CIR v Abattis Properties Ltd (2001) 20 NZTC 17,013. 2.Following the making of an assessment in May 1999, the CIR demanded the tax due from the taxpayer. This demand was not met and the CIR accordingly issued proceedings to put the taxpayer into liquidation. The taxpayer defended those proceedings on the basis that the assessment was statute barred and that the CIR was not entitled to issue an assessment when a matter had been referred to adjudication. At the hearing a further defence was raised, namely that the taxpayer had not received notice of the assessment prior to the issue of a demand for payment. 3.Master Thomson in the High Court held that: 1.The assessment was made on 27 May 1999. 2.The CIR was not estopped from issuing an amended assessment regardless of the fact that disputes resolution procedures were in process. 3.Liquidation should not be ordered because the CIR was not able to prove that the assessment had been served in time. 4.The CIR appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal accepted that the assessment was made on 27 May 1999 and held that, as a matter of law, liability existed once the assessment was made. The court held that notice of assessment is a separate issue from validity, and that the CIR’s failure to give notice did not affect the validity of the assessment. The court held that the Master was wrong to conclude that the assessment had to be served prior to the expiry of the limitation period but held that in the special circumstances of the case, the Master was entitled to dismiss the application for liquidation in his discretion. The court also considered that the sensible course in relation to the assessment would seem to be for the Commissioner to set a new date for the response period to run. 5.The CIR did this and granted the taxpayer a further two months to challenge the assessment by notice dated 27 February 2001. The taxpayer has made this challenge in separate proceedings. At the same time this present application for judicial review was filed upon grounds of want of proper process. The taxpayer seeks a declaration that the assessment made by the CIR on 27 May 1999 is invalid. The grounds on which it is alleged to be invalid are: 1.That the assessment was made after 31 May 1999 and is therefore statute barred. 2.The CIR failed to comply with statutory procedures in that the parties exchanged statements of position but the matter did not proceed to adjudication whereas the taxpayer had a legitimate expectation that it would do so. 3.The notice of assessment given by the CIR was invalid. 4.The delay between making the assessment and giving notice of it was prejudicial to the taxpayer. 6.The CIR applied to strike out the taxpayer’s application for judicial review. High Court Decision 1.His Honour Justice Durie found that the process complained of by the taxpayer relates to steps taken or not taken as a necessary prelude to the formation of the decision to reassess the taxpayer. In addition a challenge is made to the efficacy of the notice of 27 February 2001. The taxpayer also contends that the CIR cannot establish the date on which the assessment was made and whether it was before or after 31 May 1999. 2.His Honour held that the Court of Appeal did not decide that the assessment was valid but only that any validity it may have had was not affected by any subsequent imperfection over the dispatch of notice. His Honour stated: “The Court of Appeal held (at paragraph 3) that as a matter of law, liability existed once the reassessment was made. No umbrage is taken with that, as a general proposition, in the current proceedings for review. Liability exists from the moment the reassessment is made, but equally, it ceases to exist if later the reassessment is shown to be wrong, whether inherently through lack of process, or whether because it is wrong in fact. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) 18 In any event the main question here is whether the reassessment was ever validly made in the first instance and before any notice was due to have been given.” 3.Further, it was agreed that matters not raised and pursued in litigation, when the opportunity presented, cannot generally be raised for determination in later proceedings. However, according to His Honour that is not what occurred in the present case. In this case, the earlier proceedings were focused upon a different question, that is, whether good cause existed to dismiss an application to have the taxpayer wound up because of a genuine dispute over liability. There was no room for the taxpayer to have introduced the issues it is now raising. 4.In regards to the second issue, His Honour held that even though there is a need to respect and maintain the integrity of the statutory process for challenging reassessments it is important that the issues should be kept distinct, with questions of substance reserved for the statutory process and questions of the process itself kept within the separate area of judicial review. 5.Accordingly, His Honour dismissed the CIR’s application to strike out the taxpayer’s judicial review proceeding. The Commissioner appealed to the Court of Appeal. Decision The Court of Appeal found for the Commissioner on both issues. On the issue estoppel point, Her Honour Justice Glazebrook (who delivered the decision), stated that if a matter has been put at issue in prior proceedings and has been finally decided against a party then issue estoppel precludes that party from contending the contrary of the point that has been decided. In this case, Master Thomas had held that the making of the assessment had occurred on 27 May 1999. Abattis had not cross-appealed against that finding and therefore the Court of Appeal (at first instance) based its decision on that assumption. Master Thomson also found that the failure to complete the adjudication process had not invalidated the assessment. Again this point was not appealed by Abattis. The Court held in appeal from Master Thomson’s decision that the failure to give notice did not affect the validity of the assessment. As a matter of law liability existed once the assessment was made. The validity of the assessment was therefore upheld by the Court. It therefore follows that it is no longer open to Abattis to contend that defects in the giving of notice affected the validity. Further it was at this Court’s suggestion that further notice of the assessment be given to Abattis and it was in accordance with this suggestion that the 27 February 2001 notice was issued. The purpose of this was to give Abattis an opportunity to issue challenge proceedings, a purpose which must be seen as to be of benefit to Abattis. Her Honour held that Abattis cannot succeed in its challenge to actions the Commissioner took where those actions were at the suggestion of this Court. Her Honour went on to state that the issues Abattis seeks to raise in the judicial review proceedings were raised specifically by it by way of defence to the liquidation application, and either the Master made specific findings that were not appealed or this Court made findings which must be accepted as final by Abattis. The Court therefore held that Abattis is estopped from raising any of the issues it seeks to raise in the judicial review proceeding and that the CIR’s strike out application should have been granted. In regards to the second issue on the use of judicial review, the Court made some brief helpful comments as, given its finding on the first issue, it was not strictly necessary to deal with the second issue: The Court reiterated and supported the comments made by the Privy Council in Miller v CIR that it will only be in exceptional cases that judicial review is appropriate where the challenges can be addressed in the statutory objection procedure. Her Honour stated that issues as to process and validity can be dealt with under any challenge proceeding in court and should be, save in exceptional circumstances. In the Court’s view it amounts to an abuse of process to commence judicial review proceedings unless the taxpayer can point to exceptional circumstances justifying that course. Her Honour also added that if procedural issues arise before the statement of position stage then taxpayers who fail to include them in their statement of position do so at their peril. If the procedural issues occur after the formal disputes resolution process has been completed, even where a disclosure notice has been issued, there should be no difficulty in having an application granted pursuant to sec 138G(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to raise those matters. Her Honour held that there were no exceptional circumstances put forward in this case justifying the judicial review proceeding so on this ground too the Court considered that the proceeding should have been stuck out. 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) 20 REGULAR FEATURES DUE DATES REMINDER August 2002 5Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due •Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 2 0Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or ( IR 346) form and payment due •Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 3 0GST return and payment due September 2002 5Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due •Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 2 0Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) •Employer deductions (IR 345) or ( IR 346) form and payment due •Employer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 3 0GST return and payment due These dates are taken from Inland Revenue’s Smart business tax due date calendar 2002 - 2003 21 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) 22 YOUR CHANCE TO COMMENT ON DRAFT TAXATION ITEMS BEFORE THEY ARE FINALISED This page shows the draft binding rulings, interpretation statements, standard practice statements and other items that we now have available for your review.

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 4 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 02/06 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Public Trust as trustee (“the Trustee”) of the BNZ NZ Equity Index Trust (“the Trust”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3(1)(b), CF 3(1)(c), CF 3(7) and the definition of “Excess Return Amount” in section CF 3(14). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the operation of the Trust. The operation of the Trust is governed by the Trust Deed dated 19 March 1997 (“the Trust Deed”) as amended by Deeds of Modification dated 26 November 1998, 23 March 2001 and the Deed of Amendment which will be the same as, or not materially different from the draft deed provided to Inland Revenue on 10 June 2002 (“the Amending Deed”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: 1.The Bank of New Zealand (“the Settlor”) formed a unit trust, under the Unit Trusts Act 1960, known as BNZ NZ Equity Index Trust. 2.The Trust is managed by BNZ Investment Management Limited (“the Manager”). 3.The Trust is a passive investment vehicle, investing only in a portfolio of equity securities, each of which is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (“NZSE”), together with a small cash pool. The Trust will be managed so as to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities, which together form the constituent part of an Index known as the BNZ 25 Equity Index (“the Index”). 4.Members of the public hold units in the Trust and units in the Trust are offered to new investors continually. At the time of this ruling, investors can either make an initial minimum payment to the Trustee of $5,000 (or $2,500 if also investing in another BNZ Managed Fund) or by setting up a regular savings plan with a minimum total regular contribution of $1,200 per year. 5.Unit holders of the Trust are only treated differently in relation to the application fees, issue price and exit price (to the extent that such prices change over time to reflect the change in value of the Trust) and costs associated with entry into, and maintenance of, the Trust. 6.The biggest unit holder in the Trust (at the time of this ruling) is Portfolio Nominees Limited. Portfolio Nominees Limited is the custodian of an asset administration service provided to a number of Investors. AUSMAQ (NZ) Limited is the administrator of this service. The service provided by AUSMAQ (NZ) Limited as administrator and the custodian is not an advisory service. The units in the Trust held by Portfolio Nominees Limited as custodian are held on bare trust. The custodian does not and cannot act on its own volition in relation to its investment into or withdrawal from the Trust. 5 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) The Index 7.The Index comprises up to 25 of the largest New Zealand equity securities listed on the NZSE, based on average weekly market capitalisation. The Trust will not be subject to any active management as such. Rather, it will be managed to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities that together form the constituent parts of the Index. The weighting of each security in the Index will reflect its respective market capitalisation on the NZSE at the relevant date. 8.The “home” exchange of each stock can be any of the “grey list” countries as they are defined in New Zealand tax law. If the equity security is listed on the NZSE and meets the other criteria, it will be included in the Index. There is no discretion as to whether a grey list country security listed on the NZSE is included in the Index. The equity securities will normally be shares but there may also be convertible notes. 9.The market capitalisation for securities that have their “home” exchange outside New Zealand will be calculated under the standard NZSE rules for weighing of non-New Zealand equities. Cash investments of the Trust 10. Approximately 93 – 95% of the net asset value of the Trust will be invested in such investments as the Manager considers necessary to track the Index. While the majority of available funds will be invested to track the Index, a “cash pool” of up to 7% of the net assets of the Trust if the Trust Fund is below $5 million or 5% of the net assets of the Trust if the Trust Fund is above $5 million will be maintained subject to the exceptions listed in condition (a) of the existing binding private ruling for the Trust (BR PRV 02/32). The pool is only invested in bank accounts or money market deposits. Although it is not an objective of the Trust to invest in cash securities, the Trust may hold cash to facilitate easier administration of the Trust. In any event the cash pool will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the following purposes: (a) Allow for cash outflows due to expenses and net withdrawals and to pay the annual dividend to unit holders. (b) Allow for net cash inflows from investments and dividends to accumulate to a level sufficient to minimise the transaction and administrative costs associated with analysing which stocks are to be purchased and making the necessary purchase orders. 11. The beneficial interest in the Trust is divided into units. Each unit (other than a fractional unit that will confer a proportional interest in the Trust) confers an equal interest in the Trust, but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the Trust or any investment of the Trust. Index changes 12. Changes are made to the Index composition in the following circumstances: (a) At the end of each quarter (being a three month period ending on, respectively, 15 April, 15 July, 15 October and 15 January, a “quarter”), securities will be ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous six-month period (ie the six- month period ending on the end of the month preceding the quarter end). If a security not previously included in the Index has risen at the end of the six-month period above the 21st position, that security will be included as a constituent security in the Index at the quarter end and the lowest ranked Index security held at the quarter end will be removed. If a security that is currently included in the Index at the quarter end has dropped below a ranking of 30th by the end of the six-month period, that security will be removed as a constituent security from the Index and the highest ranked security at the quarter end not already included in the Index will be included. (b) At the end of each quarter, securities are reviewed with regard to compliance with the necessary minimum liquidity requirements. In order to be included and to maintain inclusion in the Index, a constituent security must meet a minimum liquidity requirement. Liquidity is defined as the average daily trading volume (over a six-month period leading up to the end of the month preceding the end of the relevant quarter after eliminating the highest and lowest months), expressed as a percentage of the total issued and quoted securities of the same class. The minimum liquidity measure for inclusion in the Index is 0.75% per month. In the event that there are not 25 securities that meet the liquidity requirement, the number of securities in the Index would be less than 25. This liquidity test does not apply to a new listing, which falls within the concessionary rule in paragraph (c) on the next page, until the end of the second complete quarter following the quarter in which listing occurs. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 6 (c) If a security is listed on the NZSE for the first time, it will be included in the Index immediately if: (i) it ranks, in terms of market capitalisation, above the 21st position (compared with other Index securities ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the six-month period ending with the month end preceding the previous quarter end); and (ii) at least 25% of the security is freely tradeable at the time of listing. The security previously ranked 25th within the Index at that time will be removed. If a security listed on the NZSE for the first time does not meet the 25% free float test at the time of listing, but meets that 25% test at the end of the quarter in which listing occurs or the following quarter, it will be included in the Index at the relevant quarter end (subject to ranking above 21st at that time). Again, the security previously ranked 25th will be removed at that time. (d) If the Trustee recommends and the independent monitor referred to in paragraph 19 agrees, then the Index must be altered to reflect a material change to the rules governing the NZSE 40 Index structure made by the NZSE. (e) If there is a merger, takeover offer, scheme of arrangement sanctioned by the High Court or other offer under the Takeovers Code for all of the issued securities of a company: (i) the company’s securities will be removed from the Index when the offeror becomes entitled to, and announces that it will, proceed with compulsory acquisition; and (ii) if the offer has less than 100% acceptance, but nevertheless proceeds and, at that time or any time after the merger, takeover, scheme of arrangement or other offer proceeds, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the compa- ny’s securities will be removed from the Index. (f) If there is one or more partial offer under the Takeovers Code for control (50% or more) of a company included in the Index and at any time after such offer or offers less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. (g) If there is one or more partial offer under the Takeovers Code for less than 50% of a company included in the Index and at any time after such offer or offers less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. (h) If, under the Takeovers Code, a company’s shareholders approve an allotment of securities and, at any time after that approval is given, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. (i) If a company’s securities are acquired under Rule 7(e) of the Takeovers Code and, at any time after the securities are acquired, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. (j) If there is a rights issue or bonus issue (other than a bonus issue election scheme for reinvestment of dividends) to existing security holders, the Index will be changed to reflect the issue of shares on the issue’s “ex” trading date. (If the rights issue is not fully underwritten, the adjustment is calculated as if all rights were exercised.) (k) If there is any other form of capital reconstruction in relation to a constituent security and an adjustment is made to the NZSE 40 Index to reflect the change, the Index will be adjusted on the same date to reflect the capital reconstruction. (l) If any other capital adjustment event such as a share issue (including under a dividend reinvestment scheme) or share buyback occurs which increases or decreases the number on issue of any constituent security and that increase or decrease, measured by market capitalisation on a cumulative basis since the last adjustment, is less than 0.03% of the Index, then any adjustments to the Index will be made at the end of the quarter in which the number of listed securities are increased or decreased. In the event that an increase or decrease represents more than 0.03% of the Index, then an adjustment to the Index will be made, subject to five business days’ notice, on the 15th day of the month in which the number of listed securities is increased or decreased. Rights issues 13. In the event of any rights issue by an Index company, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities if the securities that are the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index. 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 14. Notwithstanding paragraph 13, if the securities that are the subject of the entitlement are over-represented, the Manager will sell the entitlement and reinvest the proceeds in securities to track the Index. 15. If the Manager does not know whether the securities that are the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index, the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in securities to track the Index. Rebalancing 16. The Trust is rebalanced in the following circumstances: (a) When the quarterly adjustments are made to the Index; (b) When the Index changes other than quarterly due to market-driven changes or corporate actions such as merger, takeover, bonus issue, rights issues and capital reconstructions; (c) If the Trust’s holding of a security will be (or is) outside the tolerance levels provided for in paragraph 18 of this Ruling. 17. None of these factors is within the control of the Manager and the factors always trigger rebalancing. 18. The Manager will use best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible. Rebalancing will only occur in accordance with condition (b) of the existing binding private ruling for the Trust (BR PRV 02/32) and any deviation from the Index remaining after rebalancing will not exceed 1% of the Index. 19. The Trustee has appointed an independent party (the Trust’s auditors) to provide an annual confirmation that the operations of the Trust have conformed to these criteria. 20. Investors are able to subscribe for units in the Trust by making a cash payment. The Manager is authorised to accept from an investor a subscription in kind, ie a subscription in the form of a basket of securities that achieves a result of the Trust tracking the then Index composition. 21. Disposition of securities by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust (other than those in the cash pool) will only occur in the following circumstances: (a) If the Trust is ever wound up. (b) If, at any time, the Index composition changes and as a result the composition of the securities in the Trust no longer tracks the weightings in the Index. (c) If, on any day, there is a net withdrawal of funds from the Trust by investors holding units in the Trust which cannot be met out of the cash pool. (d) If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Trust that cannot be met other than as a result of liquidating some securities. This is not anticipated, but the Trustee needs some ultimate protection against extraordinary circumstances such as, say, a change in taxation law or an unanticipated liability or expense. (e) If the Trust is rebalanced in accordance with paragraph 16 of the Arrangement. In respect of the events under these subparagraphs, sales of securities will only be made to the extent required in each case. 22. A fee is payable to the Trustee, which is currently 0.065% (plus GST, if any) per annum of the net assets of the Trust, calculated and accruing on a daily basis. A management fee is payable to the Manager, which is currently 0.95% (plus GST, if any) per annum of the net assets of the Trust, calculated and accruing on a daily basis. No other general management fee will be levied, but it is contemplated that frontend promotion fees (entry fees) will be payable. 23. The Trust is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to correspond to the Index. Such buying and selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. In this regard, the Trust Deed when amended by the Amending Deed will state: The Manager and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Index Company securities. 24. The Manager has confirmed that all aspects of the previous ruling (BR PRV 01/29), relating to the Trust, have been complied with. 25. There has been no change to the Trust Deed (except for the noted Amending Trust Deeds), nor any change to the management or operation of the Trust since its establishment. 26. Under clause 32 of the Deed, the Manager is required to allocate taxable gross income to unit holders, and reinvest those amounts into new units on behalf of the unit holders. To the extent that the distribution can be fully imputed, an amount equal to taxable gross income will be allocated to unit holders. That amount will be reinvested, normally annually, by the Manager on the unit holders behalf and new units will be issued to the unit holders. Any departure from this practice can only occur if unit holders elect to have their entitlements distributed in cash pursuant to clause 33.4 of the Trust Deed. 27. The issuing of units and their redemption will be effected directly by the Trustee. No units are Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 8 27. The issuing of units and their redemption will be effected directly by the Trustee. No units are otherwise quoted on the official list of any “recognised exchange”, as defined in section OB 1. 28. The units will not be issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to the slice rule as stated in section CF 3(1)(b)(iv)(A). 29. Any cancellation of units will only be effected in order to allow unit holders to exit the Trust or decrease their holding in the Trust, unless an investor’s unit holding falls below a minimum value specified in the Trust Deed, in which case the Manager can require the unit holder to redeem their units. Units will also be cancelled in the event that the Trust is liquidated. 30. Except in the event of liquidation of the Trust, any cancellation of units will be in response to the request of a particular unit holder, and not all the unit holders of the Trust. All redemptions will be of whole units (including whole fractional units), not part units. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)This Ruling only applies while this Trust remains a “widely-held trust”, as that term is defined in section CF 3(14) and the Trust units are offered to the public. This condition will not be considered breached: •where the Trust is suspending subscriptions in accordance with condition (o) of the existing binding private ruling for the Trust (BR PRV 02/32), or •during the period following the Manager and/or Trustee giving notice of the termination of the Trust, units are no longer being offered to the public. b)Any cancellation of units will not be part of a pro rata cancellation as that term is defined in section CF 3(14). This condition will not be regarded as being breached solely by reason of a pro rata cancellation occurring upon winding up of the Trust. c)The Trust units will not be quoted on the official list of any “recognised exchange” as that term is defined in section OB 1. d)All dividends received by the Trust, less tax and expenses, will be allocated to unit holders annually. Those amounts will be treated as dividends and then either reinvested by the Manager on the unit holders behalf resulting in new units being issued to the unit holders or paid out in cash. e)Apart from the Trust Deed, Prospectus and Investment Statement for the Unit Trust (as updated from time to time, provided that it does not differ materially from the one supplied to Inland Revenue), and/or any Rules of the Trust that have been supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for this Ruling, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Trustee or the Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Trust) and any unit holder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unit holder) regarding the control of the Trust, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. This condition shall not be regarded as breached by virtue only of: (a) the fact that a unit holder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time; and/or (b) the entry into any agreement, arrangement or understanding contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal (including letters to incoming unit holders explaining the operation of the Trust); and/or (c) the entry into any agreement, arrangement or understanding for appointment or supervision by the Trustee of the Manager; and/or (d) any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Trustee in a capacity other than as trustee of the Trust, or the Manager in a capacity other than as manager of the Trust, in the ordinary course of the Trustee or the Manager conducting an independent investment advisory or investment portfolio management business. f)The existing binding private ruling for the Trust (BR PRV 02/32) (or any such replacement ruling) remains in force and continues to apply in all respects to the Arrangement. g)The Amending Deed provided to Inland Revenue on 10 June 2002 will be executed by 9 August 2002 so that it is the same as, or not materially different from, the draft deed provided to Inland Revenue. 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Any amount received by unit holders on redemption of units in the Trust will be excluded from the definition of “dividend ”in section CF 2, by section CF 3 (1)(b), to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. •Any amount distributed in respect of any unit in the Trust upon the winding up of the Trust, to the extent that the amount distributed does not exceed the aggregate of: i)the available subscribed capital per share cancelled, and ii) the excess return amount, will be excluded from the definition of dividend in section CF 2, by section CF 3(1)(c). •The equity securities constitute capital assets of the Unit Trust for the purposes of section CF 3(7) and the definition of the term “excess return amount” in section CF 3(14). •For the purposes of the definition of the term “excess return amount” in section CF 3(14), gains realised on dispositions of equity securities by the Trust are “capital gain amounts” available for distribution to unit holders at the time of winding-up of the Trust. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of July 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 10 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 02/07 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BNZ Investment Management Limited as Trustee (“the Trustee”) of the superannuation fund known as the BNZ 25 NZ Equity Index Fund (“the Fund”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section HH 3(5) and the definitions of “Superannuation Fund” and “Qualifying Trust” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the operation by the Bank of New Zealand of a superannuation fund known as the BNZ 25 NZ Equity Index Fund (“the Fund”). The operation of the Fund is governed by the Trust Deed dated 24 February 1997 (“the Trust Deed”) as amended on 23 March 2001 and the Deed of Amendment which will be the same as, or not materially different from, the draft deed provided to Inland Revenue on 10 June 2002 (“the Amending Trust Deed”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: 1.The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, as are the “retail” superannuation funds which invest in it. 2.The Sponsor of the Fund is the Bank of New Zealand. The Trustee is also the Manager of the Fund. 3.The Fund acts as a “wholesale” superannuation fund into which other “wholesale” and “retail” superannuation funds invest. The Fund also operates for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to the limited number of natural persons who invest directly in it. 4.Members of the Fund are only treated differently in relation to the application fees, issue price and exit price (to the extent that such prices change over time to reflect the change in value of the Fund) and costs associated with entry into, and maintenance of, the Fund. 5.The “retail” funds investing in the Fund are superannuation funds (both employee and personal) which have previously been (or may in future be) established completely independently from the establishment of the Fund. For example, an existing BNZ “retail” fund, the Bank of New Zealand Future Lifestyle Plan, currently invests in the Fund. Superannuation funds other than superannuation funds established by or managed by the Bank of New Zealand have also invested in the Fund. 6.The Fund was established for the purposes of being a “wholesale” investment vehicle for other “wholesale” funds and “retail” superannuation funds and for the purposes of providing retirement benefits to the limited number of individual natural persons who invest directly in it. All the “wholesale” and “retail” superannuation funds which invest in the Fund have been or will be established for the purposes of ultimately providing retirement benefits for individual natural persons. 7.The Fund is a passive investment vehicle, investing only in a portfolio of equity securities, each of which is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (“NZSE”), together with a small cash pool. The Fund will be managed so as to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities which together form the constituent part of an Index known as the BNZ 25 Equity Index (“the Index”). The Index 8.The Index comprises up to 25 of the largest New Zealand equity securities listed on the NZSE, based on average weekly market capitalisation. The Fund will not be subject to any active management as such. Rather, it will be managed to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities that together form the constituent parts of the Index. The weighting of each security in the Index will reflect its respective market capitalisation on the NZSE at the relevant date. 9.The “home” exchange of each stock can be any of the “grey list” countries as they are defined in New Zealand tax law. If the equity security is listed on the NZSE and meets the other criteria, it will be included in the Index. There is no discretion as to whether a grey list country security listed on the NZSE is included in the Index. The equity securities will normally be shares but there may also be convertible notes. 10. The market capitalisation for securities that have their “home” exchange outside New Zealand will be calculated under the standard NZSE rules for weighting of non-New Zealand equities. 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) Cash investments of the Fund 11. Approximately 99% of the net asset value of the Fund will be invested in such investments as the Trustee considers necessary to track the Index. While the majority of available funds will be invested to track the Index, a “cash pool” of up to 1% of the net assets of the Fund will be maintained subject to the exceptions listed in condition (a) of the existing binding private ruling for the Fund (BR PRV 02/33). The pool is only invested in bank accounts or money market deposits. 12. Although it is not an objective of the Fund to invest in cash securities, the Fund may hold cash to facilitate easier administration of the Fund. In any event the cash pool will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the following purposes: (a) Allow for cash outflows due to expenses and net withdrawals. (b) Allow for net cash inflows from investments and dividends to accumulate to a level sufficient to minimise the transaction and administrative costs associated with analysing which stocks are to be purchased and making the necessary purchase orders. Index changes 13. Changes will only be made to the Index composition in the following circumstances: (a) At the end of each quarter (being a three-month period ending on, respectively, 15 April, 15 July, 15 October and 15 January, a “quarter”), securities will be ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous six-month period (ie the six-month period ending on the end of the month preceding the quarter end). If a security not previously included in the Index has risen at the end of the six-month period above 21st position, that security will be included as a constituent security in the Index at the quarter end and the lowest ranked Index security held at the quarter end will be removed. If a security that is currently included in the Index at the quarter end has dropped below a ranking of 30th by the end of the six-month period, that security will be removed as a constituent security from the Index and the highest ranked security at the quarter end not already included in the Index will be included. (b) At the end of each quarter, securities are reviewed with regard to compliance with the necessary minimum liquidity requirements. In order to be included and to maintain inclusion in the Index, a constituent security must meet a minimum liquidity requirement. Liquidity is defined as the average daily trading volume (over a six-month period leading up to the end of the month preceding the end of the relevant quarter after eliminating the highest and lowest months), expressed as a percentage of the total issued and quoted securities of the same class. The minimum liquidity measure for inclusion in the Index is 0.75% per month. In the event that there are not 25 securities that meet the liquidity requirement, the number of securities in the Index would be less than 25. This liquidity test does not apply to a new listing, which falls within the concessionary rule in paragraph (c) below, until the end of the second complete quarter following the quarter in which listing occurs. (c) If a security is listed on the NZSE for the first time, it will be included in the Index immediately if: (i) it ranks, in terms of market capitalisation, above the 21st position (compared with other Index securities ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the six-month period ending with the month end preceding the previous quarter end); and (ii) at least 25% of the security is freely tradeable at the time of listing. The security previously ranked 25th within the Index at that time will be removed. If a security listed on the NZSE for the first time does not meet the 25% free float test at the time of listing but meets that 25% test at the end of the quarter in which listing occurs or the following quarter, it will be included in the Index at the relevant quarter end (subject to ranking above 21st at that time). Again, the security previously ranked 25th will be removed at that time. (d) If the Trustee recommends, and the independent monitor referred to in paragraph 19 agrees, then the Index must be altered to reflect a material change to the rules governing the NZSE 40 Index structure made by the NZSE. (e) If there is a merger, takeover offer, scheme of arrangement sanctioned by the High Court or other offer under the Takeovers Code for all of the issued securities of a company: (i) the company’s securities will be removed from the Index when the offeror becomes entitled to, and announces that it will, proceed with compulsory acquisition; and (ii) if the offer has less than 100% acceptance, but nevertheless proceeds and, at that time or any time after the merger, takeover, scheme of arrangement or other offer proceeds, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 12 (f) if there is one or more partial offer under the Takeovers Code for control (50% or more) of a company included in the Index and at any time after such offer or offers less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. (g) if there is one or more partial offer under the Takeovers Code for less than 50% of a company included in the Index and at any time after such offer or offers less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. (h) if, under the Takeovers Code, a company’s shareholders approve an allotment of securities and, at any time after that approval is given, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. (i) if a company’s securities are acquired under rule 7(e) of the Takeovers Code and, at any time after the securities are acquired, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. (j) if there is a rights issue or bonus issue (other than a bonus issue election scheme for reinvestment of dividends) to existing security holders, the Index will be changed to reflect the issue of shares on the issue’s “ex” trading date. (If the rights issue is not fully underwritten, the adjustment is calculated as if all rights were exercised). (k) if there is any other form of capital reconstruction in relation to a constituent security and an adjustment is made to the NZSE 40 Index to reflect the change, the Index will be adjusted on the same date to reflect the capital reconstruction. (l) if any other capital adjustment event such as a share issue (including under a dividend reinvestment scheme) or share buyback occurs which increases or decreases the number on issue of any constituent security and that increase or decrease, measured by market capitalisation on a cumulative basis since the last adjustment, is less than 0.03% of the Index, then any adjustments to the Index will be made at the end of the quarter in which the number of listed securities are increased or decreased. In the event that an increase or decrease represents more than 0.03% of the Index, then an adjustment to the Index will be made, subject to five business days’ notice, on the 15th day of the month in which the number of listed securities is increased or decreased. Rights issue 14. In the event of any rights issue by an Index company, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities if the securities that are the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index. 15. Notwithstanding paragraph 14, if the securities that are the subject of the entitlement are over-represented, the Manager will sell the entitlement and reinvest the proceeds in securities to track the Index. 16. If the Manager does not know whether the securities that are the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index, the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in securities to track the Index. Rebalancing 17. The Fund is rebalanced in the following circumstances: (a) When the quarterly adjustments are made to the Index. (b) When the Index changes other than quarterly due to market-driven changes or corporate actions such as merger, takeover, bonus issue, rights issues and capital reconstructions. (c) If the Fund’s holding of a security will be (or is) outside the tolerance levels provided for in paragraph 18 of this Ruling. 18. The Manager will use best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible. Rebalancing will only occur in accordance with condition (b) of the existing binding private ruling for the Fund (BR PRV 02/33) and any deviation from the Index remaining after rebalancing will not exceed 1% of the Index. 19. The Trustee has appointed an independent party (the Fund’s auditors) to provide an annual confirmation that the operations of the Fund have conformed to these criteria. 20. The Trustee is authorised to accept from an investor a subscription in kind, ie a subscription in the form of a basket of securities that achieves a result of the Fund tracking the then Index composition. 21. Disposition of securities by the Trustee on behalf of the Fund (other than those in the cash pool) will only occur in the following circumstances: (a) If the Fund is ever wound up. (b) If, at any time, the Index composition changes and as a result the composition of the securities in the Fund no longer tracks the weightings in the Index. 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) (c) If, on any day, there is a net withdrawal of funds from the Fund by investing superan- nuation funds or natural persons which cannot be met out of the cash pool. (d) If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met other than as a result of liquidating some securities. This is not anticipated, but the Trustee needs some ultimate protection against extraordinary circumstances such as, say, a change in taxation law or an unanticipated liability or expense. (e) If the Fund is rebalanced in accordance with paragraph 17 of the Arrangement. In respect of the events under these subparagraphs, sales of securities will only be made to the extent required in each case. 22. A fee will be payable to the Trustee by each member of up to 0.3% per annum of the value of the units held by that member (plus GST, if any). 23. Each investing superannuation fund must make a minimum initial contribution to the Fund of $200,000 or such lesser amount as the Trustee with the written consent of the Sponsor may approve. 24. Under the Trust Deed for the Fund, members of the Fund have an individual Member Account, into which is credited any contributions by the member together with any growth in value of the funds invested. It is anticipated that the Member Accounts will be calculated and recorded on a unitised basis, ie the total value of the Fund will be divided into units and each member will be allocated the number of units which reflects their respective contributions and earnings. 25. The Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to correspond to the Index. Such buying and selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. In this regard, the Trust Deed when amended by the Amending Deed will state: The Fund and the Trustee do not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Index Company securities. 26. The powers contained in clause 10.1(h) of the Trust Deed will only be exercised to facilitate the purposes of the Fund and in any event will only be used in accordance with paragraph 25 of this Ruling. 27. Members may from time to time elect to withdraw funds from the Fund. A substantial withdrawal from the Fund could be in the millions of dollars. In that circumstance, the Fund may not be able to fund the withdrawal in one portfolio trade as, depending on the market circumstances (including liquidity), brokers are likely to be limited as to the size of the trade they will accept at all. Even if a broker (or brokers) did accept a trade of significant size, they would not be able to guarantee that the trade would be completed or settled within three business days. In these circumstances the Fund will accumulate funds to the full withdrawal amount. 28. The Manager does not have the power to purchase units from Members. 29. The Applicant has confirmed that all aspects of the previous ruling (BR PRV 01/17) relating to the Fund have been complied with except that they received a compulsory share acquisition by court order which required the Fund to hold non-Index shares. This occurred during the Fletcher Energy acquisition when the Fund was issued shares in a company that did not track the Index. (The shares were in a United States company called Capstone. Each Fletcher energy shareholder was issued with a small number of Capstone shares as well as other consideration). As it was a court approved compulsory acquisition the Manager had no choice but to receive those shares. The terms of the issue of the Capstone shares meant that all the recipients had to hold the shares for a period of time before they could sell them and use the proceeds to invest in the Index. 30. There has been no change to the Trust Deed (except for the noted Amending Trust Deed), nor any change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. b)The existing binding private ruling for the Fund (BR PRV 02/33) (or any such replacement ruling) remains in force and continues to apply in all respects to the Arrangement. c)The Amending Deed provided to Inland Revenue on 10 June 2002 will be executed by 9 August 2002 so that it is the same as, or not materially different from the draft deed provided to the Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 14 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The Fund is a “superannuation fund” as defined in section OB 1. •The Fund is a “qualifying trust” under paragraph (b) of the definition of “qualifying trust” in section OB 1. •Amounts derived by investors as a result of withdrawals from the Fund are excluded from gross income by virtue of section HH 3(5). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of July 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 02/08 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as Trustee of the AMP Superannuation World Index Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2, EE 1, EE 2, EF 1, EF 2 and HH 3(5). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the redemption of Units in the AMP Superannuation World Index Fund (“the Fund”) by members who receive securities for their redemption, and those shares are trading stock or revenue account property of that member. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. 2.The Fund invests in securities of those companies that are included in the AMP World Index (the “AMP Index” or the “Index”). The AMP Index is a customised version of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (the “MSCI World Index”) and tracks those securities in the MSCI World Index which are from “grey list” countries if the market capitalisation of the country’s securities included in the MSCI Index represents at least 1% of the MSCI Index. The Fund has been designed to provide members with a simple and cost-efficient method of investing in a portfolio with a performance broadly representative of the world share market. 3.The Trustee of the Fund is the New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited (“the Trustee”), although the Trust Deed contains provision for the retirement and replacement of the Trustee. 4.The Manager of the Fund is AMP Investment Management (NZ) Limited (“the Manager”), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMP Limited. 5.Clause 5.3.1A of the Trust Deed provides: The Fund shall seek to track the Index by investing in Constituent Company Securities as near as practicably possible to their weightings in the Index and the Trustee’s primary investment duty shall be to seek to achieve this purpose. All other investment duties (express or implied) shall be construed subject to this duty. The Fund and the Trustee shall not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Constituent Company Securities. 6.The Trust Deed also ensures that any statutory superannuation schemes (ie any superannuation scheme constituted under an Act of Parliament or government superannuation scheme) can also join the Fund. 7.The Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that its portfolio continues to correspond as near as practicably possible to the Index. Such buying and selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. The sole purpose of the Fund will be to continue to track the Index as near as practicably possible irrespective of whether the sale of shares will give rise to a profit or loss. 8.The beneficial interest in the Fund is divided into units. Every unit confers an equal interest in the Fund, but does not confer any interest in any particular investment of the Fund. 9.The Applicant and the Manager have confirmed that, to the best of their knowledge, the Fund has complied with the previous rulings (BR PRV 01/105 and BR PRD 99/10) relating to the Fund. The Trust Deed and Member’s Booklet for the Fund 10. The terms of the Fund are provided in the Trust Deed. There are no clauses in the Trust Deed or Rules of the Fund or any other documents that operate differently for specific members or groups of members. Membership 11. The Fund was established as a wholesale registered superannuation scheme in which any other superannuation scheme can invest. The Fund was not established by any particular financial institution as an investment vehicle for that institution. Date of adjustments 12. The Fund is rebalanced every quarter and other adjustments are made as a result of mergers, takeovers, rights issues and share buybacks when those events occur. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 16 Mergers, takeovers, share buybacks and rights issue 13. The Index may be adjusted from time to time because of mergers, takeovers, share buybacks, distributions of capital, cash issues, and substitutions of companies in the Index. With the exception of any situation where shares in a Constituent Company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to any companies legislation, listing rules or takeover code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practically possible (but in any event within three business days) to the time the Index is adjusted. The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. 14. In the event of a share buyback by a Constituent Company of the Index, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practicably possible (but in any event within three business days) to the time the Index is adjusted. This adjustment will not be made through electing to participate in a buyback scheme of a Constituent Company, except if the Fund is able to accept a buyback offer at the same time as an Index adjustment for that Constituent Company occurs. 15. In the event of any rights issue by a Constituent Company, the Manager will hold the entitlement if the entitlement is included in the Index. If the entitlement is not included in the Index, but the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities. If the Manager does not know whether the securities that are the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Constituent Companies to track the Index. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 16. Initial contributions to the Fund are made through the Manager. The Manager deposits the cash contributions from the members into the Fund. The Manager invests these cash contributions, in return for which the Manager receives units on behalf of members. The Manager subcontracts the function of converting contributions to parcels of shares in companies included in the Index to Henderson Global Investors Limited (“the Investment Manager”). The Investment Manager is a United Kingdom incorporated subsidiary of AMP Limited. The Investment Manager will purchase securities in the Index according to the pre-determined rules set out above. 17. Under the Trust Deed, the Manager is responsible for further issues of Units in the Fund. The Manager is also responsible for Unit redemptions. 18. Dividends, net of any fees or expenses of the Fund, that accrue to the portfolio of shares held by the Fund will be invested in securities that constitute the Index or are held in cash pending the investment of that dividend. 19. There are certain reasons or events when investments held by the Fund will have to be bought or sold. The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: •If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up, or if the Trustee is replaced (and this of itself means that there is a technical disposal of securities); •If there is a change in the AMP Index composition and the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to maintain tracking; •On the redemption of Units in order to pay benefits to members; •Where proceeds are received by the Fund in the form of securities; •Where there is no election available and where dividends are received in the form of bonus securities and they are converted to cash; •Where securities are purchased in error; •To satisfy a legal claim made against the Fund or the Trustee; •To meet any expenses of the Fund, which are authorised by clause 10.3.10 or 11.3.2 of the Trust Deed. 20. Clauses 10.3.10 and 11.3.2 provide for the Trustee and Manager to be reimbursed from the Fund for all Administrative Expenses (as defined in the Trust Deed) incurred by them. Payment of benefits 21. A member is only able to dispose of its Units by requesting the Manager to redeem the Units for the purpose of paying a benefit to that member. A member may redeem Units subject to the conditions in clause 8 of the Trust Deed. Clause 8.3.3 requires redemptions to be for amounts of at least $10,000 or all of a member’s Units and no member is to be left with less than $100,000 worth of Units. The Manager may also suspend redemptions in the limited circumstances noted (at paragraph 30). 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) The redemption can be in the form of cash and/or cash equivalents and/or securities. Even though the Trust Deed gives the Manager a general discretion to redeem by cheque or the transfer of Constituent Company Securities or a combination of them (clause 8.3.4 of the Trust Deed), redemption in securities will only arise at the request of the member (ie redemption in securities will not arise at the discretion of the Manager/Trustee). In addition, the Manager will not exercise this discretion with a view to increasing the performance of the Fund in any way. Where a member requests a redemption in securities the Manager will only decline a request for redemption in securities due to size constraints (ie the number of units held by the member is small and as such a parcel of securities cannot be formed). 22. Redemptions will be made from the cash pool if sufficient funds are available, otherwise redemptions will be financed from the sale of securities. In addition, following a redemption, the cash pool will not normally be topped up and there is no specified period of time in which the cash pool will be injected with further funds. Accordingly, if there is insufficient cash to pay a redemption if it arises, the redemption will be financed through the sale of securities. 23. Members redeem Units directly with the Fund, with the Manager acting on behalf of the Trustee (ie members do not sell their Units to the Manager who then redeems them with the Fund). 24. Clause 8.3.2 of the Trust Deed provides: Every Benefit payable under this clause 8.3 shall be determined by multiplying the Redemption Price calculated on the date of acceptance by the Manager by the number of Units redeemed and become payable to the Member not later than ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the Manager receives the Benefit request or on any later redemption date requested by the Member. 25. Redemption Price is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean the “Current Unit Value” less the “Exit Fee”. 26. Current Unit Value is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: ... on any date an amount that is arrived at by dividing the Current Fund Value by the number of Units on issue on such date ... 27. The Current Fund Value is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: The amount calculated by adding as at any time when a valuation is required in relation to the Fund: (a) the total of the market value of all Cash, units in the AMP Investments’ World Index Fund and investments of the Fund determined pursuant to clause 6; and (b) the income of the Fund due but not yet received; and (c) any other amounts which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purposes of making a fair and reasonable determination of the value of the Fund having due regard to duly accepted accounting practice and accounting principles from time to time; and deducting therefrom such amounts: (d) as are required to meet liabilities properly attributable to the Fund (actual or contingent and not otherwise allowed for in determining the value of any asset) to the extent that the Manager has decided that provision should be made in the accounts of the Plan; (e) as represent Administration Expenses payable by the Trustee or the Manager; and (f) which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purpose of making a fair and reasonable determination of the current value of the Fund having due regard to generally accepted accounting practice and accounting principles current from time to time. 28. Clause 3 of the Trust Deed provides that Market Value in relation to the Constituent Companies Securities in the Index means: ... the last sale price of that security on its home stock exchange at any relevant time (provided that the last sale price is the same as or higher than the current buy price and lower than the current sell price. In the event that the last sale price is lower than the then current buy price, then the market value is the then current buy price and in the event that the last sale price is higher than the current sell price then the market value is the current sell price). 29. Exit Fee is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean: ... such sum, if any, as the Manager in its absolute discretion may determine (either generally or in relation to a particular Benefit) to be a fair fee payable in relation to the relevant Benefit to provide for the likely per Unit cost of realising Assets to meet that Benefit, having regard to the Manager’s estimate of the aggregate of all costs, charges, expenses, disbursements, commissions, brokerage and other usual fees which would be likely to be incurred in respect of the sale or disposal of Assets on the date of calculation of the Redemption Price if Assets to fund a Unit’s Redemption Price were sold or disposed of on such date. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 18 Suspension of payment of benefits 30. Clause 8.5 of the Trust Deed provides that the Manager can suspend redemptions in certain circumstances up to a period not exceeding 20 business days. The Fund will not utilise the power to suspend the redemption of units except in exceptional circumstances (where and to the extent that it is necessary to do so) being: (i) if the Fund is unable to convert sufficient assets into cash, to meet a redemption request; or (ii) if the market value of the units at the time is not a true reflection of the actual value of the units, due to a suspension in trading of any Constituent Company Securities on any exchange; or (iii) if, for reasons beyond its control, the Manager is unable to calculate the redemption price. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of three business days, except if an exceptional circumstance occurs that is beyond the control of the Trustee and the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. 31. The Fund has suspended redemptions on one occasion before. This suspension occurred as a result of the terrorist attacks in New York on 11 September 2001 as none of the underlying securities held by the Fund were being traded. Ability to decline membership 32. Clause 7.1.5 of the Trust Deed provides that the Manager may accept or decline any application to become a member and shall not be required to give reasons for any such decision. 33. The Manager has never refused an application for membership. However, the Manager may in the future refuse applications for membership. The circumstances where this is likely to arise include: •Where the applicant is not, or ceases to be, a registered superannuation scheme or statutory superannuation scheme; or •Where accepting the application could result in the Fund breaching a Condition of the existing private ruling for the Fund (BR PRV 01/105 or any such replacement ruling). Hedging 34. The Fund will not take any action to hedge or manage foreign exchange risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund being held in non-New Zealand currencies. Borrowing 35. The Fund is permitted to borrow to pay Administrative Expenses. However, the Fund will not exercise its discretion to borrow, although the Fund may become inadvertently overdrawn (for no longer than strictly necessary) where the Fund is required to fund purchases of shares due to changes in the Constituent Companies in the Index where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs. Cash investments held by the Fund 36. Although it is not an objective of the Fund to invest in cash securities, the Fund may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The Fund will hold cash in the following instances: •Following the sale of securities in the course of tracking the Index, pending the reinvestment of that cash; •Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; •Following the receipt of a cash dividend or a non-cash dividend and its conversion to cash, pending the investment of that dividend; •Following the sale of securities to meet a request to redeem units in cash; •To accumulate the minimum amount of cash that will be used to purchase securities in a marketable and economically sensible sized parcel so as to minimise the Fund’s transaction costs. The Manager has advised that this amount is presently US$1 million, but may reduce where a lower amount can permit transaction costs to be maintained at the current level (or a level not materially different). 37. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as cash or cash equivalents will not be greater than what strictly arises out of the above described circumstances, and in any event will not exceed 1% of the total assets of the Fund, except if the Fund receives a large cash contribution (provided the cash is invested as soon as possible and in any event within three business days) or a member requests a large cash redemption (provided the cash is distributed within three business days of the sale of securities). 38. Cash equivalents must have a maturity date of six-months or less. Cash equivalents will not include units in any unit trust or group investment fund. 39. It is not envisaged that the amount of cash required to enable the purchase of securities in a marketable and economically sensible sized parcel will change from US$1 million unless there are improvements in share trading systems that make it economic to trade in smaller parcels of shares. This would be 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) beneficial for the Fund as it would be able to invest surplus cash sooner and keep the cash levels in the Fund at a lower level than might otherwise be the case if the Fund is confined to a pre-determined minimum parcel size. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The Fund is an investment vehicle primarily for investment into by superannuation funds which are themselves either: (i) widely-held investment vehicles for direct investment by natural persons, or (ii) vehicles for investment (directly or indirectly) by other superannuation funds that are widely-held vehicles for direct investment by natural persons. b)The Fund operates in accordance with its Trust Deed dated 4 December 1998. c)The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. d)The Fund only tracks the AMP World Index. e)Where cash is distributed on redemption its market value will be its nominal value. f)Where cash equivalents are distributed on redemption the value of this distribution will be the market value of these cash equivalents. g)The market value of a security at any time shall be the value quoted on the relevant Stock Exchange at that time, as determined by the method provided in the definition of market value in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed. h)The Manager in determining the Members’ entitlement to securities on redemption of Units in the Fund under clause 8.3 of the Trust Deed, shall use the market value of those securities at the valuation time (as defined in the Trust Deed). i)The formula for calculating the “Current Unit Value” as defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed will remain unaltered for the period of this ruling. j)The amounts derived by the Member from the subsequent sale or disposal of securities received on redeeming Units in the Fund will be gross income of the Member. k)Members do not acquire Units in the Fund for the purpose of acquiring securities. l)Units in the Fund are not tradeable on a secondary market. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Pursuant to section HH 3(5) any amounts (including securities) received by members as a result of redemption of Units in the Fund will not be gross income of the member. •The cost of any securities acquired by a member on redemption of Units in the Fund is the market value of those Units at the valuation time of the Units redeemed less any cash or cash equivalents received. •The market value of the Units redeemed is equal to the Redemption Price of those units. •The cost of a security acquired by a member on the redemption of Units is an allowable deduction under section BD 2 and is deductible: –in full in the income year in which the Units are redeemed, if the member acquires the securities as trading stock for the purpose of section EE 1; and –in accordance with section EF 2 in the later of the income year in which the securities are disposed of and the income year in which the gross income is derived in respect of the disposition of the securities, if the member acquires the securities as revenue account property other than trading stock. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 August 2002 to 31 July 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 26th day of July 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 20 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 02/09 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as Trustee of the AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2, EE 1, EE 2, EF 1, EF 2 and HH 3(5). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the redemption of Units in the AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund (“the Fund”) by members who receive securities for their redemption, and those shares are trading stock or revenue account property of that member. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: The AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund The Fund 1.The AMP Superannuation Tracker Fund (“the Fund”) is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. The Fund is not listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (“NZSE”). 2.The Fund has been designed to provide members with a simple and cost effective method of investing in a portfolio with a performance broadly representative of the New Zealand share market. 3.The Trustee of the Fund is the New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Ltd (“the Trustee”) although the Trust Deed contains provisions for the retirement or removal and replacement of the Trustee. 4.The Manager of the Fund is AMP Investment Management (NZ) Ltd (“the Manager”). The Manager invests the investors’ contributions into the Fund. The Investment Manager/ Promoter of the Fund is AMP Henderson Global Investors (New Zealand) Ltd (“the Investment Manager”). The Investment Manager purchases securities in the Index, described more particularly in paragraphs 6 – 8 below. Both the Manager and the Investment Manager are owned by AMP Ltd, incorporated in New South Wales. 5.The Fund was established, as a wholesale registered superannuation scheme, principally for the purpose of paying benefits to persons who are trustees of superannuation schemes registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and who elect to invest in the Fund. Investment policy 6.The Fund is a passive or index investor and is required to hold a portfolio of shares and other notes and options (“the securities”) that correspond to the composition and weighting of the Russell/JB Were Tradeable Index (“the Index”). The Index is a market weighted index with a target capitalisation representing at least 95% of a defined pool of tradeable securities listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange. 7.Despite the Trust Deed providing that the Manager and Trustee can invest in other Indexes, and apart from permitted investments of the cash pool, the Fund will only invest in the securities that make up the Russell/JB Were Tradeable Index and will continue to track the Index as near as practicably possible irrespective of whether the sale of the shares will give rise to a profit or loss. 8.The Fund is required to buy and sell shares as required to ensure that it continues to correspond as near as practicably possible to the Index. Such buying and selling will not be motivated by any intention to derive a profit or gain from such sales. In this regard, Clause 5.3.1A of the Trust Deed states: The Fund shall seek to track the Index by investing in Constituent Company Securities as near as practically possible to their weightings in the Index and the Trustee’s primary investment duty shall be to seek to achieve this purpose. All other investment duties (express or implied) shall be construed subject to this duty. The Fund and the Trustee shall not have an intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling Constituent Company Securities. 9.The Applicant and the Manager have confirmed that, to the best of their knowledge, the Fund has complied with the previous rulings (BR PRV 02/04, BR PRV 99/009 and BR PRD 99/11) relating to the Fund. 21 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) Adjustments to the Fund 10. The Fund is re-balanced in the following circumstances: (a) The Fund’s portfolio is monitored daily, to ensure that it is tracking the Index. The reference to “Fund’s portfolio” means the Constituent Companies held by the Fund. (b) The Manager will re-balance the Fund to the Index following any adjustments to the Index. Such re-balancing will occur as soon as possible but in any case within three business days of a change to the composition of the Index. Management and operation of the Fund Borrowing 11. The Fund is permitted to borrow to pay Administrative Expenses. However, the Fund will not exercise its discretion to borrow, although the Fund may become inadvertently overdrawn (for no longer than strictly necessary) where the Fund is required to fund purchases of shares due to changes in the Constituent Companies in the Index where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs. Hedging 12. This Fund only tracks shares listed in the NZSE and hence the Fund will purchase shares in New Zealand dollars. Accordingly, the Fund will not be exposed to foreign exchange risks. Contributions to the Fund 13. Contributions to the Fund will be by way of parcels of securities or cash. Cash may be accepted in the following circumstances: (a) where there is a contemporaneous redemption against which the contribution can be netted off by receiving cash into the Fund and then paying it out on the redemption; or (b) to the extent the application cannot be made in securities due to uneven parcel sizes provided the cash pool remains below 0.5% of the total assets of the Fund and, except where the situations listed in paragraph 15 arise or where the cash is committed to fund an obligation that was known at the time of receipt of the subscription, the cash is converted to Constituent Company Securities as soon as practicably possible. 14. Members wishing to contribute cash may be required to purchase a parcel of securities through a separate arrangement with the Manager, or through other intermediaries (such as brokers and financial advisors). Cash investments held by the Fund (“cash pool”) 15. The proportion of the Fund’s assets to be held as the cash pool will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the purposes of the cash pool (as stated in paragraph 16 of this Ruling), and will not in any event exceed 0.5% of the total assets of the Fund, except if: (i) the Fund receives a large cash contribution (provided the cash is invested as soon as possible and in any event within three business days); or (ii) a member requests a large cash redemption (provided the cash is distributed within three business days of the sale of securities); or (iii) the Fund receives a large cash inflow from or in respect of a Constituent Company, such as a distribution due to a pro rata buyback or takeover or a change in the Constituent Companies of the Index (provided the cash is invested as soon as possible and in any event within three business days); or (iv) the Fund holds cash as a result of disposing of securities in the course of and for the purposes of winding up the Fund. 16. The purpose of the cash pool as set out in Clause 5.2.5 of the Trust Deed is: The Trustee may maintain or invest in Cash in any amount representing up to five percent (5%) of the Current Fund Value at any time, PROVIDED THAT the investment in Cash shall only be used to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund and to reduce the number of transactions required to be made or to facilitate redemptions from time to time, but may not be used by the Manager or the Trustee to increase the performance of the Fund by maximising the holding of securities considered to be likely to give a high return or minimising the holding of securities considered likely to give a low return. 17. “Cash”, as defined in Clause 3 of the Trust Deed includes: deposits, or negotiable instruments, in each case having maturities which are not later than the times at which the proceeds of realisation thereof are expected to be required, and on which there is full indefeasible liability of: (a) a New Zealand registered bank (having the meaning given to that term by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989) approved by the Manager for the purpose; or (b) the New Zealand government. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 22 18. The size and operation of the cash pool will be strictly managed so as to reflect its three-fold purpose of: (a) Allowing funds to accumulate to an appropriate amount for investment, and (b) Minimising the number of equity security sale and purchase transactions, and (c) Managing the liquidity of the Fund in respect of meeting its anticipated liabilities and withdrawals. 19. When the cash held by the Investment Manager reaches the minimum investment level, it will be applied to acquire securities to track the Index as soon as practicably possible. The Manager has advised the minimum amount required to enable the purchase of every security in the Index in a marketable and economically sensible sized parcel is approximately $50,000, but may reduce where a lower amount can permit transaction costs to be maintained at the current level (or a level not materially different). 20. It is not envisaged that the amount of cash required to enable the purchase of securities in a marketable and economically sensible sized parcel will change from $50,000 unless there are improvements in share trading systems that make it economic to trade in smaller parcels of shares. This would be beneficial for the Fund as it would be able to invest surplus cash sooner and keep the cash levels in the Fund at a lower level than might otherwise be the case if the Fund is confined to a pre-determined minimum parcel size. 21. The Fund does not normally hold cash equivalents. Rather, the cash amounts are normally held in bank deposits and interest is paid on these deposits. Dividend reinvestment 22. In the event of a dividend reinvestment option being available to the Trustee, the Manager will only accept such an option if it is consistent with tracking the Index. In all other cases, the Manager will decline the option and will always accept the cash dividend that will be immediately allocated to members. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 23. There are certain reasons or events when investments held by the Fund will have to be bought or sold. The Trustee will only dispose of securities (other than cash pool investments): (a) If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up or if the Trustee is replaced (and this of itself means that there is a technical disposal of securities); (b) If there is a change in the Index composition and the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to maintain tracking; (c) When transferring securities to a member if the member redeems units for securities; (d) Where there is no option available to receive dividends in the form of cash, and dividends are received in the form of bonus securities and are converted to cash; (e) To satisfy a legal claim against the Fund or Trustee or to meet expenses of the Fund, but only to the extent to which such a claim or expense cannot be met from existing resources; (f) If a member or members require cash on redemption of units and such redemption cannot be met from the cash pool; (g) Where securities are purchased in error. Redemption of units 24. A member is only able to dispose of their units by redeeming them. A member may redeem units subject to the conditions in Clause 8 of the Trust Deed. Clause 8 requires redemptions to be for amounts of at least $10,000 or all of a member’s units and no member is to be left with less than $100,000 worth of units. The redemption can be in the form of cash and/or cash equivalents and/or securities. 25. Redemptions are usually made through the transfer of Constituent Company Securities (equal to the value of the units being redeemed and may also contain a small cash balancing item) but may, in the circumstances described below, be made in cash. 26. In the following circumstances a redemption will be made in cash (where that cash is not committed for other purposes): (a) Where there is a contemporaneous contribution against which the redemption can be matched; or (b) Where the cash is sufficient to fund the redemption in full, that redemption will be made from the cash pool; and (c) Where the cash is not sufficient to fund the redemption in full, the balance of the redemption will be made from securities in the proportions that will ensure that the Fund will continue to match the composition and weighting of the Index as near as practicably possible. 23 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 27. Clause 8.3.2 of the Trust Deed provides: Every Benefit payable under this clause 8.3 shall be determined by multiplying the Redemption Price calculated on the date of acceptance by the Manager by the number of units redeemed and become payable to the Member not later than ten (10) Business Days following the date on which the Manager receives the Benefit request or on any later redemption date requested by the Member. 28. Redemption Price is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean the “Current Unit Value” less the “Exit Fee”. 29. Current Unit Value is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: ... on any date an amount that is arrived at by dividing the Current Fund Value by the number of Units on issue on such date ... 30. The Current Fund Value is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed as: The amount calculated by adding as at any time when a valuation is required in relation to the Fund: (a) the total of the market value of all Cash, units in the AMP Investments’ Tracker Fund and investments of the Fund determined pursuant to clause 6; and (b) the income of the Fund due but not yet received; and (c) any other amounts which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purposes of making a fair and reasonable determination of the value of the Fund having due regard to duly accepted accounting practice and accounting principles from time to time; and deducting therefrom such amounts: (d) as are required to meet liabilities properly attributable to the Fund (actual or contingent and not otherwise allowed for in determining the value of any asset) to the extent that the Manager has decided that provision should be made in the accounts of the Plan; (e) as represent Administration Expenses payable by the Trustee or the Manager; and (f) which, in the opinion of the Manager, should be included for the purpose of making a fair and reasonable determination of the current value of the Fund having due regard to generally accepted accounting practice and accounting principles current from time to time. 31. Clause 3 of the Trust Deed provides that Market Value in relation to a Constituent Company Security in the Index means: ... its value as in the Index at any relevant time. 32. Exit Fee is defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed to mean: ... such sum, if any, as the Manager in its absolute discretion may determine (either generally or in relation to a particular Benefit) to be a fair fee payable in relation to the relevant Benefit to provide for the likely per Unit cost of realising Assets to meet that Benefit, having regard to the Manager’s estimate of the aggregate of all costs, charges, expenses, disbursements, commissions, brokerage and other usual fees which would be likely to be incurred in respect of the sale or disposal of Assets on the date of calculation of the Redemption Price of Assets to fund a Unit’s Redemption Price were sold or disposed of on such date. Suspension of redemptions 33. Clause 8.5 of the Trust Deed provides that the Manager can suspend redemptions in certain circumstances up to a period not exceeding 20 business days. The Fund will not utilise the power to suspend the redemption of units except in exceptional circumstances (where and to the extent that it is necessary to do so) being: (i) if the Fund is unable to convert sufficient assets into cash, to meet a redemption request; or (ii) if the market value of the units at the time is not a true reflection of the actual value of the units, due to a suspension in trading of any Constituent Company Securities on any exchange; or (iii) if, for reasons beyond its control, the Manager is unable to calculate the redemption price. Any such suspension will be for a maximum period of three business days, except if an exceptional circumstance occurs that is beyond the control of the Trustee and the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund and/or the Manager to recover from that event. Utilisation of member expenses for tax purposes 34. The Trust Deed has been amended to allow the Trustee to credit a Member’s Account with units in recognition of any tax deduction that the Plan has received as a result of an election by that member under section DI 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Trust Deed was amended, by the Second Deed of Amendment dated 1 February 2002, by inserting Clause 12A. Sub-clause 12A.1, which is relevant for the purposes of the Ruling, provides that: Where a Member has made an election under section DI 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (“section DI 3(2)”) that any expenditure, which is incurred by the superannuation scheme for which the Member is a trustee (or, in respect of a superannuation scheme constituted under an Act of Parliament, the person appointed to administer the superannuation scheme), Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 24 be treated as if it were expenditure incurred by the Plan and the Plan has received a tax deduction as a result of that election, the Trustee shall credit to the Member Account of the relevant Member such number of Units as the Trustee considers equitable to recognise such tax deduction. For the avoidance of doubt, the number of units to be issued in normal circumstances would be calculated by reference to the amount determined by dividing the amount of any tax benefit which the Manager considers arises from the tax deduction by the Issue Price applying on the Business Day on which the tax benefit is considered by the Manager to arise. 35. The Fund will always issue Units according to the above Clause and there will be no discretion as to whether the Fund will in fact issue Units in accordance with the above Clause. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following Conditions: a)The Fund is an investment vehicle primarily for investment into by superannuation funds which are themselves either: (i) widely-held investment vehicles for direct investment by natural persons, or (ii) vehicles for investment (directly or indirectly) by other superannuation funds that are widely-held vehicles for direct investment by natural persons. b)The Fund operates in accordance with its Trust Deed dated 10 February 1999. c)The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. d)The Fund only tracks the Russell/JB Were Tradeable Index. e)Where cash is distributed on redemption its market value will be its nominal value. f)Where cash equivalents are distributed on redemption, the value of this distribution will be the market value of these cash equivalents. g)In determining the market value of a security at any time the last sale price for that security, as quoted on the New Zealand Stock Exchange at that time, shall be used. h)The Manager in determining the Members’ entitlement to securities on redemption of Units in the Fund under clause 8.3 of the Trust Deed, shall use the market value of those securities at the valuation time (as defined in the Trust Deed). i)The formula for calculating the “Current Unit Value” as defined in clause 3 of the Trust Deed will remain unaltered for the period of this ruling. j)The amounts derived by the Member from the subsequent sale or disposal of securities received on redeeming units in the Fund will be gross income of the Member. k)Members do not acquire units in the Fund for the purpose of acquiring securities. l)Units in the Fund are not tradeable on a secondary market. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Pursuant to section HH 3(5) any amounts including securities received by members as a result of redemption of units in the Fund will not be gross income of the member. •The cost of any securities acquired by a member on redemption of units in the Fund is the market value of those units at the valuation time of the units redeemed less any cash or cash equivalents received. •The market value of the units redeemed is equal to the Redemption Price of those units. •The cost of a security acquired by a member on the redemption of units is an allowable deduction under section BD 2 and is deductible: –in full in the income year in which the units are redeemed, if the member acquires the securities as trading stock for the purpose of section EE 1; and –in accordance with section EF 2 in the later of the income year in which the securities are disposed of and the income year in which the gross income is derived in respect of the disposition of the securities, if the member acquires the securities as revenue account property other than trading stock.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 27 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 02/12 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BNZ Capital Guaranteed Growth Fund Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of the definitions of “financial arrangement” in section EH 14, “approved issuer”, “interest” and “money lent” in section OB 1, the definition of “associated persons” in section OD 7, sections FC 1, NG 2 and NG 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and section 86G of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue of certain capital guaranteed growth notes and related transactions. The Bank of New Zealand (“the BNZ”) has established BNZ Capital Guaranteed Growth Fund Limited (“FundCo”), a vehicle which has issued notes to investors, the return on which is linked in part to the futures market. FundCo is a wholly owned subsidiary of the BNZ. In addition, repayment on maturity of an amount determined to be 117.5% of the initial capital invested on subscription of these notes is guaranteed by the BNZ. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: (a) Issue of Notes: FundCo has issued a series of notes (“the Notes”) to investors at an issue price of NZ$1,000 per Note. Each Note represents an agreement to make progress payments (“the Variable Growth Payments”) and to sell, on a cash settled basis, to the investor on 7 May 2007 (“the maturity date”), a stated proportion of FundCo’s assets on that date (“the FundCo Agreements”). The Notes will be debt securities under the Securities Act 1978 and accordingly FundCo has appointed a trustee and entered into a trust deed for the benefit of the Noteholders as required by the Securities Act 1978. (b) Termination: On the termination or maturity date, instead of FundCo physically delivering all of the assets in the Account in settlement of all the outstanding Notes, there will be a cash settlement of each Note equal to the value of the specified proportion of the assets being purchased. Subject to the applicable fees and charges for early settlement, the Noteholders are able to call for early settlement and settlement may also occur on the occurrence of certain events. This is outlined in the Trust Deed and the Cash Settled Agreement. (c) Variable Growth Payments: During the term of the Notes, the Variable Growth Payments are to be made by FundCo to investors based upon a fixed percentage of the increase in value of the Net Assets of AHL Guaranteed Trading (NZ) Limited (“TradeCo”) (see (g) next page). Restrictions may be placed on payments which would reduce the value below either of the original investment or the highest net asset value on any previous progress payment date. In addition, if there is early settlement in respect of some Notes that is taken into account when calculating the original investment or the highest net asset value. (d) Capital Guarantee Fund: FundCo has used a proportion of the amount received from the issue of the Notes to invest in a deposit (“the Deposit”) with the BNZ. On maturity, the value of the Deposit and of the Net Assets that will be received by FundCo from TradeCo will be cash settled. The amount to be distributed to investors has been guaranteed by the BNZ to be 117.5% of the aggregate amount subscribed by the investors on the original issue of the Notes that are then outstanding. This amount (“the Capital Guaranteed Amount”) is guaranteed to be repaid to investors by the BNZ. e)Futures Market: FundCo has invested the balance of the amount received from the issue of the Notes (ie after investing in the Deposit and meeting certain expenses) by way of an agreement for sale and purchase with TradeCo of that company’s Net Assets (“the TradeCo Agreement”). TradeCo is owned by three trustees of a trust established for New Zealand charitable purposes. TradeCo makes investments in the futures market (see (h) next page). The TradeCo Agreement provides for a sale of TradeCo’s Net Assets, with settlement at a stated time, being 10 years after entry into the agreement (subject to FundCo’s right to call for early settlement and settlement on the occurrence of certain events). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 28 (f)Cash Settled Sale: Instead of physical delivery of TradeCo’s Net Assets on settlement, there will be a cash settlement of the agreement equal to the value of TradeCo’s Net Assets. It is not intended that TradeCo’s Net Assets will be physically delivered to FundCo except in the event of a default by TradeCo to make the cash settlement payment. The cash proceeds will form part of the assets of FundCo subject to the settlement referred to in paragraph (b). (g) Variable Growth Payments: During the term of the Notes progress payments are to be made by TradeCo to FundCo based upon a fixed percentage of the increase in value of TradeCo’s Net Assets (thereby enabling FundCo to make the payments described in paragraph (c) to investors during the term of the agreements). The restrictions described in paragraph (c) will also apply to these progress payments. (h) Futures Investment: TradeCo will continue to use the moneys received by it under the agreement for sale with FundCo to invest in futures, foreign exchange and derivative contracts. This investment is being managed by Man Investment Products Limited under an Investment Management Agreement. The principal futures broker is Man Financial Limited, appointed along with the Introducing Broker, Man Management AG under an Introducing Broker Agreement. (i)Guarantee: TradeCo has entered into a guarantee agreement (“the Guarantee Deed”) with the BNZ under which the BNZ has agreed to guarantee repayment of the Capital Guaranteed Amount on the maturity date. This guarantee does not apply where Notes are redeemed prior to maturity. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: •The FundCo Agreements are not held by an associated person (as defined in section OD 7) of FundCo (section NG 2(1)(b)(i)). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The FundCo Agreements are “financial arrangements” as defined in section EH 14 and do not constitute debentures to which section FC 1 applies; •The amounts invested under the FundCo Agreements constitute “money lent” as that term is defined in section OB 1; •The FundCo Variable Growth Payments and amounts paid to investors on settlement in excess of the amounts invested will constitute “interest” as that term is defined in section OB 1; •The FundCo Agreements may continue to be registered by an approved issuer as registered securities under section 86G of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971; and •Because FundCo is an approved issuer under section NG 6, payments made by FundCo which constitute interest for tax purposes and which are derived by non-residents, will be subject to non-resident withholding tax at the rate of 0% pursuant to section NG 2. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 2002 until 30 June 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 23rd day of August 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 29 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 30 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS This section of the Tax Information Bulletin contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. EASEMENTS – DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE COSTS OF PREPARATION, STAMPING, AND REGISTRATION This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on the deductibility of expenditure incurred for the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income—previously stated in Public Ruling BR PUB 98/7 Easements – deductibility of costs of preparation, stamping, and registration, published in the Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 10, No.12 (December 1998). The ruling ceased to apply from 31 March 2002. Public Ruling BR 98/7 has not been reissued as there is some doubt as to whether the arrangement to which the Ruling applied is an arrangement (as defined in the Act) for which a Public Ruling can be issued. Summary All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This interpretation statement considers whether the expenditure incurred for the preparation, stamping, and registration of an easement used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income is deductible under section DJ 11. Section DJ 11 applies as follows: •An easement is a lease for the purposes of section DJ 11. •The Commissioner will allow a deduction for costs incurred by a taxpayer in the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements where they are used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income, in the income year in which the expenditure is incurred. •Payments made for the grant of an easement are not expenditure incurred in the preparation of an easement and therefore not deductible under section DJ 11. Background Land may have its utility enhanced by the right to the use of an easement. Once registered an easement gives an interest in the land that is of enduring benefit. Under section DJ 11 a taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the costs of the preparation, stamping, and registration of “any lease of property used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income”. Issue The issue is whether an easement is a “lease of property” as defined in the Act. Legislation Section DJ 11 states: A taxpayer is allowed a deduction in respect of expenditure incurred by the taxpayer during an income year for the preparation, stamping, and registration of any lease of property used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income, of any renewal of any such lease, or in the borrowing of money employed by the taxpayer as capital in the derivation of gross income. The following are defined terms in section OB 1: “Estate” or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: “Interest” – ... (b)In relation to land, has the same meaning as “estate” 31 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) “Lease” – (a)Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: Analysis The nature of an easement The essential elements of an easement, as developed by common law, are that: •there must be a dominant tenement and a servient tenement (Hawkins v Rutter \[1892\] 1 QB 668); and •the easement must accommodate the dominant tenement such that it is related to the utility of the land and must do more than confer a personal benefit on the owner of the land (Re Ellenborough Park \[1955\] 3 All ER 667); and •the dominant owner and servient owner must be different persons (Metropolitan Rly Co v Fowler \[1892\] 1 QB 165); and •the easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of the grant (Re Ellenborough Park). In New Zealand, the common law elements of an easement have been modified by statute. The statutory modification has created “easements in gross”. Section 122 of the Property Law Act 1952 allows the creation of easements in gross. An easement in gross is one where there is no requirement for a dominant tenement. The right created by the easement is not appurtenant to another parcel of land. This modifies the first element of a common law easement, that there be a dominant and servient tenement. While statute permits an easement where there is no dominant tenement, there must be a servient tenement. This is necessary, for if the right granted by the easement arises from ownership of the land, there is no requirement to claim that right as an easement as it already exists. Two other features of an easement, while not defining characteristics, further describe the rights and limitations of an easement: •An easement permanently binds the land over which the right is exercised, and similarly subsists permanently for the benefit of the dominant tenement. One issue that arises is whether the rule against perpetuities applies to an easement. If the right created by the easement vests immediately with the grantee, authority indicates that the rule against perpetuities does not apply (Ellison v Vukicevic (1986) 7 NSWLR 104). •The notion that an easement cannot and does not confer a right to possession in the land over which the right is granted (Copeland v Greenhalf \[1952\] 1 All ER 809). An easement is a lease for the purposes of the Act Although an easement is not an estate in land, it is an interest in land as contemplated by the law of real property. In Auckland City Council v Man O’War Station Limited \[1996\] 3 NZLR 460, Anderson J observed: An easement... is an incorporeal hereditament, which is a right in respect of land, and therefore an interest in land, but it is not land in the tangible sense nor an estate in land in the common law sense. \[page 465\] \[emphasis added\] An easement may be distinguished from other lesser rights such as a licence. A licence is a personal right and so does not pass an interest in the land in the way that an easement does (Errington v Errington \[1952\] 1 All ER 149 and Thomas v Sorrell (1673) 124 ER 1098). A lease, as contemplated in the law of real property, is an estate of less than freehold. Estates of less than freehold exist where the duration of the estate is certain or capable of being made certain (Charles Clay & Sons Ltd v British Railways Board \[1971\] 1 All ER 1007). Adams EC (Ed) in Garrow’s Law of Real Property (Butterworths, Wellington, 1961) categorises leases whether for a fixed term, at will, or at sufferance as the estates of less than freehold. For the purposes of the Act, a “lease” is defined in section OB 1 as any disposition by which a “leasehold estate” is created. An easement is created by a disposition of property. The owner of the fee simple which will become the servient tenement surrenders, or disposes of, part of his or her right in the land to another person. Also implicit in the definition is that the disposition must create a leasehold estate. That is, the disposition must not be one that, for example, transfers the leasehold estate in the land. An easement qualifies, as it is not a transfer of any interest in the land but the creation of an interest in the land, a right that attaches to land so that it may improve its use and benefit. “Leasehold estate” is also defined, as any estate however created, other than a freehold estate. The concept of a “freehold estate” was developed by common law. A freehold estate is one of uncertain duration: the feature that distinguishes it from an estate of less than freehold, ie a lease. In the case of individuals it is uncertain as it is measured by reference to their lives. For corporations, it is uncertain, as they may continue on indefinitely. There are three types of freehold estates in New Zealand: the fee simple which will endure until the holder of the estate dies intestate without heirs, the life estate which will continue only for the life of the holder and is extinguished on that person’s death, and the stratum estate created by section 4(2) of the Unit Titles Act 1972. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 32 The term “estate”, also defined in the Act, is coupled with the word “interest”. “Interest” is defined as having in relation to land the same meaning as “estate”. For the purposes of the Act, therefore, the terms “estate” or “interest” are merged and treated synonymously. An easement is an interest in land. A lease is an estate in land. The term “lease” is the nomenclature used in the Act for estates or interest in land unless specifically excluded, such as estates of freehold and mortgages. An easement as an interest in land is therefore a “lease” as defined in the Act. Therefore section DJ 11 applies to the costs of preparation, stamping, and registration of easements. Incurred expenditure allowable by the Commissioner It is difficult to identify definitively the types of expenditure incurred in the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements. The costs incurred in the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements are not specified in the Act. The Courts have not had occasion to consider the types of expenses that are incurred in the “preparation” of an easement in the context of section DJ 11. However, the word “preparation” or “prepare” has been considered judicially (Horsley v Collier and Cartly Ltd \[1965\] 2 All ER 423 and Calabria v R (1982) 151 CLR 671). Those cases point to the word “preparation” indicating something that is done prior to it being ready for its use. Where the character of the expenditure is for the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement and the easement is used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income, then the statutory requirement has been satisfied and a deduction permitted accordingly. It is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of preparation costs. However, an example of costs that will be allowed are legal costs, registration fees, and surveying costs. Costs for granting of an easement not deductible It is not uncommon for the owner of what will become the servient tenement to receive a sum of money for granting the easement. Payment for the granting of an easement is not part of the preparation expenses. Preparation expenses are expenses incurred in the acts or instances of preparing an easement. Payments for the grant of an easement are payments made in consideration for the grant of an easement and are not expenses incurred in the process of preparing an easement. Payments made for the grant of an easement are not deductible under section DJ 11. Example Farmer Ltd is a company conducting its agricultural and horticultural activities in an area where rainfall is limited and there is no natural irrigation. Farmer Ltd arranges for irrigation to be provided to the property. This requires reticulation across a neighbouring property. Farmer Ltd incurs survey costs and legal fees in the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement allowing the diverted water to be transported to Farmer Ltd’s property. Farmer Ltd agrees to pay the owner of the neighbouring property a one-off lump sum payment for the right to create the easement. In addition, the owner of the dominant tenement, Farmer Ltd, agrees to pay the legal costs for reviewing and approving the drafted easement’s documentation incurred by the owner of the neighbouring property, ie the owner of the servient tenement. The survey costs and legal fees, including those paid for the owner of the neighbouring property, are costs for the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement and so are deductible in the income year in which they are incurred. The cost of the irrigation scheme itself is not part of the costs of preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement. The one-off payment to the owner of the neighbouring property for the right to create the easement is not for the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement and therefore is not deductible. 33 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) DEDUCTIBILITY OF SPONSORSHIP EXPENDITURE Introduction This interpretation statement contains guidelines that the Commissioner considers relevant in determining whether sponsorship expenditure is deductible under the general deductibility provisions in section BD 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. This statement replaces the Commissioner’s statement Deducting sponsorship as advertising expenditure, in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 4 (October 1994), pages 1 and 2. All legislative references in this statement are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Summary Sponsorship expenditure will be deductible under limb (b) of section BD 2(1) where a nexus exists between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. •There must be a nexus or necessary relationship between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity. •This requires a determination of the character of the advantage sought by the taxpayer in incurring the expenditure. This is a subjective matter, depending upon the taxpayer’s purpose when incurring the expenditure. The determination of the taxpayer’s purpose or purposes will require an objective analysis of surrounding circumstances, including the effect of the expenditure. •In relation to limb (b)(ii), expenditure will be deductible where it is dictated by the business ends to which it is directed, those ends forming part of or being truly incidental to the business. •Voluntary expenditure is deductible provided it is directed to business or income-earning ends. •In the absence of associated party or avoidance concerns, the quantum of the expenditure is not material to the issue of deductibility. •The fact that a third party may benefit from the expenditure incurred does not preclude that expenditure from being deductible. In order for the nexus test to be satisfied, the taxpayer needs to show that he or she intended that the business would be promoted by incurring the sponsorship expenditure. In this regard, the following objective factors will support a taxpayer’s contention that he or she intended that the business be promoted by the expenditure: •The specific terms of the sponsorship arrangement, eg is there a specific requirement for the recipient to promote the taxpayer’s business? What is the extent and prominence of the business exposure specified in the agreement? •The place of the sponsorship arrangement in a coherent marketing strategy. For example, if a business’s market research has identified that potential customers frequently attend cultural events, then part of its marketing strategy may be to sponsor such events in return for its name and products being promoted during the event. •The relationship between the market or potential market exposure capable of being reached and the taxpayer’s business. For example, market exposure at a tennis tournament is directly related to the business of a sports equipment retailer. •The relationship between the expenditure and the resulting income derived, ie can it be shown that the expenditure resulted in income being derived? For example, the sale of 10 tractors at an agricultural field-day, by a tractor manufacturer sponsoring the event in return for being able to display the tractors, shows a direct relationship between the sponsorship expenditure and the derivation of income. Deductibility of the sponsorship expenditure is subject to section BD 2(2), which prohibits deductions for expenditure of a capital or private or domestic nature. From an analysis of case law pertaining to the capital/revenue distinction the following seven tests are identified: •the need or occasion which calls for the expenditure; •whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature; •whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset; •whether the expenditure creates an advantage which is of an enduring benefit to the business; •whether the expenditure is on the profit-making structure or on the profit-making process; •whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital; •the treatment of the expenditure according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting. The indicia developed by the Courts to distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure are not necessarily all relevant in the context of sponsorship expenditure. Of the various indicia analysed, it would appear that the identifiable asset test is the most important. While the enduring advantage test appears relevant, frequently the nature of the enduring benefit resulting from the sponsorship expenditure will not be such as to warrant a capital classification because the benefit is intrinsically linked to the means of exposure. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 34 An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether the sponsorship expenditure, in whole or part, relates exclusively to things of a private or domestic nature. Where a benefit of a private or domestic nature (eg private enjoyment) accrues to the recipient of sponsorship expenditure, or to any other person, but this benefit is incidental to the payer’s income-earning or business activity, then the deduction is not prohibited. Section EF 1 may apply to limit the deduction in any income year to that portion of the sponsorship expenditure which relates to the current income year. Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the current year deduction is effectively restricted to goods used in that year in deriving gross income. Where the expenditure relates to a payment for services, the current year deduction is effectively restricted to the amount incurred on services performed in that year. Where the expenditure relates to a chose in action, the deduction is deferred for the portion relating to the unexpired part of the period that the chose is enforceable. If sponsorship expenditure is incurred in relation to depreciable property (as defined in section OB 1), a deduction will be allowed for depreciation as determined under section EG 2. The amount of the deduction is dependent upon whether the depreciable property is wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. What is “sponsorship”? For the purposes of this statement it is first necessary to identify what type of expenditure is being considered, ie what type of expenditure constitutes sponsorship expenditure. The term “sponsorship” is used to cover a wide range of situations, with the usage reflecting considerable overlap with the concepts of “advertising”, at one end of a continuum, and “donations” at the other end. At one extreme, the taxpayer’s sole purpose is to “advertise”/promote the business with the amount incurred reflecting market forces and what he or she considers will best achieve the purpose of business promotion. At the other extreme, the taxpayer’s “donation” is for the sole purpose of benefiting the donee and business promotion is not contemplated or is merely incidental to the philanthropic purpose. In between these two extremes, the taxpayer intends to promote his or her business in some manner when incurring the expenditure, but the expenditure made also benefits the recipient (or some other person) in a manner unrelated to the ordinary receipt of income from his or her income-earning activities. This statement does not consider expenditure at the extremes of the continuum, ie expenditure made to commercial advertising media, at one end of the continuum, and charitable donations where business promotion is not a purpose, at the other end of the continuum. Instead, the statement focuses on the deductibility of expenditure in the middle of the continuum (referred to in this statement as “sponsorship expenditure”), ie where the taxpayer making the expenditure intends that his or her business will be promoted in some way, but that the recipient, or some other person, will also be benefited in some manner other than by the receipt of ordinary income from business or income-earning activities. Legislation Whether or not sponsorship expenditure is an allowable deduction is determined under section BD 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 which reads as follows: (1)An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer ... (b) to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii) necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or ... (2)An amount of expenditure or loss is not an allowable deduction of a taxpayer to the extent that it is (a) of a private or domestic nature, or ... (e) of a capital nature, unless allowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined) or E (Timing of Income and Deductions), or ... Section EF 1 concerns accrual expenditure: (1)Where any person has incurred any accrual expenditure– (a) That expenditure is allowed as a deduction when it is incurred in accordance with this Act; and (b) The unexpired portion of that expenditure at the end of an income year shall be included in the gross income of the person for that income year and shall be allowed as a deduction in the following income year. ... 35 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) (5)The amount of the unexpired portion (if any) of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person to be taken into account in any income year shall be– (a) Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in deriving gross income:\] (b) Where the expenditure relates to payment for services, the amount of expenditure incurred on services not performed: (c) Subject to subsection (8), where the expenditure is incurred by way of monetary remuneration for services that have been performed, the amount of the expenditure that has not been paid in the income year or within such further period as is specified in subsection (6): (d) Where the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action, the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. ... (7) In this section– “Goods” means all real or personal property; but does not include choses in action or money: “Services” means anything which is not goods or money or a chose in action. ... General principles The usual approach for determining whether or not expenditure is deductible is first to consider the general deductibility provision in section BD 2(1) ie whether the expenditure was “incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income” (limb (b)(i)) or whether the expenditure was “necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income” (limb (b)(ii)). Having determined that the expenditure meets the criteria in section BD 2(1), it is then necessary to determine whether or not any of the prohibitions in section BD 2(2) apply. For expenditure to be deductible under limb (b) of section BD 2(1), there must be a nexus or necessary relationship between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity (CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 at p 61,240; Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 at p 61,274). This requires a determination of the character of the advantage sought by the taxpayer in incurring the expenditure (Buckley & Young at p 61,274). In this regard, the character of the receipt in the hands of the recipient is not determinative (Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at pp 350-351). In relation to limb (b)(ii) of section BD 2(1), the function of the term “necessarily” was considered by Dixon CJ in FCT v Snowden & Wilson Proprietary Limited (1958) 99 CLR 431 at p 436: The word “necessarily” does, however, seem to me to require consideration. Clearly its operation is to place a qualification upon the degree of connection between the expenditure and the carrying on of the business which might suffice in the absence of such a qualification. In The Commonwealth and The Post- Master General v Progress Advertising Agency Co Pty Ltd Higgins J supplied an interpretation of “necessary” as not meaning essentially necessary but as meaning appropriate, plainly adapted to the needs of a department carrying out an Act. That was in another connection but the phrase was availed of by the Court in \[Ronpibon Tin NL & Tongkah Compound NL v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 47\] as throwing light on the use of the word “necessarily” in s.51 (1). Clearly the expression is used in relation to business. Logical necessity is not a thing to be predicated of business expenditure. What is meant by the qualification is that the expenditure must be dictated by the business ends to which it is directed, those ends forming part of or being truly incidental to the business. \[Emphasis added\] “Necessarily” was also considered in Europa Oil (NZ) Limited v CIR (No 2) (1974) 1 NZTC 61,169 (CA). At p 61,208, Beattie J reiterated that logical necessity was not predicated by business expenditure, ie merely because a business expends money does not mean, of itself, that the expenditure was necessarily incurred. McCarthy P at p 61,196 stated that the determination of whether or not expenditure was necessarily incurred requires “a judgment based on common sense and business realities”, but that the ordinary meaning of “necessarily” connotes that the expenditure will not be the result of an entirely free choice, but will have been dictated by the surrounding circumstances. Richmond J at p 61,205 noted that while the term “necessarily” has a restrictive sense, it also has a sense of entitlement, in that a taxpayer who has had to incur expenditure in the course of business should be able to claim a deduction for it. Support for the view that the term “necessarily” should be read down to mean that expenditure must be directed toward business ends, as opposed to being absolutely essential, can be found in Usher’s Wiltshire Brewery Ltd v Bruce \[1915\] AC 433 at p 449 and British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd v Atherton \[1926\] AC 205 at pp 211-212 which held that voluntary expenditure may be deductible. In the appeal from the Court of Appeal decision in Europa (No 2), reported at Europa Oil (NZ) Limited v CIR (No 2); CIR v Europa Oil (NZ) Limited (No 2) (1976) 2 NZTC 61,066 (PC), the majority of the Privy Council at p 61,071 did not focus specifically on the word “necessarily”, but instead looked at what the taxpayer was legally entitled to as a result of incurring the ex- penditure, ie to use the words in Buckley & Young, it considered the character of the advantage sought by the taxpayer in incurring the expenditure. As the expenditure in that case had resulted entirely in trading stock, it held that the expenditure was deductible. Significantly, at p 61,071, the majority of the Privy Council held that the amount of expenditure is not material, ie deductibility is not dependent upon the amount of expenditure being Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 36 “reasonable”, citing Cecil Bros Ltd v FCT (1964) 111 CLR 430. At p 434, Owen J cited the following statement from Ronpibon Tin NL & Tongkah Compound NL v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 47 at p 60, which statement was approved by the Judicial Committee in both the Europa Oil cases (\[1971\] NZLR 641 at p 649 and (1976) 2 NZTC 61,066 at p 61,071): It is not for the Court or the Commissioner to say how much a taxpayer ought to spend in obtaining his income, but only how much he has spent. Thus, expenditure will be necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, where the expenditure is dictated by the business ends to which it is directed, those ends forming part of or being truly incidental to the business. This requires a determination of the character of the advantage sought by the taxpayer in incurring the expenditure. Voluntary expenditure may be deductible, provided it is directed to business ends. In the absence of associated party or avoidance concerns, the quantum of the expenditure is not material to the issue of whether or not expenditure is deductible. A key factor in determining whether expenditure is deductible under section BD 2(1) is determining the character of the advantage sought. This is a subjective matter, depending upon the taxpayer’s purpose when incurring the expenditure (CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346 at p 6,350). In this regard, there is a distinction between purpose and effect. Thus, for example, the fact that no income is ultimately derived does not necessarily mean that it was not made for the purpose of deriving gross income. Ultimately it will be a question of fact what a taxpayer’s subjective purpose or purposes were in incurring the expenditure. In this regard, a taxpayer’s purpose is to be determined by an objective analysis of surrounding circumstances, including the effect of the expenditure (National Distributors at p 6,351). The phrase “to the extent that” in limb (b) of section BD 2(1) contemplates apportionment (Buckley & Young at p- 61,274), ie where part of the expenditure is incurred for a purpose unrelated to the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity, or when a deduction for part of the expenditure is prohibited, then that part will not be deductible. Nevertheless, the fact that a third party may benefit from the expenditure incurred by the taxpayer does not necessarily preclude that expenditure from being deductible. This was held in Usher’s Wiltshire Brewery Ltd, a case which concerned expenditure voluntarily incurred by a brewery company on licensed premises which it leased to publicans, who were tied to the company in that they were required to sell the company’s beer. Although the lessee was obliged to keep the premises in good repair, the brewery company preferred to undertake the repairs and maintenance itself, being able thereby to ensure that the premises were maintained at a high standard. At issue, among other things, was whether or not expenditure incurred to repair the leased premises was “wholly and exclusively expenditure on repairs of premises occupied for the purpose of \[its brewery\] trade”. The Crown contended that the premises were not occupied by the brewery company, being instead occupied by the lessee, and therefore the repair expenditure incurred by the company did not meet the criterion for deductibility. At p 427, Lord Atkinson held that the expenditure was “wholly and exclusively expenditure on repairs of premises occupied for the purpose of \[the company’s brewery\] trade”, basing his decision on the fact that the licensed premises “were the market place for \[the company’s\] beer and none other”. He stated that the fact that the lessee benefited from the company’s repair expenditure did not preclude the criterion for deductibility being satisfied. In order to reconcile the decisions in Buckley & Young and Usher’s, it is necessary to distinguish between the situation where there are two or more distinct purposes for making the expenditure, not all of which relate to the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity (apportionment will be required here), and the situation where the third party benefit is incidental to the purpose relating to the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity (no apportionment is required here). Having established that the expenditure is deductible under either limb (b)(i) or (b)(ii) of section BD 2(1), it is then necessary to determine whether or not the deduction is prohibited by section BD 2(2). Relevant prohibitions are those relating to expenditure of a private or domestic nature (limb (a)) and expenditure of a capital nature (limb (e)). Prohibition – capital expenditure Concerning the capital prohibition in limb (e) of section BD 2(2), a number of different tests have been formulated by the Courts. The most commonly used test in New Zealand is derived from the Australian decision of Sun Newspapers Limited and Another v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 317 where Dixon J formulated the following indicia: •the character of the advantage sought (for which the lasting qualities may play a part); •the manner in which the advantage is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed (and in this, and under the former head, recurrence may play its part); and •the means adopted to obtain the advantage, eg by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment, or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure further use or enjoyment. The indicia put forward in Sun Newspapers were adopted by the Privy Council in the decision of BP Australia Limited v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 1. The BP Australia formulation was adopted in New Zealand in cases such as CIR v L D Nathan & Co Limited \[1972\] NZLR 209, Buckley & Young, CIR v McKenzies New Zealand (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233, 37 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) Christchurch Press Company Limited v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206, CIR v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001, and Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. In McKenzies, the Court of Appeal extracted five indicia from the Privy Council decision in BP Australia, which were themselves applied in Christchurch Press. Those five indicia are as follows: •a consideration of the need or occasion which calls for the expenditure (recurrence may play a part here); •whether the sums were paid out of fixed or circulating capital; •whether the payments were of a once and for all nature, producing assets or advantages which were of an enduring benefit; •a consideration of ordinary principles of commercial accounting; and •whether the sums were incurred on the structure, within which the profits were to be earned, or whether they were part of the income earning process. The Court of Appeal in L D Nathan at p 214 extracted several indicia from the BP Australia case: •recurrence; •whether the expenditure was from fixed or circulating capital; •whether the expenditure related to the business entity or structure (or profit/yielding subject) or whether it related to the process by which such a structure is operated in order to obtain regular returns; •whether the expenditure was made once and for all, with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the trade; •whether the expenditure was ordinary expenditure in the course of the regular income-earning conduct of the business; and •the nature of the asset obtained or sought in which its enduring character may play a part. The most recent New Zealand Privy Council case in this area, Wattie, adopted the same approach as that described in Hallstroms Proprietary Limited v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634 at p 648. The Privy Council also endorsed the approach taken in BP Australia, Regent Oil, British Insulated and Helsby, and McKenzies. In Poverty Bay Electric Power Board, the Court of Appeal referred to the approach of BP Australia, Hallstroms, and British Insulated and Helsby. The Court of Appeal in Birkdale endorsed the approach of the Privy Council in Wattie and BP Australia. However, these cases have recognised that although past cases can be useful in assisting with the resolution of a new case, there are dangers involved in this approach. For example, North P in the L D Nathan case at p 214 stated that where the distinction between capital and revenue expenditure was not clear-cut, the indicia should be weighed up in the context of the whole set of circumstances. This principle was confirmed by Richardson J at p 5,235 of the McKenzies case, citing BP Australia: In deciding whether expenditure is capital or income the approach generally favoured by the courts in recent years is exemplified in the following observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 244 at pp 264-265: “The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in borderline cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and agree. That answer: ‘depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and a business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process’. per Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 72 CLR 634, 648. As each new case comes to be argued felicitous phrases from earlier judgments are used in argument by one side and the other; but those phrases are not the deciding factor, nor are they of unlimited application. They merely crystallise particular factors which may incline the scale in the particular case after a balance of all the considerations has been taken.” \[Emphasis added\] Similar statements were made by Viscount Radcliffe in Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines Limited \[1964\] 1 All ER 208 at pp 212-213, and by Templeman J in Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Limited \[1977\] 3 All ER 865 at p 869. However, when the latter case was appealed to the House of Lords (reported at Tucker (Inspector of Taxes) v Granada Motorway Services Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER 801), Lord Wilberforce noted at p 804 that sometimes applying analogies is the only available option: There are a number of tests which have been stated in reported cases which it is useful to apply, but we have been warned more than once not to seek automatically to apply to one case words or formulae which have been Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 38 found useful in another (see Comr of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd). Nevertheless reported cases are the best tools that we have, even if they may sometimes be blunt instruments. From the various indicia formulated by the Courts, subject to the warning that the whole set of circumstances must be considered, the following tests or indicia may be identified: •the need or occasion which calls for the expenditure: This test considers what prompted or necessitated the taxpayer to incur the expenditure and whether the surrounding circumstances and ultimate objective of the expenditure support a capital or revenue classification. •whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature: This test, which is closely aligned to the previous one, states that recurrent expenditure is often of a revenue nature and that one-off expenditure is often of a capital nature. This test is not determinative, eg irregular expenditure may be of a revenue nature. To conclude that recurrent expenditure is of a revenue nature, it is necessary to establish that it is an ordinary incident of carrying on a business. •whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset: This test states that expenditure will be of a capital nature if an identifiable capital asset was acquired by the expenditure. •whether the expenditure creates an advantage which is of enduring benefit to the business: This test is similar to the previous one, but instead focuses on whether an enduring advantage was acquired by expending the money. If it was, then the expenditure is likely to be of a capital nature. An enduring benefit can arise from expenditure made to relieve the business of an onerous asset. In this regard, an enduring benefit is to be distinguished from where the expenditure merely relieves the taxpayer from making revenue payments for a period of time. This test is often linked to the test of recurrence, ie expenditure made once-and-for-all with a view to acquiring an advantage of enduring benefit to the business is likely to indicate that the expenditure was of a capital nature. •whether the expenditure is on the profit-making structure or on the profit-making process: This test aims at distinguishing between expenditure which relates to the business’s structure (ie assets which are used in order to carry on the business) and the business’s operation (ie the means by which the assets are organised in order to carry on the business). In this regard, in some businesses the structure may mainly consist of intangible assets, eg goodwill. This test is often linked to the identifiable asset and enduring advantage tests. For example, combining the tests enables to the correct classifications to be made where expenditure is made, as an ordinary incident of the business, to maintain the profit-making structure (likely to be of a revenue nature, despite relating to the profit-making process). •whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital: This test states that expenditure made from fixed capital (ie capital on which a return is sought by the business’s operation) is more likely to be of a capital nature, and expenditure made from circulating capital (ie capital which returns to the business as a result of the business’s operation) is more likely to be of a revenue nature. The test is not now given much weight by the Courts, as it is easy for a business to choose whether to finance an asset, say, from fixed capital or to finance it from circulating capital, irrespective of the nature of the asset financed. •the treatment of the expenditure according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting: How expenditure is classified according to ordinary commercial accounting principles may support the classification made from applying the other indicia. However, this test is not usually determinative, since tax and accounting have different aims and the respective treatments may consequently differ from each other. Many of these indicia overlap and some factors will carry more weight in given circumstances. Therefore, while these indicia are helpful as a starting point, it is nevertheless necessary to make a final judgment of whether the expenditure is of a capital or revenue nature by analysing the facts as a whole, weighing up which factors carry the most weight in the light of these facts. Prohibition – private or domestic expenditure The prohibition of deductions for expenditure of a private or domestic nature (limb (a) of section BD 2(2)) was considered in CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198. This case concerned whether or not contributions to a welfare society, which were required by statute to be made, were deductible (the case related to an income year before deductions were prohibited for expenditure incurred in deriving income from employment). At p 5,207, Richardson J stated: An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit. While ordinarily health care is uniquely personal to the individual concerned and affects his private life as well as his work potential, there may be such emphasis under the employment contract in attaining and maintaining a particular standard of fitness (or even grooming) that expenditure directed to that end cannot fairly be characterised as private or domestic or for that matter as other than work-related. 39 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) That is not this case but it suggests that it is overly simplistic to brand these contributions to this welfare society as inherently of a private rather than an employment character. On the contrary, in the very unusual circumstances of this case I have come to the conclusion, not without hesitation, that the required nexus exists between the expenditure in question and the gaining of the employment income. That expenditure is imposed on the employee by Statute. It reflects a recognition by the employer and the unions endorsed by the Legislature that the availability of the benefits afforded by membership of the welfare society has a perceived if not readily quantifiable impact on the work performance of the employees concerned. It is more than a prerequisite to the earning of income. It is directed to the income earning process itself. Clearly all those immediately concerned in the employment relationship have bona fide regarded that expenditure as work-related being directed to preserving and enhancing the employee’s performance of his duties and in the end I have concluded that we would not be justified in taking a different view. \[Emphasis added\] In coming to this conclusion of the application of the law to the particular facts in question, Richardson J held that expenses properly characterised as consumption (eg food, clothing and shelter) are not incidental and relevant to the derivation of income merely because they are required in order for a person to be able to earn income. In several Taxation Review Authority cases (Case E87 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,455; Case F30 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,704; Case F159 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,358), whether or not expenditure was of a private or domestic nature was determined by ascertaining whether anybody received a benefit of a private or domestic nature. However, by solely focusing on the recipient of the benefit resulting from the expenditure, it would prohibit a deduction for wages paid, for example, where the recipient of the wages used the money received to purchase food and accommodation. It is not considered, therefore, that this is the correct approach. Rather, as Richardson J did in Haenga, it is necessary to determine whether the expenditure, in whole or part, related exclusively to things of a private or domestic nature. Where a benefit of a private or domestic nature accrues to the recipient, but this benefit is incidental to the income-earning or business activity of the payer, then it follows from the approach in Usher’s – where expenditure was held to be deductible because the third-party benefit was incidental – that the deduction is not prohibited. In summary, then, an outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit. Where a benefit of a private or domestic nature accrues to the recipient, but this benefit is incidental to the income-earning or business activity of the payer, then the deduction is not prohibited. Where the private or domestic benefit accrues from a purpose of the taxpayer distinct from the business promotion purpose, then apportionment will be necessary. Apportionment By virtue of the definition of “sponsorship” used in this statement (ie benefits contemplated to the taxpayer and to some other party), and because of the inclusion of the phrase “to the extent that” in sections BD 2(1) and BD 2(2), the issue of apportionment must be considered. Apportionment will be required where the expenditure may partly be on revenue account and partly on capital account. Apportionment will also be required where a sponsorship agreement is entered into to achieve more than one end (eg income-earning and private)—whether or not the dual purposes are evident on the face of the relevant documentation. It will also be required where part of the sponsorship expenditure is not deductible at all eg preliminary expenditure incurred before the business began (Calkin v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,781 at p 61,786). Merely because it may be difficult under a sponsorship arrangement to determine what part of the expenditure relates to business promotion, or which part is prohibited by virtue of section BD 2(2), this does not preclude the need for apportionment where, in fact, more than one purpose was envisaged by incurring the expenditure (Buckley & Young at p 61,274). Accrual expenditure Even if a deduction is allowed for expenditure under limb (b) of section BD 2(1), and is not prohibited under section BD 2(2), it needs to be considered whether the expenditure is accrual expenditure such that section EF 1 applies to limit the deduction in any income year. Section EF 1(1) states that “accrual expenditure” is deductible when incurred, but (subject to section EF 1(3)) any “unexpired portion” of it at the end of the income year is included in the taxpayer’s gross income for the year but is allowed as a deduction in the following income year. The term “accrual expenditure” is defined in section OB 1 to mean any expenditure deductible under the Act (with certain exceptions specified in the definition in section OB 1). The “unexpired portion” of an amount of accrual expenditure is defined in section EF 1(5) which reads as follows: The amount of the unexpired portion (if any) of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person to be taken into account in any income year shall be– (a)Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in deriving gross income: (b)Where the expenditure relates to payment for services, the amount of expenditure incurred on services not performed: (c)Subject to subsection (8), where the expenditure is incurred by way of monetary remuneration for services that have been performed, the amount of the expenditure that has not been paid in the income year or within such further period as is specified in subsection (6): Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 40 (d)Where the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action, the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. Essentially, the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure is that portion of the expenditure which relates to future income years. Depreciation If a deduction is prohibited because of the capital prohibition in section BD 2(2), a deduction for depreciation may be allowed under subpart EG. Broadly, for a deduction to be allowed for depreciation the taxpayer must own the “depreciable property” (section EG 1(1)), which is defined in section OB 1 to mean: ... any property of \[the\] taxpayer which might be reasonably expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use ... in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Where there is depreciable property, the amount of the deduction allowed for depreciation is determined under section EG 2 and is dependent upon whether the depreciable property is wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Application to Sponsorship Expenditure Having considered the general principles relating to sections BD 2(1) and BD 2(2), it is necessary to apply these principles in the context of sponsorship expenditure. This will be approached as follows: •is the sponsorship expenditure deductible pursuant to section BD 2(1); •do any of the prohibitions in section BD 2(2) apply (the need for apportionment will considered under this head); •if a deduction is prohibited because of the capital prohibition in section BD 2(2), is a deduction for depreciation allowed; •does section EF 1 apply to limit the deduction in any given income year. Deductibility under section BD 2(1) Concerning the general deductibility provision in section BD 2(1), the following principles were identified: •There must be a nexus or necessary relationship between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity. •This requires a determination of the character of the advantage sought by the taxpayer in incurring the expenditure. This is a subjective matter, depending upon the taxpayer’s purpose when incurring the expenditure. The determination of the taxpayer’s purpose or purposes will require an objective analysis of surrounding circumstances, including the effect of the expenditure. •In relation to limb (b)(ii), expenditure will be deductible where it is dictated by the business ends to which it is directed, those ends forming part of or being truly incidental to the business. •Voluntary expenditure is deductible provided it is directed to business or income-earning ends. •In the absence of associated party or avoidance concerns, the quantum of the expenditure is not material. •The fact that a third party may benefit from the expenditure incurred does not preclude that expenditure from being deductible. For the purposes of this statement, sponsorship expenditure has been defined to mean expenditure where the payer intends that his or her business will thereby be promoted in some way, but that the recipient, or some other person, will also be benefited in some manner other than by the receipt of ordinary income from business or income-earning activities. Expenditure of the type which meets this definition was held to have been incurred in deriving income in the Australian case, Cliffs International, Inc v FCT 85 ATC 4374. In this case, the taxpayer contributed to the annual running of a golf tournament in which the taxpayer’s joint venture partners and key Japanese customers participated. Another case where sponsorship expenditure, as so defined, was held to be incurred in deriving income is the South African case, Income Tax Case No. 696 17 SATC 86. This case concerned a company which dealt in agricultural equipment. It purchased some footballs which it endorsed with words associated with the equipment in which it traded, and then gave them to various school football clubs. It also acquired two silver trophies which it donated to agricultural societies, having engraved them with the company’s name and the names of various pieces of equipment in which it traded. All three members of the Cape Income Tax Special Court held that the expenditure incurred on the footballs was deductible (one member held that the expenditure on the cups was capital in nature). In relation to the expenditure on the footballs, Newton Thompson J put it this way at p 87: I am satisfied that this expenditure is for advertisement purposes, that it has that effect; that it assists in selling articles in which the appellant deals; that it is incurred in the production of income... Two issues immediately arise from the definition of sponsorship adopted in this statement. Firstly, what evidence supports a taxpayer’s contention that particular expenditure meets this definition? Secondly, what effect does the third-party benefit have upon deductibility? 41 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) In relation to the first issue, in order for the nexus test to be satisfied, the taxpayer needs to show that he or she intended that the business would be promoted by incurring the sponsorship expenditure. In this regard, the following objective factors will support a taxpayer’s contention that he or she intended that the business be promoted by the expenditure: •The specific terms of the sponsorship arrangement, eg is there a specific requirement for the recipient to promote the taxpayer’s business? What is the extent and prominence of the business exposure specified in the agreement? •The place of the sponsorship arrangement in a coherent marketing strategy. For example, if a business’s market research has identified that potential customers frequently attend cultural events, then part of its marketing strategy may be to sponsor such events in return for its name and products being promoted during the event. •The relationship between the market or potential market exposure capable of being reached and the taxpayer’s business. For example, market exposure at a tennis tournament is directly related to the business of a sports equipment retailer. •The relationship between the expenditure and the resulting income derived, ie can it be shown that the expenditure resulted in income being derived? For example, the sale of 10 tractors at an agricultural field-day, by a tractor manufacturer sponsoring the event in return for being able to display the tractors, shows a direct relationship between the sponsorship expenditure and the derivation of income. In Case 696 (SA), the evidentiary support for the expenditure on the cups being deductible was described like this (Mr Galbraith at p 91): ... the company annually incurs expenditure on advertising the agricultural implements in which it deals. This advertising takes various forms, such as circulating pamphlets, distributing calendars, pocket-books, copper ash-trays, etc. It never takes the form of press advertising because the potential and actual customers of the company are too few to warrant advertising in newspapers. This description illustrates the company’s marketing strategy and the cups and footballs donated fitted within this strategy, being articles on which the names of pieces of equipment were endorsed. Case P16 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,107 illustrates that evidence of a relationship between the potential market exposure capable of being reached and the taxpayer’s business is support for the expenditure being deductible, and that the amount of expenditure was not relevant to the determination of whether or not the expenditure was deductible. In response to the company’s contention that the racing promotion was intended to associate the company with speed and efficiency, Keane J stated at p 4,114: ... the company’s decision was inherently logical from a business perspective, and the related steps taken wholly explicable from that perspective even if the level of expenditure ultimately incurred was greater than was first anticipated. Similarly, in the Australian Board of Review case, Case F67 74 ATC 397, evidence of a relationship between the potential market exposure capable of being reached and the taxpayer’s business was support for the expenditure being held to be deductible. That case concerned a consulting engineer who also derived commission income as the sole representative of several foreign boat designers in Australia. In order to promote commission sales, the taxpayer had a power boat built to one of the designs for which he was the Australian representative. He had the names of his business and the designer painted on the hull, along with his address and contact telephone number. The boat was then raced. Despite incurring the sponsorship expenditure, no commission sales were made in the income year in question, but this did not preclude deductibility of the revenue expenditure. Nor did the relatively high cost involved stop the Board of Review from finding that the revenue expenditure was deductible. In Cliffs International, sponsorship expenditure was held to be deductible on the basis of evidence showing the place of the sponsorship arrangement in a coherent marketing strategy, and the relationship between the market exposure capable of being reached and the taxpayer’s business. As noted earlier, in this case the taxpayer contributed to the annual running of a golf tournament in which the taxpayer’s joint venture partners and key Japanese customers participated. In finding that the sponsorship expenditure was deductible, Kennedy J stated at p 4,392: This event was a carefully planned annual function, which was specifically directed to enhancing the relationship between the Robe River joint venture and its customers in Japan, being six of the major steel mills. It was the only formal social function held each year and was carefully adapted to the nature of the Japanese business. It was attended by senior executives from Cliffs, whilst Mitsui & Co. was represented by the highest ranking personnel within its iron ore department, together with one of its corporate executive vice presidents. Each of the mills was represented by its highest ranking purchasing officer and two or three of his subordinates. The day was meticulously planned, so that those whom it was desired to bring together for business reasons were brought together. The day concluded with formal speeches of goodwill and presentations. The issue of the relationship between the expenditure and the resulting income was referred to in Case 696 at p 92, but in that case the absence of any supporting evidence was given little weight by the majority of the Court: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 42 With regard to this expenditure being too remote from the income to be an allowable deduction, I consider that it can fairly be stated that it is normally impossible to connect any particular sales with any particular advertising, though many companies go to considerable lengths in an endeavour to ascertain which media of advertisements produce the best results. The issue of the remoteness of sponsorship expenditure from income derived was also referred to in the Canadian case No 511 v MNR 19 Tax ABC 248, a case concerning a taxpayer in the lumber business which sponsored a local baseball team with the intention of building up its declining sales through promoting its name and products. In that case, as with Case 696, the fact that sponsorship was not direct advertising was not sufficient to preclude deductibility provided there was evidence that the company intended to advertise itself by sponsoring the baseball team. A New Zealand case where there was evidence of a direct relationship between the sponsorship expenditure and the taxpayer’s income was Case P16. The taxpayer in this case was a national courier which had acquired and raced a Jaguar motor car, having marked it with the company’s logo. Evidence that showed that there was a marked increase in turnover as a result of the racing promotion supported the conclusion drawn by Keane J that the related revenue expenditure was deductible. Example 1 Andrew is a sole trader who operates a motor mechanic business. He sponsors the local rugby league team. Under the terms of sponsorship agreement, which covers the year to 31 March, Andrew agrees to pay up-front a sum of $3,000 towards the team’s running costs. In return, the team agrees to display Andrew’s business logo on all rugby uniforms, bags and vehicles used by the team during the year. Is the expenditure incurred by Andrew under the sponsorship agreement deductible? The expenditure incurred by Andrew will be fully deductible. The requirement that the team display his business logo and name on the uniforms etc indicates that the expenditure was incurred to promote his business and is therefore deductible. Example 2 Elizabeth operates a business in Wellington as a sole-trader. She gives $500 to the boarding school which her son attends in Auckland in the name of her business. She makes no stipulations about how the school is to use the money or that her business is to be promoted in return for the payment. Nevertheless, her business’s name subsequently appears in a list of donors on the back page of the school’s annual magazine. In all, there were 20 donors and Elizabeth’s business name is not distinguished in any way from the other 19 donors. It is considered that no deduction under section BD 2 is allowed for the $500 expenditure (although a rebate may be available under section KC 5). There was no stipulation that Elizabeth’s business be promoted. The fact that there was some business promotion in the form of her business’s name appearing in the magazine is not determinative unless Elizabeth can show that such promotion was a purpose of the expenditure. While every case must be considered on its particular facts, it is considered that any marketing exposure resulting from the business name appearing on the back page of an annual school magazine is most likely to be minimal since it one of 20 donors with no prominence given it compared to the names of the other donors. This supports the view that it is incidental to other purposes (eg private) of making the payment. As well, the fact that her son’s school is in Auckland is likely to mean that little, if any, increase in revenue would be expected to result to her business since it operates in Wellington. Therefore, based on an objective analysis of the surrounding circumstances, it is considered that the expenditure does not have the requisite nexus with the earning of her business’s income. The second issue which arises from the definition of sponsorship expenditure is the effect on deductibility, if any, of a third-party benefiting from the expenditure. In this regard, as noted earlier in this statement, this fact does not of itself preclude deductibility (Usher’s Wiltshire Brewery Ltd at p 427). Rather, in order to determine whether apportionment is needed, it is necessary to determine whether the third-party benefit resulted from a purpose distinct from the business promotion purpose (apportionment will be required here), or whether the third-party benefit was only incidental to the purpose relating to the taxpayer’s business (no apportionment required). This will be a question of fact. The distinction between incidental purposes and separate purposes will be illustrated by examples following the application of the law relating to the private or domestic expenditure prohibition. Other issues, which may appear relevant to whether or not sponsorship expenditure is deductible, arise where the expenditure is voluntary or where the amount expended is higher than seems reasonable. However, as noted earlier in this statement, the fact that the taxpayer may have voluntarily entered into an agreement whereby someone else is benefited by the expenditure will not, of itself, preclude deductibility since voluntary expenditure is deductible provided it is directed to business or income-earning ends. Nor, of itself, will deductibility be precluded by the fact that the taxpayer expended more than they would have done if the third party benefit were not contemplated. This is because the quantum of the expenditure is not material (Ronpibon Tin at p 60; Cecil Bros at p 434; Europa Oil \[1971\] NZLR 641 at p 649; Europa Oil (1976) 2 NZTC 61,066 at p 61,071). 43 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) Case F67, considered earlier in this statement, was a case where relatively high expenditure did not preclude deductibility. If it has been determined that the sponsorship expenditure is prima facie deductible under section BD 2(1), it is then necessary to ascertain whether or not any of the prohibitions in section BD 2(2) apply. The two prohibitions potentially relevant to sponsorship expenditure are the capital prohibition in limb (e) and the prohibition of expenditure of a private or domestic nature in limb (a). Prohibition – capital expenditure From an analysis of case law pertaining to the capital/ revenue distinction the following seven tests were identified: •the need or occasion which calls for the expenditure; •whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature; •whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset; •whether the expenditure creates an advantage which is of an enduring benefit to the business; •whether the expenditure is on the profit-making structure or on the profit-making process; •whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital; •the treatment of the expenditure according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting. In the context of sponsorship expenditure, some of the indicia will be more relevant than others. In relation to a given set of facts, it will be necessary to weigh up the factors in order to determine whether all or part of the sponsorship expenditure is of a capital nature. These factors will now be considered in turn. The need or occasion which calls for the expenditure This test considers the need or occasion calling for the expenditure and whether the surrounding circumstances and ultimate objective of the expenditure support a capital or revenue classification. When considering the general deductibility provision in section BD 2(1), the taxpayer’s purpose in incurring the expenditure needed to be ascertained. However, in determining whether or not the capital prohibition applies, it is necessary to consider what prompted or necessitated the taxpayer to incur the expenditure in the first place. In this regard, all the cases analysed when considering the general deductibility provision in section BD 2(1) illustrated that business promotion was the purpose of incurring the sponsorship expenditure. In none of the cases was it held that the underlying reason which prompted or necessitated the expenditure indicated that the expenditure was of a capital nature. It would appear, then, that this test will be of limited use in the context of sponsorship expenditure, although arguably it would be relevant where the facts point to the business promotion being related to establishing a market for a new business. However, in such a case as this, the expenditure is likely to have not even been deductible under section BD 2(1), it being preliminary expenditure which would not have been incurred in the course of carrying on that business (Calkin at p 61,786). Recurrence As noted earlier in this statement, this test is not determinative as irregular expenditure may be of a revenue nature. To conclude that recurrent expenditure is of a revenue nature, it is necessary to establish that it is an ordinary incident of carrying on the business. In the context of sponsorship expenditure, it is possible for some types of sponsorship expenditure to be once and for all (eg a once-only sponsorship of a sports event), and for other types to be recurrent (eg regularly sponsoring the sports event). Thus, recurrence, of itself, would not be determinative of the expenditure being of a revenue nature. An example of where recurrence would have supported a finding of sponsorship expenditure being of a revenue nature, had it been at issue, is Cliffs International. Here the golf tournament was held annually. An example of once-only sponsorship expenditure being of a revenue nature is Case 696 (SA) considered earlier in this statement. In that case, the two silver cups constituted a one-off payment. Nevertheless, the majority judgment was that the expenditure incurred on these cups was of a revenue nature. While this finding was princi- pally based on the fact that no enduring asset was acquired by the company, since it divested itself of the ownership of the cups, it nevertheless indicates that recurrence is not determinative. However, while recurrence of itself is not determinative, as noted above, it is also necessary to establishing that expenditure is an ordinary incident of carrying on a business for that expenditure to be of a revenue nature. In the context of sponsorship expenditure, as it is defined in this statement, it is not considered that much weight should be placed on this test. This is because a taxpayer’s business promotion purpose, necessary to establish that the expenditure is deductible under section BD 2(1), would appear to be sufficient to show that the expenditure was an ordinary incident of business. That is, whatever third-party benefit may arise from sponsorship expenditure, it would appear that the business promotion purpose is sufficient evidence of the expenditure being an ordinary incident of business. In the Canadian case, No. 608 v MNR 21 Tax ABC 396, at p 400, Mr Boisvert put it this way: Nowadays business advertising takes on a wide variety of forms and, as long as it can be linked with a business, whether the latter profits from it or not, it is a deductible expense ... Advertising has become a necessity in the business world. \[Emphasis added\] Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 44 Identifiable asset Where the expenditure results in an identifiable asset owned by the taxpayer, the capital prohibition is likely to apply. The majority decision in Case 696 (SA) is an example of where no identifiable asset being retained by the taxpayer was the basis for finding that the capital prohibition did not apply. Distinguishing cases where an identifiable asset was retained by the taxpayer, and the expenditure incurred to acquire it was held to be of a capital nature (Income Tax Case No. 217 4 SATC 137; Income Tax Case No. 469 11 SATC 261), the majority stated at p 93: In my opinion this case is clearly distinguishable. Appellant company purchased cups and immediately presented them to agricultural societies, thereby divesting itself of ownership It had no asset as a result of this advertising expenditure ... \[Emphasis added\] Thus, if the sponsorship expenditure results in an identifiable asset, and the taxpayer does not divest itself of the ownership of the asset, then the capital prohibition will apply. Example 3 Consider the facts in example 1, above. Suppose Andrew also agreed to reimburse the team for the purchase of their van (ie the team owns the van) provided his business logo is prominently displayed on the van. Would this expenditure be deductible? Alternatively, what if he instead purchased the van himself, retaining ownership of it, but allowed the team to have full use of it provided his business logo is prominently displayed on it—would the expenditure be deductible? Where Andrew reimburses the team for the purchase of their van, although the van is a capital item it is not considered that the capital prohibition applies since the van is not owned by Andrew, nor was it acquired by him. Therefore, no enduring asset results to Andrew from this expenditure. However, if Andrew purchased the van himself and retained ownership of it, the capital prohibition would apply as the expenditure results in an enduring asset (ie the van) owned by him (although a deduction for depreciation may be allowed under section EG 2). Example 4 John Jones runs a sports goods store called Jones’s Sports. Being particularly interested in soccer, John sponsors an annual soccer competition for the three local primary schools, to be named the Jones Competition. He considers that the sponsorship arrangement will result in increased sales. He supplies the necessary sporting equipment to each school (all of which is clearly labelled with his business’s name) as well as a trophy to be presented to the winner of the competition. The trophy is labelled the Jones Competition sponsored by Jones’s Sports, and each year the trophy is engraved with the winner’s name. He incurs a total of $5,000 in the first year of this arrangement. Here there is a relationship between John’s business and the sponsorship, both being related to sport. Therefore, even though it may be impossible to identify what sales, if any, resulted from the sponsorship arrangement, John’s contention that the expenditure was incurred in order to increase sales is reasonable. Therefore, it is considered that the expenditure is deductible under limb (b)(i) of section BD 2(1). As well, the fact that the business name appears on the sporting equipment donated, as well as on the trophy, supports the conclusion that the expenditure would be deductible under limb (b)(ii) of section BD 2(1) being necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on his business. In this light, it is considered that John’s private enjoyment of soccer is incidental and therefore a deduction for the expenditure will not be prohibited by limb (a) of section BD 2(2). Further, although the cup is an enduring asset, it is not owned by John and so the capital prohibition in limb (e) of section BD 2(2) will not apply. This conclusion is consistent with the finding in Income Tax Case 696 17 SATC 86 (South Africa). Enduring advantage This test focuses on whether an enduring advantage of benefit to the business is acquired by expending the money. If it is, then the expenditure is likely to be of a capital nature. Other than cases where an identifiable asset is acquired by expending the money, this test would appear to be the most relevant in the context of sponsorship expenditure. This test is often linked to the test of recurrence, ie expenditure made once and for all with a view to acquiring an advantage of enduring benefit to the business is likely to indicate that the expenditure was of a capital nature. However, in order to determine whether or not an enduring advantage arises such that the capital prohibition would apply, it is first necessary to distinguish between long-term advertising and goodwill/ branding that may arise from such advertising. In the case of the former, any expenditure to obtain the long-term advertising merely relieves the taxpayer from making revenue payments for a period of time. It is not considered that this type of “enduring advantage” is of a capital nature (Anglo-Persian at p 262). However, section EF 1 may apply to limit the deduction in any income year because part of the expenditure relates to future income years (section EF 1 is considered more fully later in this statement). 45 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) As to whether the capital prohibition would apply because the expenditure resulted in an enduring advantage of branding or goodwill, it is considered that any “branding/goodwill” advantage gained is intrinsically linked to the business exposure itself. The advantage is not one that results from the business’s prior operation (in contrast to goodwill acquired when the business is purchased, which would be a capital asset). Although the advantage may endure beyond the end of the sponsorship agreement, this is no different from ordinary advertising. In both cases, any “branding” gained will usually dissipate rapidly unless the exposure or advertising is repeated in order to maintain it. For this reason, it is considered that any incremental contribution to long-term goodwill or brand value is properly to be regarded as incidental, as similar increments can be achieved by ordinary advertising, good customer service, product quality, etc. Therefore, it is considered that the expenditure on it is of a revenue nature and the capital prohibition does not apply. This conclusion is in line with the majority judgment in Case 696 (SA): There is little doubt that the benefit of this advertising was not confined to the year of assessment, but the same can probably be said about most advertising except in connection with special “bargain sales”. With regular advertising in various forms it is normally impossible to state when and for how long any benefit may be received and if, to be allowable as a deduction, its effect must be confined to the year of assessment, it appears to me that very little advertising expenditure could be allowed as a deduction. I am of the opinion that all successful advertising must inevitably tend to increase the goodwill of the advertiser or of the merchandise advertised, but I am unable to agree that, therefore, such advertising becomes expenditure of a capital nature. \[Emphasis added\] Profit-making structure or profit-making process This test aims at distinguishing between expenditure which relates to the business’s structure (ie assets which are used in order to carry on the business) and the business’s operation (ie the means by which the assets are organised in order to carry on the business). As noted earlier in this statement, this test is often linked to the identifiable asset and enduring advantage tests. As such, in the context of sponsorship expenditure, this test would not appear to add anything to the analyses under these heads. In particular, however, it is noted that the business promotion aspect of sponsorship expenditure, as it is defined in this statement, would appear ordinarily to be related to the profit-making process rather than to the profit-making structure. The principal exception would be where an identifiable asset is acquired as a result of expending the money in which case, as noted earlier in this statement when considering the identifiable asset test, the profit-making structure is enhanced by the sponsorship expenditure, and the capital prohibition would apply. The source of the payment This test states that expenditure made from fixed capital (ie capital on which a return is sought by the business’s operation) is more likely to be of a capital nature, and expenditure made from circulating capital (ie capital which returns to the business as a result of the business’s operation) is more likely to be of a revenue nature. As noted earlier in this statement, the test is not now given much weight by the Courts, as it is easy for a business to choose whether to finance an asset, say, from fixed capital or to finance it from circulating capital, irrespective of the nature of the asset financed. In the context of sponsorship expenditure, also, a business may finance it from either fixed or circulating capital, without thereby changing its inherent nature. Therefore, it is considered that this test is unhelpful. The treatment of the expenditure according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting How expenditure is classified according to ordinary commercial accounting principles may support the classification made from applying the other indicia. In this regard, sponsorship and promotional expenditure would ordinarily be classified as being of a revenue nature according to generally accepted accounting practice. This supports treating sponsorship expenditure as deductible. However, this test is not usually determinative since tax and accounting have different aims and the respective treatments may consequently differ from each other. Nevertheless, in the context of sponsorship expenditure, if for some reason a taxpayer treated such expenditure as being of a capital nature for accounting purposes, there may be some grounds for analysing whether or not this accounting classification should be followed for tax purposes. Conclusion–capital prohibition The indicia developed by the Courts to distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure are not necessarily all relevant in the context of sponsorship expenditure. Of the various indicia analysed, it would appear that the identifiable asset test is the most important. While the enduring advantage test appears relevant, frequently the nature of the enduring benefit resulting from the sponsorship expenditure will not be such as to warrant a capital classification because the benefit is intrinsically linked to the means of exposure. Prohibition–private or dometic expenditure An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit (Haenga at p 5,207). In particular, expenses properly characterised as consumption (eg food, clothing and shelter) are not incidental and relevant to the deriva- tion of income merely because they are required in order for a person to be able to earn income. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 46 In this regard, it is necessary to determine whether the expenditure, in whole or part, relates exclusively to things of a private or domestic nature. Where a benefit of a private or domestic nature accrues to the recipient, but this benefit is incidental to the income-earning or business activity, then the deduction is not prohibited. In the context of sponsorship expenditure, the key will be to determine whether or not any private or domestic benefit accruing as a result of the sponsorship expenditure is incidental to the business promotion purpose. Where a separate private or domestic purpose is identifiable, then apportionment will be necessary. A number of Taxation Review Authority cases have involved situations where someone (usually an employee of the taxpayer) gained private enjoyment from the sponsorship expenditure. In Case L7, the taxpayer was a radiator manufacture and repair company whose principal was interested in go-kart racing. The company decided to become involved in go-kart racing as a means of promoting the business. The go-kart bore the name of the company, the principal drove the go-kart, the pit crew (company employees) wore company colours, and the company was promoted on a billboard at the racetrack and in the racing program. The issue before the Taxation Review Authority was whether the associated expenditure should be apportioned between business promotion (deductible) and private enjoyment (no deduction allowed). At p 1,055, Barber DJ concluded that the expenditure was fully deductible, with the private enjoyment being purely incidental: I agree with the submission of Mr Nation, that the fact that Mr S obtained substantial enjoyment from the kart racing is not a significant factor in deciding whether or not the expenses incurred in that activity should be tax deductible. In my view, the issue is whether the expenditure is bona fide advertising expenditure in character, or is wholly or partly expenditure in the pursuance of go kart racing as a sport or recreational pastime. That factual issue pivots on the credibility of the evidence. I accept Mr S as an honest witness. I find that although he enjoyed his involvement in kart racing and had previously been quite strongly interested in racing in general, he made a calculated decision to boost his business enterprise by participating in kart racing with a high business profile. He sought business contacts in the motor trade and work from those contacts and from the general public. I am satisfied that these aims were achieved, and continue to be retained, in a substantial manner. I do not suggest that advertising must have good results to be deductible. I appreciate that, after much consideration, the respondent took the view that there were two equal factors in relation to the advertising expenditure, namely, the obtaining of personal pleasure in go kart racing and the attracting of business from that activity. On the evidence which I have heard, I find on the balance of probability that the business expended money on go-kart racing predominantly to advertise the business and that any private intentions or purposes of Mr S were quite incidental to the predominant objective of business expansion. In other words, I am satisfied that there was a sufficient link between the expenditure and the income earning process of the radiator manufacturing and repair business, with regard to the entire expenditure and not merely to 50% of it. \[Emphasis added\] The same approach was taken in Case P16, where the company’s principal was interested in car racing. In that case, at p 4,114, Keane J held that he saw no reason to elevate the principal’s private enjoyment of racing the car to the status of a competing purpose. In Case M131 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,850, Bathgate DJ approved of the approach in Case L7. The taxpayer in this case owned a building business that had a substantial connection, both business and private, with the racing industry. To maintain and extend the business relationship, the taxpayer purchased and raced a horse and sponsored several races in return for the business name appearing on the race books of the races sponsored. While the horse was raced under the names of the individual owners, it was soon identified with the company. The percentage of income derived from the racing industry increased following the increased promotional activity. While the deductibility of the sponsorship expenditure was not at issue in this case, in relation to remaining revenue expenditure, Bathgate DJ held that the statutory nexus was satisfied and that the element of private enjoyment was incidental to the main purpose of business promotion. Example 6 Bruce is in business as a sole-trader builder, trading as Bruce Builders. He agrees to build the gymnasium at his daughter’s school in return for an annual 50% discount on his daughter’s school fees for the time she attends the school. The school will provide the materials, but Bruce will supply the labour (himself and three of his employees). While the gymnasium is being built, the school agrees for Bruce to erect signage on the construction site stating that the gymnasium is being built by Bruce Builders. After it is completed, a prominent plaque will be displayed on the front of the gymnasium stating that it was constructed by Bruce Builders. Does the prohibition for expenditure of a private or domestic nature apply to the expenditure Bruce incurs on staff wages in relation to the construction? The expenditure on the wages was not incurred by Bruce in deriving gross income since he derives no income from building the gymnasium (limb (a) of section BD 2(1)). It is arguable, too, that they were not necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on Bruce’s business for the purpose of deriving his gross income since, arguably, he did not need to construct the gymnasium (limb (b) of section BD 2(1)). Even if it were considered that limb (b) of section BD 2(1) applied (because his business was promoted during the construction and after the construction was completed), one purpose of incurring the expenditure was to gain the 50% discount on his daughter’s school fees, ie the advantage sought was of a private nature. 47 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) On the facts presented, it is not considered that this private advantage was just incidental to any business promotion contemplated by Bruce in entering into the arrangement with the school. Therefore, as a minimum, it would be necessary to apportion the expenditure between that which was of a private nature (not deductible), and that which was deductible (if any). In this regard, the burden of proof is on Bruce to show what part of the expenditure was deductible. Example 7 Jenny is in business as a scuba-diving instructor. She enjoys horse riding and watching horse riding competitions. She decides to organise a gymkhana with prizes being given for the winning rider. She arranges for a billboard to be erected at the site of the competition with her business name etc on it. She expends a total of $2,000 in arranging the competition. Is her expenditure deductible? In this case, Jenny’s scuba-diving instructing business bears no relationship to horse riding. The attendees are not a natural audience for the scuba-diving promotion so as to reasonably form a potential market. This, considered with the fact of Jenny’s private enjoyment of horse riding, strengthens the conclusion that there is no identifiable nexus between the expenditure and her business. While there is some business exposure in the form of a billboard, it is considered that the expenditure on the competition was likely to have been incurred for private enjoyment with any business promotion being incidental to that private enjoyment purpose. On this basis, and in the absence of further evidence as to Jenny’s purpose in incurring the expenditure, it is considered that no deduction would be allowed for expenditure on the competition. Example 8 A firm, AAA Accounting, has entered into an agreement with the national opera company whereby the firm will cover the cost to the opera company of financing the orchestra that accompanies the operas. In return, the opera company will prominently display the words “proudly sponsored by AAA Accounting” on the buildings where the operas are performed and on all programs sold, as well as in all advertisements for the operas. AAA Accounting’s purpose in entering into the agreement was to provide exposure to influential members of the audience, as confirmed in its marketing plan. A survey, which it had commissioned, showed that a significant proportion of opera attendees were individuals from whom the firm sought business, being people who were of high net worth or who were influential in the corporate and government sectors. On the basis of the survey, it considered that the exposure obtained from sponsoring the opera company would attract these people as clients. In the opera company’s annual report, the managing director referred to the agreement with AAA Accounting and noted that two of the three partners in the firm had personally had a long association with opera in the past, being “opera lovers” themselves. Is the expenditure under the agreement deductible to AAA Accounting? In this case, although AAA Accounting is not in a business related to opera, it does obtain business exposure through the agreement. As well, the agreement is part of the firm’s marketing strategy as indicated in the firm’s marketing plan. While the private enjoyment of opera by two of the three partners in the firm may indicate that the expenditure was incurred for private purposes, it is considered that the reasoning given in the marketing plan shows that the expenditure was incurred for business purposes and any private enjoyment will be incidental to the business purpose of incurring the expenditure. Accrual expenditure As noted earlier, section EF 1 may apply to limit the deduction in any income year to that portion of the expenditure which relates to the current income year. Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the current year deduction is effectively restricted to goods used in that year in deriving gross income. Where the expenditure relates to a payment for services, the current year deduction is effectively restricted to the amount incurred on services performed in that year. Where the expenditure relates to a chose in action, the deduction is deferred for the portion relating to the unexpired part of the period that the chose is enforceable. Example 9 John owns and operates a restaurant. He enters into a sponsorship agreement with the local brass band whereby he agrees to pay $9,000 up-front towards the band’s running costs for the next three years in return for the name of his restaurant to be displayed prominently on the drums. What effect, if any, does section EF 1 have on the deductibility of the $9,000? In order to determine whether or not section EF 1 applies, it is necessary to determine if there is any “unexpired portion” at the end of the income year. In this regard, limb (d) of section EF 1(5) applies. This is because the expenditure results in John acquiring the chose in action consisting of the right to have his name displayed on the drums. Therefore, the unexpired portion of the expenditure at the end of the income year will be the portion of the $9,000 that relates to the unexpired part of the three-year period in relation to which the choses are enforceable. If a full 12 months under the agreement falls within the first income year, the unexpired portion will be $6,000 relating to the two years remaining under the agreement. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 48 Example 10 PQR Ltd pays a local trust $3 million toward the cost of construction of a swimming complex in return for naming rights for a 10-year period. PQR pays the $3 million in one lump sum in the current income year. Here, business exposure is obtained by the expenditure in the form of the company’s name appearing on the complex and therefore PQR is allowed a deduction for $3 million when it incurs the expenditure. In this regard, it is considered that any enduring advantage from the expenditure, namely business exposure for a 10-year period, is of the same nature as advertising ie of a revenue nature. The fact that the expenditure is made in a lump sum does not change its revenue character, as it merely relieves the company from making revenue payments for the 10-year period (Anglo-Persian at page 262). Hence, it is not considered that the capital prohibition applies in this case. However, the right to this exposure, which lasts for 10 years, is a chose in action and, therefore, section EF 1 applies to require that the unexpired portion of the expenditure be included in PQR’s gross income at the end of the current income year. The amount of the unexpired portion is determined under limb (d) of section EF 1(5), this being the amount of the expenditure which relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. In the absence of any other relevant facts, the unexpired portion at any point in time will be determined by calculating the proportion of the 10-year period remaining and multiplying it by $3 million. For example, if at the end of the current income year, 9½ years remains of the 10-year period, then the unexpired portion will be $2,850,000. This will be included in PQR’s gross income, but will be allowed as a deduction in the next income year. At the end of that year, the unexpired period will be 8½ years and so $2,550,000 must be included in PQR’s gross income in that income year. And so on until the 10-year period is expired. Depreciation If the expenditure was incurred in relation to depreciable property (as defined in section OB 1), a deduction will be allowed for depreciation as determined under section EG 2. The amount of the deduction is dependent upon whether the depreciable property is wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Example 11 Paul owns and operates a plant nursery. He purchases a van on which he displays his business name prominently. He makes the van available to the local garden society on weekends, but retains ownership of it and uses the van for business purposes during the week. Is Paul allowed a deduction for the cost of the van? If not, would he be allowed a deduction for the depreciation of the van? The cost of the van is not deductible by virtue of the capital prohibition. However, a deduction for depreciation may be allowed. In this case, the question which arises is whether or not Paul would be allowed a deduction for the full amount of depreciation on the van calculated pursuant to limb (a) of section EG 2(1) or whether limb (d) of section EG 2(1) would apply. In this regard, it could be thought that when the van was being used by the garden society members, it would not be used or available for use by Paul for business purposes and that, therefore, limb (d) of section EG 2(1) would apply to limit the deduction otherwise available. However, because Paul’s business name is prominently displayed on the van, this provides business exposure. As well, the garden society members are a potential market for his plant nursery business. Hence, it is considered that the van is being used for business purposes, even when it is being used by the garden society members, and that, therefore, limb (d) of section EG 2(1) does not apply to limit the deduction available for depreciation. Example 12 John is a shareholder-employee of ABC Ltd, a marine products supplier. His hobby is to race yachts. ABC purchases a yacht which John races in various yachting competitions. The company’s name and logo is painted on the hull of the boat. Here, a physical asset is acquired by the business and therefore no deduction is allowed by reason of the capital prohibition in section BD 2(2). However, because the company’s name is displayed on the yacht, and ABC’s business of supplying marine products would be potentially promoted in a yachting competition, a deduction for depreciation will be allowed under section EG 2. The fact that John enjoys yachting does not preclude a depreciation deduction being allowed. Monetary remuneration There may be occasions where an employer sponsors an employee to take part in some event such as by paying his or her entry fees. At first glance, this might appear to be another instance of sponsorship expenditure, the deductibility of which would need to be tested in the ways considered so far in this statement. 49 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) However, where expenditure is on account of an employee, then it will be deductible under limb (b) of section BD 2 by virtue of being monetary remuneration of that employee (the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1 includes within it any expenditure on account of an employee). Although there may be an element of “sponsoring” the employee, in that the payment on his or her behalf is over and above what would ordinarily be paid, the expenditure will be deductible for the same reasons that his or her ordinary salary is deductible. Example 13 XYZ Ltd pays the entrance fee of one of its employees (Anne) who is going to compete in the local triathlon competition. Anne agrees to display the firm’s name prominently on her T-shirt, bicycle and swimming togs. Here, Anne is the one who enters the race and therefore the payment of the entrance fee is expenditure on account of Anne. Hence, the amount paid is monetary remuneration of an employee and as such is deductible under limb (b) of section BD 2(1). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 50 TREATY OF WAITANGI SETTLEMENTS – GST TREATMENT Introduction All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”), unless otherwise stated. This Interpretation Statement considers whether Treaty of Waitangi settlements between Maori claimant groups and the Crown are subject to the GST Act. The Crown is currently negotiating and settling claims for historical Treaty of Waitangi breaches. This is being carried out through the Office of Treaty Settlements (the “OTS”). Generally, the purpose of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement is for the Crown to provide redress to the Maori claimant group for historical wrongs that were breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. The redress can take various forms, but commonly includes the transfer of land, property (eg artefacts and buildings), other agreements (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals) and the payment of money by the Crown to the Maori claimant group. As part of the settlement it is also common for the Maori claimant group to give certain undertakings (eg to support the passing of the settlement legislation in Parliament) or agreements (eg an agreement that the Treaty settlement will be in full and final settlement of the Treaty grievance). Issues In a Treaty settlement situation the main issues are: •Is there a “supply” of goods or services from the Maori claimant group to the Crown; and •Whether the Treaty settlement payments (either cash or non-cash items) constitute “consideration” for the provision of those goods or services. This statement also considers: •Whether the Treaty settlement payments are deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods or services by being in the nature of a “grant or subsidy” under section 5(6D); and •Whether in a Treaty settlement, a transfer of land, property or other agreements entered into by the Crown are supplies for which “consideration” is received from the Maori claimant group. Conclusions This statement reaches the following conclusions: In terms of whether the Maori claimant group’s undertakings and agreements are supplies, that: •In a Treaty of Waitangi settlement, undertakings or agreements provided by the Maori claimant group to the Crown may fall within the broad definition of a “supply” of goods or services. However, the provision of the Treaty settlement payments (either cash or non-cash) by the Crown to the Maori claimant group are not “consideration” for the supply of those goods or services. The real or substantive nexus is between the Treaty settlement payments and the redress of historical wrongs which were breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Treaty settlement payments are therefore not “consideration” for the supply of goods or services for the purposes of section 8(1). Accordingly, in these circumstances, no GST is chargeable. •Where the Treaty settlement payments are true compensation payments they will not come within the meaning of “grant or subsidy” in section 5(6D). Consequently, the Treaty settlement payments will not be deemed consideration for a supply of goods or services under that provision. In terms of the Crown’s provision of land, property or services as part of the Settlement, that: •The Crown makes a supply of goods (eg land or property) or services (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals) to the Maori claimant group. However, the undertakings or agreements provided by the Maori claimant group are not “consideration” for the supply of those goods or services. The supplies were linked to the redress of historical wrongs that were breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. The undertakings or agreements provided by the Maori claimant group are only part of the procedures by which the historical grievance is settled or conditions to the settlement of those grievances, and they are not consideration for the supply of goods or services for the purposes of section 8(1). Consequently, in these circumstances no GST is chargeable on this basis either. 51 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) Legislation Section 20(3) states: ... in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period.. input tax.. Section 20(4) states: For the purposes of subsection (3), output tax in relation to a supply made by a registered person must be attributed to a taxable period... “Output tax” is defined in section 2(1) as: in relation to any registered person, means the tax charged pursuant to section 8(1) in relation to any person, in respect of a supply of goods or services made by that person. “Input tax” is defined in section 3A(1) as: (a)Tax charged under section 8(1) on the supply of goods and services made to that person, being goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: ... Section 8(1) states: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. Section 2(1) defines “goods” as “all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money”. Section 2(1) defines “services” as “anything which is not goods or money”. The definition of “supply” in section 5(1) “includes all forms of supply”. Section 10 determines “the value of a supply of goods and services”. It states: (1)For the purposes of this Act the following provisions of this section shall apply for determining the value of any supply of goods and services. (2)Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of, (a) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: (b) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money, the open market value of that consideration ... Section 2(1) defines “consideration”: \[I\]n relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any nonprofit body. A payment is “deemed to be consideration for a supply” under section 5(6D). It reads: For the purposes of this Act, where any payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy is made on behalf of the Crown or by any public authority to- (a) Any person (not being a public authority) in relation to or in respect of that person’s taxable activity; or (b) Any person for the benefit and on behalf of another person in relation to or in respect of that other person’s taxable activity,- that payment shall be deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods and services by the person to whom or for whose benefit the payment is made in the course or furtherance of that person’s taxable activity. Section 6(1) defines “taxable activity” as: (a)Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association or club: (b)Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the activities of any public authority or any local authority. “Registered person” in section 2(1) means “a person who is registered or liable to be registered under this Act”. The liability to register arises under section 51(1): (1)Subject to this Act, every person who, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, carries on any taxable activity and is not registered, becomes liable to be registered— (a) At the end of any month where the total value of supplies made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately preceding that month in the course of carrying on all taxable activities has exceeded $40,000 (or such larger amount as the Governor-General may, from time to time, by Order in Council declare): Provided that a person does not become liable to be registered by virtue of this paragraph where the Commissioner is satisfied that the value of those supplies in the period of 12 months beginning on the day after the last day of the period referred to in the said paragraph will not exceed that amount: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 52 (b)At the commencement of any month where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of the supplies to be made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately following that month will exceed the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section: Provided that any such person shall not become liable where the Commissioner is satisfied that that value will exceed that amount in that period solely as a consequence of— (c)any ending of, including a premature ending of, or any substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of, any taxable activity carried on by that person; or (d)The replacement of any plant or other capital asset used in any taxable activity carried on by that person. Analysis Under section 8(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the “GST Act”), goods and services tax is imposed at a rate of 12.5 percent where the following requirements are met: •there is a supply of goods or services in New Zealand; •by a registered person; •in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. If these requirements are met then tax is calculated by reference to the value of that supply. The value of a supply of goods or services is defined in section 10(2) as being the “consideration for the supply”. “Consideration” is defined in section 2(1) as being “any payment made ... in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services”. Under section 5(6D) of the Act, payments are deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods or services in the course or furtherance of that person’s taxable activity if the payments are: •in the nature of a “grant or subsidy”; •made on behalf of the Crown or by any public authority; •made to a person; •made in relation to or in respect of that persons taxable activity. Under section 2(1) a “registered person” means a person who is registered or is liable to be registered under the GST Act. 1. Whether the Maori claimant group makes a supply of goods or services which is chargeable with GST under section 8(1) Many of the Maori claimant groups who receive Treaty settlement payments will be registered for GST, and so it is possible to argue that any supplies made might be made in the course of the Maori claimant group’s taxable activity. This will always depend on the particular facts in each case, but this interpretation statement will (for convenience) proceed on the assumptions that: •the Maori claimant group is a registered person, and •any relevant supplies could arguably be seen as being made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that Maori claimant group. The further requirements of section 8(1) are discussed below. (a) Whether in a Treaty settlement the Maori claimant group makes a supply of goods or services in New Zealand Definition of “goods” “Goods” as defined in section 2 of the GST Act means all kinds of (tangible) personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money. A chose in action is a right to recover a thing (if withheld by action) of which a person does not have immediate enjoyment and possession. Examples include debts, insurance contracts, shares, copyrights, patents and trademarks. When a particular Maori claimant group and the Crown reach a settlement in relation to a Treaty grievance, the Maori claimant group will often provide certain undertakings or agreements. For example, the Maori claimant group may agree to accept the settlement as final settlement and not to pursue the claim in Court, and may also agree to support the passing of the legislation that gives effect to the settlement deed. In a Treaty settlement generally no tangible or real property passes from the Maori claimant group to the Crown or another person. Therefore, in most such cases, the Maori claimant group will not provide something as part of the settlement agreement that could be described as a “good”. However, it is possible that a future Treaty settlement agreement between a Maori claimant group and the Crown could contain a provision whereby some tangible or real property passes from that Maori claimant group to the Crown or another person. If that were so, then the Maori claimant group would provide something as part of the settlement agreement that could be described as a “good” for the purposes of the GST Act. 53 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) Definition of “Services” “Services” as defined in section 2 of the GST Act means “anything which is not goods or money”. According to Case S65 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,408, for an activity to be a “service” it must benefit the recipient in some way. In Case S65 the taxpayer previously ordered by a disciplinary tribunal to pay costs was denied a claim for an input tax credit for payment of those costs on the basis that he had not been supplied with goods or services. As stated above, when a particular Maori claimant group and the Crown reach settlement of a Treaty of Waitangi grievance, the Maori claimant groups often provide certain undertakings or agreements. The Maori claimant group’s undertakings and agreements are of some benefit to the Crown, therefore the undertakings and agreements could arguably be considered “services” for the purposes of the GST Act. Definition of “Supply” “Supply” is defined in section 5(1) as including all forms of supply. Both the New Zealand and English courts have held that the word “supply” should be given a very wide meaning. The High Court in Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 considered whether Databank had supplied services to various banks. In this case, the court interpreted the word “supply” as “furnish with or provide”. English courts have held that “supply” means to “furnish with or serve”. In Carlton Lodge Club Limited v C and E Commrs \[1974\] 3 All ER 798 the court held that the serving of drinks to members of an unincorporated club was a supply. In reaching this decision Milmo J said (at p 801): “the word ‘supply’ in its ordinary and natural sense means to furnish or to serve”; In C and E Commrs v Oliver \[1980\] 1 All ER 353 and 355 the court held that the purchase of a stolen car at an auction was a supply. Griffiths J also said (at p 354): “There is no definition of ‘supply’ in the Act itself, but it is quite clear from the language of the Act that ‘supply’ is a word of the widest import... . ‘Supply’ is the passing of possession in goods pursuant to an agreement whereunder the supplier agrees to part with and the recipient agrees to take possession. By ‘possession’ is meant, in this context, control over the goods, in the sense of having the immediate facility for their use. This may or may not involve the physical removal of the goods.” Given that supply merely requires something to be conferred by a person, and that it is defined in wide terms for GST purposes, the word appears to encompass all transactions, agreements, and other events where value is bestowed by one person on to another person. Therefore, the furnishing of goods or the provision of services will be a supply. The GST Act focuses on contractual supplies. This approach was reiterated in Wilson & Horton Limited v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325. This case discussed circumstances in which a newspaper publisher should account for GST on the services of placing advertisements for non-resident clients. In the Court of Appeal decision Richardson J said at p 12,328: Those provisions are directed to the contractual arrangements between the supplier and the recipient of the supply. In keeping with the general statutory scheme in that respect s 11, providing for zero rating of supply transactions where the stated overseas element is present, follows the same pattern. It follows that where, as in the presently material s 11(2)(e), the provision refers to “services ... supplied ... to a person” the statutory dictionary applies and the phrase refers to the contractual position and so to the person who has provided the consideration. There must also be an identifiable supply. The need to identify the supply was noted by Tipping J in Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 (CA). The Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust case involved a payment made by the Crown to a charitable trust that was established by the Crown to provide services and promote the wellbeing of Chatham Islands residents. Blanchard J said (at p 15,081): While it is clear that the services do not have to be supplied to the person providing the consideration (as defined) for them, it is still necessary for there to be a supply of services within the proper meaning of the phrase. Although services are defined as meaning anything which is not goods, it is still necessary for there to have been a supply of something. \[Emphasis added\] From the case law the word “supply”: •means to “furnish with or to provide or to serve” (Databank Systems Ltd, Carton Lodge Club Limited v C and E Commrs, and C and E Commrs v Oliver), •focuses on contractual supplies (Wilson & Horton Limited and Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust). In a Treaty settlement the Maori claimant groups enter into undertakings and agreements that are of benefit to the Crown, and no goods are provided by the Maori claimant groups to the Crown, and so therefore the undertakings and agreements entered into by the Maori claimant groups may be a supply of services. The undertaking and agreements are clearly identifiable supplies. As such, the undertakings and agreements provided by the Maori claimant group to the Crown as part of the Treaty settlement may fall within the broad definition of “supply”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 54 Whether “forbearance to sue” is a supply? There are two TRA cases that have considered whether forbearance to sue is a supply. In Case S77 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,483 Barber DJ considered an agreement to take no further enforcement steps and to have the proceedings struck out of court was not a supply of goods or services. In this case, the taxpayers were a farming couple who set fire to stubble on their farm. The fire burnt out of control and spread to a neighbouring farm where the fire damaged farm machinery, owned by the L partnership. The taxpayers and the L partnership reached an out of court settlement based on the value of the machinery and various costs to the L partnership. The taxpayer sought an input tax credit on the sum paid. The Authority considered that the surrender was not of itself a supply, as the L partnership did not forgo any legal right, rather it achieved enforcement of its legal right to damages. Therefore the taxpayer was not entitled to an input tax credit. Barber DJ commented that although the concept of “supply” is a very wide one (citing Databank Systems Ltd) the concept of “supply” could not cover the situation in Case S77, as the L partnership did not supply anything to the taxpayers (at p 7,487). In Case T22 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,124, Willy DJ also discussed the forbearance to sue point. He referred to the Commissioner’s policy statement on the “GST treatment of damages and out of court settlements” and made the following comments (at p 8,147): That \[policy statement\] appears to me to be a sensible appreciation of the legal consequences of an out of Court settlement in so far as it may impact upon the payment of goods and services tax. One can readily understand how a given settlement may involve the transfer of property which can be “connected back to the original taxable supplies” and that where a part of the payment relates to the original supply an apportionment of a global settlement sum may be required. I put it no higher than that. It is for that reason no doubt that the Commissioner relied as he did on the matters set out in his letter of 1 February 1994. To go beyond that and assert that the mere forbearance to sue is in some way the provision of goods or a service is on the face of it a surprising proposition. In Case T22 Willy DJ was also of the view that although the definition of “service” was wide, it did not include a forbearance to sue. He considered it could not be said that the taxpayer had provided a service to the Crown merely by choosing to not exercise the existing legal rights. Further Willy J commented it may be that the Crown has derived some benefit from the taxpayer’s decision, but that did not convert the taxpayer’s decision into the provision of services (at p 8,148): Viewed in that general way it cannot be said that merely by desisting from exercising rights otherwise available to it the objector has provided any service to the Crown. It may be that the Crown considers it has derived some benefit from the decision of the objector not to exercise those rights, but that does not convert the decision of the objector into one for the provision of services to the Crown. I repeat what is said earlier in this judgment from the decision of the Court of Appeal in C of IR v New Zealand Refining Company Ltd at p 13,193 of the unreported judgment of Blanchard J: “It is fundamental to the GST Act that the tax is levied on or in respect of supplies. It is not a tax on receipts or on turnover; it is a tax on transactions:”. There has been no transaction in this case answering that description and therefore there is nothing to tax. The reality is that the objector has simply surrendered some rights which it considered it otherwise had in return for a payment to it by the Crown of $2,000,000. Therefore even if the Commissioner had persuaded me that he should have been allowed to rely upon the forbearance to sue argument I am satisfied for the reasons I have given that it too would have failed. In both cases, the TRA decided that a mere forbearance to sue was not a supply. It is considered that it is unnecessary to narrow the concept of “supply of a service” in this way in order to give effect to the intention that GST will only be payable on transactions. The definitions of “supply” and “services” are very wide, and would seem able to include agreements to do things such as enter into a lease, and agreements not to do things such as a restraint of trade. These cases are not considered strong enough to exclude the possibility that a forbearance to sue may in certain circumstances be a supply. It is considered that in a Treaty settlement the Maori claimant group’s forbearance to sue (ie agreeing not to pursue the claim in Court) given as part of the Maori claimant group’s undertakings and agreements may be a supply of a service also. Conclusion The Commissioner considers that in a Treaty of Waitangi settlement the Maori claimant group’s undertakings and agreements may be supplies of goods or services in New Zealand for the purposes of section 8(1). (b) Whether any consideration was received in respect of, or for the inducement of, that supply The Treaty of Waitangi settlement payments or redress provided by the Crown to the Maori claimant groups can take various forms, but commonly includes the transfer of land, property (eg artefacts and buildings), other agree- ments (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals) and the payment of money. GST is levied under section 8(1) “by reference to the value of that supply”. Section 10(2) provides that the value of a supply is “the consideration for the supply”. “Consideration” in section 2(1) means “any payment made ... in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services...”. 55 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) Therefore, the next question is whether the Treaty settlement payments are made in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of the Maori claimant group’s undertakings and agreements. Definition of “consideration” The main requirement for “consideration” is that there must be a direct or substantial nexus between the payments and the supply of goods or services. In CIR v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 the court said that for a payment to constitute consideration there must be a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply. In New Zealand Refining the court considered that there was little or no connection between the payments made by the Crown and any supply of goods or services by New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (the company). Further the court said that although the payments were intended as an inducement to the company to keep the refinery open for three years, they were not payments for any supply. Blanchard J said that although there may have been an expectation that the refinery would continue to operate, there was no contractual requirement to that effect and no stipulation for the supply of product or services to any buyer or buyers. The only requirement was that the refinery continued to remain operational. Blanchard J noted that to qualify for the payment, the company simply had to keep the refinery operational, a requirement that it could satisfy just by processing its own products without making any supplies (at p 13,192). His honour continued (at p 13,193): It is fundamental to the GST Act that the tax is levied on or in respect of supplies. It is not a tax on receipts or on turnover; it is a tax on transactions: C of IR v Databank Systems Ltd. It is therefore necessary, as Mr Green submitted, to distinguish between supplies and the taxable activity (as defined in s 6) in the course of which they are made. The definition in s 6 itself requires a nexus between a supply and consideration, as does s 10. The tax itself is levied by s 8 on a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and is “by reference to the value of that supply”. Section 10 provides that the value of a supply is “to the extent of the consideration for the supply” the amount of the money involved or the nonmonetary open market value of the consideration. Already, before turning to the definition of “consideration”, it can be seen that, again, a linkage between supply and consideration is requisite to the imposition of the tax. The definition of “consideration”, though broad, cannot and does not dispense with that requirement. To constitute consideration for supply a payment must be made for that supply, though it need not be made to the supplier nor does the supply have to be made to the payer. There is a practical necessity for a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply. The mechanics of the legislation will otherwise make it impossible to collect the GST. \[Emphasis added\] The court took a similar approach in Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust saying that there must be a sufficient nexus between the payment (or other conduct) and the relevant services. In Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust the court also held that the payments were not consideration for (assumed) supplies, even though it concluded earlier that no supplies were made. Tipping J said (at p 15,081): If one assumes, contrary to my earlier conclusion, that what the trustees did amounted to the supply of services to the Crown as settlor and/or to the Islanders as beneficiaries, it must also be shown that the payments by the Crown had a sufficient connection with those services to fulfil at least one limb of the statutory definition. The money was not paid for any particular purpose, albeit that in terms of ordinary trustee law it had to be used within the terms of the Trust. I therefore have difficulty in seeing how it can be said that the payments made by the Crown were in respect of or for the inducement of any services. Clearly the payments were not in response to the supply of services. With the use of the money not in any way related to any particular purpose and not in any way circumscribed or mandated, except by the conventional requirement that the trustees should keep within broad and general powers vested in them by the Trust deed, I do not consider the relationship between the payment and the (assumed) services fulfils the definition of consideration. As a consequence, the trustees did not make their (as- sumed) supply of services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Therefore, it is not sufficient that each party merely provides something, there must be a direct or substantial nexus or link between the supply and the consideration, in the sense that the supply must be the occasion or reason for the consideration. In Case T22, Judge Willy did not accept that the taxpayer had made a supply of goods or services to MAF by ceasing to conduct its farming activity in return for the payment. As the regulations had already removed the taxpayer’s ability to carry on the business, there was not a sufficient connection between the ceasing of the business and the payment. In summary, the main requirement is that for a payment to be consideration for a supply, there must be a direct or substantial nexus or link between the payment and the supply of goods or services (NZ Refining; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust). Undertakings and agreements As stated in NZ Refining, the mere fact that there may be some form of supply by the Maori claimant group to the Crown does not of itself mean that the Treaty settlement payments the Crown makes to the Maori claimant group is consideration for that supply. The Treaty of Waitangi settlement payments made by the Crown to the Maori claimant group takes various forms, of both cash and non-cash items. For GST purposes there must be a direct or substantial nexus between the supplies made by the Maori claimant groups and the receipt of the Treaty settlement payments. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 56 Anything supplied by the Maori claimant group under the settlement agreement must provide the occasion or reason for the receipt of the Treaty settlement payments from the Crown. However, in most Treaty of Waitangi settlement situations where the Crown makes Treaty settlement payments to the Maori claimant group, there is no real or substantial nexus between the supplies and the Treaty settlement payments. In many settlement situations such a nexus will not be present. Treaty of Waitangi settlement payments are generally made by the Crown to recognise and compensate for historical wrongs that were breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles. Therefore, the real or substantive nexus is between the Treaty settlement payments made by the Crown and the redress or compensation for historical wrongs, not the undertakings or agreements provided by the Maori claimant group as part of the Treaty settlement. The undertakings or agreements are only part of the mechanism or procedure by which the Treaty grievance is settled. In such a situation there is no direct or substantial nexus between the supplies made by the Maori claimant group and the receipt of the Treaty settlement payments from the Crown. An example of a case where there was a forbearance to sue is the British VAT tribunal decision of Cooper Chasney \[1990\] 5 BVC 677. Unfortunately in that case the tribunal did not comment on whether there was a difference between the forbearance to sue and an agreement to give up the right to use a company name. Conclusion In a Treaty settlement situation, the Commissioner considers that supplies are made by the Maori claimant groups, but there is no real or substantial nexus between the supplies and the Treaty settlement payments (either cash or non-cash items) received from the Crown. The real or substantive nexus is between the Treaty settlement payments made by the Crown and the redress of historical wrongs which were breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, not the undertakings or agreements provided by the Maori claimant group as part of the Treaty settlement. The undertakings or agreements are only part of the mechanism or procedure by which the Treaty grievance is settled. Unless the payments from the Crown to the Maori claimants are “consideration” for other matters, the payments will not be subject to GST. (c) Whether in terms of section 5(6D) the Treaty settlement payments (cash or non-cash) are deemed consideration for supply in the course or furtherance of the Maori claimant group’s taxable activity Under section 5(6D) of the Act, payments are deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods or services in the course or furtherance of that person’s taxable activity if the payments are: •in the nature of a “grant or subsidy”; •made on behalf of the Crown or by any public authority; •made to a person; and •made in relation to or in respect of that person’s taxable activity. In order for section 5(6D) to apply all of the factors mentioned above must be met. The first question that section 5(6D) raises is whether the Treaty settlement payments meet the case law definitions of “grant or subsidy”. The phrase “grant or subsidy” is not defined in the legislation, but the words are given meaning by case law. The case law shows that the following factors when combined together usually indicate that a payment is in the nature of a “grant or subsidy”, ie where the payment is: •A gift, in the sense that there is no obligation to make it (De Morgan and Anor v The Director General of Social Welfare (1996) 17 NZTC 12,441 and GTE Sylvania v R \[1974\] CTC 751). •Special assistance (First Provincial Building Society Ltd v FCT 95 ATC 4145, Placer Development Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (1969) 121 CLR 353, De Morgan and Anor v The Director General of Social Welfare (1996) 17 NZTC 12,441, Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan and Anor (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636). •A payment to promote or encourage an industry or enterprise (GTE Sylvania v R \[1974\] CTC 751, Reckitt & Coleman Property Ltd v FCT 4 ATR 501 and Placer Development Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (1969) 121 CLR 353). •Made out of public funds (GTE Sylvania v R \[1974\] CTC 751). •Beneficial to the public interest (GTE Sylvania v R \[1974\] CTC 751 and Placer Development Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (1969) 121 CLR 353). In deciding whether a payment is in the nature of a “grant or subsidy” it is the character or quality of what is paid and of the consideration given that is crucial, not its receipt in the hands of the payee (Director General of Social Welfare v S & D De Morgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636). In order to make a decision as to whether the Treaty settlement payments are payments in the nature of a “grant or subsidy”, all the above factors must be weighed and the relevant facts taken into account. 57 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) In the Treaty context, the settlement payments are redress or compensation for historical wrongs. Compensation is something that is to be paid which makes up for the loss that the person has sustained (Great Western Railway v Helps \[1918\] AC 141) or a payment to be placed into the hands of the owner expropriated, the full money equiva- lent of the thing of which he has been deprived (Nelungaloo Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth (19471948) 75 CLR 495). The meaning of compensation is inconsistent with payments that are in the nature of a “grant or subsidy”. If the Treaty settlement payments (either cash or non- cash) are a true compensation payment for historical wrongs, they will not be payments in the nature of a “grant or subsidy”. A Treaty settlement payment is not assistance or aid to supplement the recipient’s efforts, but a payment to make up for a wrong done or loss suffered in the past that were breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. In this sense, it is not gratuitous or a gift, given that it is occasioned by a moral, and possibly legal, obligation to correct the wrong done. It does not have the purposes of promoting a particular industry or enterprise. While it may be used for an industry or enterprise, the real purpose is to compensate for a wrong done or make up for loss. Conclusion The Commissioner considers that where the Treaty settlement payment is a true compensation payment for historical wrongs that were breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi it will not be a payment in the nature of a “grant or subsidy”. Consequently, the Treaty settlement payments (either cash or non-cash) are not deemed to be consideration for the supply of goods or services in terms of section 5(6D). 2. Whether the Crown makes a supply of goods or services which is chargeable with GST under section 8(1) The Crown is the party to a Treaty of Waitangi settlement with the Maori claimant groups and the Crown itself transfers land and property, enters into agreements (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals), or makes payment of money pursu- ant to the settlement agreement. It appears therefore that the Crown is making supplies of goods or services to the Maori claimant groups. In order to decide whether such supplies are subject to GST it is necessary to consider whether any consideration was received in respect of, or for the inducement of those supplies. If no consideration was received for those supplies, section 8(1) will not apply and it will then be unnecessary to discuss the other requirements that need to be met in section 8(1). (a) In a Treaty settlement, does the Crown make a supply of goods or services in New Zealand? Definition of “goods” or “services” As part of a Treaty settlement, the Crown often transfers land or property (eg historical artefacts and buildings) to the Maori claimant groups. Section 2 defines “goods” as “all kinds of personal or real property”. The transfer of land or property by the Crown to the Maori claimant group clearly falls within the definition of “goods”. The Crown may also make payments of money. The definition of “goods” in section 2 does not include “choses in action or money”. Section 2 also defines “services” as “anything which is not goods or money”. Therefore, the payment of money by the Crown to the Maori claimant group is clearly not “goods or services”. The Crown could also make provision for other agreements (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals). The provision of any other agreements (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals) by the Crown to the Maori claimant group clearly falls within the definition of “services”. Definition of “supply” As stated above, from the case law the word “supply”: •means to “furnish with or to provide or to serve” (Databank Systems Ltd, Carton Lodge Club Limited v C and E Commrs, C and E Commrs v Oliver, Case T22), •focuses on contractual supplies (Wilson & Horton Limited, Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust). In a Treaty settlement, the Crown furnishes or provides land, property (eg historical artefacts or buildings) and other agreements (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals) to the Maori claimant groups that fall within the definitions of goods and services. Possession of the land and property passes from the Crown to the Maori claimant group. The services are also of benefit to the Maori claimant group. There are also clearly identifiable supplies. As such, the provision of land, property (eg historical artefacts or buildings) and other agreements (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals) by the Crown to the Maori claimant groups are capable of being regarded as a supply of goods or services. Conclusion The Commissioner considers that, in a Treaty settlement, the land, property or other agreements (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals) provided by the Crown to the Maori claimant groups may also be supplies of goods or services in New Zealand for the purposes of section 8(1). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 58 (b) Is any consideration received in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, that supply? Definition of “consideration” As stated above, the main requirement is that, for a payment to be “consideration”, there must be a direct or substantial nexus or link between the payment and the supply of goods or services (NZ Refining, Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust). For the purposes of GST, it is necessary to establish whether there is a direct or substantial nexus or link between the supply of goods or services provided by the Crown and the undertakings or agreements entered into by the Maori claimant groups. If so, GST will be chargeable by the Crown and the Maori claimant groups may be able to claim an input tax deduction. The undertakings or agreements provided by the Maori claimant groups are capable of falling within the definition of “consideration”. However, for the reasons outlined below, in the absence of other factors, there will be no GST chargeable by the Crown on the supply of the goods or services. First, although supplies are made there is no real or substantial nexus between the provision of goods and services by the Crown and the Maori claimant group’s undertakings or agreements. The provision of goods (eg land or property) or services (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals) are generally made by the Crown to recognise and compensate for historical wrongs that were breaches of the Treaty and its principles. Therefore, the real or substantive nexus is between the goods or services provided by the Crown and the wrongs done in the past, not the undertakings or agreements provided by the Maori claimant groups as part of the Treaty settlement. Also, GST is determined according to the value of the supply. Under section 10(2), if the consideration is not in money (eg the Maori claimant group’s undertakings or agreements), the value of the supply is the open market value of the consideration. Because the undertakings or agreements are made in order to correct past wrongs and to settle historical Treaty of Waitangi grievances, the undertakings or agreements do not have and are not intended to have any open market value. The Crown is not transferring the goods (eg land and property) or services (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, or native plants and animals) in order to receive consideration of value from the Maori claimant groups. It is transferring the goods or services in order to correct past wrongs. Furthermore, the undertakings or agreements are only the mechanism or procedure by which the historical grievance is settled or conditions to the settlement of those grievances. In such a situation there is no direct or substantial nexus between the supplies made by the Crown and the undertakings or agreements provided by the Maori claimant groups. Conclusion The Commissioner considers that in a Treaty settlement situation the Crown does not make a supply of goods or services which is chargeable with GST under section 8(1) as: •The direct or substantial nexus is between the goods (eg land or property) or services (eg an agreement to preserve land sites, or native plants and animals) provided by the Crown and the redress of historical wrongs, not the undertakings or agreements provided by the Maori claimant groups as part of the Treaty settlement. •It is not intended that the Crown receive anything from the Maori claimant groups of significant open market value under the Treaty settlement agreement in return for that supply. •Any undertakings or agreements are just a procedure by which the historical grievance is settled or conditions to the settlement of those grievances. 59 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) Example It has been concluded that certain actions taken against a particular iwi during the 1850s and 1860s were a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi. Descendants of that particular iwi (the Maori claimant group) and the Crown have entered into a Treaty of Waitangi Settlement agreement to settle the historical Treaty claims. In the settlement agreement, the Crown acknowledges that the wrongs committed against the iwi were breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi during the 1850s and 1860s. Accordingly, the Crown agrees to provide redress to atone for the wrongs done. The settlement agreement provides that the redress (cash and non-cash items) will include certain areas of land and improvements on land, money, and the return of other property (held as artefacts in a provincial museum) that belonged to the iwi that were taken by the Crown. The Crown also makes an agreement to preserve specific land sites, native plants and animals in the Maori claimant group’s tribal area. While the Treaty settlement agreement states that the redress is to atone for the wrongs done that were breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, the Maori claimant group also enters into certain undertakings or agreements with the Crown. These include accepting that the settlement payments are in full and final settlement of the Crown’s breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi in relation to their historical Treaty claims and to support the passing of legislation which is required to give effect to the settlement agreement. The Maori claimant group has registered as an entity for GST purposes. The Maori claimant group and the Crown want to know whether any GST is payable on the Treaty settlement. In terms of section 8(1) or section 5(6D), does the Maori claimant group make a supply of goods or services to the Crown for any consideration? The undertakings or agreements provided by the Maori claimant group to the Crown fall within the broad definition of supply. However, the Treaty settlements payments (either cash or non-cash) provided by the Crown to the Maori claimant group are not consideration for supplies of goods or services. The real or substantive nexus is between the Treaty settlement payments provided by the Crown and the redress of historical wrongs. In these circumstances no GST is chargeable. The Treaty settlement payments (either cash or non-cash) are to compensate for historical Treaty breaches. The Treaty settlement payments are a true compensation payment and, as such, they do not fall within the definition of a “grant or subsidy” for the purposes of section 5(6D). Therefore the Treaty settlement payments are not deemed consideration for a supply under section 5(6D) either. In terms of section 8(1), does the Crown make a supply of goods or services to the Maori claimant group for any consideration? Clearly, the transfer of land or property from the Crown to the Maori claimant group or the entering into certain agreements (eg an agreement to preserve specific land sites, native plants and animals) are supplies of goods or services. However, the undertakings or agreements entered into by the Maori claimant group are not consideration for the supply of those goods or services. The real or substantive nexus is between the goods or services provided by the Crown and the redress of historical wrongs. Therefore, no GST is chargeable by the Crown on the supply of these goods or services.

Section CN 1(2) enables the Commissioner to exempt shipping operators of another country from New Zealand income tax on merchandise, goods, livestock, mail or passengers shipped from New Zealand, if New Zealand shipping operators are similarly exempt in the other country. Papua New Guinea has recently provided an undertaking, backdated to 1 April 1999, to exempt New Zealand shipping operators from Papua New Guinea income tax on freight shipped from Papua New Guinea. New Zealand has therefore responded by exempting Papua New Guinea shipping operators deriving income from the shipment of freight from New Zealand, also with effect from 1 April 1999. Other countries with whom New Zealand has previously entered into exemption arrangements under section CN 1(2) are Barbados, Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Greece, Hong Kong, Israel, Liberia, Netherlands Antilles, New Caledonia, Panama, Poland, Tonga and Vanuatu. 63 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

JUDICIAL REVIEW Case:Surjeet Singh v CIR Decision date:7 August 2002 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, Income Tax Act 1994, Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) Keywords:Amended Returns, NOPA; Deemed Acceptance; Exceptional Circumstances s 89K TAA Summary The CIR was successful in resisting the application for judicial review. Facts On 10 June 1998, the CIR issued to the plaintiff a default assessment for income tax in relation to his business as a motor mechanic for the year ended 31 March 1997. On 10 August 1998, he issued similar default assessments for the years ended 1990 –1996 and 1998. As the plaintiff had not previously furnished any returns of income, he could dispute the default assessments only by furnishing a returns of income for the relevant periods: section 89D(2) TAA. According to the CIR’s records, the plaintiff’s accountant prepared returns for the 1990 – 1996 years, and filed them on 22 September 1998. A second return for 1996 was filed on 26 January 1999. Returns for the 1997 and 1998 years were filed on 19 November 1998. The plaintiff claimed, and the CIR disputed, that on 22 October 1998 further tax returns were filed for the period 1990 – 1998 to which the CIR did not respond within two months. On 23 March 2001, the CIR took enforcement proceedings in the District Court, and in the course of those proceedings, the plaintiff sought to file NOPA’s out of time. The CIR claimed it was not competent for the plaintiff to proceed by way of judicial review rather than by way of the statutory challenge procedure. The plaintiff claimed, as a first cause of action, the alleged returns of 22 October 1998 were to be construed as NOPA’s issued under section 89D, which the CIR failed to respond to, and accordingly the CIR was deemed by section 89H to have accepted those returns. As a second cause of action, the plaintiff sought a determination the CIR acted wrongly in failing to find the delays in challenging the assessments were due to “exceptional circumstances,” so the time for challenge should be extended under section 89K. The CIR disputed the factual claim that the alleged returns were filed on 22 October 1998. He also disputed he was deemed to have accepted the contents of the alleged returns, or that there were any grounds for challenging his decision that there were no “exceptional circumstances.” Decision The Court declined to consider the factual question of whether or not the CIR had invited the plaintiff to file a NOPA out of time, as the issue had already been determined against him by the District Court on 12 August 2001. The plaintiff was therefore bound by that decision, and could not challenge it, except by appeal brought within time. The Court held that if tax returns were filed on 22 October 1998, they would have no legal significance. It was therefore unnecessary to decide whether or not additional returns were filed on that date. The reasons for this conclusion follow: The 1998 year •This year could not be challenged as it was the subject of an agreed adjustment signed on 13 April 1999. Section 89I precluded the plaintiff from challenging it. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 64 The 1990 – 1996 years •The CIR had superseded the default assessments with amended assessments based on the returns filed on 22 September 1998, which meant the default assessments had no continuing effect. The 1996 year •An additional reason applies to 1996. The initial return filed on 22 September 1998 was superseded by a second return filed on 26 January 1999, leading to an amended assessment on 16 February 1999. The CIR may under section 113 accept late returns and process them outside the response period, which he did in the case of this second return. As the plaintiff had filed a return, he had the right under section 89D(1) to issue a NOPA in response to the assessment, until 16 April 1999. As he did not do so, he cannot dispute the issue, unless he can establish “exceptional circum- stances”. The 1997 year •A similar process applied to the 1997 year as to 1996. Exceptional circumstances On this issue, the Court found there was no point in considering whether the plaintiff could demonstrate exceptional circumstances in relation to the returns allegedly filed on 22 October 1998, as they had no legal significance for reasons set out above. In addition, in relation to the 1990 – 1997 years, no facts were pleaded or proved to support the submission the CIR acted wrongly in finding the statutory test for extraordinary circumstances was not met. 65 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) TRANSFER APPLICATION DISMISSED Case:Actonz Investment Joint Venture, Erris Promotions, Arsenal Limited and others v CIR Decision date:15 August 2002 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Transfer application dismissed Summary The CIR was unsuccessful in his attempt to transfer six cases from the TRA to the High Court. Facts Actonz Investment Joint Venture (“Actonz”) setup a scheme involving the purchase of software (“the scheme”) which the CIR considers to be the second largest tax avoidance arrangement in New Zealand to date, for both income tax and GST purposes. The GST side of the case is currently in the High Court, Actonz having challenged the CIR’s assessment disallowing the GST input claimed as a result of the scheme. The income tax assessments for the individual investors disallowing the depreciation losses claimed as a result of the scheme, and imposing 100% shortfall penalties for taking an abusive tax position, were made earlier this year. Six of the individual investors, representing the 420 odd Actonz investors, filed challenges to the income tax assessments in the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”). These six “representative” cases were commenced before the TRA, as test cases. Given the public importance of the issues involved and the amount of money at stake, the CIR applied to have the six depreciation cases transferred from the TRA to the High Court and consolidated in the High Court with the GST case. Actonz cross-applied to have the GST case stayed until the depreciation case has been heard. Decision Hammond J dismissed both the CIR’s application for a transfer of the depreciation case to the High Court, and Actonz application for a stay of the GST case in the High Court. His Honour went through the legislative basis for the removal of proceedings from the TRA to the High Court, ie section 138N(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) and the relevant authorities in the area and concluded that the overall test is that of the justice of the case. The relevant authorities set out certain factors which need to be traversed in the consideration of a transfer application and included the factual complexity and difficulties of any given dispute, the sums involved and the existence of difficult issues of principles. His Honour considered that the reasons why the investors filed in the TRA were relevant. The first consideration related to the fact that the TRA is a specialist tribunal and that it is the individual’s right to have his case dealt with economically, confidentially, expeditiously and in a forum of his choice. The second consideration related to the issue of legal costs. It was suggested by counsel for the investors that the hearing costs in the TRA are “minute in comparison with the costs of conducting a \[lengthy\] trial in the High Court.” The third consideration was that of anonymity in that proceedings in the TRA are not in open Court but rather by way of a hearing that is closed to the public. Under the heading of “Costs” His Honour was not persuaded that the sums in issue (around $226m in total—averaging at $80,000 per taxpayer) in this case are of real moment for present purposes. His Honour accepted that the amounts were considerable but thought it is trite that the sum of money in issue in a proceeding is in and of itself a poor measure of the difficulties likely to attend on a case. Under the heading of “Objector/Plaintiff autonomy” His Honour found that plaintiff (objector) autonomy should weigh in favour of those parties in the context of these cases. The plaintiffs are entitled, in His Honour’s view, to say “I want the less formal, less expensive and private TRA, at least in the first instance.” The structure of the statute supports this view according to His Honour. Under the heading “the forensic overlap in the proceedings”, His Honour was not persuaded that these cases should be co-joined in the way sought by the CIR. The first reason was because of the differences in parties, ie the Actonz plaintiff in the GST case is different from the objectors in the depreciation proceedings in the TRA. If the CIR is allowed to co-join the two then the objectors will have the plaintiff in the GST case “thrust upon them”. Secondly, if they are co-joined the ambit of the dispute is considerably widened for the objectors and the length of the combined proceedings would escalate the costs for the objectors. Thirdly, His Honour felt that there are arguably some real differences in the legal issues between the cases. The availability (or rather possibility of unavailability) of the CIR’s senior counsel, Mr Jim Farmer QC for a trial that would last several weeks, if the matters were co-joined, was also a factor that Hammond J took into consideration in reaching his decision. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 66 Therefore essentially for practical reasons His Honour took the view that the respective proceedings should remain in the forums in which they were commenced. Staying the GST case so the depreciation case can be heard His Honour stated that Actonz counsel seemed to want the best of both worlds in applying for a stay of the GST case yet arguing against the transfer of the income tax cases. In His Honour’s view the adjournment application is premature and that when the issues are more closely defined from the income tax cases, and the final “shape” of the GST litigation can be discerned, it may or may not be appropriate for there to be an adjournment in the then context of the overall litigation. The application for a stay was therefore dismissed. 67 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) In the current case the appellants submitted that the costs judgment should be recalled because new evidence relevant to costs had arisen since the date of the costs judgment. On 17 June 1999 Baragwanath J refused to recall the costs judgment. That decision was appealed. The appellants argued that the Commissioner was guilty of conduct that necessitated continuation of the litigation, that the High Court was unaware of the failed settlement when it delivered the costs judgment (and that that was relevant to costs), and that other taxpayers (the Kemp litigants) in a similar position had costs awarded in their favour. The Commissioner argued that the decision to recall a judgment is a discretionary decision and the actual decision which the appellants wanted to recall was a costs decision, another discretionary decision. The Commissioner further argued that as he was substantially successful in the High Court that he was entitled to costs and that Baragwanath J did not err in his approach. Furthermore, the Kemp litigants were in a fundamentally different situation than the appellants. Decision Glazebrook J, delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal, found for the appellants. Her Honour noted that Baragwanath J’s costs judgment was made without knowledge of the aborted settlement deeds. It also pre-dated the Kemp litigation. Her Honour questioned some of Baragwanath J’s comments but recognised the judge had a discretion when awarding costs. However, Glazebrook J noted that the Court of Appeal was concerned by a statement in Baragwanath J’s judgment to the effect that the appellants could not have allied themselves with the Kemp litigation without electing to discontinue their substantive appeal. The Court of Appeal held that the appellants would only have had to do this if the settlements were upheld. This concern persuaded the Court of Appeal that the appeal should be allowed. It made an order recalling the costs judgment. Baragwanath J was ordered to make a fresh costs assessment in light of the Court of Appeal’s decision. COSTS SENT BACK TO THE HIGH COURT FOR A NEW ASSESSMENT Case:Brent Leroy Miller & Ors v CIR; Managed Fashions Limited & Ors v CIR Decision date:19 August 2002 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Costs, High Court’s discretion Summary The Court of Appeal upheld the appellants’ appeal of the High Court costs judgment. The High Court was ordered to make a fresh costs assessment. Facts This appeal was from a decision of Baragwanath J, dated 17 June 1999, refusing to recall an earlier costs judgment. The costs related to litigation about a tax avoidance scheme known as the JG Russell template. The template has been held to constitute tax avoidance in all New Zealand courts, including the Privy Council (see Miller v CIR \[2001\] 3 NZLR 316). On 13 July 1994 the Taxation Review Authority delivered a decision reported as Case R25 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,120. After that decision some of the appellants, who were parties in Case R25, entered into settlement agreements with the Commissioner. These settlements were later abandoned as the Commissioner decided they were ultra vires as they involved remitting more than $50,000 of core tax (which the Commissioner did not have the statutory authority to do). Subsequent to the failed settlements, the appellants appealed Case R25 and also judicially reviewed the Commissioner. Baragwanath J, in three judgments, found largely for the Commissioner. Costs of $80,000 were awarded to the Commissioner. Other participants of the JG Russell template also attempted to settle their liabilities, and the Commissioner also resiled from those settlements. A group of taxpayers, known as the Kemp litigants, judicially reviewed the Commissioner in relation to the failed settlements. In a decision reported as Kemp & Ors v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,110, Robertson J found for the Commissioner (the settlements were not enforceable), but was of the opinion that that was one of the rare cases where the successful party should pay costs to the unsuccessful party (the Commissioner had to pay costs to the unsuccessful applicants). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 68 JUDICIAL REVIEW CAUSE OF ACTION STRUCK OUT Case:John George Russell & Ors v Taxation Review Authority & CIR Decision date:20 August 2002 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994, New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 Keywords:Judicial Review, strike out Summary The Commissioner was successful in his application to strike out the applicants’ amended fourth cause of action. Facts This case relates to the JG Russell template. The template has been held to constitute tax avoidance in all New Zealand courts, including the Privy Council (see Miller v CIR \[2001\] 3 NZLR 316). In early 2000 Mr Russell and a number of companies associated with him and his tax avoidance template brought judicial review proceedings against the Commissioner and the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”). The review proceedings consisted of five causes of action. On 2 October 2000 Fisher J, in the High Court in Auckland (Russell v Taxation Review Authority (2000) 19 NZTC 15,924), struck out the first and fifth causes of action and stayed the second and third causes of action. The fourth cause of action was sent back for the plaintiffs to amend the pleadings. An amended statement of claim was filed and the Commissioner applied to strike it out. This judgment was the result of the Commissioner’s strike-out application. The fourth cause of action alleged that the Commissioner acted unfairly in his conduct with the plaintiffs, in particular by refusing to call the “correct” witnesses and in not complying with discovery obligations. Because of the Commissioner’s conduct certain decisions of the TRA should be reconvened. The plaintiffs argued that the Commissioner is obliged by the common law, section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and section 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 to act honestly and fairly in his proceedings before the TRA. The obligations include an obligation of disclosure of relevant documents and ensuring witnesses are available for examination and cross-examination. The plaintiffs alleged that the Commissioner had failed to comply with these obligations. Decision: Section 27 of the Bill of Rights Act The plaintiffs argued that the Commissioner will have breached section 27(1) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 if he conducts the proceedings before the TRA in a way such as to impair the rights guaranteed by that section. Section 27(1) refers to the principles of natural justice. The Commissioner argued, and O’Regan J accepted, that the primary focus of section 27(1) should be on the judicial body (the TRA) rather than any public official (the Commissioner). It was also noted that section 27(3) of the Bill of Rights Act says that civil proceedings against the Crown should be treated in the same manner as civil proceedings between individuals. O’Regan J concluded that if the Commissioner conducts proceedings before the TRA in compliance with the rules governing hearings in the TRA, it will be very difficult to establish any conduct which could be said to infringe any duty he has in terms of section 27(1). Section 6 of the Tax Administration Act The plaintiffs argued that the Commissioner has a duty to act honestly and fairly by virtue of section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. That section says that the Commissioner must at all times use his best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. The plaintiffs argued that section 6 should be interpreted in the same way as the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, and that breaches of the obligations created by section 6 should be treated in the same way as breaches of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act. The Commissioner argued that section 6 did not impose specific duties of the kind described, but rather said that section 6 was a general statement as to the standard of conduct required by the Commissioner. The Commissioner submitted that failures to meet those standards could lead to a complaint to the Commissioner (or the Ombudsman or the TRA in appropriate cases) but could not be the foundation of an independent High Court action. O’Regan J held that section 6 did not create rights or obligations akin to those created by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and therefore that it could not be the foundation of an action for the remedy sought by the plaintiffs. The Scally Principle The Scally principle (named after R v Bolton Justices, ex parte Scally \[1991\] 2 All ER 619) is a principle applied in some criminal cases “that a challenge may also lie where unfairness in the conduct of proceedings resulted in some failure on the prosecutor’s part, even when no-one has been guilty of fraud or dishonesty...” R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, ex p A \[1997\] 3 All ER 745, 761. 69 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) The plaintiffs argued that there was no reason not to extend the application of this principle to proceedings which did not have a criminal flavour. O’Regan J did not accept the plaintiffs’ submissions and noted that there was no compelling reason to extend this principle to cases outside the criminal and quasi criminal arena. Conclusion O’Regan J concluded by saying that “the Commissioner’s obligation to act honestly and fairly does not encompass an obligation to call witnesses or make them available, in circumstances where the Commissioner (and the Commissioner’s counsel), do not seek to lead evidence from them for the purposes of the Commissioner’s case...” . Similarly, his Honour found that the TRA’s powers for discovery are also adequate. Furthermore, O’Regan J noted that any deficiencies could be dealt with on appeal. O’Regan J therefore struck out the cause of action. The plaintiffs have indicated that they are going to appeal this decision. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) 70 Decision His Honour Justice Hansen made it quite clear in his decision that NHNL counsel conceded that it was an error on the part of NHNL that has led to this application. Counsel also accepted that he could not simply amend the pleadings by changing the relevant GST period. However, Counsel did submit that there was jurisdiction for the Court to hear the substantive dispute and deal with the matter by way of the declarations now sought. Counsel submitted that this was a pragmatic approach given that a five day hearing had been set for September the 9th. Counsel also submitted that this was an exceptional case, as in Golden Bay, and leave should be granted accordingly. His Honour stated that the problem facing NHNL is that it cannot challenge the assessment for the April period in this Court until such time as the disputes procedures under the relevant legislation had been undertaken. His Honour held that in this case it is clear that the Court has jurisdiction to grant the leave to amend. In exercising the discretion it is appropriate to take into account whether or not the trial will be postponed, whether the setting down rules could be rendered nugatory and whether there is prejudice to the defendant. However, at the end of the day the important factor is to ensure that the real controversy between the parties goes to trial. It seemed to His Honour that in virtually any other type of proceedings leave would be granted in the circumstances confronting the Court. However, for valid reasons a different approach has been taken by the Courts in relation to tax disputes, ie in cases such as Miller v CIR, Simunovich Fisheries Ltd v CIR, Golden Bay Cement Co Ltd v CIR etc. His Honour held that, while he had considerable sympathy for NHNL, he had reached the conclusion that it would be inappropriate to grant the leave sought. The authorities cited make it plain that it is inappropriate to attempt to challenge an assessment by way of judicial review proceedings and declarations based on that review. Even though what was sought here was a declaration pursuant to the Court’s inherent jurisdiction as a matter of principle it is hard to see any difference between a declaration made pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction and a declaration made under proceedings initiated under the Judicature Amendment Act. Here NHNL is seeking a declaration relating to substantive matters which it says the CIR erred in the course of the assessment. APPLICATION TO AMEND PLEADINGS Case:North Harbour Nominees Limited v CIR Decision date:29 August 2002 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act Keywords:Application to amend pleadings by way of declaration dismissed Summary High Court discretion to amend pleadings by way of declaration not exercised. Facts North Harbour Nominees Ltd (“NHNL”) sought leave to file an amended statement of claim for a matter which has been set down for 5 days hearing commencing 9 September 2002. All interlocutory steps, discovery, and exchange of briefs have been completed. The proposed amended statement of claim deletes the challenge to the assessment for the 31 March 1997 taxable period and replaces it with a declaration that the plaintiff (NHNL) satisfies the criteria for an input tax deduction in the taxable period ended 30 April 1997 and that section 76 of the GST Act has no application. The Commissioner opposed the application for amendment because, in his submission, it is an attempt to change the GST taxable period in issue in this case. It seeks to replace a challenge to an assessment for the GST period ending 31 March 1997 with a declaration that NHNL satisfies the criteria for an input tax deduction in the 30 April 1997 taxable period. The Commissioner argued that the Court has no jurisdiction to change the taxable period in issue. By way of background, NHNL claimed an input tax deduction in its GST return for the taxable period ending 31 March 1997. The claim related to the importation of a fishing vessel called the Ocean Dawn. One of several issues in the case is whether GST on the import of the boat was levied or paid in the taxable period ending 31 March 1997. The question of the correct taxable period was raised by the CIR over four years ago in his NOPA. NHNL was aware of this issue and responded to it in its Notice of Response. In May 2002, NHNL claimed that, as a result of certain documents provided by the CIR as part of the pre-trial discovery process, it was obliged to accept that the taxable period ended 31 March 1997 was not the correct taxable period to claim the credit. The Commissioner asserted that the documents referred to by NHNL were actually its own documents. 71 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002) Further, this case is distinguishable from Golden Bay in that it is not a truly exceptional case. First, the problem was of its own making. Second, the imbalance in UOMI rates is a statutory matter determined by the Legislature and it applies in all such cases. Third, there are still two weeks to go before trial and the Court resources will not necessarily be wasted. Therefore, there are insufficient factors in this case to create the necessary exceptional circumstances that would warrant leave.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 02/20 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by PSIS Limited (ìPSISî). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 5, CE 1(1)(a), CE 1(1)(b), the definition of ìdividendsî in section CF 2(1), and the definition of ìinterestî in section OB 1. This Ruling does not consider how (if at all) section HF 1 applies to or affects the Arrangement. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is that PSIS will charge account holders monthly transaction fees, subject to terms and conditions which state that account holders will be exempt from transaction fees where they meet certain stated criteria. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.PSIS operates as a financial services organisation, offering depositors interest bearing accounts and borrowers interest bearing loans. 2.In January 1996, PSIS introduced transaction fees because it had small or low activity deposit accounts whose transaction and maintenance costs exceeded the benefit or advantage that PSIS gained from these accounts. 3.The fees were introduced to discourage account holders from undertaking multiple small transactions as the processing of these transactions was a significant cost to PSIS on an annualised basis. Account holders who undertake a certain level of business with PSIS (referred to as ìvalued customersî) are not liable for these fees. This policy is in line with a number of PSISís competitors, being the major trading banks. 4.Under PSISís company constitution there is a requirement that all account holders subscribe for a single share in PSIS. Accordingly, all account holders are shareholders of PSIS. 5.Presently, PSIS applies transaction fees to the following transactions (set out in the Fees Brochure, dated July 2002): Transaction type AT M -withdrawal -balance enquiry -declined withdrawal Bill payment -electronic -telephone banking -internet banking EFTPOS -purchase/withdrawal -decline purchase/withdrawal Cash withdrawal Direct debit External automatic payment Personal cheque withdrawal Transfer withdrawal 6 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) 6.However, the following categories of account holders are exempt from transaction fees: (a) account holders who maintain deposit account balances at minimum monthly levels (where the balance is held in one account or more of any account types). The minimum levels are: ïCurrent account(s)$500 ïCurrent account(s) with personal cheque facility$1,000 ïSavings account(s)$2,000 ïTerm deposit(s) and bond account(s)$5,000 ïCapital note(s)$2,500 ïLoan(s) (excludes Creditline and Overdraft balances and limits, see Fees Brochure Notes, no. 2)$50,000 The transaction fee exemptions apply to one or more account types associated with one customer/membership number (Fees Brochure Notes, no 1). For the purposes of the fee exemption, a month runs from the 26 th day of a calendar month to the 25 th day of the following calendar month (Fees Brochure Notes, no. 3), or (b) account holders who are 65 years or older (from the month following the 65 th birthday); or (c) account holders who have their New Zealand Superannuation Retirement Income or Veterans pension credited, in full, to a PSIS account; or (d) account holders under 18 years of age who elect to have restricted account use as determined by PSIS (i.e. deposits, cash and cheque withdrawals, ATM and EFTPOS facilities). Fees will be charged from the month following the account holders 18 th birthday; (e) account holders who are full-time tertiary students, 18 years or older undertaking a course with a minimum duration of one year (the customer must present their current student identification card to qualify and continue to present a current student identification card at the beginning of each academic year to renew the exemption (see Fees Brochure Notes, no. 4)). 7.PSIS keeps a running monthly total of prima facie transaction charges. No charges are made until the 25th of each month. At this stage, the decision as to whether account holders meet the criteria for an exemption is made. Account holders that do not meet the criteria for an exemption from transaction fees are charged monthly in arrears on the 25th of each month. 8.Where an account holder meets the criteria for an exemption set out above for a given month, the fees that are applicable to the transactions undertaken are not charged. 9.There are no other collateral contracts, agreements, terms, or conditions, written or otherwise, that have a bearing on the conclusions reached in this ruling. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)the current commercial rate of interest is paid by PSIS in respect of all its accounts, regardless of whether any benefit or advantage is given to particular account holders in terms of an exemption from transaction fees, and b)the criteria for the exemption from transaction fees are not dependent on the account holderís status as a shareholder of PSIS. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, and the qualification in respect of section HF 1, under the heading ìTaxation Lawsî, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïThe benefit of being exempt from transaction fees is not gross income of those account holders under section CD 5. ïSuch benefits are not interest under section CE 1(1)(a) or (b). ïSuch benefits are not dividends under section CF 2(1). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 31st day of October 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 02/21 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Fletcher Challenge Forests Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: Section CD 3; Section CD 4; Section CD 5. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the consolidation of every five existing ordinary and preference shares of Fletcher Challenge Forests Ltd (ìFCFî) into one such ordinary and preference share respectively pursuant to the authorisation conferred by clause 2.12 of the Constitution of FCF and: (i)implemented by a resolution passed by the Board of FCF on 13 November 2002; and (ii) a consequential amendment to FCFís Constitution being approved by a special resolution passed at the annual meeting of shareholders of FCF on 13 November. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.FCF has the following two classes of share on issue: ï929,507,897 ordinary shares; and ï1,859,015,794 preference shares. The ordinary shares were issued both before and after 1 July 1994, the commencement date of the Companies Act 1993, and the preference shares were issued and placed over the period December 2000 to March 2001. 2.Currently the available subscribed capital of the ordinary shares totals $979,362,685 (or $1.0536 per share). As at 1 July 1994, the commencement date of the Companies Act 1993, that available subscribed capital was $489,871,903. At present the available subscribed capital of the preference shares total is $487,253,948 (or $0.2621 per share). 3.FCF has re-registered under the Companies Act 1993. The terms of the preference shares (set out in clauses 2.2 and 2.3 of the Constitution of FCF) are as follows: 2.2Rights of Existing Preference Shares Subject to clause 2.3, each Preference Share existing at the date of adoption of this Constitution confers on the holders, in addition to the rights set out elsewhere in this Constitution and the Act (except where such rights are negated, altered or added by this Constitution) the same rights, and ranks equally with, the Ordinary Shares and holders of Preference Shares will vote with the holders of Ordinary Shares on all matters except on a vote relating to a liquidation of the Company, in which case a separate vote of the holders of Preference Shares will be required. 2.3Rights of Shares in the Event of Liquidation In addition to the rights set out in clause 2.1 and, in the event of liquidation of the Company, clause 2.2 (a) the Preference Shares rank ahead (to the amount of NZ$0.25 per Preference Share) of the Ordinary Shares. (b) the Ordinary Shares will be entitled to the next NZ$0.25 per Ordinary Share, and (c) thereafter, holders of Preference Shares and Ordinary Shares will share equally in any remaining surplus. On 15 December 2005 (the fifth anniversary of the first allotment of the preference shares as a class) the preference rights on liquidation attached to the preference shares will lapse and the preference shares will automatically convert to ordinary shares: clause 2.4 of the Constitution. 4.The ordinary and preference shares of FCF are listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (ìthe Stock Exchangeî) and the Australian Stock Exchange. The ordinary shares and the preference shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ìthe NYSEî) in the US where they are listed and traded in the form of American Depository Receipts (ìADRsî). Each ADR represents 10 ordinary or preference shares of FCF, conferring on the holder the appropriate dividend, voting and other shareholder entitlements commensurate with the underlying shares and administered through the depositary of the ADR programme. 5.It is a condition of listing on the NYSE that shares must have a minimum share price of $US1 over a 30-day trading period. The requirement is applicable to the ADRs. The trading range of the shares of FCF in recent times has been such that there has been a breach of this requirement. On 22 January 2002 the NYSE notified FCF of the breach and required FCF to take steps to cure the deficiency or be subject to suspension or delisting procedures. 8 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) 6.The board of FCF proposes to consolidate the shares of the company in order to ensure compliance with listing requirements of the NYSE. The depositary of the ADR programme will undertake a consequential consolidation of the ADRs such that the ADR:share ratio remains 1:10. FCF considers that with fewer shares on issue, and the consequential consolidation of the ADRs, there should be compliance with the requirement that the ADR share price must not fall below $US1 per share. A further reason for the consolidation is that the current share price gives rise to large percentage swings for each one cent of price movement and is not market efficient because swings in the share price create too big a hurdle for many buyers and sellers, essentially creating illiquidity. 7.Under clause 2.12 of its Constitution, the board of FCF has the power to consolidate and divide or subdivide, all or any of its shares (whether of one or more classes). ìShareî is defined in the Annexure to the Constitution as follows: an Ordinary Share or a Preference Share as the case may be 8.The board proposes to pass a resolution which will have the effect that all existing ordinary shares and all existing preference shares of FCF will be consolidated. The draft of the directorsí resolution (including the preamble) reads as follows: Noted: Subject to shareholder approval of the consequential amendment to the Companyís constitution, the Board proposes to consolidate the ordinary and preference shares of the Company on a five-for-one basis and, consistent with New Zealand market practice, fractional entitlements following the consolidation will be rounded up to the nearest whole number. The consolidation is intended primarily to ensure that the Companyís American Depositary Receipt (ìADRî) programme complies with the New York Stock Exchange quantitative continuous listing standard that requires the average closing price of the Companyís American Depositary Shares (ìADSsî) to be not less than US$1.00 over a consecutive 30-day trading period. The share consolidation, taken together with the consequential consolidation of the ADSs, should result in an increase in the market price of the ADSs to a level that remedies the breach of the New York Stock Exchangeís quantitative listing standard. In consolidating the ordinary and preference shares, the ordinary ADSs and Series A ADSs ratios of 1 ordinary ADS or Series A ADS for every 10 underlying securities will remain unchanged. The effect of the consolidation is therefore to require a five for one consolidation of the ordinary ADSs and Series A ADSs. Consistent with United States market practice and in line with the terms of the deposit agreement governing the Companyís ADS programme in similar circumstances, Citibank, N.A. (as depositary) has advised that it will round down any fractional entitlements to an ordinary ADS or Series A ADS following the consolidation of the ordinary ADSs and Series A ADSs to the nearest whole number. Citibank, N.A. will sell the underlying securities represented by those fractional entitlements, and the proceeds paid to the relevant holder. Citibank, N.A., as holder of the Companyís shares that underlie the ADR programme, will have those shares consolidated in the same manner as each other shareholder in the Company. If approved by shareholders at the Companyís annual shareholdersí meeting, following the consolidation, clause 2.3 of the constitution of the Company will be amended to maintain the current entitlements of the preference shareholders on liquidation of the Company. Resolved: 1. Subject to the approval by special resolution of the amendments to clause 2.3 of the Companyís constitution, pursuant to the power conferred on the Board by clause 2.12 of the constitution of the Company, with effect from 5.00 pm (New Zealand time) on \[29\] November 2002 (the Record Time): (a)All existing ordinary and preference shares of the Company are consolidated on a five-for-one basis such that every five ordinary shares and every five preference shares in the Company registered in the name of a shareholder at the Record Time will be consolidated into one ordinary or preference share in the Company respectively, with the intent that: (i)all existing rights, privileges and restrictions attaching to the existing ordinary and preference shares of the Company continue in existence and remain unaltered; (ii)each of the shares shall remain fully paid and the amount of subscribed capital attributable to each ordinary and preference share shall remain the same; and (iii) the consolidation is merely a reformatting of all existing ordinary and preference shares and is not a cancellation of existing shares followed by a new issue of shares. (b)If, in effecting the consolidation referred to in paragraph (a) above, a holder of ordinary shares or preference shares in the Company does not have a number of ordinary shares or preference shares exactly divisible by five, in calculating the number of shares held by such holder following consolidation, a fraction of a share will be rounded up to the nearest whole number. 2. That any one of the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer or the Company Secretary be authorised to execute and deliver on behalf of the 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) Company (whether before or after the date of these resolutions) any requests, notices or other communications, and to take any such action on behalf of the Company as may be contemplated by, or necessary or expedient under or in connection with, the consolidation approved in resolution 1, including the giving of instructions to the Companyís share registrar to record the consequential changes to the Companyís share register. 9.The Board has considered the substance of the consolidation. It is intended that this matter will be part of the business at a meeting of the board on 13 November 2002 and at the annual general meeting of shareholders, which is also to be held on that date. 10. The objective of the consolidation is that, as from \[29 November 2002\], every five ordinary shares and every five preference shares presently held by a shareholder will be consolidated into one such ordinary share or preference share, as the case may be. In respect of the holders of ADRs the number of ADRs on issue will be consolidated on a one for five basis to enable the American Depository Receipt ratio of ten shares in the company per ADR to remain unchanged. 11. If a holder of ordinary or preference shares does not have a number of ordinary shares or preference shares exactly divisible by five, in calculating the number of shares to be held by such a holder following the consolidation, a fraction of a share will be rounded up to the nearest whole number. On the basis of the share register as at 31 July 2002 and assuming a share price of 22 cents for both classes of shares and an average rounding of 0.5 of a share for each shareholder with a shareholding not divisible by five, the rounded-up fractions of post-consolidation shares would result in an additional post-consolidation: ï24,228 ordinary shares; and ï12,078 preference shares. In such circumstances the total dollar value of the rounding to shareholders would be $19,967 (36,306 x $1.10 x 50%). This represents 0.00325% of FCFís current market value. On the basis that the pre-consolidation shares convert post-consolidation into 185,901,579 ordinary shares and 371,803,158 preference shares the percentage change in shareholding as a result of rounding up would be: 0.00261% for ordinary shares and 0.00085% for preference shares (total 0.00130%). An affected shareholder will be conferred with an ìadditionî to shareholding ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 of a share. (In other words, as rounding up will be required only where a shareholder holds a number of shares which is not equally divisible by five, no shareholder will receive more than 0.8 of a share as a consequence of the rounding up.) FCF were advised by its financial advisors, First NZ Capital Group Ltd, to round up fractions. First NZ advised that although this would favour some shareholders over others, based on a share price of $0.25, the maximum differential between shareholders would be only $1 per shareholder. 12. Implementation of the five-for-one consolidation will require the appropriate adjustment of the 25 cent preferences. Under the existing share count a preference shareholder has a total preference of $1.25 for every five shares. If parity is to be maintained the preference needs to be consequentially adjusted to $1.25 for every share under the consolidation share count. 13. The rights associated with the preference shares are incorporated in the Constitution, which may be amended only by a special resolution passed by shareholders in general meeting. Under section 32(2) of the Companies Act the power to alter the Constitution is vested in the shareholders of FCF. 14. Therefore, in conjunction with the proposed board resolution and in order to complete the implementation of the consolidation, shareholders will be asked to pass a special resolution at the annual meeting of shareholders (on 13 November 2002) to amend the Constitution of FCF. The amendment will increase the preference in liquidation from 25 cents per share to $1.25 per share. A draft of the shareholdersí resolution reads as follows: That, with effect from the date the shares in the Company are consolidated on a one for five basis pursuant to a resolution of the Board of the Company, the constitution of the Company be amended by deleting the two references to ìNZ$0.25î in clause 2.3 and replacing them with ìNZ$1.25î. If the resolution is approved by the shareholders, the Effective Time will be 29 November 2002. 15. The directorsí resolution and the shareholdersí resolution are effectively subject to favourable binding rulings being given in respect of the consolidation. FCF desires to have certainty on its ASC position. 16. If the shareholders do not approve the proposed amendment to the Constitution or if binding rulings satisfactory to the company are not given, the Board intends, as soon as is practicable, to alter the number of the companyís shares represented by each ADR so that each ADR would represent 50 underlying shares. This should remedy the breach of the NYSE quantitative continuous listing standard. Any alteration to the number of the companyís shares represented by each ADR, using this method of consolidation, will only affect the holders of ADRs. 10 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) 17. FCF recognises that it will need to advise the various stock exchanges of the proposed consolidation. For example, the New Zealand Stock Exchange Listing Rules (the Listing Rules) require that any proposal to consolidate shares must be notified to the Stock Exchange as soon as the information is first available: section 10.8.1. In addition an appendix 7 notice concerning ìnotice of event affecting securitiesî will need to be given to the Stock Exchange no later than 10 business days prior to record date. FCF is not expecting to be required to give the Stock Exchange notice of the cancellation of securities in accordance with section 7.12.1 of the Listing Rules because no securities will be cancelled. The Australian Stock Exchange requires reciprocal notification of all matters notified to the New Zealand Stock Exchange. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: ïThe resolutions passed by the Board and the shareholders of FCF are not materially different from draft resolutions set out in this ruling. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïThe consolidation does not result in a sale or disposition for the purpose of sections CD 3, CD 4 or CD 5. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 8 November 2002 to 31 March 2003. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8 th day of November 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) NEW LEGISLATION STUDENT LOAN SCHEME ñ REPAYMENT AND INTEREST WRITE-OFF THRESHOLDS FOR 2003-04 The student loan scheme repayment threshold, which sets the income level at which compulsory repayments begin, will increase from its current level of $15,496 to $15,964 for the 2003-04 income year. The student loan scheme interest write-off threshold, which sets the level of income that part-time or part-year students may have and still be entitled to a full interest write-off, will increase from its current level of $25,378 to $25,909 for the 2003-04 income year. The student loan scheme repayment and interest write-off thresholds are based on the amount of the domestic purposes benefit payable to a person with two or more children. The repayment threshold is aligned to the gross amount of the benefit, rounded up so that it is divisible into whole dollars on a weekly basis, and the interest write-off threshold is aligned to the amount of other income at which the benefit is fully abated. These thresholds are reviewed annually in December each year and are set on the basis of the amount that it is projected will be payable from 1 April of the following year. Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2002 and Student Loan Scheme (Income Amount for Full Interest Write-off) Regulations 2002 12 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, and livestock values. GENERAL DEPRECIATION DETERMINATION DEP48 ñ PRINTS (INCLUDING LIMITED EDITION PRINTS), PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS A General Depreciation Determination has been issued that inserts into the industry categories ìHotels, motels, restaurants, cafÈs, taverns and takeaway barsî, ìResidential rental property chattelsî and ìShopsî, and into the asset category ìOffice equipment and furnitureî, in the appropriate alphabetical order, the following asset classes: General asset classEstimate DV banded SL equiv useful life depín ratebanded (years)(%)dep'n rate (%) Paintings and drawings,209.56.5 in either case being property which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value Prints (including limited101812.5 edition prints) The new depreciation determination also consequentially deletes the asset class ìPrintsî from the industry category ìHotels, motels, restaurants, cafÈs, taverns and takeaway barsî. The rate for ìPrints (including limited edition prints)î is the same as the deleted rate for prints. The reference to limited edition prints is intended to avoid any doubt. The general asset class ìPaintings and drawings, in either case being property which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in valueî is a new introduction. It encompasses works (including painted or drawn reproductions) in a variety of media and on a variety of substrates. The qualification ìÖ, in either case being property which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in valueî is, strictly, unnecessary in that it merely paraphrases a legislative requirement that must be satisfied in any case. However comments on the exposure draft of this determination indicated concern that ìPaintings and drawingsî (the asset class description originally proposed) would encompass much property that would not reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value when used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. It was suggested that the proposed description might mislead some taxpayers into claiming depreciation deductions in respect of paintings and drawings that are not depreciable property. The qualification is intended as an aid to compliance for any user of the determination (and of published tables based on it) who might not be familiar with the relevant tax law. There might be circumstances where expert advice on whether property might be expected to decline in use will be useful in deciding whether the definition of ìdepreciable propertyî is met. However in the normal course it is not reasonable to expect property to decline in value when used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income if its value is significantly affected by: ïIts artistic qualities; or ïIts collectability due to its rarity, antiquity, or association with a person, place or event, or any other reason and these characteristics are not diminished in the use of the property. It was suggested that providing a depreciation rate for paintings and drawings will increase compliance and administrative costs, as taxpayers and the Commissioner may find it necessary to take expert advice if disputes should arise. This possibility is acknowledged. However it is a consequence of the availability of the depreciation allowance and more particularly of the annual accounting cycle in which depreciation deductions are available. The intention of the legislature would be frustrated if the Commissioner were to attempt to deny the depreciation allowance by declining to determine an annual depreciation rate for such property. The possibility of such costs was implicitly acknowledged in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 9 (September 1998), which said in relation to original paintings that ìa valuation opinion may be sought to independently and objectively satisfy the test of whether an item is depreciable property or not under section OB 1î. However it is expected that instances where expert opinion is required will be very rare if the factors referred to above are taken into account. Determination DEP48: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 48 applies to ìdepreciable propertyî other than ìexcluded depreciable propertyî for the 2002/2003 and subsequent income years. The Commissionerís views expressed in the earlier article 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) ìPrints and original paintingsî in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 9 (September 1998) dealt with the law, including depreciation determinations, that applied at that time. Those views do not apply for the 2002/2003 and subsequent income years. The determination is reproduced below.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 14 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) LEGAL DECISIONS ñ CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. Weíve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. LEGAL FEES PARTIALLY INCURRED FOR PRINCIPAL PURPOSE, NO ARRANGEMENT IN PLACE, INCOME NOT RETURNED, SHORTFALL PENALTIES FOR EVASION AND LACK OF REASONABLE CARE Case:TRA19/2002 Decision date:22 October 2002 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:input credit, legal fees, shortfall penalties, evasion, lack of reasonable care, PAYE, income, arrangement Summary The taxpayerís challenge sought an input credit for legal fees, that shortfall penalties not be imposed, and asserted an arrangement was in place. Challenge failed for the most part: held to have failed to return income; some legal fees incurred for principal purpose of making taxable supplies, and others for defending taxpayer from a crime; evasion shortfall penalty imposed for failing to account for PAYE; and lack of reasonable care shortfall penalty imposed for failing to return income. Facts At the relevant times, the taxpayer was practising as a chartered accountant. There were five issues: 1.The taxpayer had prepared tax returns for four clients, and as a result of Police investigation, was charged under the Crimes Act 1961. The taxpayer engaged a lawyer to defend those charges. The taxpayer was convicted of all eight charges. He appealed the convictions, but the appeal was dismissed. The taxpayer claimed an input credit for the legal fees in his GST returns. 2.The taxpayer was registered as an employer with the Commissioner. Payments of PAYE were dishonoured and an investigation identified discrepancies. The Commissioner sought to impose a shortfall penalty for evasion. The taxpayer argued his cashflow problems were due to the Commissioner withholding the above GST refund claim, as well as incurring legal fees to assist clients with fraud charges, and a matrimonial severance which prevented him from accessing capital. 3.The parties had endeavoured to enter into an arrangement. The taxpayer made various payments, arguing they were made to ensure an arrangement was in place and thus enable penalties to be remitted. The Commissioner argued the proposed arrangement required all outstanding tax returns to be filed, which did not happen. 4.The taxpayer was registered for GST on an invoice basis and failed to return amounts invoiced to clients. The taxpayer argued he had written these off as bad debts, and had not actually invoiced them. 5.The Commissioner sought to impose a shortfall penalty for gross carelessness, and in the alternative, for lack of reasonable care in preparing his tax return for that period. Decision 1.Legal fees His Honour found the taxpayer had been obliged to incur at least half the legal fees for the protection of his reputation and business as a chartered accountant. His Honour did not think the fees paid to protect the taxpayerís business and/or business reputation were too indirect to be a business GST input, but also found that fees paid to defend the taxpayer from a crime cannot have the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) 2.Evasion His Honour held a shortfall penalty for evasion (in respect of PAYE) under section 141E was payable (less 75% reduction already allowed by the CIR). His Honour found the taxpayer knew the PAYE was outstanding, had not, and did not make any attempt to pay the outstanding PAYE (other than the application of a tax credit to part of the debt), and applied the PAYE deductions for a purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner. There had been no cause beyond the taxpayerís control which led to his failure to account for PAYE. His Honour confirmed again that the amount of every tax deduction made under the PAYE rules must be held in trust by the employer for the Crown; the money is no longer that of the employer. 3.Arrangement His Honour found there was no arrangement: The Commissioner had a clear policy requiring outstanding returns to be filed before an arrangement can be entered into and to ensure that any such arrangement remains valid. The taxpayer was found to have not complied with his obligations, to have failed to meet those conditions. 4.Income not returned His Honour found the additional income had not been not returned. While sections 25 and 26 of the GST Act 1985 allow for credit notes to be issued and bad debts to be written off, the taxpayer was unable to satisfy the evidential requirements of those sections that he had done so in respect of the income not returned. Credit notes had not been issued and there were no grounds on which the Commissioner could determine credit notes were not required. His Honour reiterated that while there is no one formula for writing off a bad debt, there needs to be evidence the debts have actually been written off. 5.Lack of reasonable care Shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care payable. His Honour found there could not be gross carelessness where an accountant, under the pressures being experienced by the taxpayer, thought he did not need to return income which he did not intend to collect and which he knew would not be recovered. However, His Honour found this amounted to not taking reasonable care and took into account that the taxpayer is an experienced accountant from whom one would expect good accounting and record keeping practices (more so than of other individuals). This decision has not been appealed. TAX AVOIDANCE CORRECTLY ADDRESSED AND COMMISSIONERíS ASSESSMENT CONFIRMED Case:Dandelion Investments Limited v CIR Decision date:5 December 2002 Act:Section 99 Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:tax avoidance, scope of administrative law issues in proceedings at the TRA Summary Unsuccessful appeal by taxpayer. Court of Appeal affirmed the Commissionerís assessment based on application section 99. Administrative law issues on objection limited to showing assessment incorrect. Hearing before the TRA cures any procedural defects. If the assessment is correct, alleged procedural defects by the Commissioner of no importance. Scope of administrative law inquiries limited by the objection. TRA cannot enter into a quasi-judicial review ìfishing expeditionî in the guise of administrative law enquiry. Facts This was an appeal by the taxpayer for the judgment of Tompkins J at the High Court (reported (2001) 20 NZTC 17,293) which was a successful appeal by the CIR from the TRA (reported Case U11 (1999) NZTC 9,100) In the 1986 tax year the taxpayer paid interest of $570,080 on a loan to enable a subsidiary to acquire shares. By means of a circular flow of money the taxpayer received back (tax-free) some $484,000. The taxpayer claimed a deduction of $570,080. The Commissioner applied section 99 to disallow the deduction. The taxpayer objected and was successful at the TRA before Willy J on the basis of an alleged flawed process of re-assessment and on time bar (the TRA did accept the existence of a tax avoidance scheme). The Commissioner successfully appealed to the High Court. The taxpayer appealed to the Court of Appeal Decision The Court of Appeal rejected the appeal. 1.McGrath J giving judgment for the Court noted that the issue of the taxpayerís ability to object being constrained by the Commissionerís failure to prove the grounds of assessment was outside the scope of the appeal as the framing of the objection was not before the High Court on appeal and thus not before the Court of Appeal (par 53 to 54) 16 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) But he went on to consider the matter in obiter comments. On the facts it was considered the taxpayer had been able to frame an effective objection (para 59). It was considered that any defects in the Commissionerís assessment and objection processes had been cured by the extensive hearing before the TRA (para 60 to 63). 2.On the time bar issue the Court considered that Hyslop v CIR \[2001\] 2 NZLR 329 at par 20 established that it was not necessary for a taxpayer to receive a notice of assessment prior to the time bar for the assessment to be valid (para 71). The Court further rejected the suggestion that the notice (dated 26 March 1991) had been fraudulently backdated noting there was no evidence to support the allegation (para 71). 3. The Court rejected the taxpayerís reliance on the Commissionerís Policy Statement on section 99 (ìCPSî) referring to the Privy Council in OíNeil (2001) 20 NZTC 17,051 (para 73-74). The Court also rejected that the CPS raised any legitimate expectation that it would be followed saying that there was ìlimited scope for application of the principles of legitimate expectation to confine the Commissioner in the exercise of statutory duties in relation to assessment functionsî (at para 75). 4.The Court rejected the suggestion that the arrangement was not one for tax avoidance. It considered the test of arrangement in CIR v BNZI had been met (para 77). It rejected suggestions that the arrangement was a normal business transaction or that the Commissioner had failed to tax other parties to the arrangement saying of the latter that the liability to tax of other parties was ìhighly speculativeî and lacking any bearing on the question of the purpose of the arrangement. (at para 83). The Court concluded: ìin reality there was no true business purpose to be achieved by the appellant in entering into the transaction other than to obtain the benefit of a deductionÖof $570,080Ö which was to be offset by a tax free dividend receipt of $484,000î (at para 85). The Court considered this to be tax avoidance. An argument by the taxpayer that the Commissionerís use of section 99(3) to remove the deduction from the taxpayer was invalid because some other adjustment under section 99(4) had not been done was also rejected as the Court did not accept the adjustment contended for was necessary (at para 86). Finally the Court took the opportunity to remind the TRA of the scope of its jurisdiction: ìAs we have said the function of the Authority was to hear and determine the objection disallowed by the Commissioner by conducting a fresh hearing into the matters raised in the objection, in which questions of validity as well as correctness of the assessment could be considered. But the Authorityís role remained one which was concerned with the correctness of the assessment. It did not extend to conducting what was effectively a broad based judicial review of the process leading up to the Commissionerís assessment and disallowance of the objection and subsequent conduct of the proceeding before the Authorityî (para 90). A general overview of the distinction between judicial review and the statutory objection process was made (par 91 to 94) with the Court observing that the power to consider validity issues in the statutory process did not justify a ìfishing expeditionî into Department process and concluded: ìIn the course of the statutory procedure the administrative decisions of the Commissioner are challenged in a manner that enables the correct decision on the taxpayerís liability to prevail, if necessary through the appeal process. In the end, if it is determined that the taxpayer was initially assessed by a genuine exercise of judgment as to the assessable income and, ultimately, was correctly assessed, the respective principles underlying the statutory review scheme and judicial review are in harmony. Importantly, as well, the integrity of the tax system in the eyes of the public is maintainedî (at para 94). 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) MORTGAGEE SALES Case:Christchurch Readymix Concrete Ltd v Rob Mitchell Builder Ltd (in liquidation) Decision date:17 December 2001 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act Keywords:GST liquidation mortgagee debt agency Summary The Court held that the proceeds of the sale of property by a mortgaged registered person, which is commenced by the mortgagee and completed by a liquidator, are to be paid to the mortgagee, minus costs of sale. GST is not a cost of sale in such circumstances as section 42 of the GST Act gives it a specific ranking. Facts The liquidators of the defendant company, Rob Mitchell Builders Ltd (ìRMBî) applied to the court for directions as to the ownership of the balance of proceeds of sale of a property at Taylors Mistake Rd, Christchurch (ìthe propertyî). The Commissioner was invited by the court to be heard in the proceedings and elected to do so. RMB was a registered person carrying on business as a builder. The property was owned by RMB and accounted for in its financial records as stock. By agreement for sale and purchase dated 27 February 2002, RMB agreed to sell the property for $430,000 incl. GST. The agreement became unconditional on 2 April 2002 and a deposit was paid by the purchaser and applied for the benefit of the company. On 15 April 2002, RMB was placed in liquidation by the plaintiff (who took no part in the proceedings). The sale was settled on 1 May 2002, with the mortgagee giving a discharge of first mortgage to allow the sale to proceed. Insufficient funds were available from the settlement to repay both the first mortgagee and the GST component of the sale. The liquidators considered they had an obligation to account for GST to the CIR whereas the bank considered the entire proceeds after real estate agents costs, solicitorsí costs and rates, to be due to the bank. The GST of $47,777 was held in trust by agreement between the parties to allow settlement to proceed. The liquidators then brought these proceedings under section 284 of the Companies Act 1993. Decision The bank argued that as the agreement became unconditional and a deposit was paid prior to liquidation, the supply is deemed by the GST Act to have been made by RMB, with the liquidators merely effecting settlement. As such, the liquidators were not liable to pay GST on the sale (section 58 (1D) GST Act) and the bank was entitled to apply the entire proceeds of sale in repayment of its mortgage. The Commissioner argued that the obligation to pay GST (as opposed to when the liability arises) occurs at the end of a taxable period, in this case, the date of liquidation. As however, the matter was then in the hands of the liquidators, the supply could not continue until the liquidator so decided. Upon liquidation, a companyís secured creditors have three options under section 305 Companies Act 1993: ïrealise the property ïvalue it and claim in liquidation for the balance due, or ïsurrender it for the benefit of all creditors and claim in liquidation for the debt. The bank made no claim in liquidation and the Commissioner submitted that it had therefore realised the property by agency of the liquidator. It was submitted that, as such, the supply is deemed to be by the principal, and the bank or the liquidators were required to file a return under section 17(1) GST Act. Venning J reviewed the scheme of the GST Act carefully, noting that: ïGST is a statutory liability that accrues pursuant to the Act. ïGST is not a portion of the price, but is calculated by reference to that price. ïGST is not a sum held in trust, but is a debt due to the Crown. ïA GST debt owed by a company in liquidation has a priority set by the Seventh Schedule to the Companies Act 1993 (ìthe Seventh Scheduleî). His Honour dismissed the Commissionerís argument that, but for the liquidation, RMB would have accounted for GST to the Commissioner and only the balance of the proceeds would have been available to the bank. He noted that the bank was always entitled to full repayment and that, in practice, had the bank not provided the necessary discharge to allow the sale to proceed, settlement would not have occurred and ìthere would have been no money payable to the Commissioner for GSTî. His Honour also rejected the Commissionerís argument that the liability to pay the GST did not arise until the end of the GST period: ìAlthough the amount of tax payable for the period could not be calculated until the end of the period, the liability to pay GST in respect of the sale of the Taylors Mistake property arose on the \[deemed\] supply of the goods, which occurred on 3 April 2002.î \[prior to the liquidation\] 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) The crux of the Courtís decision was the finding that the liquidators were not acting as the bankís agent in completing the sale. At the point of liquidation, equity in the property had passed to the purchasers and the company was left with bare legal title and an interest in personalty. This meant that the liquidator was from that point on only responsible for the GST on supplies made after the date of liquidation (section 58(1D)) and as the supply in dispute was prior to the liquidation, it became a GST debt caught by the ranking provisions of section 42 of the GST Act. The Commissionerís argument that the GST was also a necessary disbursement of the liquidators was dismissed in like fashion. The Commissioner relied on the House of Lords decision Re Toshoku Finance UK plc (in liq) \[2002\] 1 WLR 671 (HL), as being analogous to the present matter. His Honour noted the distinguishing feature as being that the corporation tax at issue in Toshoku ìÖwas not specifically included in the relevant statutory list of claims to be paid in priority.î GST on the other hand is given a post-liquidation ranking by section 42(2)(b) in accordance with the Seventh Schedule. Having found that the sale was made by the mortgagor pre-liquidation, the section 104 LTA ìexpense occasioned by saleî argument was also dismissed as it related only to sales made by or on behalf of a mortgagee. Similarly, the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Edgewater Motels was not relevant. 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) REGULAR FEATURES DUE DATES REMINDER February 2003 5Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 7End-of-year income tax 7 February 2003, 2002 end-of-year income tax due for people and organisations with a March balance date and who do not have an agent 20Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or ( IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 28GST and return payment due March 2003 5Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 7Provisional tax instalments due for people and organisations with a March balance date 20Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or ( IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 31GST and return payment due These dates are taken from Inland Revenueís Smart business tax due date calendar 2002 - 2003 20 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) 21 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 1 (January 2003) YOUR CHANCE TO COMMENT ON DRAFT TAXATION ITEMS BEFORE THEY ARE FINALISED This page shows the draft binding rulings, interpretation statements, standard practice statements and other items that we now have available for your review.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz NETHERLANDS SOCIAL SECURITY PENSIONS ñ TAXATION WHEN THE RECIPIENT IS A NEW ZEALAND RESIDENT PUBLIC RULING ñ BR PUB 03/01 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 98/6 which was published in TIB Vol 10, No 12, December 1998. BR Pub 98/6 applied until 30 November 2001. This new ruling takes into account minor changes in legislation since BR Pub 98/6 was published. Its period of application is from 1 December 2001 to 30 November 2006. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (ìthe Actî), and to the Double Tax Convention between the Netherlands and New Zealand, which appears in the Schedule to the Double Taxation Relief (Netherlands) Order 1981, S.R. 1981/43 (ìthe Double Tax Conventionî). This Ruling applies in respect of Article 19(2) of the Double Tax Convention. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the periodic payment of a Netherlands social security pension to a person who is a resident of New Zealand for tax purposes. This person may be a national of the Netherlands, or of New Zealand, or of both countries. For the purposes of this Ruling the word ìnationalî has the meanings attributed to it by Article 3, paragraph 1.h of the Double Tax Convention. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: ïWhen a New Zealand tax resident receives a Netherlands social security pension, and that person is also a New Zealand citizen, the pension is taxable only in New Zealand. ïWhen a New Zealand tax resident, who is not a New Zealand citizen, receives a Netherlands social security pension, the pension may be subject to tax in both the Netherlands and New Zealand, with the Commissioner giving a credit for tax paid in the Netherlands in accordance with New Zealandís foreign tax credit rules. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 December 2001 to 30 November 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 24th day of January 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 5 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 03/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 03/01 (ìthe Rulingî). Background Confusion has arisen as to the New Zealand tax treatment of social security pensions paid by the Netherlands Government to people living in New Zealand. Some taxpayers believe that the pensions are not taxable in New Zealand if the recipients are not New Zealand citizens. This ruling clarifies New Zealandís jurisdiction to tax pensions paid by the Netherlands, including when New Zealandís right to do so is an exclusive right. Legislation Section BD 1(2) states: An amount is not gross income of a taxpayer if it is Ö (c)a foreign-sourced amount and the taxpayer is a non-resident when it is derived. Article 19(2) of the Double Taxation Convention reads as follows: a.Any pension paid by, or out of funds created by, one of the States or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority and any pension paid to an individual under the social security scheme of one of the States, may be taxed in that State. b.However, such pension shall be taxable only in the State of which the individual is a resident if he is a national of that State. Article 3(1)(h) defines the term ìnationalî to mean: 1.in the case of the Netherlands, any individual possessing the nationality of the Netherlands, and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in the Netherlands; 2.in the case of New Zealand, any individual possessing citizenship of New Zealand and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in New Zealand. Article X of the Protocol to the Double Tax Convention states: X. With reference to Articles 18 and 19 It is understood that the term ìpensions and other similar remunerationî includes only periodical payments. Application of the Legislation Under the Income Tax Act 1994, persons who are resident in New Zealand are subject to New Zealand tax on their worldwide income. Double Tax Conventions and Agreements with other countries override the Income Tax Act and determine which country has jurisdiction to tax the income in question. Among other issues the Double Tax Convention between the Netherlands and New Zealand determines the tax treatment of periodic pensions paid by an organisation in one country to residents of the other country. Article 18 of the Double Tax Convention sets out which country has the jurisdiction to tax pensions paid by one country to the residents of the other country. This article, however, does not apply to pensions paid out: ïunder social security schemes, or ïfor services rendered to the country paying the pension. Article 19 deals with these two classes of pension. Article 19(2) states that a social security pension may be taxed by the country from which it is paid but the pension shall be taxed only in the country in which the recipient of the pension is resident if the recipient is also a national of the country of residence. Therefore, a social security pension paid to a New Zealand tax resident who is also a national of New Zealand may be taxed only in New Zealand. However, if the recipient is a New Zealand tax resident but is not a New Zealand citizen, New Zealand will not have an exclusive right to tax the pension. In those circumstances the Double Tax Convention does not restrict either the Netherlands or New Zealand from taxing the pension and the pension could be taxed in both the Netherlands and New Zealand under their domestic law. Persons who are not New Zealand citizens and have tax deducted by the Government of the Netherlands from their Netherlands social security pensions are entitled to tax credits under section LC 1. When this occurs the Commissioner will, in accordance with New Zealandís foreign tax credit rules, give the recipient a tax credit for the tax paid in the Netherlands. However, these tax credits cannot exceed the amount of tax due in New Zealand. Residence and nationality Article 4 sets out rules for determining the residence (for the purpose of the Double Tax Convention) of a person who is resident for tax purposes in both the Netherlands and New Zealand under their domestic law. The term ìnationalî in the case of New Zealand is defined in the Double Tax Convention as: Ö any individual possessing citizenship of New Zealand and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in New Zealand 6 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) (The rules determining how New Zealand citizenship is acquired are set out in the Citizenship Act 1977.) Hence, under the Double Tax Convention a person who is a citizen of New Zealand is a national of New Zealand. Accordingly, under Article 19(2)(b) New Zealand will have an exclusive right to tax a Dutch social security pension when the recipient is determined to be a New Zealand tax resident under Article 4 and is also a New Zealand citizen. (This will be so whether or not that person is also a Dutch national. In the case of dual nationality, the recipient will still satisfy the requirements of Article 19(2)(b)óNew Zealand tax residency and New Zealand citizenshipóand the additional fact of possessing Dutch nationality will not alter the conclusion that only New Zealand may tax the pension.) Liability to tax under New Zealand domestic law The Double Tax Convention need not be considered unless an amount of Netherlands pension is taxable under New Zealand domestic law. A Netherlands pension could be fully or partly exempt from tax under sections CB 5(1)(f) or CB 5(1)(fa) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section CB 5(1)(f) may apply where the New Zealand benefit payable to a Netherlands pensioner has been reduced in terms of section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964. Section CB 5(1)(fa) applies where an arrangement has been made in respect of an overseas pension under section 70(3) of the Social Security Act 1964. Section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964 applies where the recipient of a Netherlands pension is also entitled to a benefit of a similar nature under New Zealand social welfare legislation. In that event the New Zealand benefit is to be reduced by the amount of a Netherlands pension and the effect of section CB 5(1)(f) is as follows: ïWhere the amount of the New Zealand superannuation or veteranís pension payable has been reduced by the amount of a Netherlands pension under section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964, section CB 5(1)(f) does not apply. Therefore, the full amount of the Netherlands pension is taxable under New Zealand domestic law, and ïWhere an entitlement to another type of New Zealand benefit has been reduced by the amount of a Netherlands pension, the Netherlands pension is exempt income under section CB 5(1)(f) to the extent that the New Zealand benefit has been reduced. Therefore, where a deduction from a New Zealand benefit entitlement has been made under section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964 and the amount of a Netherlands pension exceeds the amount of the New Zealand benefit entitlement, the amount exceeding the New Zealand benefit entitlement is taxable under New Zealand domestic law. Under section 70(3) of the Social Security Act 1964 an arrangement may be made to pay the full amount of an overseas pension to the Chief Executive of the department responsible for administering that Act (which is currently the Department of Work and Income) in order to receive the full rate of a benefit payment under that Act, the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 or the New Zealand Superannuation Act 2001. This option is available to recipients of Netherlands pensions from 1 July 2002: Social Security (Alternative Arrangement for Overseas Pensions) Amendment Regulations 2002. Where such an arrangement is made the Netherlands pension is not taxable under New Zealand domestic law (but the equivalent amount of the New Zealand benefit would be taxable): section CB 5(1)(fa). Example 1 A taxpayer is a Dutch citizen who immigrated to New Zealand two years ago. He receives a Netherlands social security pension. He has not become a New Zealand citizen, but is a tax resident of New Zealand. Both New Zealand and the Netherlands may tax his pension. New Zealand will grant him a tax credit for the tax charged on the pension by the Netherlands. Example 2 A taxpayer also has Dutch nationality and immigrated to New Zealand five years ago. She likewise receives a Netherlands social security pension. Unlike the taxpayer in Example 1 she has become a New Zealand citizen. Only New Zealand may tax the social security pension that she receives from the Netherlands. 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 02/22 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Macquarie Financial Products Management Limited (ìthe Trusteeî). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, CG 1, CG 4, CG 5, CG 6, CG 7, CG 13, CG 15, DD 1, GB 1, OB 1, Subpart FG, and Schedules 3 and 4. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of the Macquarie Titan Trust (ìthe Titan Trustî) in accordance with the Macquarie Titan Trust Replacement Trust Deed dated 17 December 2001 (ìthe Trust Deedî), the Deed of Participation. The Macquarie Titan Trust dated 21 December 2001 (ìthe Deed of Participationî), the Macquarie Titan Trust Investment Statement (prepared as at 7 January 2002 for the purposes of the Securities Act 1978) (ìthe Investment Statementî), and the Macquarie Titan Trust Prospectus dated 19 December 2001, as amended by a Memorandum of Amendment dated 25 January 2002 (ìthe Prospectusî). Further details of the Arrangement are set out below. 1.The Titan Trust is an Australian resident unit trust established for NZ investors by the Macquarie Titan Trust Trust Deed dated 30 November 2001. The Trust Deed amended the 30 November 2001 trust deed, by restatement and addition. The Trustee is an Australian resident company. The central management and control of the Titan Trust is in Australia. The Statutory Supervisor for the Titan Trust is New Zealand Permanent Trustees Limited. 2.The Trust Deed provides the facility for there to be more than one NZ investor subscribing for ordinary units and sharing as beneficiaries under the trust in the income and gains of the Titan Trust. The income and gains of the Titan Trust will arise from investments and other property subject to the trust. Every unit has identical interests and rights, and confers on its holder an undivided beneficial interest in the property (including the income) of the Titan Trust as a whole. 3.Clause 16 of the Trust Deed provides that the Trustee will determine the investment policy of the Titan Trust, and may from time to time vary that policy, and will describe the current investment policy in each prospectus or information memorandum (if any) for the Titan Trust. 4.Clause 29 of the Trust Deed provides that: The Trustee may at any time elect that any amount (capital or income) of the Trust be distributed to Holders pro rata to the number of Units held in the Trust as at a time determined by the Trustee. Each Holder is presently entitled as at the end of each Year to a share of Distributable Income for that Year, if any, which has not previously been distributed, in the proportion of the number of Units held to the aggregate of all Units then in issue in the Trust. Within 2 months after the end of each Year, the Trustee must distribute any undistributed share of Distributable Income to which any Holder is entitled, either in cash or Bonus Units as the Trustee may elect. Distributable Income is the net income of the Trust determined for the purposes of section 95 of the Tax Act. Year means a year or other period in relation to which taxable income of the Trust for purposes of the Tax Act must be determined. Each Holder has a vested and indefeasible interest in all amounts of Distributable Income to which that Holder becomes entitled in accordance with the operation of this clause. 5.Income may be derived by the Trust in the form of cash or growth in the value of its investments. The Trustee may elect that any distribution be in the form of Bonus Units, and the Trustee may elect to distribute any undistributed share of Distributable Income either in cash or Bonus Units. The Trustee intends to make distributions in the form of both cash and Bonus Units, and may use both methods in the same year. The Trustee has stated that there is no set policy of making only non-taxable bonus issues in preference to cash distributions. If the Titan Trust makes a cash distribution of its income such distribution will be of a more than modest amount. 6.Pursuant to the Securities Act 1978, the Trustee and the Statutory Supervisor executed the Deed of Participation to record the terms of issue of ordinary units in the Titan Trust. Clause 3.1 of the Deed of Participation provides that applications for units in the Titan Trust may be made upon and subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Deed of Participation, the Trust Deed, current investment statement and prospectus for the Titan Trust. 7.NZ investors have applied for ordinary units in accordance with the Investment Statement and the Prospectus. Any changes to the amount of money payable by an NZ investor can only be effected by change to the registered Prospectus in respect of the Trust. Alterations to the terms and conditions of issue of any units can be made by way of the Trustee amending the Trust Deed. The Trustee may only amend the Trust Deed with the consent of the Statutory Supervisor. 8 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) 8.The Investment Statement states at page 18 that the Titan Trust is designed to be a medium-term investment for NZ investors to gain exposure to returns derived from a portfolio of international hedge funds. The Investment Statement provides for an Investment Maturity Date (ìthe IMDî) of 31 March 2008, and for a Maturity Settlement Date (ìthe MSDî) expected to be 28 April 2008, at which time net proceeds from the Titan Trust investments will be distributed to unit holders. The Trustee intends to terminate the Titan Trust shortly after the MSD. 9.The offer was a closed-end offer of ordinary units in the Titan Trust, at an issue price of $1 per unit with a minimum application amount of $5,000 and multiples of $1,000 thereafter. The units were issued on 27 March 2002. No applications for units will be accepted after 20 March 2002 except at the discretion of the Trustee. 10. The Investment Statement contains an offer to enter a Loan and Security Agreement (ìthe Investment Loanî) with Macquarie Finance (NZ) Limited (ìMacquarie Subî). NZ investors do not have to take an Investment Loan in order to subscribe for units. The offer is for a loan of up to 100% of the subscription amount. The Investment Loan can only be used to subscribe for units in the Titan Trust. The Investment Statement states that based on market conditions as at 17 December 2001, the interest rates on the Investment Loan would be 9.54% (fixed rate) and 7.37% (variable rate). Interest is payable quarterly. The principal must be repaid in full upon the MSD, or upon the NZ investor ceasing to be a resident of New Zealand for tax purposes, or upon disposal of all units, or pro rata upon partial disposal of units. 11. The offer of units and of the Investment Loan was open to all NZ resident investors including companies, individuals, superannuation funds and trusts. 12. The current investment policy of the Titan Trust provides for the NZ investorsí subscriptions to be invested in shares issued by Macquarie Offshore Funds No. 2 Limited (ìthe Fundî) in accordance with the document entitled ìSummary Document Macquarie Offshore Funds No. 2 Limited Class A Sharesî, dated 20 December 2001, amended and restated as at 25 January 2002 (ìthe Summary Documentî). The Class A shares are the first class of shares issued by the Fund. The terms of issue of the Class A shares include the following. No pre-emption or other rights exists in respect of any of the shares. The Trustee as shareholder has: voting rights in the case of any variation of the rights attaching to the shares or as otherwise permitted by the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda; entitlement to such dividends as may be declared; entitlement to redemption or repurchase of shares as provided in the by-laws; the right to share pro rata in the surplus assets of the Fund in the event of the winding up or dissolution of the Fund. The directors of the Fund are obliged to create and maintain an investment portfolio in respect of each class of shares. The holders of shares in one class have no rights whatsoever in respect of the assets of any other portfolio appertaining to any other class of shares. However, in the event of any insolvency of any one or more sub-fund(s) under this umbrella structure, any creditors in respect of such insolvent portfolio(s) would be creditors of the Fund as a whole and accordingly could proceed against any assets of the Fund. 13. The Fund is a Bermudan incorporated company, and is tax resident in Bermuda, with a majority of Bermudan directors. The Fund has taken the NZ dollars subscribed for shares and undertaken a spot trade to convert them into US dollars, using the US dollars to invest in a range of open-ended collective investment schemes, mutual funds, separately managed accounts and investment vehicles domiciled in jurisdictions outside Australia. The portfolio of investments (ìthe Titan Portfolioî) will comprise a portfolio of international hedge funds, foreign exchange contracts, cash (at call), managed investments and/or term deposits. The Fundís investments will be managed by Macquarie International Capital Advisors Pty Limited, an Australian resident company. 14. The Fundís investment objective is to deliver consistent capital appreciation with low volatility. According to the Summary Document, while the directors of the Fund have the power to declare dividends, the directors intend that earnings from the Titan Portfolio will be retained by the Fund and no cash dividends on shares will be declared. Despite this, the Fund has made a dividend distribution which has been used by the Titan Trust to make a cash distribution for the three-month period ending 30 June 2002. Shares may be redeemed as at the last business day of any calendar month. The redemption price of each share is based on a determination of the net asset value of the Titan Portfolio in accordance with international accounting standards, and the redemption price is calculated after deducting an appropriate allowance for fiscal and sale charges including redemption fees. 15. Macquarie Bank Ltd (ìMacquarieî) will provide a loan facility to the Fund if certain performance criteria and other conditions precedent are met. 16. The Investment Statement provides an illustrative simulated performance of the Fund which shows a compound pre-tax annual return, after fees and expenses, of 15.9%. The Trustee will apply to 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) redeem all of its outstanding shares in the Fund as at the IMD and pay the net proceeds to investors as soon as practicable thereafter. 17. Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the put option agreement between the Fund and Macquarie, Macquarie has agreed to pay to the Fund on 28 April 2008 a cash settlement amount of the difference if the value of the Titan Portfolio at 31 March 2008 is less than its initial value plus 3%, after adjustments for redemptions. The put option will be cash settled. This agreement, subject to its terms and conditions (including terms and conditions set out in the Prospectus), provides a capital protection to the Titan Trust, and through the Titan Trust to NZ investors. 18. The Investment Statement provides that the Trustee has the discretion to dispose of all or some of the shares in the Fund and to purchase additional shares from new or existing issuers or to access an exposure to a fund of funds investment through other means. This discretion may be exercised in circumstances where the Trustee forms the view that overall returns to the Titan Trust could be improved either in terms of consistency or the absolute level of returns. 19. The Investment Statement records that disposal of units may be requested by investors at any time during the term of the investment by way of redemption of units by the Trustee or by way of sale of units to Macquarie Sub. Units may be purchased by Macquarie Sub at a price equal to 99% of the redemption price, and Macquarie Sub is able to sell or redeem such units. The derivation of a 1% margin from purchasing units is an important commercial reason for Macquarie Sub to fulfil this role. 20. A request for disposal by either method is required in writing at least forty calendar days prior to the last business day of a month (ìthe Disposal Dateî). The price at which disposal will be effected will not be able to be known at the time of the request. Partial disposal of a unitholding must not change the ratio of ordinary units to bonus units held, and must be in a minimum amount of 5,000 units and leave a minimum holding of 5,000 units. Payment will be made as soon as the administrator of the Fund publishes the net asset value of the shares (in the case of sale), and the Trustee receives the proceeds from the redemption of the shares (in the case of redemption). 21. Redemptions will be processed once aggregate outstanding requests from all investors for such redemptions reach $250,000 subject to the possible suspension of the redemption of units for a period up to four months where it is impracticable at the redemption date for the Trustee to calculate the net asset value. While NZ investors may request disposal by way of sale, Macquarie Sub cannot, pursuant to Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority rules, be compelled to purchase units. Macquarie Sub has no set policy about when it will purchase units. Normal commercial factors (including the value of units and of the investments of the Titan Trust, the number of units already held, the Titan Trustís historical performance versus the risks of holding units at the time units are offered by NZ investors) will determine whether units are purchased. If Macquarie Sub does not purchase the units, the Trustee will redeem the units. 22. The Investment Statement states in the section headed ìMaturityî that before the IMD, the Trustee will seek from NZ investors confirmation as to whether they wish to request a transfer of their units to Macquarie Sub or to continue to hold those units up to the MSD. Investors who choose to request a transfer must complete the transfer consent form and return it to the Trustee before the IMD. If Macquarie Sub agrees to accept the transfer, then transfer will be effected on or before the MSD. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) During the period of this ruling section LF 7 does not apply to limit the deductibility of interest. (b) The Titan Trust is not a foreign entity, or a member of a class of foreign entities specified in Part B of schedule 4.

(h) There will be no material changes to the way the Titan Trust is taxed in Australia for the period of this ruling. (i)The Macquarie groupís purposes for the facility that may be provided by Macquarie Sub to purchase 10 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) units from investors under the Arrangement are to allow the Macquarie group to control the secondary market, to provide liquidity, to reduce the groupís exposure to the capital protection feature of the Arrangement and to allow Macquarie Sub to earn a fee and to provide a choice of investment exit mechanism for investors generally. Specifically, such a facility is not a preordained exit procedure that has been implemented with the purpose of enabling some or all investors to avoid deriving ìdividendsî (for income tax purposes) under the Arrangement. (j)There is no ìarrangementî (as defined by section OB 1) between any NZ investor and the Fund and/or any member(s) of the Macquarie group, including Macquarie, the Trustee, Macquarie Sub, and Macquarie International Capital Advisors Pty Limited, to prefer or treat differently any such investor as to the redemption of units and the application of the ordering rule (for income tax purposes). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïSubject to Subpart FG (being the rules relating to thin capitalisation), for NZ investors who are individuals, or a company not excluded from section DD 1(3) by section DD 1(4), and who have borrowed an Investment Loan to invest in units in the Titan Trust, expenditure on interest incurred by those NZ investors (whether in relation to only the Investment Loan, or in relation to a financial arrangement that includes the Investment Loan) will be deductible under section DD 1(1)(b) or section DD 1(3); ïThe interest of a New Zealand resident investor in the Titan Trust will not constitute an interest in a foreign investment fund by virtue of section CG 15(2)(b). ïIf the Titan Trust is a CFC (as defined in section CG 4): ïNZ investors will not be required to return attributed foreign income or losses pursuant to section CG 1 from the Titan Trust by virtue of section CG 13(1). ïSubject to section CG 6(1)(a), those NZ investors having an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî (as defined in section OB 1) in the Titan Trust for any ìaccounting periodî (as defined in section OB 1) are required to return FIF income or loss attributed to the investor pursuant to section CG 7(5). ïThose NZ investors which do not have an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî (as defined in section OB 1) in the Titan Trust for any ìaccounting periodî (as defined by section OB 1) are not required to return FIF income or loss by virtue of section CG 15(2)(b) and are not required to return FIF income or loss attributed to the investor pursuant to section CG 7(5). ïIf the Fund is a CFC (as defined by section CG 4) as a consequence of the Titan Trust being a CFC (as defined in section CG 4) and holding qualified control interests (as defined by section CG 4(6)) in the Fund: ïSubject to section CG 6(1)(a), those NZ investors holding an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî (as defined by section OB 1) in the Fund for any ìaccounting periodî (as defined by section OB 1) are required to return attributed foreign income or loss pursuant to section CG 1, and ïSubject to section CG 6(1)(a), those NZ investors holding an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî (as defined by section OB 1) in the Fund for any ìaccounting periodî (as defined by section OB 1) are required to return foreign investment fund income or loss of the Fund attributed to the investor pursuant to section CG 7(5). ïIf an underlying foreign company is a CFC (as defined by section CG 4) as a consequence of the Fund being a CFC (as defined by section CG 4) and holding ìqualified control interestsî (as defined by section CG 4(6)) in the underlying foreign company, the rulings in (c) above shall apply, subject to section CG 13, in respect of the underlying foreign company, and so on down any chain of CFCs. ïSections BG 1 and GB 1 do not apply to the Arrangement to negate or vary any of the above conclusions. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 March 2002 to 30 April 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11 th day of December 2002.

(l) The Fund will not be a foreign entity, or a member of a class of foreign entities, specified in Part B of Schedule 4. (m) Any Administration Agreements entered into with PAML in respect of the Fund, are not materially different to the Administration Agreement provided to the Rulings Unit on 15 November 2002. (n) There is nothing permitted by law that enables New Zealand Unit Holders to control the exercise of decision-making rights with respect to the Fund. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïWhere Class D and Class E units are issued on the terms that PAML has the power to reinvest the income entitlements in additional units, the issue of additional units to Unit Holders will constitute a ìnon-taxable bonus issueî (under section CF 8(b) and the definition of ìnon-taxable bonus issueî in section OB 1). ïThese units will be excluded from the definition of a dividend in terms of section CF 3(1)(a). ïInterests held by New Zealand investors in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of ìforeign investment fundî by virtue of section CG 15(2)(b). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 20 December 2002 to 19 December 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20 th day of December 2002.

Weíve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. LATE OBJECTION APPLICATION TO BE RECONSIDERED Case:R G Lawton v CIR Decision date:19 December 2002 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Judicial review, late objection Summary Mr Lawton sought judicial review of the Commissionerís decision to not accept an application for late objection in relation to share-trading losses. Commissionerís decision upheld in the High Court, but the Court of Appeal ruled Commissioner to reconsider the application for late objection, highlighting consideration of the merits while upholding the High Courtís finding that the Commissioner is not under a statutory duty to assess omitted income. Facts Mr Lawton is a builder who in 1986 forayed into the stock market. Between 1986 and 1992 he incurred losses of $566,183.33 and interest costs of $281,020, only making a profit in the income years ended 1987 and 1989. Until 1993, Mr Lawton viewed his profits or losses (and associated interest costs) as being on capital account and therefore did not include them in his income tax returns for those years. He did return the dividend income. In 1993, following publicity of the Court of Appealís decisions in CIR v Inglis \[1993\] 2 NZLR 29 and CIR v Stockwell \[1993\] 2 NZLR 40, Mr Lawton consulted his existing accountant who advised him his share transactions were on revenue account. Mr Lawtonís accountant then sought that corresponding adjustments be made by the Commissioner and reassessments issued. The Commissioner declined to exercise his discretion to do so, treating the accountantís letter as a late objection under s30(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976. This decision of 12 November 1993 was the decision under review. The matter was revisited several times. The Commissioner maintained his position in relation to the income years to 1992, and allowed Mr Lawtonís losses for the 1993 year. Mr Lawton did not consider his request to be a late objection. In June 2001, Mr Lawton sought judicial review of the Commissionerís decision not to reassess, which was dismissed (reported at (2002) 20 NZTC 17,531). He then lodged this appeal, seeking reassessments be issued for the relevant years. Decision The issues before the Court were whether the Commissioner has a statutory duty to assess omitted income; whether the decision of 12 November 1993 was a valid exercise of his discretion, and if not, whether any errors were rectified in the subsequent reviews; and if there are grounds for review, whether the delay in filing proceedings should lead to denial of relief. The Court of Appeal upheld the High Courtís finding that the Commissioner is not under a statutory duty to assess omitted income. The Court of Appealís decision reinforces CIR v Wilson (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512, in which case it was held the merits of the objection may be one relevant factor (ie not the overriding factor), stating the paramount consideration in all cases is not necessarily the correctness of the assessment. While finding the Commissioner is entitled (in a case such as this) to treat any request to reassess as a late objection, the Court held the decision of 12 November 1993 was not a valid exercise of the Commissionerís discretion because the merits of Mr Lawtonís proposed objection were not considered. This error was not rectified in the subsequent reviews. The Court found the merits were not considered by the primary officer, or the Regional Controller initially, and 22 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) when the merits were considered by the departmental solicitor and later by the Regional Controller again, that they were not given any weight but rather, departmental policy was rigidly adhered to in declining to accept the late objection. The Court found Mr Lawton did not ìseek advantageî, but rather was ìpromptedî by the publicity surrounding the other two cases, to make enquiries of his existing accountant. The Court did not find any of the following amounted to seeking an advantage from the recently publicised cases: the scale, volume or frequency of the share transactions; Mr Lawtonís experience in business; that he had an accountant; or the lack of objection through the then applicable process. Rather, his losses would have been on revenue account even if those earlier decisions had not found in favour of those taxpayers. The Court held the delay in filing proceedings should not lead to denial of relief, taking into account the reasons for the delay, the failure by the Commissioner to examine the merits of his case in a proper fashion, and the absence of prejudice to the Commissioner from the delay. However, the Court did not grant the relief sought by Mr Lawton (the issuing of reassessments for the relevant years). Rather, the Court ordered the CIR to reconsider the application for acceptance of a late objection, in accordance with the terms of its judgment, being to consider the merits of Mr Lawtonís position and properly weigh them. 23 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL Case:CIR v Surjeet Singh Decision date:20 December 2002 Act:Section 71A Districts Courts Act 1947 Keywords:Appeal against findings of fact Summary The CIR successfully resisted the application for leave to appeal. Facts On 12 October 2001, in the context of proceedings for recovery of tax, Judge Cadenhead determined a factual dispute between the Commissioner and taxpayer over whether the department had agreed to accept a late notice of objection. He found in favour of the department. A statement of defence filed asserted the taxpayer had objected to a default assessment on 22 October 1998, and again to further assessments from time to time, the last being on 17 July 1999. A challenge by way of judicial review followed, which was reported as Singh v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,811. In those proceedings, the taxpayer alleged the Commissioner had failed to take into account certain returns he claimed to have made in relation to the 1990-1998 tax years. Alternatively, he sought a determination that the Commissioner had acted wrongly in failing to find that delays in challenging assessments were due to exceptional circumstances so the time for challenge should be extended. The High Court found each ground advanced in respect of the first cause of action failed, and there were no exceptional circumstances. Consequently the judicial review application was dismissed. In the course of its judgment the High Court had said: ìFactual issue (ii) has been determined adversely to the plaintiff by the District Courtís decision delivered by Judge Cadenhead on 12 October 2001. The plaintiff is bound by the decision which, save by appeal brought within time, cannot be challenged. I do not accept the plaintiffís submission that this application for review is to be treated as such appeal. To do so would multiply error: effectively treating as reviewable by the District Court the determination of the Crownís delegate not to find ìexceptional circumstancesî; and as reviewable by this court the limited factual determination by the District Court on the point. Litigation must be kept on the correct jurisdictional rails. (Emphasis added) In the light of these comments, the taxpayer made the present application to the District Court for leave to appeal against the judgment of Judge Cadenhead. That judgment had not been sealed, and relative to the date of sealing, there was no dispute that the application for leave was in time. Decision The taxpayer confirmed in argument that he really wanted to appeal the finding of credibility made by Judge Cadenhead and that he preferred the evidence of the Department. He submitted the District Court need not be troubled by the detail, as justice required that whatever the taxpayer wanted reconsidered by the High Court should go to it. The Court referred to observations on the purpose of requiring leave in Sandle v Stewart \[1982\] 1 NZLR 708,715, and noted that an appellate Court will only interfere in a finding of credibility in exceptional circumstances, where, for example, the judge at first instance has failed to take advantage of evidence he has heard. It was therefore difficult to see the point of giving leave in this case, unless it could be established where the judge might have gone wrong. The Court found that no details of any arguable complaint about the factual findings were forthcoming. It also expressed the view the District Court probably had no power to inquire into the factual issue at all, as that offended section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. In the result, the Court found there was no merit of any kind in the application and observed the application had been brought without any apparent sign of even the most basic consideration of principle and statutory provision. In the circumstances, the Commissioner was awarded $1,500 costs. 24 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) APPEAL NOT PERMITTED AFTER UNSUCCESSFUL JUDICIAL REVIEW Case:TRA 47/97 Decision date:14 January 2003 Act:Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 Keywords:Judicial review, appeal, cases stated Summary Judge Barber refused to allow an appeal of a decision of the Taxation Review Authority after that decision had previously been unsuccessfully judicially reviewed. Facts This case involved certain participants of a well-known tax avoidance scheme developed by Mr J G Russell, an Auckland accountant. Mr Russellís template has been held to be a tax avoidance arrangement (see the Privy Council in Miller v CIR \[2001\] 3 NZLR 316). This case relates to the aftermath of the Wetherill judicial review case which culminated in the Privy Council refusing leave to hear the applicantsí appeal on 2 October 2002. Wetherill related to two decisions of Judge Barber in the Taxation Review Authority (ìthe TRAî): Case U35 ((2000) 19 NZTC 9,330) and Case U41 ((2000) 19 NZTC 9,380). In Case U35 Judge Barber allowed the Commissioner to file certain cases stated out of time, and refused the objectorsí applications that their objections be allowed. In Case U41 Judge Barber struck out an attempted appeal of Case U35 and refused to state a case on appeal for the opinion of the High Court. In Wetherill, a judicial review of Case U35 and Case U41, the High Court (OíRegan J) found for the objectors/ applicants: M & J Wetherill & Co Ltd & Ors v TRA & CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,166. However, the Court of Appeal overturned OíRegan Jís decision and later refused leave to appeal to the Privy Council: M & J Wetherill & Co Ltd & Ors v TRA & CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,624; M & J Wetherill & Co Ltd & Ors v TRA & CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,681. The Privy Council itself refused special leave. In this case the objectors attempted to appeal, as opposed to review, the TRAís decision in Case U35. The objectors argued that OíRegan J had held that there was a right of appeal in relation to the decision in Case U35 and that as the Commissioner had not appealed against that finding the TRA was bound to follow the ruling of the High Court. They submitted that OíRegan Jís decision was res judicata and the TRA was therefore obliged to state a case on appeal in respect of Case U35. The essence of the objectorsí arguments was summarised by Judge Barber in paragraph \[52\] as follows: ìEssentially then, Mr Judd puts it that, with regard to my said findings in Case U35, I am now required to state a Case on Appeal to the High Court pursuing to section 26 as the High Court found that I should.î The Commissioner argued that OíRegan Jís decision on this point was at best obiter, and that he had not made any orders in relation to the relevant section of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994. The Commissioner also submitted that the Court of Appeal had made it clear that there was no basis for a separate appeal to the High Court in respect of the matters that were covered by the judicial review. The Court of Appeal had also remarked that in this case there was no room for different factual conclusions on judicial review or appeal. Decision Judge Barber stated that the Court of Appeal ìseemed to me to confirm my rulings in both Cases U35 and U41. One of those rulings was that the objectors had no right of appeal from the orders and findings which I made in Case U35. In simple terms, it seems to me that one of the orders which I made in Case U41 still stands, namely, that the taxpayersí Notice of Appeal from my interlocutory ruling of 4 February 2000 (Case U35) be struck out, and this has been confirmed by all our appellate Courts, so there is no notice of appeal on which a form of Case Stated can now be based.î Judge Barber concluded that his decision in Case U41 to strike out the reported appeal still stood intact. Furthermore, he agreed with counsel for the Commissionerís submission that many of the points raised in the purported case on appeal had already been dealt with ìand dismissedî by the Court of Appeal. The case stated on the appeal that had been submitted to the TRA was ìineffective and invalidî. 25 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) 26 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 2 (February 2003) These dates are taken from Inland Revenueís Smart business tax due date calendar 2002 ñ 2003.

The Act itself arose from recommendations made in recent reviews of membersí remuneration and expenses, and sets out rules for their administration and clarifies their tax treatment. It has also made minor amendments to clarify membersí employment status for taxation purposes. Background The Remuneration Authority (Members of Parliament) Amendment Bill was introduced into Parliament on 11 June 2002. Certain benefits to be subject to fringe benefit tax During its passage through Parliament, the bill was amended to provide that the private use or enjoyment component of services provided to members in relation to travel, accommodation, attendance or communications would be made subject to fringe benefit tax. Remedial amendments In 1998 the Income Tax Act 1994 was amended to ensure that remuneration and expenses paid to members of Parliament would receive the same tax treatment as similar payments made to employees. The Remuneration Authority (Members of Parliament) Amendment Act 2002 has amended the changes introduced in 1998, in order to further clarify this intended policy. Key features Certain benefits to be subject to fringe benefit tax The Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to provide that the private element of services provided to members for travel, accommodation, attendance or communications is subject to fringe benefit tax. This treatment will apply irrespective of whether the services are provided to the member direct, or by way of a cash payment to reimburse the member for expenditure incurred. The definition of ìfringe benefitî contained in section CI 1 has been extended to include these services, thereby rendering them subject to fringe benefit tax. They have also been included within the list of exempt public office income contained in section CB 7, to ensure that they are not also subject to income tax. Remedial amendments The Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to clarify the policy intent that members are to receive the same tax treatment as employees in relation to income derived from their office. The changes amend the definitions of ìsalary or wagesî and ìemploymentî contained in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The definition of ìsalary or wagesî has been extended to include payments of salary or allowances made to members. The definition of ìemploymentî has been extended to include the activities of a Member of Parliament which give rise to an entitlement to the receipt of a source deduction payment. A consequential amendment removes members from the section OB 1 definition of ìspecified office holderî. Application dates The fringe benefit tax amendments to sections CB 7 and CI 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 apply from 1 April 2003, the date of effect of the Remuneration Authority (Members of Parliament) Amendment Act 2002. The remedial amendments to section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 apply from 1 April 2002. STUDENT LOAN SCHEME ñ INTEREST RATES FOR 2003-04 The total Student Loan Scheme interest rate for the 2003-04 income year will remain at 7.0%. The total interest rate has two componentsóthe base interest rate and the interest adjustment rate. These are 5.1% and 1.9% respectively for the 2002-03 income year. From 1 April 2003 the base interest rate will decrease to 4.2% and the interest adjustment rate will increase to 2.8%. Student Loan Scheme (Interest Rates) Regulations 2003 5 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. CLARIFICATION OF STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENT IR ñ SPS RDC 620 ñ WRITING OFF TAX DEBT REDUCTION OF NET LOSSES WHEN WRITING OFF A DEBT Standard Practice Statement IR-SPS RDC 620óWriting off tax debt, originally published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No. 11 (November 2002), states the Commissionerís practice in relation to writing off tax debts. Section 177C(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that if the Commissioner writes off a debt for a taxpayer who has a net loss, all or part of the net loss must be extinguished by dividing the amount written off by 33% and reducing the net loss by that amount. IR-SPS RDC 620 states ìIf an amount is written off and the taxpayer has tax losses, all or part of the net loss will be reduced by the amount of the write-off grossed up by 33%î. It has been brought to our attention that the above wording may lead to an incorrect calculation of the amount of loss reduction. For example: If the amount written off was $100,000 and this was multiplied by 33% this would result in a loss reduction figure of $133,000. In this scenario, the correct calculation is $100,000 divided by 33% giving a correct loss reduction of $303,303.30. It is possible for this calculation to result in the amount of loss reduction being higher than the current net loss. In this situation, the net loss is to be extinguished in accordance with section 177C(5). Standard Practice Statement RDC 620 will continue to apply until such time as it is withdrawn. 6 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. LIVESTOCK VALUES ñ 2003 NATIONAL STANDARD COSTS FOR SPECIFIED LIVESTOCK The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has released a determination, reproduced over the page, setting the national standard costs for specified livestock for the 2002/2003 income year. These costs are used by livestock owners as part of the calculation of the value of livestock on hand at the end of the income year, where they have adopted the national standard costs (NSC) scheme to value any class of livestock. Farmers using the scheme apply the one-year NSC to stock bred on the farm each year, and add the rising two-year NSC to the value of the opening young stock available to come through into the mature inventory group at year-end. Livestock purchases are also factored into the valuation of the immature and mature groupings at year-end, so as to arrive at a valuation reflecting the enterpriseís own balance of farm bred and externally purchased animals. NSCs are developed from the national average costs of production for each type of livestock farming based on independent survey data. Only direct costs of breeding rearing rising one- and two-year livestock are taken into account. These exclude all costs of owning (leasing) and operating the farm business, overhead costs of operating non-livestock enterprises (such as cropping) and costs associated with producing and harvesting dual products (wool, fibre, milk and velvet). For bobby calves, information from spring 2002 is used while other dairy NSCs are based on survey data for the year ended 30 June 2002. For sheep, beef cattle, deer and goats, NSCs are based on survey data for the year ended 30 June 2001 which is the most recent available for those livestock types at the time the NSCs are calculated. The NSCs calculated for the year ended 31 March 2003 have increased for most livestock classes, with the main exceptions to this being the NSC for rising two-year dairy cattle which fell marginally, and the NSC for purchased bobby calves which fell by 13% due to the significant reduction in the cost of milk-based feed in spring 2002. Total expenditure on most farm types increased in the survey year on which the NSCs are based. The increase in costs is mainly a result of improved incomes permitting additional expenditure. While much of this expenditure increase is aimed at producing more of the dual products (particularly milk), and is consequently excluded from the NSCs calculated, some of the increase in costs flow to the higher average cost of producing livestock. The new NSCs struck each year only apply to that yearís immature and maturing livestock. Mature livestock valued under this scheme effectively retain their historic NSCs until they die or are sold, albeit through a first in, first out (FIFO) or inventory averaging system as opposed to individual livestock tracing. One-off movements in expenditure items are effectively smoothed within the mature inventory grouping, by the averaging of that yearís intake value with the carried forward values of the surviving livestock in that grouping. For the farm-bred component of the immature inventory group, the NSC values will appropriately reflect changes in the costs of those livestock in that particular year. The NSC scheme is only one option under the current livestock valuation regime. The other options are market value, the herd scheme and the self-assessed cost (SAC) option. SAC is calculated on the same basis as the NSC but uses a farmerís own costs rather than the national average costs. 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) NATIONAL STANDARD COSTS FOR SPECIFIED LIVESTOCK DETERMINATION 2003 Kind of livestockCategory of livestockNational standard cost $ SheepRising 1 year 21.50 Rising 2 year13.90 Dairy cattlePurchased bobby calves143.00 Rising 1 year612.00 Rising 2 year 97.10 Beef cattleRising 1 year202.00 Rising 2 year117.00 Rising 3 year male non-breeding cattle (all breeds)117.00 DeerRising 1 year 64.40 Rising 2 year32.50 Goats (meat and fibre)Rising 1 year 16.30 Rising 2 year11.20 Goats (dairy)Rising 1 year 96.90 Rising 2 year 15.80 PigsWeaners to 10 weeks of age83.40 Growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age 65.70 This determination is signed by me on the 30th day of January 2003.

This determination is made in terms of section EL 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994. It shall apply to any specified livestock on hand at the end of the 2002-2003 income year where the taxpayer has elected to value that livestock under the national standard cost scheme for that income year.

We received three submissions on the draft. No submission raised an issue on the proposed rates. However, one submission suggested that compact disc recorders and digital versatile disc recorders should also be included in the determination. After careful consideration, we have decided that due to the nature of these assets they should be the subject of a separate determination. The general depreciation determination inserts new asset classes into the ìAudio and Video Recording Studios and Professional Photographyî and ìLeisureî industry categories and the ìHire equipment (short-term hire of 1 month or less)î asset category. The determination also inserts new asset classes into the ìHotels, Motels, Restaurants, Cafes, Taverns and Takeaway Barsî and ìResidential Rental Property Chattelsî industry categories. The general determination is reproduced here. The new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful lives set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. GENERAL DEPRECIATION DETERMINATION DEP49 This determination may be cited as ìDetermination DEP49: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 49î. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed here.

Weíve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. TAXPAYER ìPERSON AFFECTEDî BY TAX AVOIDANCE ARRANGEMENT; CIRíS ASSESSMENTS UPHELD Case:CIR v Peterson and Peterson v CIR Decision date:19 February 2003 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:ìperson affectedî Summary The taxpayer was a person affected by a tax avoidance arrangement and his tax affairs could be reconstituted under section 99. It was irrelevant that he did not know the extent of the tax avoidance arrangement and that he was not one of the persons in the required ìmeeting of mindsî necessary to constitute an arrangement. Facts These were cases taken by the taxpayer in relation to two film investments made in the 1980s. The films were ìLie of the Landî and ìUtuî. In both cases the Commissioner concluded that the expenses of the films were inflated by means of non-recourse loans and circular funding. This increased the depreciation deduction apparently available to the taxpayer but for which there was no actual liability as the circular funding had already repaid the loans. The Commissioner disallowed the depreciation deduction to the extent of the inflated expenses. The taxpayer objected and the cases were heard at the TRA. The taxpayer won one (Lie of the Land) and the Commissioner the other. Both TRA decisions were appealed to the High Court where the taxpayer won one again and the Commissioner the other (see (2002) 20 NZTC 17,583 and 17,761). Both decisions were appealed. The main issue was the proper application of section 99 ITA 1976 to the taxpayer. The taxpayer argued that as he was not part of the ìmeeting of mindsî necessary for an arrangement under section 99 (the test from BNZI \[2002\] 1 NZLR 450) then section 99 could not be applied to him. Further it was argued that the taxpayer entered a fixed price contract and this was the cost to him of the investment regardless of what consequently occurred outside his knowledge. The Commissioner argued that section 99 could be applied to the taxpayer as there was an arrangement meeting the BNZI test even though the taxpayer was not one of those involved in the necessary ìmeeting of mindsî and he was a ìperson affected by that arrangementî (per section 99(3)). The Commissioner also placed weight upon the phrase ìwhether or not any person affected by that arrangement is a party theretoî (section 99(2)). Decision The Court considered the Commissioner had acted correctly by adjusting the assessments. The bulk of the reasoning is in CIR v Peterson which is summarised below. The Court distinguished these cases from BNZI by noting the Commissionerís argument ìis that because of the inclusion at the end of subsection (2) of the phrase ìwhether or not any person affected by that arrangement is a party theretoî and subsection (3) empowers the Commissioner to adjust the assessable income of ìany person affectedî, the adjustment to the assessable income of the taxpayer Ö was not erroneousî whereas the Commissionerís argument in BNZI was that BNZI was a party with knowledge to the arrangement (paragraph 29-30). 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) The Court considered that as the loan had been repaid (via the circular funding) the TRA and the High Court had erred by not focussing on the repayment: ìPlainly the correct focus must be on whether the loan was repaid, not on what the taxpayer knewî (paragraph 33). The Court considered that as the loan had been repaid the deductions were not available regardless of section 99 (paragraph 34). The Court turned to consider section 99. It was satisfied there was an arrangement (pointing out the architect of the arrangement had the necessary mutuality in his differing capacities (paragraph 37), but went on to consider whether the section allowed the Commissioner to ìadjust the taxable income of the taxpayer who was not a party to the arrangement and had no knowledge of itî (paragraph 38). The Court referred to the following passage by Blanchard J in BNZI: ì\[175\] As the principal judgment records paragraph \[42\], there are three successive inquiries. The first is as to the extent of the arrangement; the second is as to whether it has the purpose or effect of tax avoidance and the third, which arises only where the second is answered affirmatively, is as to the adjustment to be made to counteract the tax advantage. The adjustment can be made against both a party to the arrangement and a person affected, who is not necessarily a party. But it can be made only where a tax advantage has been obtained ìunder that arrangementî. The Commissioner therefore cannot make an adjustment as against someone who is not a party merely because that person has received a payment subsequent to the operation of an arrangement but outside the arrangementÖ.î (Emphasis added) And commented on that paragraph: ìFirst, it clearly recognises that an adjustment can be made to the assessable income of a person affected though not a party to the arrangement. Secondly, it reflects the Judgeís view that BNZ Investments obtained any tax advantage not from or under the ìdownstreamî tax avoidance arrangement, but by another ìupstreamî arrangement. In our case, however the tax advantage obtained by the taxpayer was derived directly from the very arrangement in which the loan funds were included in the cost to the partnership of the film.î (paragraph 42) It was recognised that deciding whether a tax advantage was derived from a tax avoidance arrangement was a matter of fact and degree: ìThere will be circumstances in which questions will be raised as to the degree of proximity necessary to qualify as a person affected for the purposes of section 99(3). This will be another aspect of line drawingÖ so as to distinguish between a tax advantage that may legitimately retained and one that is vulnerable to adjustment. But we do not seeÖthis caseÖas even approaching the line.î (paragraph 44) The argument advanced by the taxpayer that he had a fixed price contract and had paid that price so he was entitled to a deduction was dismissed. In support of this the taxpayer relied upon Cecil Bros (1964) 111CLR 430 and Europa Oil \[1976\] 1 NZLR 546, 556. The Court considered the argument was essentially that the Commissioner could not ìsecond guessî the value of services provided and said that the Commissioner was not precluded from declining to recognise costs not truly incurred. As such the cases referred did not apply (paragraph 46). Peterson v CIR largely followed the reasons in the companion case. However in this case the non-recourse loans were entirely fictitious (paragraph 4, and did not occur at all, as opposed to the circular funding in the other case). The Court again said the costs not truly incurred should not be deduced (notwithstanding section 99) but regardless of that view section 99 applied again. (paragraph 13). Even if the loans had been incurred, section 99 would apply as the loans were repaid so liability (if any) was extinguished (paragraphs 13, 15). 12 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) ANOTHER CASE TRANSFERRED FROM THE TRA TO THE HIGH COURT The Court found that the respondent would not be prejudiced by the transfer and granted the application. The transfer was made conditional on preserving the respondentís strike out application of the TRA proceeding, although it was not accepted that the application had any merit. It was decided that the two proceedings should be heard together rather than consolidated. Case:CIR v D H McIlraith Decision date:19 February 2002 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Transfer of proceedings, section 138N of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Summary High Court grants Commissionerís application to have proceeding transferred from the TRA to the High Court. Facts In 2001 the respondent brought proceedings in the High Court against the Commissioner challenging an assessment for the 1996 year, and seeking judicial review and compensation under the NZ Bill of Rights Act. In 2002 he brought proceedings in the TRA challenging an assessment for the 1997 year on very similar grounds, also alleging bias, abuse of power, and bad faith against IRD officers. Because of the overlap between the issues in the two proceedings, the Commissioner applied to have the TRA proceeding transferred to the High Court and consolidated with the High Court case. Decision The Court held that the application was correctly brought under section 138N of the TAA which authorised it. It was a straightforward procedural application not requiring a statement of claim. The Court found that the application should be granted for two main reasons: ïThe substantial overlap, legally and factually, between the proceedings as they related to the correctness of the assessments; ïThe inappropriateness of the TRA as a forum for deciding serious allegations of bad faith and abuse of power. The recent Court of Appeal decision in Dandelion Investments Ltd v CIR (CA204/01, 5 December 2002) determined that the TRAís role was concerned with the correctness of the assessment and ìdid not extend to conducting what was effectively a broad-based judicial review of the process leading up to the Commissionerís assessment Öî. The Court also referred to the criteria listed in the recent Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Erris Promotions (CA175/02, 7 November 2002), and discussed these briefly in relation to the present case. 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) DOCUMENTS NOT PREPARED WITH A DOMINANT PURPOSE OF LITIGATION Case:Glenharrow Holdings v CIR Decision date:13 February 2003 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Discovery, litigation privilege, legal professional privilege Summary The High Court held that litigation privilege did not apply to documents prepared by and for the Commissionerís experts prior to the issuing of the Commissionerís statement of position. Facts This was an interim interlocutory decision relating to the interaction between litigation privilege and legal professional privilege and the disputes process in Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is the second interlocutory decision relating to this taxpayer. The first is reported at Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,792. In this dispute the plaintiff sought an order for discovery of all documents in respect of which the Commissioner had claimed litigation privilege, up to 6 December 2000 (the date the Commissioner issued his statement of position), on the basis that litigation was not reasonably in contemplation until after that date. The plaintiff also made a similar claim in relation to documents the Commissioner contended were covered by legal professional privilege. The Commissioner had instructed four experts prior to 6 December 2000. The Commissioner and each of the experts had produced a list of documents, all of which made claims of privilege. The substantive issue relates to a disallowed input tax credit arising from the purchase of a mining licence. Decision Justice Panckhurst set out some of the legislation relating to the disputes resolution procedure, and a chronology of the facts. His Honour noted a potential conflict between the concept of litigation privilege and the ìall cards on the tableî philosophy of the disputes process. The Judge decided that it was not ìnecessary or appropriate to decide the privilege exclusion question with reference to Part IVA generallyî, but that the ìappropriate course is to reach a decision tailored to these circumstances and not seek to determine the more general question.î Justice Panckhurst noted that the test for the availability of legal professional privilege was a two-step process. Firstly there is a threshold requirement that litigation must be in train or at least reasonably apprehended. Secondly the relevant document must be one which was prepared to enable legal advice to be received in relation to that litigation. His Honour concluded that litigation was reasonably apprehended by December 2000. However, he did not accept the Commissionerís contention that the dominant purpose for which the relevant documents were prepared was to advise in relation to apprehended litigation. Rather, Panckhurst J considered that the dominant purpose must have been to enable the Commissioner to prepare and issue his statement of position, a statutory requirement. Litigation privilege was not available up to and including 6 December 2000. In respect of solicitor-client privilege, Panckhurst J noted that the Commissioner had claimed the privilege in relation to a large number of documents. His Honour stated (paragraph \[45\]): ìMany appear to be communications emanating from the Commissionerís legal advisors where a claim to legal professional privilege is unsurprising. In relation to these aspects of the claim to privilege I see no grounds to go behind the privilege claim made in the list itself, supported as it is by affidavit evidence.î However, in relation to solicitor-client privilege claims by the Commissionerís experts Panckhurst J indicated that he would like to inspect a sample of the documents to see whether privilege properly applied. His Honour ordered the parties to confer to see what documents should be provided to him to inspect. After such inspection a final judgment would be issued. The Commissioner is not appealing this decision. 14 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) TAXPAYERíS OBJECTION PROCEDURALLY FLAWED; TRA LACKS JURISDICTION TO DETERMINE OBJECTION. Case:TRA 026/01 Decision 002/2003 Decision date:30 January 2003 Act:Income Tax Act 1994 Tax Administration Act 1994 TRA Regulations 1994 and 1998 Keywords:Objection not disallowed, case stated request invalid, points of objection notice invalid, challenge proceedings Summary The taxpayerís case stated request was invalid as the objection had not been determined and it was not made in time. The taxpayerís points of objection notice (PON) was also invalid as it was not provided within the statutory time frame. Facts This was a J G Russell related matter. In 1996 assessments for the tax years 1985 to 1996 were issued. Those assessments relied upon sham as the basis of assessment although later section 99 ITA 1976 was added as a ground of assessment. The taxpayer objected on 22 November 1996 however that objection has not been determined by the Commissioner. Subsequently (20 November 2000) two notices of proposed adjustments (NOPAs) were issued covering the tax years 1985 to 2000 which relied on different bases of proposed reassessment. Those NOPAs expressly proposed to reverse the assessments made in 1996 and to replace them with new assessments. The taxpayer replied with two notices of response (NORs) expressly accepting the adjustment to cancel the 1996 assessments but rejecting the balance of the proposed adjustments. Since then one NOPA has been abandoned and the other has proceeded via a statement of response (SOP) to Adjudication. The taxpayer purported to request a case be stated on 21 January 2002 (received by the Commissioner on 25 January 2002) using the NOPAs as the alleged determination of the objection. A (PON) dated 18 April 2001 was then received from the taxpayer at the Wellington Service Centre on 30 April 2001 (received by Litigation Management on 2 May 2001). This case was focussed on the preliminary issues of whether the case could proceed given the objection had not been determined. The taxpayer argued that the NOPA in effect decided the objection and that triggered the right to request a case stated. The taxpayer also argued that the Commissioner had failed to file a timely case stated. Decision Barber J concluded that there was no jurisdiction for the case to continue: ìIt seems to me that there is no jurisdiction for this Case Stated to proceed because there has never been a disallowance of the objection. The issue and service of the NOPAs, which is all the objector could rely upon, did not trigger off an event permitting the objector to request that the objection be heard and determined by a Taxation Review Authority.î (paragraph 42) In those circumstances Barber J stayed the case. While he considered the case invalid as the objection was not determined he thought it ìprudentî to leave it at the TRA Registry until the Adjudication process ended on the later NOPA and NOR (paragraph 50). While his Honour considered the delay in addressing the objection ìthoroughly unsatisfactoryî he also recognised the difficulties in addressing the Russell template and the need for ìcare and thought due to extensive consequencesî (paragraph 51). He also rejected an allegation the Commissioner had failed to file a timely case stated. His Honour was taken through the various timeframes of the objection procedure and concluded that if the Commissionerís NOPA was a determination of the objection (which it was not) then: ïThe request for a case stated was not notified to the Commissioner within the relevant statutory timeframe and the objection was at an end (paragraph 46 to 56). This was a timeframe the Authority had no jurisdiction to enlarge (paragraph 54). In considering this the Authority rejected the application of any deemed receipt by the Commissioner under the TRA Regulations or the District Courts Rules or the Postal Services Act 1998 (paragraphs 58 to 64). ïThe PON was not timely and therefore invalid (paragraphs 66, 73). ïUsing the PON date of receipt by the Commissioner the case stated (if it had been necessary: assuming the taxpayerís steps had been timely and valid) was received by the TRA within time (paragraph 66). In concluding His Honour noted the probable invalidity of the assessments but concluded he lacked jurisdiction to deal with that issue but considered it moot anyway in light of the Disputes Resolution procedure that was underway (paragraph 76-78). Finally he reiterated his earlier call for a Commission of Inquiry into the Russell template (paragraph 84). 15 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) FUNDAMENTAL VARIATION Case:TRA Decision 003/2003 Decision date:26 February 2003 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Supply, cancellation, alteration, fundamental variation, contract, insolvency, liquidation, credit note Summary The Disputant entered contracts to buy land and claimed input credits in respect of the supplies. The vendor became insolvent and the mortgagees exercised their rights of sale. The contracts were not completed, neither were they expressly cancelled. The liquidator did not issue credit notes but the Commissioner considered the supplies to have been cancelled and reversed the input credits to the disputant. The TRA held that the Commissioner was entitled to do so. Facts The disputant, MHL, entered into contracts with KIL for the purchase of two townhouses. GST input tax claims were made for the full purchase price of each unit. Prior to settlement of the purchases, KIL went into liquidation, and the mortgagees exercised their powers of sale to sell the units to third parties. The department considered that the supplies had been cancelled. As a result, a dispute arose as to whether the taxpayer was required to account for the GST originally claimed as input tax. MHL ultimately did this in its GST return for the two-month period ended 29 February 2000. MHL then issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment proposing that the debit adjustment of $56,667.67 made in its GST return for the period ended 29 February 2000 was incorrect. The grounds for the adjustment proposed were that the contracts had not been cancelled as neither party to the contracts had served the notices required to cancel the contracts. The department disagreed with the adjustment proposed by the taxpayer, and the dispute proceeded to Adjudication. The department accepted that MHL correctly claimed the original input tax credits on the payment of the deposits for the properties, having received tax invoices for both purchases. The department contended however, that because the supplies have been cancelled or fundamentally varied or altered, an adjustment is required under section 25 of the GST Act. Evidence was given for the Commissioner by the departmentís investigator and the liquidator of KIL. An employee adviser of the disputant company gave evidence for the disputant. Decision The Authority reviewed the agreed facts and the evidence brought by the parties and concluded: ìÖin any event there cannot now be specific performance of the contracts. The most the disputant could hope for is damages for the vendorís breach and possibly a claim against the mortgagee. The vendor has ceased to exist. A claim against the mortgages might conceivably have included a claim for the GST but even if possible cannot alter the legal relationships between the Commissioner and the taxpayer. At best it could only indemnify the taxpayer from any claim the Commissioner may have.î And: ìÖit was open to the disputant to cancel the contracts when the vendor failed in its obligation to build the units. On the facts as I find them to be it failed to do so, and any rights to cancel it may have had under the Contractual Remedies Act has long since expired.î The Authority then reviewed the scope of section 25 of the GST Act and concluded that the provisions therein contemplated the situation before the court: ìBecause the agreements for sale and purchase to the knowledge of the disputant have been cancelled, the disputant therefore knows that the tax invoices issued to it by the vendor are ìincorrectî for the purposes of section 25(4). The disputant has therefore made a ìdeduction of an amount of input tax Ö to which that other knowledge Ö relatesî and therefore it is obliged to repay to the Commissioner the amount by which ìthe input tax deducted exceeds the output tax properly chargedî.î He concluded by noting: ìThe fact the vendor company in liquidation did not issue a credit note and the liquidator refused to do so does not assist the disputant. In those circumstances the Commissioner is entitled to invoke section 25(3B). He was satisfied from the records available to him that there was a sale to the disputant which did not proceed and therefore a ìcredit note is not required to be issuedî. Section 25(3B) is clearly intended to break what would otherwise be a procedural impasse to the implementation of section 25, and was property invoked for the purpose in this case.î 16 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) OTHER ITEMS OF INTEREST STATEMENT OF POLICY WITHDRAWAL AND REVISED INTERPRETATION Time limits for new companies to make qualifying company elections ñ where extension-of-time arrangements with tax agents exist ñ previous policy withdrawn The Commissioner has reviewed the position on the time limits for new companies to make qualifying company or loss attributing qualifying company elections that will apply from the commencement of the companyís first income year. The previous policy was set out at pages 4 to 6 of Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 6, No 13 (May 1995). The legislative requirement for qualifying company elections is that they be filed for newly-formed companies within the time allowed by section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for filing a tax return if the election is to take effect on the first day of the companyís first income year. For taxpayers who do not have extension-of-time (EOT) arrangements for filing their tax returns through tax agents, this means that if a companyís return is filed before 7 July, which is the last day for companies to file their tax returns if there are no extension-of-time arrangements, then shareholders and directors will still have until 7 July to file any QC elections. In cases where the company has a late balance date, the date for the filing of the return will differ from 7 July and it will be that date which will apply in place of 7 July. This left some uncertainty, however, in relation to the required date for filing elections where taxpayers did have EOT arrangements in respect of tax returnsóie whether those elections had to be filed by the same time as the tax return or whether the taxpayer had until the end of the extension period of 31 March (or some other date that may be given pursuant to the Commissionerís discretion) to file the election even if the return had been filed at an earlier date. The view taken in the 1995 statement was that after 7 July the election was required to be filed no later than the filing of the income tax return under those EOT arrangements. In other words, a post-7 July election filed subsequent to the filing of the income tax return was not accepted. As a result of the review, the Commissioner no longer considers that the previous policy where a company is subject to an EOT arrangement correctly states the law. The previous policy (as set out in TIB, Vol 6, No 13, pages 5 and 6, under the heading ìLast date for elections for newly-formed companies on an agency listingî) is hereby formally withdrawn. The Commissioner now considers that, on both the current and previous versions of section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, in conjunction with the provisions of sections HG 3(3), HG 4(5), and HG 14(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994, the time allowed for filing elections is the same as the time permitted for the taxpayer to file an income tax returnóregardless of whether or not the tax return is filed prior to the filing of elections. For taxpayers subject to a tax agentís EOT arrangement, this will generally be 31 March of the year following the income year to which the first income tax return relates. Consistent with what was foreshadowed in the AGENTSanswers of March 2002, this revised interpretation will be applied from the 2001 and subsequent income years. 17 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) 18 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) These dates are taken from Inland Revenueís Smart business tax due date calendar 2003 - 2004 REGULAR FEATURES DUE DATES REMINDER April 2003 7Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due End-of-year income tax 7 April 2003, 2002 end-of-year income tax due for clients of agents with a March balance date 22Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or ( IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 30GST and return payment due May 2003 5Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 20Employer deductions Large employers ($100,000 or more PAYE and SSCWT deduction per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or (IR 346) form and payment due Employer deductions and employer monthly schedule Small employers (less than $100,000 PAYE and SSCWT deductions per annum) ïEmployer deductions (IR 345) or ( IR 346) form and payment due ïEmployer monthly schedule (IR 348) due 30GST and return payment due 19 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 3 (March 2003) INLAND REVENUE NATIONAL OFFICE PO BOX 2198 WELLINGTON TELEPHONE (04) 498 5800

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to binding rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 03/01 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Restaurant Brands Limited. Taxation Laws This Ruling applies in respect of the following sections of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: ïIncome Tax Act 1994, sections BD 2(2)(c), DE 1 and the definition of ìincome from employmentî in section OB 1. ïGoods and Services Tax Act 1985, the definition of ìtaxable activityî in section 6, and the definition of ìemployment under any contract of serviceî in section 6(3)(b). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement of a delivery driver by Restaurant Brands Limited (ìRBLî) pursuant to the Delivery Contract (dated October 2000), and in accordance with information in the Pizza Hut Contract Driver Information Driverís Copy (dated 30 October 2001), the KFC documentation (dated 19 September 2002) and the standard practice information provided to Inland Revenue in the ruling application (dated 30 October 2001) (collectively referred to as ìthe relevant documentsî), to deliver RBL products to RBL customers. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs following. Relationship between RBL and its delivery drivers 1.RBL prepares and sells a range of ìfast foodî products via Pizza Hut and KFC businesses. RBL sells its products through a chain of restaurants and provides a delivery service to its customers at some of these restaurants. RBL engages the services of delivery drivers to deliver its products to its customers from either Pizza Hut or KFC stores. 2.The relationship between the delivery drivers and Pizza Hut are governed by the following documents: ïThe ìDelivery Contractî ïThe guideline on ìDelivery Driver Paymentsî ïA form to compile the details of the driver, bank account, vehicle and motor insurance (currently known as the ìDriver and Vehicle Details Formî) ïThe ìContract Delivery Drivers Notice of Taxation Requirementsî ïThe guideline on ìMaking a Deliveryî ïThe ìCHAMPS ñ The Customer Is Whyî guidelines on dealing with a customer, and ïThe ìStandard Practice Informationî provided to Inland Revenue in the rulings application. 3.The relationship between the delivery drivers and KFC is governed by the following documents: ïThe ìDelivery Contractî ïThe ìContract Delivery Driversí Notice of Taxation Requirementsî ïThe ìDriver and Vehicle Details Formî ïThe ìCHAMPS ñ The Customer Is Whyî guidelines on dealing with a customer, and Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) 6 ïThe ìStandard Practice Informationî provided to Inland Revenue in the rulings application. The KFC documentation does not contain a copy of the guideline on ìDelivery Driver Paymentsî, or a copy of the guideline on ìMaking a Deliveryî. 4.The only difference of relevance is that KFC does not have its own company delivery vehicles, and no employees carry out home deliveries, whereas some of the Pizza Hut stores have company delivery vehicles that are used by employees to carry out home deliveries. Also, in some cases employees and the delivery drivers may deliver for the same Pizza Hut store. At one Pizza Hut store no delivery drivers are employed and therefore the employees carry out home deliveries in their personal cars. Terms of the Delivery Contract 5.Under the terms of the Delivery Contract the delivery driver agrees to: (a) use only the motor vehicles detailed in the Driver/Vehicle details (ìVehiclesî) in the performance of the contract (clause 4) (b) at all times observe all reasonable instructions given by RBL or its duly authorised representative in connection with delivery services (clause 4) (attention is drawn to any delivery driver guidelines issued by RBL from time to time) (c) be responsible for all costs and expenses of the driversí business including the costs and expenses of operating and maintaining all delivery vehicles (clause 5) (d) be liable for and shall indemnify RBL against any liability, loss, claim or proceedings arising out of or relating to the use of the vehicles in the provision of delivery services (clause 6) (e) maintain throughout the continuance of the agreement, at their own expense (clause 7): ïACC contributions, where the delivery drivers engage employees to perform services under the contract, make the appropriate ACC employer contribution as required on behalf of those employees (if any) ïa minimum of Third Party Property Damage Liability Insurance in respect of the vehicle. (f) produce to RBLís authorised representative documents that are necessary in the opinion of RBL to establish that the delivery driver has complied and continues to comply with their obligations under the contract (clause 9) (g) immediately refer any discrepancies on delivery with regard to collection of monies and delivery records to RBL (clause 10) (h) at the end of each delivery period provide to RBLís authorised representative: ïa complete account and record in the format specified by RBL (clause 11), and ïall monies collected by the delivery driver from customers of RBL during the course of that delivery period (clause 12). (i) be responsible to account for any cheques, credit card slips or monies received on behalf of RBL as soon as possible and make good any shortfall (clause 13) (j) wear any uniforms provided by RBL and ensure their proper care and maintenance. A $30 deposit is retained out of the first payment, to be returned to the delivery driver on return of the uniform in good conditions (fair wear and tear excepted) (clause 14) (k) provide and wear any additional uniform items as may be requested by RBL (eg black trousers) (clause 15) (l) provide a float of $30 for the purpose of making change during each delivery period (clause 16) (m) ensure that the RBL signage is correctly attached to Vehicles in accordance with instructions supplied (clause 17) (n) return upon request, clean and in good condition uniforms, delivery pouches and signage. Failure to do so will entitle RBL to deduct replacement cost from any monies owing to the delivery driver (clause 18). 6.The delivery driver is not liable to take out any insurance or be responsible for loss or damage to the products delivered (as long as the loss or damage does not result from the delivery driverís wilful default, negligence or breach of the Contract) (clause 8). 7.The delivery driver may not assign their rights under the contract without the prior written consent of RBL (clause 20). 8.In terms of RBLís obligations under the Delivery Contract: (a) RBL agrees to pay the delivery driver: ïfor services on a per delivery basis (clause 1) ïwithin 14 days of submission of an invoice for services in accordance with the rates set out in schedule A (currently an all inclusive payment of $3.90 per delivery \[as at 30 September 2001\] 7 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) (including GST if any)). The delivery driver is eligible for a petrol surcharge of 10 cents per delivery while petrol prices are above $1 per litre to be removed if petrol prices fall below $1 per litre as set out in the Attachment to the Delivery Contract. These rates may be reviewed from time to time by RBL at its discretion (clause 3) (b) Products carried by the delivery driver shall be at the risk of RBL (clause 8) (c) The engagement of the delivery driver does not commit RBL to a guarantee of any minimum remuneration (clause 1) (d) RBL is not responsible for any vehicle damage sustained as a result of the delivery driverís negligence or omission (clause 17) (e) RBL also reserves the right to engage the services of other contractors (clause 2) (f) The uniforms, delivery pouches and signage remain the property of RBL (clause 18). 9.Under clause 1 either party may terminate the Delivery Contract upon notice to the other party at the conclusion of any delivery. 10. The legal relationship between the delivery driver and RBL is described as that of ìprincipal and independent contractor and not that of employer and employeeî (clause 19). Delivery Driver Payments 11. The guideline on ìDelivery Driver Paymentsî states that the delivery drivers will be reimbursed at the current delivery payment rate per delivery, at a maximum of 2 deliveries per round trip (para 1). 12. In the case of a mistake and redelivery is required, the delivery driver will receive another delivery payment if the mistake was through no fault of their own (para 2). The following are examples of delivery driver payments/reimbursements that are available. 13. The delivery drivers receive payments/ reimbursements for: ïredeliveries that have resulted through overdue order complaints, only if the initial order was logged out from the restaurant (ie order has left the restaurant) after a 20 minute timeframe has lapsed ïredelivery due to wrongly supplied delivery details (eg wrong address/phone number supplied by RBL to the delivery driver) ïdelivery of hoax orders or orders cancelled after the product has left the restaurant (the product must be returned to the restaurant) ïredelivery due to miscellaneous circumstances outside the delivery driverís control ïcost of phone calls made to customers or back to the restaurant from a payphone. 14. The delivery drivers do not receive payments/ reimbursements for: ïthree or more home deliveries per delivery round, RBL policy is a maximum of 2 ïcomplaints indicating driverís mishandling of the order (eg pizza has been dropped by the delivery driver) ïredelivery due to the delivery driver not finding the address where the original delivery details are correct (where possible delivery drivers are required to call from a payphone to clarify the delivery details) ïcost of cellphone calls back to the restaurant ïredelivery due to missing items off the order (eg missing garlic bread). \[It is the delivery driverís responsibility to check that they have the entire order before leaving the restaurant\] ïtransporting stock between stores, stock transfers are the shift managerís responsibility, and not the delivery driverís responsibility. 15. Delivery drivers are not guaranteed any minimum per hour delivery payment. Notice of Taxation Requirements 16. The Contract Delivery Drivers Notice of Taxation Requirements is a guide which states that: ïThe delivery driver is not an employee of RBL ïThe delivery driver should seek independent taxation advice to understand their rights and obligations ïPAYE will not be deducted from payments for deliveries ïThe gross values of all payments received by the delivery driver for deliveries must be included in the delivery driverís annual income tax return (IR 3) ïThe delivery driver may be liable to pay provisional tax, and ïThe delivery driver must register for GST if the delivery driver has income of $40,000 or more. Delivery guidelines on making a delivery 17. The guidelines on ìMaking a Deliveryî have suggestions for the manner in which deliveries are to be made, handling customer complaints, and what to do in the event of emergencies. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) 8 CHAMPS ñ The Customer Is Why guidelines on dealing with a customer 18. The CHAMPS guidelines on dealing with a customer includes sample dialogue to address the customer in various circumstances (eg if the order has missing items), and the dress code requirements that must be met. 19. The delivery driver is also required to complete a shadow shift. A shadow shift is where a delivery driver goes out on the road with an experienced driver and watches them carry out a delivery shift. 20. Under these guidelines the delivery drivers are also required to wear name tags at all times. Standard Practice Information 21. The delivery drivers are not: ïentitled to overtime or sick pay ïrequired to belong to any union ïable to supervise employees of RBL ïable to access RBLís administration or support services, (they do have access to staff toilets and product discount) ïadvertising for work or have their own client base, however there is no restriction for them doing this. 22. Also, the delivery drivers: ïare able to decide the hours they work (provided work is expected to be available). It is standard practice that the delivery drivers make themselves available for rostered hours. ïprovide their own vehicles and associated equipment ïare free to work for another principal ïmust hold an appropriate driverís licence. 23. RBL trains the delivery drivers as to the manner in which deliveries are made. The delivery drivers are instructed as to what geographical area they will work in. 24. RBL employees take orders over the phone and decide the delivery sequence of the orders. A maximum of two to four separate orders can be delivered at any one time (to ensure quality control of the product). 25. From time to time RBL may pay at its discretion the delivery drivers a minimum of two deliveries per hour during certain hours, in order to ensure minimum coverage for RBL during quiet periods. 26. Although the delivery driver may find their own replacement driver, in practice this does not happen and generally another delivery driver is used by RBL. 27. RBL may from time to time at its discretion provide incentive payments or gifts to certain delivery drivers for maintaining delivery standards. The incentive payments are not contractually guaranteed. RBL proposes to implement a ìDriver-Bankî scheme whereby drivers will be ìcreditedî with 20 cents for every delivery they make. This amount will accumulate during the year and will be paid out as a lump sum on each driverís contract anniversary date. The scheme will not be included as a term of the Delivery Contract. There is no similar incentive scheme operating for RBL employees. Relationship between RBLís employees (employed under a different contract) and delivery drivers 28. RBL has a number of company owned delivery vehicles (ìcompany delivery vehiclesî) assigned to various Pizza Hut stores (these vehicles have the Pizza Hut logo painted on them and an identifiable red phone on the roof). Only RBL employees drive these vehicles (the delivery drivers do not drive these vehicles). The ratio of company delivery vehicles to the number of Pizza Hut stores is less than 50%. 29. In certain cases employees and delivery drivers may deliver for the same store. In the Pizza Hut stores where both employees and delivery drivers deliver for the same store, the employees also do other tasks (ie make the pizzas, cleaning etc). The delivery drivers are contracted purely to deliver the pizzas and are not asked to perform other tasks. 30. Where no company delivery vehicles are allocated to a store that store will only use delivery drivers and not RBL employees to deliver its products to customers. All KFC stores do not have company delivery vehicles and therefore rely solely on delivery drivers to carry out home deliveries. At one Pizza Hut store no delivery drivers are employed and therefore the employees carry out home deliveries in their personal cars. 31. No other collateral contracts, agreements, terms or conditions, written or otherwise, have a bearing on the conclusions reached in this Ruling. 9 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) The terms of the relevant documents entered into by RBL and the delivery driver are exactly the same as those provided to Inland Revenue in the ruling application dated 30 October 2001, except in relation to the following clauses of the Delivery Contract (dated October 2000) where the number of days or dollar amounts (as appropriate) may vary from time to time: ïClause 3, which states that RBL agrees to pay the delivery drivers within 14 days of submission of an invoice for their services in accordance with the rates set out in Schedule A. Schedule A only contains reference to the rate per delivery. ïClause 14, which states that a $30 deposit will be retained out of the delivery driverís first payment, to be returned to the delivery driver on the return of the uniform in good condition. ïClause 16, which provides that a float of $30 be carried by the delivery driver. (b) RBL will provide the delivery drivers with the notice of taxation requirements at the commence- ment of the contract and advise the delivery drivers that as independent contractors they are required to comply with their own income tax, GST and ACC obligations. (c) The actual relationship between RBL and the delivery driver is, and will continue to be during the period this Ruling applies, in accordance with the terms of the relevant documents in all material respects. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïFor the purposes of sections BD 2(2)(c) and DE 1, payments made by RBL to the delivery driver are not ìincome from employmentî as defined in section OB 1, so the driver is not prevented from claiming deductions under these sections by reason only that the driver earns ìincome from employmentî, and ïFor the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by the driver to RBL will not be excluded from the definition of ìtaxable activityî in section 6 of the GST Act by section 6(3)(b) of that Act as they are not made under ìcontracts of serviceî. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 26 October 2001 until 26 October 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 10th day of February 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) 10 PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 03/02 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Persons who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Johnson & Johnson (New Zealand) Limited and Depuy New Zealand Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CH 2, CH 3, CD 5, EB 1, EH 21, EH 22, EH 23, EH 24, BG 1 and GB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of a Deferred Employee Share Plan (ìDESPî) for the benefit of the employees of Johnson & Johnson (New Zealand) Limited and Depuy New Zealand Limited (ìthe Johnson & Johnson NZ Groupî). The Trustee of the DESP will be a New Zealand resident subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (New Zealand) Limited, being Johnson & Johnson New Zealand Share Plans Limited (ìthe Trusteeî). The Trust Deed, the Plan Rules and the Participation Contract (ìPCî) provided to the Inland Revenue Department on 8 March 2001 together form the basis of the Arrangement subject to this Ruling. These documents supersede all previous documents provided to the Commissioner in relation to this Ruling. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: 1.The DESP will be a key part of the Johnson & Johnsonís remuneration performance pay regime for its employees. The purpose of the DESP is to attract, retain and motivate such employees and to act as a deterrent to theft or misbehaviour and to give employees a clear identity as shareholders in Johnson & Johnson Inc. (the parent company of Johnson & Johnson in the United States (ìParent Companyî)). The DESP provides the employees with a chance to acquire rights to purchase shares in the Parent Company (ìAllocation Rightsî). 2.The DESP is part of the Johnson & Johnson Worldwide Incentive Plan (ìWWIPî). The WWIP is a plan operated by the Parent Company. Under the DESP, Allocation Rights will be offered to employees of the Johnson & Johnson NZ Group companies having regard to the following factors: ïEmployee category: Employees are divided into various position levels and awards vary according to the level of the employees ïIndividual performance: Each position has key performance targets, which are negotiated each year. The performance targets can vary from position to position (for example, sales budgets are set for sales positions) and individual performance is rated against the individualís specific targets, and ïCompany performance: The award available is multiplied by a company performance multiplier of 80% to 120%, which is determined by reference to the performance of the relevant operating subsidiary measured against factors such as sales, income, inventory level, cash flow, and profitability determined each year. 3.The number of shares subject to Allocation Rights each participating employee (ìParticipantî) would receive will be determined by the Johnson & Johnson Compensation Committee in the United States having regard to the above criteria and will be notified by the Parent Company to the Trustee. All shares are ordinary listed shares. 4.The quantum of awards (ie the shares) varies by position level, individual and company performance as stated above. Awards can range from a minimum of 3% to 10% of a Participantís salary subject to the company performance multiplier of 80% to 120%, so that the actual minimum and maximum could range between 2.4% to 12% of the Participantís salary. 5.To meet the entitlements of a Participant, shares are provided directly to the Trustee by the Parent Company. Neither the Parent Company nor the Johnson & Johnson NZ Group companies will provide monetary contributions to the Trustee to purchase shares. No company in the Group will claim any income tax deduction in New Zealand in respect of any shares the Parent Company provides to the Trustee. 6.The Johnson & Johnson NZ Group companies will provide monetary contributions to the Trust to undertake services such as accounting, auditing, consulting, and trust management (ìServicesî) or pay for these services directly to third parties. 7.Each company will claim income tax deductions in relation to their proportion of contributions paid for Services, which will be calculated and invoiced to each company on the basis of proportionate total head count of each company. 11 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) 8.Each company will expense contributions in the year in which they are paid for financial reporting purposes and claim income tax deductions in New Zealand in respect of contributions in the year in which they are paid by that company. 9.While a Participant will receive Allocation Rights under PC, those rights will not be in respect of specific shares and no specific shares will be allocated notionally or beneficially to the Participant. The Allocation Rights will be operative for up to a maximum period of ten years or earlier on termination of employment. 10. The Allocation Rights will be granted for nil consideration. A Participant may exercise their Allocation Rights, and for a consideration not exceeding $1 purchase the shares from the Trustee or receive proceeds from the sale of the shares by the Trustee. 11. There is no minimum vesting or non-exercise period in respect of the Allocation Rights the Participants would receive under the DESP. 12. Dividends received by the Trustee during any period will be either accumulated or allocated to deserving employees of the Johnson & Johnson NZ Group companies under the discretion of the Trustee acting on advice of the Johnson & Johnson Compensation Committee. 13. A Participantís interest in shares in the Trust cannot be transferred but will be subject to cancellation by the Trustee in the case of theft, defalcation or misbehaviour, etc. 14. On exercise of the Allocation Rights of a Participant, shares may be transferred in specie to the Participant, or cash distributions made by the Trustee to the Participant funded from the sale of shares. Exercise may take place at the discretion of the Participant and shall take place on termination of employment or 10 years after the date of purchase of the shares. 15. Further details of the Arrangement as contained in the Trust Deed, the Plan Rules and the PC (ìthe documentsî) are detailed below. Trust Deed 16. The Trust Deed provides that Johnson & Johnson (New Zealand) Limited wishes to establish a Trust for the employees of the Johnson & Johnson NZ Group companies. 17.

A Participant may accept an offer to enter a PC by signing a PC and returning it to the Trustee or by following such other method of acceptance set out in the offer (Rule 7.3). 21. A Participant, by entering into a PC, receives Allocation Rights (a right granted by the Trustee to the Participant to purchase shares under the DESP). 22. A Participant may exercise their Allocation Rights, and purchase all or part of the shares the subject of the PC from the Trustee for a consideration of $1, or receive proceeds from the sale of those shares by the Trustee (Rule 9.1(a)). 23. A Participant, on termination of employment or on the expiry of 10 years from the close of the offer period, is deemed to have exercised their Allocation Rights under the PC, and at the Participantís election, is to receive shares or proceeds from the sale by the Trustee of shares on which the Participant has Allocation Rights for a consideration of $1. (Rule 9.1(b) and (c)). 24. The Johnson & Johnson NZ Group companies may direct the Trustee in respect of Plan Shares to: ïTransfer the shares to any other incentive plan or scheme for the benefit of Employees, or ïTransfer the shares to a superannuation or similar fund for the benefit of Employees (Rule 11). 25. The Trustee may pay, apply or appropriate all or any part of income arising under the Trust fund to one or more of the Participants to meet the expenses of the Plan or for any other purpose relevant to the Plan (Rule 12.2). 26.

Upon termination or winding up of the Trust, each Participant will be deemed to have exercised their Allocation Rights under the PC and for a consideration not exceeding $1 can elect to purchase shares from the Trustee, or elect to receive the proceeds from the sale by the Trustee of shares. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) 12 Participation Contract (PC) 28. The PC is between the Trustee and a Participant under which the Trustee provides Allocation Rights to the Participant (Clause 2). 29. A Participant may exercise their Allocation Rights to purchase shares from the Trustee by giving the Trustee an ìExercise Noticeî (Clause 3). The Exercise Notice must specify (Clause 3.1): ïThe number of shares the Participant wishes to purchase, and ïWhether the Participant wishes to request the Trustee to sell on behalf of the Participant the shares the Participant has so purchased from the Trustee. 30. A Participant is deemed to have given an Exercise Notice in the following circumstances (Clause 3.2): ïTermination of employment ï10 years from date of purchase of the shares by the Trustee ïTermination of Trust. 31. On the receipt of a valid Exercise Notice, and for a consideration of $1, the Trustee shall either transfer the shares to the Participant or sell the shares on the Participantís behalf (Clause 3.5). 32. The number of shares to which a Participant is entitled will be adjusted for any bonus or rights issues (Clauses 4.1 and 4.2). Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: The executed documents being the Trust Deed, the Plan Rules and the Participation Contract will not differ in any material way to the draft documents provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on 8 March 2001. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: ïThere is no gross income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred by the Participants pursuant to the accrual rules by virtue of sections EH 21 to EH 24 in relation to their participation in the DESP. ïThe benefit received by a Participant under the DESP is ìmonetary remunerationî by virtue of section CH 2. The benefit is included in the gross income of the Participant under section CH 3. ïUnder section CH 2(6), a Participant derives gross income in respect of the shares obtained under the DESP when the Participant exercises their right to acquire shares from the Trustee. ïThe taxable value of the benefit received by a Participant under section CH 2 is the difference between the amount paid for the shares, being $1 (one dollar), and the market value of the shares on the day the right is exercised by the Participant. If the shares acquired by the Participant are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the value of the shares is the market value of the shares, on the day the rights are exercised, converted into New Zealand dollars using the relevant foreign exchange rate on that day. ïThe shares the Parent Company provides to the Trustee for the benefit of a Participant do not constitute gross income derived by the Participant under sections CD 5, CH 3, or EB 1. ïAny monetary contributions the Johnson & Johnson NZ Group companies provide to the Trustee in respect of Services do not constitute gross income derived by the Participant under sections CD 5, CH 3, or EB 1. ïSections BG 1 and GB 1 will not apply to negate or vary the conclusions above. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the income years ending 31 March 2001 to 31 March 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 10 th day of February 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 13 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) PRODUCT RULING ñ BR PRD 03/03 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by ORIX New Zealand Limited (ìORIXî). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (ìthe Actî) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CI 2, GC 15, GC 17 and BG 1, and Schedule 2, Part A clause 1(c). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of a motor vehicle by ORIX under its 12 x 12 x 12-month lease product, to a lessee who in turn provides the motor vehicle to an employee of the lessee, for their private use or enjoyment, or makes the motor vehicle available for such private use or enjoyment. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.ORIXís 12 x 12 x 12-month lease product (ìthe Productî) provides for a 12-month lease of a motor vehicle, with the possibility of the lessee entering into up to two further leases of that vehicle, each further lease being for a period of 12-months. The lease or leases granted under ORIXís 12 x 12 x 12- month lease product are subject to the terms and conditions contained in ORIXís Master Hire Agreement (ìMHAî) and Identification Schedule (ìIDSî). 2.There are no penalties imposed on the lessee if they do not take up one or both of the possible further leases of the vehicle under the Product. 3.There is no provision in the lease documentation that offers an incentive to the lessee if they take up one or both of the possible further leases of the vehicle under the Product. 4.The leasing process under the Product is as follows: ïAfter initial consultation to determine the leasing needs of the customer, ORIX will prepare a vehicle quotation outlining details of the vehicle and accessories, the lease term, the lease rate, the expected usage, the services included in the lease, and estimated market values of the vehicle at the commencement of each 12-month period under the Product. The lease term in the quote is described as ìa 12- month contract with the option of 2 further leases of 12 and 12-months respectivelyî. The lease rates quoted in respect of the two possible further leases are stipulated in the quote as being estimates only. At this time a credit form application will also be required to be completed if the lessee is a new customer. ïOnce the lesseeís credit application is approved, an MHA is drafted and sent to the lessee. The MHA contains all the terms and conditions under which ORIX will grant the lease of a vehicle to the lessee. Any vehicle subsequently leased to the customer will be subject to the terms and conditions of the MHA. ïIf the lessee accepts the quotation and wishes to lease the vehicle, a Vehicle Request Form (ìVRFî) is prepared by ORIX and sent to the customer for signing. Once this form is signed, an order is placed with the vehicle dealer by ORIX. ïUpon delivery of the vehicle, the customer signs an acknowledgment of receipt of delivery, and the vehicle contract is loaded onto the ORIX system. ORIX then issues an IDS outlining the specific details of that individual vehicle lease. In respect of this Product, the IDS specifies a 12-month lease term. ïThe MHA requires that an IDS must be completed in respect of each vehicle hired by ORIX to the customer, and provides that each IDS is required to be read and construed by reference to the MHA, as if each provision of the MHA were set out in the particular IDS. ïThere is no obligation or right of renewal for either the lessee or the lessor in respect of the lease. ïPrior to the end of each of the first two 12- month leases taken up under the Product, ORIX will advise the lessee in writing that the vehicle lease is due to expire, and ask whether the lessee requires a further 12-month lease of that vehicle. At this point the lessee is also required to provide the vehicleís odometer reading, and an excess kilometre charge (if any) is calculated. ïThe lessee may choose to roll over the excess kilometre charge (if any), so that it may be paid by way of instalments, together with the lease payments for the next 12-month lease under the Product, if such a further lease is taken up, as a convenient means of paying the charge. Similarly, the lessee may choose to roll over any refund for kilometres unused into the lease payments for the next 12-month lease under the Product, if such a further lease is taken up. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) 14 ïThe projected market values and lease rates for subsequent 12-month leases provided in the initial vehicle quotation are estimates only, taking into account anticipated depreciation on that vehicle in any prior leasing period. ORIX may seek a revision of the market value and/or lease rate prior to commencement of any subsequent lease, and is not bound to the initial quotation for any subsequent lease. ïIf the lessee does not wish to lease the vehicle for a further 12-month term, the vehicle is returned to ORIX upon expiry of the lease, and any excess kilometre charge is to be paid to ORIX by the lessee, or any refund for kilometres unused is to be paid to the lessee by ORIX. 5.The total term of the leases under the Product does not exceed 75% of the estimated useful life of the vehicle. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The motor vehicle leased by the lessee under the Product is provided to an employee of the lessee, for their private use or enjoyment, or made available for such private use or enjoyment. b)The lease does not constitute a ìfinance leaseî, as defined in section OB 1 of the Act. c)Any rental rate for a lease period under the Product is the same rental rate that would be offered to any other customer for that particular vehicle and lease period (taking into account the customer credit rating, customer fleet size, kilometre allowances, options, accessories, and general service components of the lease including vehicle maintenance) irrespective of whether a previous lease for that vehicle was entered into by that lessee. d)There is no contract, agreement, arrangement, plan, undertaking or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable) at the time of entering into any lease under the Product: ïthat any party will, or will if requested, renew, extend or vary the lease term ïthat the parties will enter into a further lease in respect of the vehicle ïthat there will be penalties for choosing not to enter into a further lease in respect of the vehicle, or ïconcerning, or otherwise affecting the Arrangement, other than the vehicle quotation, the MHA, the VRF and the IDS. e)All calculations, factors, and/or projections which are taken into account in formulating the rental rates applicable to each lease are not in any way based on a lease of the relevant motor vehicle for more than 12-months. f)ORIX may adjust the projected market value and lease rate prior to the commencement of any subsequent period under the Product, and is not bound by the initial quotation in this regard. g)The lease term in the quote is described as ìa 12- month contract with the option of 2 further leases of 12 and 12-months respectivelyî. h)The lease rates quoted in respect of the two possible further leases are stipulated in the quote as being estimates only. i)The number of replacement tyres stipulated in the IDS for the first lease period under the Product will reflect the number in the corresponding quote, and the lessee is entitled to the full amount thereof in that lease period, irrespective of whether a further lease of the vehicle is taken up. The number of replacement tyres for any subsequent lease periods will be negotiated at the commencement of that period, and will be reflected in the lease rate for that period. j)Any surplus replacement tyre allowance is forfeited, without refund, at the conclusion of a lease, if no subsequent lease term is taken up. k)ORIX and the lessee are not associated persons pursuant to section OD 7.

John Mora Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 33 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) NEW LEGISLATION RACING ACT 2003 ñ ASSOCIATED TAX CHANGES The Racing Act 1971 has been replaced with the Racing Act 2003, enacted on 10 March 2003. The new Act will provide effective governance arrangements for the racing industry, facilitate betting on galloping, harness, and greyhound races and other sporting events, and promote the long-term viability of New Zealand racing. The Act makes consequential amendments to the Gaming Duties Act 1971, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, and the Income Tax Act 1994. Background Previous reviews of the racing industry have highlighted that the dual governance structure of the racing industry was neither efficient nor effective, was not appropriate for the future performance of the industry, and an impediment to effective coordination of industry policy. The Racing Bill was introduced into Parliament on 30 May 2001. Key features The Racing Act 2003 replaces the New Zealand Racing Industry Board and the Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) with one single boardóthe New Zealand Racing Board. One board will simplify the governance of the racing industry. The New Zealand Racing Board will determine the racing calendar, conduct racing betting and sports betting (previously undertaken by the TAB), make rules relating to betting, and distribute funds obtained from betting to the racing codes (New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing Incorporated, Harness Racing New Zealand Incorporated, and New Zealand Greyhound Racing Association (Incorporated)). The Racing Board will undertake betting which was previously undertaken by the racing clubs and the TAB. The Board will retain the ìTABî brand name. Changes to the Gaming Duties Act 1971 The Act repeals a number of the definitions in section 3 of the Gaming Duties Act. The definitions repealed are: ïBetting profits ïFixed-odds race betting losses ïFixed-odds sports betting profits ïRace ïRacing club ïSpecial investments ïTotalisator club ïFixed-odds race betting losses ïFixed-odds sports betting losses ïGross investments ïRace meeting ïRestricted totalisator club ïSports event The Act inserts new definitions into section 3 of the Gaming Duties Act of ìBoardî, ìfixed-odds racing bettingî, ìsports bettingî, ìtotalisator racing bettingî, ìequalisator bettingî, and ìwinning dividendî. The new Act repeals sections 4-7 of the Gaming Duties Act and inserts new sections 4 and 5 in their place. The new section 4 provides a simpler formula to determine betting, profits for totalisator racing, sports betting and fixed-odds racing betting on which gaming duty, at a rate of 20%, is imposed. Totalisator racing The new betting profit formula for totalisator racing betting is: 8/9 x (amounts - refunds) - winning dividends - fractions where: amounts is the amounts received by the Board or its agent (including GST) for totalisator racing betting including the net return from bets laid off refunds is the amount of refunds (including GST) winning dividends is the amount of all winning dividends fractions is the amount retained by the Board under section 60(3) of the Racing Act 2003 in respect of totalisator race betting. Sports betting and fixed-odds racing betting The betting profits for sports betting and fixed-odds racing betting is: amounts - refunds - dividends where: amounts is the amount received by the Board (or agent) for sporting or racing events refunds is the total amount of refunds (including GST) dividends is the total amount of dividends for the sporting or racing event. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) 34 The new section 5(1) provides that the Board must provide a return to the Commissioner, in the prescribed form, of the totalisator duty payable by the Board for all racing betting and sports betting on events for which results have been declared in the previous month. The return and payment of the duty is due on the 20 th of each month. Section 5(2) provides that if the event is held over two or more days which straddle a month, the event is regarded as having been held in the month in which the last day occurs. Section 5(3) states that totalisator duty payable by the Board constitutes a debt due and payable to the Crown. Changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 The meaning of the term ìsupplyî in section 5 of the GST Act is amended by repealing subsections (8) and (9), which deemed money bet on any race or sporting event to be a supply of services. The Act inserts a new subsection (8) which provides that any racing betting or sports betting conducted by the Board must be regarded as a supply of services by the Board. Section 10 of the GST Act is amended by repealing subsections (12), (12A) and (13), which deal with determining the consideration in money for the supply of betting services. The Racing Act inserts two new subsections, (12) and (13). The new subsection (12) provides that the consideration in money for the supply of services for: ïRacing betting or sports betting is treated as the amount received by the New Zealand Racing Board (or its agent), plus the net return of bets laid off by the Board less all refunds and winning dividends ïEqualisator betting is treated as the amount received by a racing club. The new subsection (13) provides that ìequalisator bettingî, ìNew Zealand Racing Boardî, ìracing clubî, ìracing bettingî, and ìsports bettingî have the same meaning as set out in section 5 of the Racing Act 2003. Changes to the Income Tax Act 1994 The Racing Act also makes a number of minor consequential amendments to the Income Tax Act, namely: ïThe reference to ìTotalisator Agency Boardî in section CB 4(1)(i)(i) has been changes to ìNew Zealand Racing Boardî. ïCB 4(1)(i)(ii), which refers to the ìNew Zealand Racing Industry Boardî has been changed. ïThe reference to ìThe New Zealand Racing Conferenceî in section CB 4(1)(i)(iii) has been changed to ìNew Zealand Thoroughbred Racingî. ïThe reference to ìsection 2 of the Racing Act 1971î in section CB 4(1)(i)(vi), section EH24(1)(c)(i) and in the definition of excepted financial arrangment in section EH14 has been replaced with ìsection 5 of the Racing Act 2003î. ïThe reference to the ìRacing Act 1971î in section CB 9(c) has been replaced with the ìRacing Act 2003î. ïThe reference to ìestablished under part VB of the Racing Act 1971î in sections EH24(1)(c)(ii) and in the definition of excepted financial arrangment in section EH 14 has been replaced with ìadministered under Part 6 of the Racing Act 2003î. Application date The Racing Act 2003 comes into force on a date to be appointed by the Governor-General by Order in Council. 35 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) HIGHER THRESHOLD FOR AUTOMATIC RELEASE OF INCOME TAX REFUNDS The threshold under which income tax refunds arising from income statements (personal tax summaries) are automatically released to taxpayers has been raised from $50 to $200 by Order-in-Council. Under the change to section MD 1(1A) of the Income Tax Act 1994, taxpayers with refunds of $200 or less will have these refunds released to them without having to confirm that the particulars contained in an income statement are correct, 30 days after the issue of the income statement. These taxpayers will need to contact Inland Revenue only if the details in the income statement are incorrect or if they have other income. For refunds over $200, taxpayers will still need to contact Inland Revenue to confirm that the income statement is correct, and the refund is owed to them. The Government announced the change to the threshold in December 2002. The higher threshold will apply to income tax refunds arising from income statements issued in respect of the 2002-03 and future income years. Income Tax (Refund of Excess Tax) Order 2003 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) 36 Example If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8(3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the otherís interests, so they each hold an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî which must be disclosed. They are not required to account for attributed foreign income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules. In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in a FIF. However, only the FIF interests should be disclosed on an IR 478, IR 439, IR 440, IR 441, IR 442 or IR 443 forms (see ìOverlap of interestsî below). Foreign company interests A resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the companyís country of residence. The 2003 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company which is an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on an Interest in a foreign company disclosure schedule (IR 477 or IR 479) form. The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons: ïAttributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFCís country of residence. ïTo identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company which is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (ie, Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States of America). LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. 2003 INTERNATIONAL TAX DISCLOSURE EXEMPTION ITR14 Introduction Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires people to disclose interests they hold in foreign entities. Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 2003. This exemption may be cited as ìInternational Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR14î, and the full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 2003 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2002 exemption. Interests held by residents Disclosure is required by residents for these interests: ïan interest held in an FIF ïan ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies in respect of all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. An ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determining exemption from disclosure it includes these interests: 1.an income interest held directly in a foreign company 2.an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company 3.an income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8 (3) of the ITA. 37 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) ïThe requirement for a CFC which is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993. Foreign investment fund interests An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an ìinterest in a foreign investment fundî specified within section CG 15(1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed: ïrights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg a unit trust) ïan entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme ïan entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy ïan interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press). However, any interest that does not fall within the above types or which is specifically excluded as an interest in an FIF under section CG 15(2) does not have to be disclosed. The following are listed in section CG 15(2) as exclusions from what constitutes an interest in an FIF: ïAn ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî in a CFC (separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company). ïAn interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (ie Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States of America). ïAn interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme. ïA qualifying foreign private annuity, unless an election has been made to remain within the FIF regime, by the due date for filing the personís 2003 tax return. See Inland Revenueís booklet Overseas private pensions (IR 257) for more information. ïInterests in foreign entities held by a natural person other than in that personís capacity as a trustee, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquiring the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. ïAn interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency. ïAn interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years. A resident who holds an interest in an FIF at any time during the 2003 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form Interest in foreign investment fund disclosure schedule and worksheet (IR 439, IR 440, IR 441, IR 443). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed four forms to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in an FIF using one of the methods. The respective forms to use for whichever FIF income calculation method you choose to apply is as follows: ïIR 439 form for the accounting profits method ïIR 440 form for the branch equivalent method ïIR 441 form for the comparative value method ïIR 443 form for the deemed rate of return method. Overlap of interests A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in an FIF. For example, a person with an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in an FIF. However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either the IR 477 or IR 479 forms or the IR 439, IR 440, IR 441 or IR 443 forms) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to file: 1.Use the appropriate IR 439, IR 440, IR 441, IR 442 or IR 443 form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular: ïan interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held) ïan income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country ïan interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) 38 2.Use the IR 447 or IR 479 forms to disclose:an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the IR 439, IR 440, IR 441, IR 442 or IR 443 forms. Disclosure is not required on any of the forms for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not a FIF interest. An example is an interest which is covered by the Schedule 3, Part A exclusion from the FIF rules. Interests held by non-residents The 2003 disclosure exemption removes the need for interests held by non-residents in foreign companies and FIFs to be disclosed. This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs. The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold. However, under the international tax rules non-residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC regime (section CG 6(1) of the ITA 1994). In addition, under section CG 16(4) of the ITA 1994 a non-resident is not to be treated as deriving or incurring any FIF income or loss. The disclosure of non-residents holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules. Summary The 2003 international tax disclosure exemption removes the requirement of a resident to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in an FIF) that does not constitute an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî (ie it is less than 10%). The disclosure exemption is not affected by the foreign companyís country of residence. Further, an interest in an FIF must be disclosed. The 2003 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs. Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This exemption may be cited as ìInternational Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR14î 1.Reference This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 2003. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are interests in foreign investment funds, unless that interest is held by a non-resident of New Zealand. 2.Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 3.Exemption (i) Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in a foreign investment fund), in the income year ending 31 March 2003, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, unless the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî, as defined by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. (ii) Any non-resident person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund in the income year ending 31 March 2003, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply: ïno attributed foreign income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company by virtue of section CG 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and/or ïno foreign investment fund income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign investment fund by virtue of section CG 16(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This exemption is signed on the 2nd day of April 2003.

The conversion rates for the first six months of each income year are published in the Tax Information Bulletin following the end of the September quarter and the rates for the full 12-month rates at the end of each income year. To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Table A Use this table to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: ïbranch equivalent income or loss under the CFC or FIF rules under section CG 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 ïforeign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 ïFIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits, comparative value (except if Table B applies) or deemed rate of return methods under section CG 16(11) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Key X Y ìxî is the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the next day on which they were quoted. ìyî is the average of the mid-month exchange rates for that month and the previous 11 months. Example 1 A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 September 2002. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD). HKD 200,000 ̃ 3.4624 = NZ$57,763.40 A similar calculation would be needed for an FIF using the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Example 2 A taxpayer with a 31 March balance date purchases shares in a Philippines company (which is an FIF) for 350,000 pesos (PHP) on 7 September 2002. Using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods, the cost is converted as follows: PHP 350,000 ̃ 24.4034 = NZ$14,342.26 Alternatively, the exchange rate can be calculated by averaging the exchange rates ìxî that apply to each complete month in the foreign companyís accounting period. Example 3 A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 2002 and has a balance date of 31 March 2003. During this period, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singapore dollars was derived. (i)Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2002: (0.8216 + 0.8627 + 0.8440 + 0.8047 + 0.8349) ̃ 5 = 0.83358 (ii) Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD 500,000 ̃ 0.83358 = NZ$599,822.45 Table B Table B lists the end-of-month exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for the six-month period ending 31 March 2003. Use this table for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: ïItems ìaî (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the income year) and ìcî (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the previous income year) of the comparative value formula. ïForeign tax credits paid on the last day of any month calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 15, No 4 (April 2003) 40 Example 4 A New Zealand resident with a balance date of 30 September 2002 held an interest in an FIF resident in Thailand. The market value of the FIF interest at 30 September 2002 (item ìaî of the comparative value formula) was 500,000 Thailand baht (THB). THB 500,000 ̃ 20.0730 = NZ$24,909.08 Note: If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in these tables, contact one of New Zealandís major trading banks. 41 Inland Revenue
