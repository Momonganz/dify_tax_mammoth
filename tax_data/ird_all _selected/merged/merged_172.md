This Interpretation Statement explains the residence rules in the Income Tax Act 2007, and applies from 1 April 2014. 2. The analysis in this Interpretation Statement is in three parts. The first part (from \[17\]) deals with the rules governing the residence of natural persons (individuals), and discusses the relationship between those rules and the residence articles contained in New Zealand’s double taxation agreements (DTAs). It also discusses the transitional resident rules. The second part (from \[308\]) explains the residence rules for companies. It also explains the consequences of a company being a dual resident, and briefly discusses the relationship of the company residence rules to the controlled foreign company (CFC) regime. The final part (from \[432\]) of this Interpretation Statement deals with residence and the taxation regime for trusts. 3. This Interpretation Statement updates and replaces “Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) Rules 1989: New Residence Rules” (Public Information Bulletin No 180, June 1989). It also replaces the following items:  “Returning resident’s visas – when a person seeking such a visa is resident for tax purposes” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 11, December 1999);  “Is a person working overseas while on leave of absence for two years resident for tax purposes?” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 10, November 1999);  “Determining a person’s permanent place of abode” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 1, July 1995); and  “Residence status of public servant and family while overseas” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 11, April 1995). 4. The following items should not be relied on to the extent that they are inconsistent with this Interpretation Statement:  “Temporary exemption from tax on foreign income for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) (that item’s inconsistency with this Interpretation Statement is noted at \[232\]); and  “Temporary exemption for transitional residents” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) (that item’s inconsistency with this Interpretation Statement is noted at \[233\]). 3 Relevance of residence 5. The concept of residence is a central feature of the Act and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GSTA 1985). 6. Under the Act, residence is relevant for determining whether a person is assessable for tax on worldwide income or only on New Zealand-sourced income. New Zealand residents are assessable on worldwide income (other than exempt income and excluded income), and non-residents are assessable only on New Zealand-sourced income (other than exempt income and excluded income) (s BD 1(5)). New Zealand residents may be entitled to a credit for foreign income tax paid on foreign-sourced income (s LJ 2). 7. Tax residence is relevant to the rules for the taxation of interests in foreign superannuation schemes. From 1 April 2014, lump sum withdrawals or transfers from foreign superannuation schemes will generally be taxed on an amount that approximates the gains made during the period the person is a New Zealand resident under either one of two new methods – the “schedule” method or the “formula” method. Both of these methods require the person to determine the length of their “assessable period” (CF 3(8)). The duration of a person’s tax residence is relevant to determining the length of the “assessable period”. 8. In addition to this, there is an exemption period for lump sum foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers for people who acquired the interest in the scheme when they were non-resident 1 (see ss CW 28B and CF 3). The exemption period runs until the end of the 48 th month after the month in which the person satisfied the residence requirements in the Act ─ similar to the temporary exemption for transitional residents 2 ─ (see s CF 3(6)). Unlike the transitional resident rules there is no minimum period of non-residence required to qualify for the exemption period. 9. From 1 April 2014 the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes. However, one of the situations where the FIF rules will continue to apply is where a person acquires an interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while they are a New Zealand resident (see the definition of “FIF superannuation interest” in s YA 1). 10. Tax residence is also relevant to a person’s eligibility for working for families tax credits under the family scheme. However, there are further additional residence requirements that either the principal caregiver or the dependent child must meet for the purposes of the family scheme. These relate to: being “New Zealand resident” as defined in s MA 8 (which means ordinarily and lawfully resident, other than only because of holding a temporary entry class visa), presence in New Zealand, and the transitional residence status of the principal caregiver and their spouse/partner (ss MC 5 and MD 7). 11. Under the GSTA 1985, residence is relevant for determining the place of supply of goods and services. Supplies by residents are deemed to be made in New Zealand, and supplies by non-residents are generally deemed to be made outside New Zealand (s 8(2) of the GSTA 1985). It is noted that the term “resident” in the GSTA 1985 means resident as determined in accordance with ss YD 1 and YD 2 (excluding s YD 2(2)) of the Act. However the definition of “resident” in the GSTA 1985 3 also provides that: 1 Provided they have not had such an exemption period before acquiring the interest. 2 Discussed from \[224\]. 3 It is noted that if enacted the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2013, introduced on 22 November 2013, will amend the definition of “resident” in the GSTA 1985. The proposed amendment would result in the back-dating rules in s YD 1(4) and (6) being ignored in determining the residence or non-residence of natural persons for GST purposes. 4  a person is deemed to be resident in New Zealand to the extent that they carry on a taxable activity or any other activity here while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity; and  a person who is an unincorporated body (which includes a partnership, a joint venture, and the trustee of a trust) is deemed to be resident in New Zealand if the body has its centre of administrative management here. It is also noted that supplies by non-residents may be treated as being supplied in New Zealand under s 8(3), (4) and (4B) of the GSTA 1985. 12. Residence under the Act may also be relevant for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (the SLSA 2011). Borrowers who are not physically in New Zealand may, in some circumstances, be treated as being physically in New Zealand. Some of the circumstances in which a borrower may be treated as being physically in New Zealand are subject to the condition that the borrower is tax resident in New Zealand (for example in the case of an unplanned absence from New Zealand, or unexpected delay in returning to New Zealand). Being physically in New Zealand, or treated as such, is relevant to whether a borrower is “New Zealand-based” 4 for the purposes of the SLSA 2011. Whether a borrower is New Zealand-based determines if their loan is interest-free, and also determines the repayment obligations that will apply to them. 13. In addition, tax residence may be relevant to a New Zealand-based borrower’s filing requirements under the SLSA 2011. Examples 14. Throughout this Interpretation Statement, examples are given to illustrate points made. These examples are merely illustrative; they obviously do not cover the infinite number of factual scenarios that may arise. The relevant legislative provisions must be considered and applied to each case on its particular facts. That is, conclusions should not be drawn by determining whether the facts of a particular case may be analogous with a particular example, but rather on the basis of applying the correct tests established by the law. There are no “bright- line” tests, and different results in different examples should not be construed as indicating that there are. The examples deal with discrete residence tests, as identified by the headings under which they appear. They do not consider other tests – for example the permanent place of abode examples do not consider the day-count rules, any potential DTA implications, or the application of the transitional resident rules. Legislation 15. “New Zealand resident” is defined in s YA 1 of the Act, which states: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise,— ... New Zealand resident— (a) means a person resident in New Zealand under— (i) section EY 49 (Non-resident life insurer becoming resident): (ii) sections YD 1 to YD 3 (which relate to residence): (b) is defined in section MA 8 (Some definitions for family scheme) for the purposes of subparts MA to MF and MZ (which relate to tax credits for families) 4 Defined in s 4(1) of the SLSA 2011. 5 16. Section YD 1 deals with the residence of natural persons (individuals) – discussed from \[17\]. Section YD 2 deals with the residence of companies – discussed from \[308\]. Analysis Part 1: Residence of natural persons (individuals) Overview 17. An individual is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period (s YD 1(3)) (“the 183-day rule”). The person will then be treated as resident from the first of those 183 days (s YD 1(4)). A person is also resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere (s YD 1(2)). 18. A person who is resident by virtue only of the 183 day rule will stop being a New Zealand resident if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period (s YD 1(5)) (“the 325-day rule”). The person will then be treated as not resident from the first of those 325 days (s YD 1(6)). 19. However the permanent place of abode test is the overriding residence rule for individuals. This means that a person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period will remain a New Zealand resident if they continue to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Equally, a person who is present in New Zealand for less than 183 days in a 12-month period is still a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. A person who is absent for more than 325 days in a 12-month period, but who has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at any time during that period, cannot cease to be resident any earlier than the day they lose their permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 20. The permanent place of abode test is most relevant to people leaving New Zealand. People moving to New Zealand will typically be resident under the 183- day rule and will not need to consider the permanent place of abode test. However in situations where someone moves between New Zealand and another country or countries, New Zealand residence could be triggered under either test. Also, someone moving to New Zealand could potentially establish a permanent place of abode prior to the first day of their presence under the 183-day rule. 21. In applying the 183-day and 325-day rules, a person present in New Zealand for part of a day is treated as present in New Zealand for the whole day and not absent for any part of the day (s YD 1(8)). For example, if someone arrived in New Zealand at 3pm on 28 July, that day would be counted as a full day of presence. Presence in New Zealand embassies or New Zealand consulate offices overseas is not presence in New Zealand. 22. A person who is personally absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government is treated as a New Zealand resident during that time (s YD 1(7)). See further from \[202\]. 23. A person who is employed under the recognised seasonal employment scheme will be treated as non-resident even if they satisfy the 183-day rule, provided they do not have a permanent place of abode here (s YD 1(11)). See further from \[170\]. 24. The discussion of the residence rules for individuals is structured as follows: 6 Flowchart – How to establish if an individual is tax resident in NZ .................................. 7 Permanent place of abode ........................................................................................ 8 Examples illustrating the concept of “permanent place of abode” ................................... 25 The day-count rules ................................................................................................. 31 The 183-day rule ..................................................................................................... 31 Examples illustrating the 183-day rule ....................................................................... 32 Non-resident seasonal workers .................................................................................. 33 The 325-day rule ..................................................................................................... 33 Examples illustrating the 325-day rule ....................................................................... 34 Relationship between the PPA test and the day-count rules ........................................... 36 Examples illustrating the relationship between the 183-day and 325-day rules ................ 37 Government service rule .......................................................................................... 38 Examples illustrating the government service rule ....................................................... 40 Transitional resident rules......................................................................................... 41 Examples illustrating the transitional resident rules ...................................................... 42 Changes in residence ............................................................................................... 44 Relevance of double taxation agreements ................................................................... 45 Examples illustrating the DTA tie-breaker tests ........................................................... 52 Flowchart – How to establish if an individual is tax resident in New Zealand 25. The following flowchart sets out the matters to be considered in establishing if an individual is tax resident in New Zealand, and shows the interrelationship between the various residence tests for individuals. 26. It should be noted that if someone is tax resident in New Zealand and also in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, the DTA will determine what taxing rights each country has. See further from \[246\]. 27. It should also be noted that new migrants or returning New Zealanders may be eligible to be transitional residents, and entitled to tax exemptions for certain foreign-sourced income. See further from \[224\]. 7 Yes 183-day rule Have you been in NZ for more than 183 days in total in any 12-month period? No No Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes No No Not Resident Resident Resident Resident Resident Resident 3 Not Non-resident seasonal workers Are you employed under the recognised seasonal employer policy published by the Department of Labour? (see: http://www.dol.govt.nz/initiatives/strategy/rse) Government service rule Are you absent from NZ in the service of the Government of NZ? 325-day rule Have you been out of NZ for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period? Is there a dwelling in NZ you could live in on an enduring rather than temporary basis? If “no”, you do not have a PPA in NZ. Is the dwelling your permanent place of abode? Consider whether it is the lasting or enduring place you usually live, or a place you can live when required, in a locality with which you have a durable connection and that is a current focal point of your living 2 , taking into account the following: Whether your presences in NZ / absences from NZ have been for continuous or interrupted periods; The length of your presences in or absences from NZ; Your overall connections with NZ and with the dwelling, including: ◦ The nature and use of the dwelling and your connection with it (consider ownership, past use and intended future use); ◦ Your intention as to your future presence in / absence from NZ. Also consider what has occurred if it is different to what was intended; ◦ The strength of your family and social ties in NZ (location of family and friends, other social ties such as memberships of clubs etc). ◦ Any employment or business interests or ties you have in NZ; ◦ Any economic ties you have to NZ; ◦ Any personal property you have in NZ. Permanent place of abode (PPA) Do you have a PPA in NZ? Yes Have you satisfied the 183-day rule since last satisfying the 325-day rule? 1 1 The back-dating of the 183-day and 325- day rules means that travel in and out of NZ may result in an overlap between those rules. See further from \[188 \]. 3 If you subsequently satisfy the 183-day rule, the back-dating of that rule may mean that you are in fact resident as at this date. See further from \[188\].

The permanent place of abode test is the overriding residence rule for individuals. It primarily needs to be considered in relation to people leaving New Zealand, though it may also be relevant in other contexts. 29. The discussion below details why the Commissioner considers that the permanent place of abode test requires the person to have a dwelling in New Zealand. The discussion of the practical application of the test, including the factors to be considered in determining whether a particular dwelling in New Zealand will be a person’s permanent place of abode, starts from starts from \[66\]. Examples are set out from \[123\]. 30. The discussion of the permanent place of abode test is structured as follows: Meaning of “permanent place of abode”...................................................................... 8 Is a dwelling required for a person to have a permanent place of abode? ..................... 9 The ordinary meaning or meanings of “place of abode” ........................................... 9 The purpose of section YD 1(2) ............................................................................ 11 Conclusion on whether “place of abode” requires a dwelling ..................................... 13 “Permanent” place of abode ................................................................................... 14 The ordinary meaning of “permanent” ................................................................... 14 The purpose of section YD 1(2) ............................................................................ 15 When will a person’s place of abode be their permanent place of abode?...................... 15 What does it mean to have a dwelling in NZ?............................................................ 16 If a person has a dwelling in NZ, when will it be their permanent place of abode? ......... 17 Material factors to consider .................................................................................. 18 Continuity and duration of presence in NZ ........................................................... 18 Durability of association .................................................................................... 19 The nature and use of the dwelling and the person’s connection with the dwelling . 20 Intention ...................................................................................................... 21 Family and social ties ..................................................................................... 21 Employment, business interests and economic ties ............................................ 22 Personal property .......................................................................................... 22 Other factors ................................................................................................. 23 “A” permanent place of abode ................................................................................ 23 Summary – permanent place of abode ....................................................................... 24 Acquiring and losing a permanent place of abode ........................................................ 24 Examples illustrating the concept of “permanent place of abode” ................................... 25 Meaning of “permanent place of abode” 31. Section YD 1(2) states: YD 1 Residence of natural persons ... Permanent place of abode in New Zealand (2) Despite anything else in this section, a person is a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere. 32. The term “permanent place of abode” is not defined in the Act. Its meaning has been expressed in different ways in cases that have considered the test. “Permanent place of abode” has been described as meaning a lasting or enduring place where one usually lives (Case F138 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,237), and as a place 9 in which one can live or dwell when required, in a locality with which the person has a durable connection and that is a current focal point of one’s living (See further \[67\]) (Case Q55 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,313). 33. Case F138, Case Q55 and TRA 43/11 \[2013\] NZTRA 10 5 make it clear that a permanent place of abode can either be a place someone has lived (ie, a place where one “usually lives”) or a place someone could live in the future (ie, a place in which one “can live or dwell”). 34. To determine whether a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode, the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand and the durability of the person’s association with their place of abode here must be considered (FCT v Applegate 79 ATC 4307 (FCAFC), Case H97 (1986) 8 NZTC 664, Case J98 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,555, Case Q55). Is a dwelling required for a person to have a permanent place of abode? 35. There is a question as to whether “place of abode” in the context of s YD 1(2) refers to New Zealand generally, a city or locality within New Zealand, or a dwelling in New Zealand. The Commissioner considers “place of abode” in the context of s YD 1(2) means a place where a person dwells and sleeps and that is used as a base for their daily activities (Case F138, Case Q55). Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the permanent place of abode test requires that the person have a dwelling in New Zealand. This view is consistent with the New Zealand cases that have considered the permanent place of abode test. The ordinary meaning or meanings of “place of abode” 36. The ordinary meaning of the phrase “place of abode” is open to different interpretations, based on the meanings of the words “place” and “abode”. These words are defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, 3 rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2013, accessed 3 March 2014) (relevantly) as meaning: place, n.1 5. a. A particular part or region of space; a physical locality, a locale; a spot, a location. Also: a region or part of the earth’s surface. ... b. The amount or quantity of space actually occupied by a person or thing; the position of a body in space, or in relation to other bodies; situation, location. ... 9. a. A dwelling, a house; a person's home; (formerly) spec. a mansion, a country house with its surroundings, the principal residence on an estate. Also: a farm or farmstead. ... 10. A particular spot or area inhabited or frequented by people; a city, a town, a village. ... abode, n.1 3. The action of dwelling or living permanently in a place; habitual residence. Freq. in place of abode. Also fig. Cf. ABIDING n. 3b. 4. A place of ordinary residence; a dwelling place; a house or home. Cf. ABIDING n. 3a. Now somewhat literary. 5 It is noted that TRA 43/11 is on appeal to the High Court. 10 37. As can be seen, the word “place” could mean either a specific point in space (ie, a particular address) or a location more generally (ie, a city or locality, or even a country). The word “abode” could refer to a specific abode (in the sense of a house or home), or it could refer more loosely to the fact of living somewhere. The phrase “place of abode” is therefore open to being interpreted as referring either to a particular house or dwelling, or to someone having a place of abode somewhere more generally in New Zealand. 38. Section YD 1(2) refers to someone having a permanent place of abode “in” New Zealand. This indicates that New Zealand in general could not be someone’s “place of abode” for the purposes of s YD 1(2). If it were intended for that to be the case, the test could simply have been drafted such that a person would be a New Zealand resident “if New Zealand is their permanent place of abode”. Nevertheless, the phrase “place of abode” in s YD 1(2) is still open to being interpreted, on an ordinary reading of those words, as meaning either a specific dwelling or a more general location in New Zealand. 39. The New Zealand case law on the permanent place of abode test indicates that the narrower of those interpretations is appropriate – that is, that “place of abode” refers to a dwelling. In Case F138, Judge Bathgate considered the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition of “abode”, being: 1. The action of waiting; 2. A temporary stay; 3. Habitual residence; 4. A place of habitation; house or home. 40. In the context of the residence provisions in the Income Tax Act 1976, Judge Bathgate concluded that the phrase “place of abode” means “a place where one usually lives” (at 60,244). This is the same meaning Judge Bathgate had held the term to have in the context of the first home rebate provisions he considered in Case F96 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,036. Judge Bathgate observed in Case F138 that, in light of the English authorities holding the phrase to include both business and residential addresses, the interpretation he had given “place of abode” in Case F96 could possibly be regarded as too narrow in contexts other than the one considered in that case. However, having considered the dictionary definition of “abode”, he interpreted “place of abode” in the same way he had in Case F96, which indicates that he considered that interpretation was not too narrow in the context of the residence provisions. Therefore, it is clear that by “a place where one usually lives” Judge Bathgate meant “place” as in the actual physical dwelling or house where one usually lives, not the “place” more generally. 41. In Case Q55, Judge Barber stated that having a permanent place of abode means “having a place in which one can live or dwell whenever it is convenient for one to do so and which is a current focal point of one's living” (at 5,319 – 5,320). Judge Barber went on to say at 5,320: I consider that “has a permanent place of abode” does not require that a dwelling be always vacant and available for the taxpayer to live in; but that there is a dwelling in New Zealand which will be available to the taxpayer as a home when, and if, that taxpayer needs it, and that the taxpayer intends to retain that connection on a durable basis, with that locality. I do not think that a durable connection with a locality alone could create “a permanent place of abode” where a dwelling is not owned or tenanted or otherwise available such as the house of a parent, or relative, or friend. I consider that the phrase “has a permanent place of abode” requires, inter alia, the availability of a place in which to dwell but that the existence of a home or dwelling does not necessarily create a permanent place of abode. The latter concept also requires some durability of connection with a locality as well as the availability of a place in which to sleep. There must be many people who have no permanent place of abode. Some of these people may have a number of residences. 11 I think that the strength of a person’s ties with New Zealand is the paramount factor in assessing residency but those ties must include the availability on a permanent basis (continuing indefinitely) of a place in which to dwell and sleep if that person is to have a permanent place of abode somewhere in New Zealand. The enduring availability of a dwelling is a fundamental criterion to having a permanent place of abode, but it is not decisive on its own. 42. This passage from Judge Barber’s judgment in Case Q55 was cited in TRA 43/11, and Judge Sinclair’s approach in that case is consistent with the view that there must be a dwelling in New Zealand that the person could reside in for them to potentially have a permanent place of abode here. 43. In all other New Zealand cases in which taxpayers have been held to have a permanent place of abode here, there has been a dwelling that has been regarded as the taxpayer’s permanent place of abode: see for example Case F139 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,245, Case H97, Case J41 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,240 and Case J98. 44. In Case F139, Judge Barber considered that the taxpayer’s permanent place of abode was with his parents, who he had lived with before his departure from New Zealand. Similarly, in Case H97, it was held that the taxpayer’s permanent place of abode was the residence of his parents. In Case J41, Judge Barber considered that the taxpayer’s permanent place of abode was in New Zealand, and found that “his enduring relationship was with the New Zealand house property; his association with it had durability” (at 1,242). In Case J98, the taxpayer was held to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, and Judge Barber noted that the taxpayer “at all times regarded his New Zealand home as his permanent place of abode” (at 1,560). 45. Although the Australian tax residence tests are different to New Zealand’s, there are Australian cases in which the phrase “place of abode”, in the context of either the expression “permanent place of abode” or “usual place of abode”, was given a narrow meaning – in particular Executors of the Estate of Subrahmanyam v FCT (2002) ATC 2303. The Australian cases add further support to the view that a place of abode is a dwelling, rather than a place more generally. In Subrahmanyam, the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal noted there were a number of authorities (Case U110, 87 ATC 663, Case N31, 81 ATC 167 and Applegate) that indicated a wider interpretation of “place” in the phrase “place of abode” should not be adopted. In addition to those authorities, Case S19, 85 ATC 225, Case W13, 89 ATC 196, Tanumihardjo v FCT 97 ATC 4817 and (post Subrahmanyam) Shand v FCT \[2003\] AATA 279, (2003) ATC 2080 and Boer v FC of T \[2012\] AATA 574, (2012) ATC ¶10-269 also appear to support a narrower interpretation (that a place of abode is a dwelling) over a wider one (that a place of abode is something broader – ie, a city or country). The purpose of section YD 1(2) 46. The Commissioner considers that an examination of the purpose of s YD 1(2), looking in particular to the historical context and wider statutory context, does not provide particularly strong guidance on the issue of whether a dwelling is a pre-requisite to having a permanent place of abode. It is worth observing, however, that there is nothing that would suggest that “place of abode” should be read as meaning a general locality in New Zealand, as opposed to a specific dwelling in New Zealand in which the person could live. On the other hand, some of the pre-legislative material suggests that Parliament intended a dwelling to be a pre-requisite to having a permanent place of abode. 47. There have been a number of legislative changes to the residence tests for individuals. Those changes and the inferences that may be drawn from the legislative history are outlined below. 12 48. The permanent place of abode test was introduced in 1980 as a consequence of the Supreme Court decision in Geothermal Energy New Zealand Limited v CIR (1979) 4 NZTC 61,478. A personal presence in New Zealand test was introduced at the same time. The previous test had been that a natural person would be resident “if his home is in New Zealand”. 49. In Geothermal, Beattie J considered that the Taxation Review Authority (the TRA) was wrong in Case B25 (1976) 2 NZTC 60,205 in holding that “home” should be regarded as being equivalent to “domicile”, and even if it was not exactly equivalent that the concept of “home” meant “permanent home”. Beattie J commented that if the legislature had meant “domicile” or “permanent home” it could simply have said so. Beattie J also stated (at 61,498) that: “\[i\]n very broad terms I consider that once a person lets his former dwelling place and moves away from it with his family it is not his “home” any more – at least until he and his family move back into it”. 50. The 1980 legislative amendment was aimed at ensuring it was not as easy to lose New Zealand residence as it would have been under the test laid down in Geothermal – that a person’s “home” is the centre of gravity of one’s domestic life. In the case of a married (and not separated) person, Beattie J regarded this as being where the person’s spouse/partner and family live. In the case of a single person, Beattie J regarded it as being the place where the normal course of the person’s life occurs. The Commissioner considers that Parliament intended the 1980 legislative changes to import the notion of permanency, so that simply being away from New Zealand for a time (with one’s spouse/partner, if not single) would not mean that the person’s “home” was no longer in New Zealand. The legislative change also appears to have been intended to counter the suggestion from Geothermal that letting one’s house out meant it was no longer their “home”. The phrase “permanent place of abode” is used in the Australian income tax legislation and it appears that the same phrase was chosen in New Zealand to bring in the benefit of Australian case law on the meaning of that phrase (in particular Applegate, which was decided shortly before Geothermal). The introduction of the permanent place of abode test in 1980 was intended to counter particular issues arising out of the decision in Geothermal. 51. There is nothing in the reasons for the introduction of the test that sheds any light on whether a dwelling was intended to be a pre-requisite for the test. However, the residence tests for individuals underwent further legislative change in 1988, and some inferences may be drawn from this part of the history to s YD 1(2) as to how Parliament understood the permanent place of abode test to operate. 52. The Minister of Finance had announced in the Budget of 18 June 1987 that the government would introduce measures to broaden the New Zealand tax base and to limit international tax avoidance. This announcement resulted in the formation of a Consultative Committee on international tax reform (the Valabh Committee). The report of the Valabh Committee (Valabh Committee, International Tax Reform: Full Imputation Part II (Consultative Committee on Full Imputation and International Tax Reform, July 1988)) recommended a number of changes: the introduction of a branch-equivalent regime and a foreign investment fund regime, and changes to the trust regime. These changes and new regimes were intended to reduce the numerous opportunities available to residents to avoid or defer New Zealand tax by interposing foreign entities between themselves and income- producing assets. To support these changes, the Valabh Committee also recommended changes to the residence rules. 53. Accordingly, the permanent place of abode test was amended in 1988 so that someone will be resident, despite anything else in the provision, if they have “a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, whether or not they have a 13 permanent place of abode outside New Zealand” (emphasis added). This amendment was to ensure that the focus of the test is on the person’s connections with New Zealand, rather than whether the person has closer connections with New Zealand or another country. This was intended to make it more difficult to lose New Zealand residence than it had been previously, when the test presumed that a person could have only one permanent place of abode. (See \[2.4\] of the Valabh Committee report). 54. It could be argued that the intention to make it more difficult to lose New Zealand residence would not be achieved if the permanent place of abode test required a person to have a dwelling in New Zealand. However, the goal of making it easier for people to become tax resident in New Zealand and harder to lose that status was achieved by broadening the permanent place of abode test (to include the words “whether or not they have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand”), and also by bolstering the personal presence test. The personal presence test introduced in 1980 had provided that a person would be resident in New Zealand for tax purposes if they were present for a continuous period of not less than 365 days. The 1988 amendments replaced that test with the current personal presence test, which provides that a person will be resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for a period or periods of more than 183 days during any 12-month period. 55. It seems implicit in the Valabh Committee report that the committee considered that a permanent place of abode test would require a dwelling as opposed to just links or ties with a locality. The report noted that, under the previous statutory provisions, a person could “cease to be a resident here by disposing of any permanent place of abode in New Zealand and acquiring a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand” (\[2.4.5\] of the Valabh Committee report). See also \[2.4.6\], which refers to “disposing of one’s permanent place of abode in New Zealand”. 56. The Valabh Committee proposed amendments that involved retaining the permanent place of abode test (but including the words “whether or not they have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand”), and Parliament accepted those amendments. This supports the proposition that Parliament understood the phrase “permanent place of abode” to require a dwelling, as did the Valabh Committee. Conclusion on whether “place of abode” requires a dwelling 57. The Commissioner considers, based on the ordinary meaning of the phrase “place of abode” and the case law, that the better view of the law is that having a dwelling in New Zealand is a pre-requisite to having a permanent place of abode here. No compelling purposive or other reason supports interpreting “place of abode” in s YD 1(2) as meaning a general locality within New Zealand, as opposed to a specific dwelling in which the person could live. Comments in the Valabh Committee report are consistent with this approach. The New Zealand case law supports this view. Case Q55 overtly states that a dwelling is required, and the same approach was adopted in TRA 43/11. The approach in the other New Zealand cases that have considered the permanent place of abode test are consistent with this. The view that a dwelling is required is also consistent with the Australian case law (which, although only persuasive, is of particular interest given that the phrase “permanent place of abode” appears to have been chosen to bring in the benefit of Australian case law on the meaning of that phrase). 14 “Permanent” place of abode 58. Although a person must have a dwelling in New Zealand to have a permanent place of abode here, the existence of a dwelling is not determinative (Case Q55). The existence of a dwelling in which the person could live will not, of itself, give rise to tax residence in New Zealand. Having a dwelling in New Zealand may potentially mean that the person has a “place of abode” in New Zealand, but further to that, the person’s place of abode in New Zealand must be their permanent place of abode. The ordinary meaning of “permanent” 59. The word “permanent” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, 3 rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2013, accessed 3 March 2014) (relevantly) as: permanent, adj. and n. A. adj. 1. a. Continuing or designed to continue or last indefinitely without change; abiding, enduring, lasting; persistent. Opposed to temporary. 60. Case law establishes that the word “permanent” is capable of different meanings. As noted by Fisher J in Applegate at 4317: The section is difficult to apply particularly if the emphasis is on subjective intention. It is made doubly difficult by the indiscriminate use of the differing concepts of domicile, residence, permanent place of abode and usual place of abode. Moreover the concept of permanence is used in a context in which it does not, and could not, bear its primary meaning of “everlasting”. It would amount to a contradiction in terms to suggest that an independent person could be domiciled in Australia but with his permanent residence outside Australia, if permanent bears its ordinary meaning. But it is clear that the meaning of permanent is far from intractable, and very much takes its colour from its context. As the Master of the Rolls, Lord Evershed said in McClelland v. North Ireland Health Board (1957) 2 All. E.R. 129 at p. 140: “The word (permanent) is clearly capable, according to the context, of many shades of meaning.” 61. In Case F138, Judge Bathgate noted at 60,243: In the Applegate case the Court held that “permanent” was also to be construed in the light of the context in which it was used; it could have many shades of meaning. I regard it as the opposite to “temporary” and consider for the purposes of this case the first meanings given in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary apposite, namely: “lasting or designed to last indefinitely without change; enduring; persistent; opposite to temporary.” 62. The Australian courts have considered “permanent place of abode” in contrast to domicile, given the context of the Australian tax residence tests, and have concluded that “permanent” in that context means more than temporary, but cannot mean “everlasting”. The Australian courts have therefore adopted the approach that it is “proper to pay greater regard to the nature and quality of the use which a taxpayer makes of a particular place of abode for the purpose of determining whether it qualifies as his permanent place of abode” (Applegate, per Fisher J at 4317). 63. Although the permanent place of abode test appears in a different context in the New Zealand legislation, the approach taken by the TRA indicates that “permanent” in the context of s YD 1(2) also does not mean “everlasting”. In the New Zealand cases, the TRA has taken the same approach as the Australian courts, considering that in determining whether a place of abode is a person’s 15 permanent place of abode it is proper to pay greater regard to the nature and quality of the use a person makes of a place of abode, and that the material factors to consider are the continuity and duration of the person’s presence and the durability of their association with the particular place. A person’s intention with respect to the duration of their residence in a place is just one of the factors that is relevant (Case H97, Case J98, Case Q55). It is clear from the New Zealand case law that the person does not need to intend to live somewhere for the remainder of their life in order for it to be their permanent place of abode. This indicates that “permanent” in the context of the New Zealand legislation similarly does not mean that the place of abode must be the place the person will live on an “everlasting” basis. 64. The case law establishes that a permanent place of abode is not necessarily the place of abode in which the person intends to live for the remainder of their life, but it must be more than a temporary or transitory place of abode; it is to be contrasted with temporary (Applegate, Case F138, Case H97, Case J98, Case Q55). As noted above, in Case F138 Judge Bathgate considered that the appropriate definition of “permanent” was “lasting or designed to last indefinitely without change; enduring; persistent; opposite to temporary”. The purpose of section YD 1(2) 65. The purpose of s YD 1(2) is discussed above (from \[46\] – \[ 56\]). The purpose of the provision is consistent with “permanent” being read as meaning enduring, or the opposite of temporary. It is clear it was not intended that a person could only have a permanent place of abode if they had a place of abode in which they intended to live forever. On the other hand, the place of abode must be able to be used by the person as a place of abode on an enduring basis. When will a person’s place of abode be their permanent place of abode? 66. As noted above, New Zealand cases have described “permanent place of abode” as meaning a lasting or enduring place where one usually lives, and as a place in which one can live or dwell when required, in a locality with which the person has a durable connection and that is a current focal point of one’s living. 67. The Commissioner considers that Judge Barber’s statement in Case Q55 about a person’s permanent place of abode being “a current focal point of one’s living” was not intended to suggest that the place needs to be the current day-to-day focus of a person’s life. The permanent place of abode test operates to ensure that even if someone is away from New Zealand for 325 days or more in a 12- month period, they will remain a New Zealand resident so long as they have a permanent place of abode here. Obviously when someone is away from New Zealand for 325 days or more, any place of abode they may have in New Zealand will not be a current focus of their day-to-day life (ie, what they do on a daily basis). It would therefore seem that Judge Barber meant that the place would need to remain a focal point of the person’s life in a broader sense. 68. Whether a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode is determined by considering the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand and the durability of the person’s association with their place of abode here (Applegate, Case H97, Case J98, Case Q55). The factors relevant to this enquiry are discussed below, from \[81\]. It is important to understand that the relevant factors are not of equal weight, and the significance to be afforded to each of the factors will depend on the person’s particular circumstances. The question is whether, having regard to the overall picture, the person’s place of abode in New Zealand can be regarded as their permanent place of abode. 16 What does it mean to have a dwelling in New Zealand? 69. The requirement for a person to have a dwelling in New Zealand does not mean that they must own, rent, or otherwise control the dwelling. The focus is on whether there is a dwelling that can objectively be said to be able to be used by the person as a place of abode. Ownership or control of the dwelling significantly assists in establishing that the person would be able to use the dwelling as a place of abode. However, the person may be able to use a dwelling even though he or she does not own it – for example, where the property is held in a family trust or owned by a family company (eg, as in TRA 43/11 6 ). Similarly, the dwelling may be owned by a family member in circumstances where it would be able to be used by the taxpayer as a place of abode: for example, see Case F139 and Case H97. 70. In addition, the requirement does not mean that the place of abode must be vacant or able to be occupied immediately. It is not uncommon for someone who is temporarily overseas to lease their property to a third party, or to enable someone else to use it during their absence. A place of abode can be a person’s permanent place of abode even if it is rented to or otherwise used by someone else while the person is residing in a foreign jurisdiction. See, for example, Case Q55, TRA 43/11, Case F138, Case J98 and Case J41. 71. In Case F138 the taxpayer rented his house out, but retained the right to possession on 30 days’ notice. In TRA 43/11 the dwelling that was considered available to the taxpayer to reside in was an investment property rented out on a periodic tenancy. A property rented out on a fixed-term tenancy could also potentially be regarded as a dwelling that the owner (or some other person) could use as a place of abode, and that may therefore potentially be their permanent place of abode. For example, in Case Q55, the taxpayer’s home was rented out under a fixed-term tenancy and was held to be his permanent place of abode. It is acknowledged that in that case the taxpayer and his wife timed their return to New Zealand to be a few days after the expiry of the tenancy, ensuring that the house would be available for them to reoccupy on their return. It is noted though that the tenancy could not be unilaterally terminated before the end of the fixed- term. As such, the taxpayer would not have been able to reoccupy the house any sooner, had he returned earlier than expected. 72. The above cases show that a property does not necessarily cease to be a person’s permanent place of abode merely because the person is temporarily absent and during that period the dwelling is let out. If the person is able to use the property as a place to live on an enduring basis, then it can still be their permanent place of abode, irrespective of whether the property is otherwise occupied for limited periods of time. 73. A person may have multiple places of abode available to them in New Zealand. For example, in addition to his home, the taxpayer in Case Q55 had a number of rental properties that Judge Barber noted would have been potential places of abode for the taxpayer had they been needed. Judge Barber accepted that there would have been some practical difficulties in the taxpayer taking up residence in any of those rental properties, but he nonetheless considered that the taxpayer could have dwelt or lived in at least one of them. Where a person has multiple places of abode, frequently one particular dwelling will obviously be the most likely place in which the person would choose to abide in New Zealand (as in Case Q55). 74. While an investment property may be a dwelling that a person could use as a place of abode, and could potentially be a permanent place of abode, the 6 As noted above, TRA 43/11 is on appeal to the High Court. 17 Commissioner considers that this would not commonly be the case. The considerations to have regard to in determining if a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode are discussed below. If a person has a dwelling in New Zealand, when will it be their permanent place of abode? 75. Having established that someone has a dwelling in New Zealand that they could use as a place of abode, it is necessary to determine whether it is their permanent place of abode. The material factors to have regard to in determining this are discussed in detail from \[81\]. 76. In most cases it will be a simple matter to establish whether a person’s place of abode in New Zealand is a permanent place of abode. Assume, for example, that a person who normally lives in New Zealand, who owns and occupies a house here and who has employment ties here, is absent for a fixed period of, say, 12 months. This person has an enduring relationship with their New Zealand place of abode, and it is the place where they usually live. That place of abode is their permanent place of abode. 77. More difficult cases will arise where the person has been absent from New Zealand for a substantial period, or where the person is here intermittently. Where the answer is not clear, all relevant factors must be weighed carefully. As noted above, this will involve a consideration of the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand and the durability of the person’s association with their place of abode here. 78. A person’s connections to the location in New Zealand where their place of abode is situated are relevant in objectively assessing whether the particular dwelling is the person’s permanent place of abode. The strength of such connections may indicate that the area is a focal point of a person’s life (See further \[67\]), and therefore lead to an inference that the abode is the person’s permanent place of abode. In TRA 43/11, Judge Sinclair considered it important that the property was situated in a locality in which the taxpayer had continuing family and other ties. 79. A person may also have connections to New Zealand generally, such as keeping a New Zealand bank account, having membership in professional or trade associations, or maintaining medical insurance with a New Zealand company (see further from \[103\]). Such factors could be relevant to any location in New Zealand and are not by their nature tied to any specific dwelling or location. General connections to New Zealand, as opposed to connections to a place of abode or to the location in which the abode is situated, may still provide some indication that the taxpayer is likely to return to New Zealand to live and that their dwelling here may potentially be their permanent place of abode. 80. In establishing whether a person’s place of abode in New Zealand is their permanent place of abode, the consideration is not limited to factors occurring within the relevant income year. It is appropriate to consider the person’s past and likely future association with New Zealand and with the place of abode (Case Q55). 18 Material factors for determining whether a person’s place of abode is their permanent place of abode 81. As noted above, to determine whether a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode, these factors must be considered:  the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand; and  the durability of the person’s association with their place of abode here (which is assessed by looking at the totality of the circumstances). (Applegate, Case H97, Case J98, Case Q55). These are discussed in turn below. Continuity and duration of presence in New Zealand 82. As a general rule, the longer a person is present in New Zealand the more likely it is that their place of abode here is their permanent place of abode. Conversely, the longer a person is absent from New Zealand the less likely it is that their place of abode here will be their permanent place of abode. 83. This is not to say that periods of presence in, or absence from, New Zealand are the overriding consideration. However, where a person is absent from New Zealand for an extended period it is more likely that, on balancing the extended absence with the person’s retention of enduring connections with New Zealand, the person does not have a permanent place of abode here. 84. Where a person is absent from New Zealand, a point would eventually be reached where it would no longer be reasonable to determine that a dwelling they have in New Zealand is still their permanent place of abode. Such an assessment would be made taking all material facts into account. This would include whether the person has maintained a level of connection to New Zealand that indicates they will be returning to live at the dwelling on a durable basis. The longer a person is away from New Zealand, the less ties to New Zealand they are likely to retain and the more ties to another place they are likely to establish. This would typically support a conclusion that their dwelling here is no longer their permanent place of abode. That said, there may be situations in which a person lives in another country for an extended time but still maintains strong ties to New Zealand. Depending on the circumstances, the person may continue to have a permanent place of abode here. As noted at \[111\], s YD 1(2) leaves open the possibility that a person may have more than one permanent place of abode. 85. There is no specific length of presence in, or absence from, New Zealand that results in a person acquiring or losing a permanent place of abode here. If a person has strong connections with New Zealand , it could be expected that a longer period of absence would be required for their place of abode here to no longer be considered their permanent place of abode than would be the case if the person’s connections to New Zealand were weaker. 86. In the shareholder remuneration case of Troon Place Investments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,175 (HC), the court found that the shareholders of the taxpayers, who were on an overseas trip for three years and one month, were resident in New Zealand under the permanent place of abode test for the duration of their absence. The shareholders had business interests in New Zealand (the businesses operated by the taxpayer companies), and were involved in the administration and management of the companies during their absence from New Zealand. For most of the time the shareholders were overseas they travelled around the United Kingdom and Europe in a campervan. Despite the absence of just over three years, Tompkins J found that the shareholders had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. It is acknowledged that there is no discussion of 19 the permanent place of abode test in Troon, nor of the particular facts that led the court to conclude that the shareholders retained a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during their absence. However the court clearly had to turn its mind to the issue, and did not take the view that the length of absence was enough in the circumstances to result in the shareholders no longer having a permanent place of abode here. 87. Similarly, in TRA 43/11 Judge Sinclair considered, despite the taxpayer living away from New Zealand for up to four years in the tax years in question, that he continued to have a permanent place of abode here in those years. However, Judge Sinclair noted that the taxpayer was not continuously absent during the four year period. Rather, he made regular trips back to New Zealand, spending on average 42 days a year here. 88. The totality of the particular circumstances must be considered in each case. As noted above, there is no particular length of absence from New Zealand that will necessarily be enough on its own to result in the conclusion that someone does not have a permanent place of abode here. 89. The duration of presence criterion focuses on the length of the person’s presence in New Zealand. The continuity of presence criterion refers to whether the person is present in New Zealand for continuous or interrupted periods. If the periods of presence are continuous, this may indicate the person’s place of abode here is permanent, because they are actually living here rather than merely visiting for brief periods. Likewise, the more continuous the periods of absence from New Zealand are, the more that might indicate the person no longer retains a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, compared to a situation where someone returns to New Zealand frequently. While frequent trips back to New Zealand are a factor to consider in determining whether a person has a permanent place of abode here, such trips must be viewed in context. For example, regular visits may be explicable because the person is returning to see children who live here with an ex-spouse, or to visit extended family. The fact that the person has family here would be a factor to be taken into account in assessing whether the person has a durable association with a place of abode in New Zealand (see from \[91\]). However, the weight to be given to frequent visits should be considered in light of all of the circumstances and of the context of the person’s trips to New Zealand. 90. The continuity and duration of a person’s presence must be considered in conjunction with the durability of their association with their place of abode. For example, consider the case of an Australian business executive who travels to New Zealand on short business trips on numerous occasions during the year, and has an investment property here, but who otherwise has few ties with New Zealand. In this situation, the lack of continuity of presence, the limited duration of presence, the reason for the trips to New Zealand, the lack of any overly significant ties with New Zealand, and the fact that the investment property has not been used by the person as a place of abode (even if it could potentially be) indicate that the property here is not their permanent place of abode. Durability of association 91. To determine whether a person has a durable association with their place of abode, the totality of the circumstances must be looked at and the person’s overall connections with their place of abode and with New Zealand must be weighed up. It is then necessary to evaluate the extent to which those connections indicate that the person has an enduring relationship with their place of abode here such that it can be considered to be their permanent place of abode. Consideration of the durability of a person’s association with a place of abode therefore involves an examination of the extent and strength of the 20 attachments that the person has established and maintained in New Zealand. See, for example, Case Q55, Case F138, Case J98, Case U17 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,174 and TRA 43/11. 92. The above cases establish that some of the material factors to be considered when assessing whether a person has a durable association with a place of abode such that it can be regarded as their permanent place of abode are:  the nature and use of the dwelling and the person’s connection with the dwelling;  the person’s intentions;  family and social ties;  employment, business interests and economic ties;  personal property; and  any other factors that shed light on whether the place of abode is the person’s permanent place of abode. These factors are discussed in turn below. The nature and use of the dwelling and the person’s connection with the dwelling 93. As noted at \[57\], a person must have a dwelling in New Zealand to potentially have a permanent place of abode here. As discussed from \[69\], this does not mean that the dwelling needs to be one that is owned by the person, or vacant or able to be occupied immediately. That said, the nature and use of a dwelling that a person has in New Zealand, and the connection that the person has with the dwelling, may provide a strong indication as to whether the person has an enduring connection with New Zealand and with the dwelling, such that it can be regarded as their permanent place of abode. 94. If the person owns a house or apartment in New Zealand, for example, this may, depending on the circumstances, be a stronger indication of an enduring connection with the place of abode and with New Zealand than, say, the ability to reside at a parent’s house. 95. Whether (or the extent to which) a person has lived in a dwelling will be a relevant factor to take into account in assessing whether it is their permanent place of abode, but it is not essential that they have lived in the particular dwelling before. That said, in assessing whether a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode, the nature and quality of the use made by the person of that particular place of abode must be considered (Applegate, Case Q68, 83 ATC 343, Case H97). If a house or apartment owned by the person has been their home, this would carry substantial weight. There may be circumstances in which an investment property could be a person’s permanent place of abode, though this would not commonly be the case. The ownership of property that has always been held purely as an investment would (as with other investments in New Zealand) be a factor to consider in determining whether the person has an enduring relationship with New Zealand. So too would ownership of a property that has been used exclusively as a holiday home, and not used by the person as a permanent residence. However, it is less likely that such a dwelling could be regarded as the person’s permanent place of abode, compared to a dwelling that has been used by the person as their home. 96. The suitability of a dwelling will be relevant insofar as it assists in determining whether the property is the person’s permanent place of abode. The possible unsuitability of a dwelling for the person to live in could lead to an inference that 21 the property is not the person’s permanent place of abode. For example, if a person with a family owned a studio flat, the inference may be that the flat is not the person’s permanent place of abode, given that it may be regarded as unsuitable for the family. However, although a dwelling may objectively be regarded as unsuitable, a person’s particular circumstances must be considered to determine whether it is their permanent place of abode (for example if they have previously lived in the dwelling, and would likely do so again). Intention 97. Determining whether a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand is an objective enquiry (Case H97, Case J98 and Case Q55). However a person’s intention can also be considered in such an enquiry (Case F138, Case F139, Case H97 and Case Q55). 98. A person’s intentions about their presence in or absence from New Zealand and about any place of abode they have here will be important factors, although a person’s intentions are not the central consideration. It is necessary to consider not only what was intended, but what in fact occurred (Case F139 and Case H97). In cases where a person is overseas, the intention to return to New Zealand to live may be indicative of an enduring attachment to New Zealand and suggest their place of abode here is their permanent place of abode. However, it is important to balance intention with all other relevant factors. For example, if a person has departed from New Zealand for an extended period, but ultimately intends to return, that intention alone would not establish that the person’s place of abode here is their permanent place of abode. On the other hand, if a person has departed for a relatively short period of fixed duration, the intention to return will be a strong indicator that the person’s place of abode here is their permanent place of abode. 99. Although a person’s intention is subjective, the degree to which it is reasonably held is relevant in terms of the weight to be given to it. Family and social ties 100. The location of a person’s family may be a factor of some importance. For example, if a person is absent from New Zealand, but their immediate family remain here, that will tend to support a conclusion that the person’s place of abode here is their permanent place of abode. Once again, however, family ties must be considered in relation to all of the other relevant factors. If a person is absent from New Zealand for a relatively short period, the fact that the person’s family accompanies them overseas will not mean the person does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 101. The weight to be attached to family ties may vary from individual to individual, and in light of the nature and quality of the relationships. In the case of a person who has extended family who they have not lived with, or not lived with for some time, the person’s family ties to New Zealand will be relevant but should not be given too much weight. By contrast, where a person has more immediate family (such as a spouse/partner or dependent children) in New Zealand, that will generally provide a strong indication that the person has an enduring attachment to New Zealand and that their place of abode here is a permanent place of abode. However, in determining the weight to be given to any family ties it is important to bear in mind the person’s particular circumstances and, as noted above, the nature of the relevant relationships. For example, there may be circumstances in which someone has dependent children in New Zealand but that factor is not of sufficient weight to result in them having a permanent place of abode here – for instance in the case of someone who is estranged from their children (see Case U17), or someone who has agreed for their children to remain in New 22 Zealand with an ex-spouse. Although in the latter situation the person has important, close family ties to New Zealand, and may well make regular trips back to New Zealand to see their children, these connections need to be viewed in light of all of the other circumstances and will not necessarily lead to a conclusion that the person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 102. Other social ties, such as membership of sporting and cultural associations, are also relevant in establishing whether a person has an enduring attachment to New Zealand and therefore whether their place of abode here is their permanent place of abode. Such ties will not necessarily be of much weight by themselves, but may suggest that the person will be returning to New Zealand to live, and together with other ties to New Zealand may be indicative of the person’s place of abode here continuing to be their permanent place of abode. Employment, business interests and economic ties 103. If all or part of the person’s employment, business, trade or profession is carried on in New Zealand, that may indicate an enduring association with New Zealand. Also, if the person is absent but retains employment, business, trade or professional ties with New Zealand, the retention of those ties may indicate an enduring association with New Zealand. For example, university lecturers who take sabbatical leave overseas generally continue to be employed and paid by the university during their absence. The continued employment ties in such a situation will be important in determining whether the person’s place of abode in New Zealand remains their permanent place of abode. The weight to be given to employment ties will depend on their strength – for example, whether employment is guaranteed after the absence or is likely still to be open to the person, and the reasons for the employment arrangements being as they are. 104. The person’s overall economic connections with New Zealand will also be relevant. Whether the person has a bank account or credit card facilities in operation in New Zealand, whether the person has insurance coverage from New Zealand or superannuation in New Zealand, and whether the person has any investments here or managed from here, must be considered. By themselves, these factors may not carry much weight. However, if the person has other connections with New Zealand, their economic connections, together with those other connections, may establish that the person has an enduring association with New Zealand, which would suggest that their place of abode here is their permanent place of abode. 105. Paying child support or other financial support to people in New Zealand may be relevant, as with any other economic connections to New Zealand. In TRA 43/11, Judge Sinclair noted that the taxpayer paid child support and contributed to other expenses for his children in New Zealand. However, it is noted that in that case the level of financial assistance was substantial. 106. Memberships of trade and professional associations should also be taken into account but, again, would not by themselves carry much weight. Personal property 107. If the person has personal property (eg, furniture or a vehicle) situated in New Zealand, this should be taken into account in determining whether the person has an enduring association with New Zealand. 108. The weight to be given to the fact that a person has personal property in New Zealand will depend on the nature of the property and the person’s circumstances. For example if someone leaves the bulk of their furniture and 23 other personal effects in New Zealand this would be of more weight than someone leaving, say, a few personal effects with a relative or friend. Other factors 109. Other factors, such as whether the person receives New Zealand social welfare assistance, or whether the person regularly spends their holidays in New Zealand, may also be relevant. 110. There is no exhaustive list of factors that can be taken into account. Any factor showing a person has a durable connection to New Zealand generally, to the location where their place of abode is situated, or to their place of abode itself may assist in drawing the inference that the person intends to live in New Zealand on an enduring basis, and therefore by implication that their dwelling here is their permanent place of abode. “A” permanent place of abode 111. As noted above, s YD 1(2) provides that a natural person is a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, “even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere”. Therefore, s YD 1(2) leaves open the possibility that a person may have more than one permanent place of abode. 112. It should be emphasised that the focus of the permanent place of abode test is on the person’s connections with New Zealand, rather than on whether the person’s connections are closer with New Zealand or another country. A person may be resident in New Zealand under the permanent place of abode test even if they have closer connections with another country. 113. That said, factors that evidence a durable connection to New Zealand generally, to the location in New Zealand where the person’s place of abode is situated, or to their place of abode itself must be weighed against contrary factors that weaken those connections. Such contrary factors could include evidence of the person’s connections to a foreign country; for example, the purchase of a home in another country, or family, social, financial and other ties to another country. 114. If a person has established strong connections to another country, it is less likely that the person will return to their place of abode in New Zealand. Conversely, the lack of strong connections to another country make it more likely that the person will return to their place of abode in New Zealand: see, for example, Case H97. 115. However, there may be situations where a person has a permanent place of abode in more than one country and moves between those countries. A person having established strong connections in another country will not preclude them having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. There may also be situations where a person has no permanent place of abode anywhere. Lack of strong connections in another country will therefore not necessarily suggest that a person’s place of abode in New Zealand is their permanent place of abode. For example, in TRA 43/11 Judge Sinclair did not place any particular weight on the taxpayer not having established roots in Iraq, noting that this was not surprising given the security issues in that country and the nature of the taxpayer’s employment (though in that case the taxpayer was held to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand). 116. The extent of a person’s connections to a foreign country will be relevant in assessing the person’s connections to New Zealand and their place of abode here. However, the permanent place of abode test does not involve a comparison of the relative “permanence” of different permanent places of abode. So long as a 24 person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand they will be resident here under s YD 1(2). Summary – permanent place of abode 117. In summary:  A person must have a dwelling in New Zealand to have a permanent place of abode here. However, the existence of a dwelling in which the person could live will not, of itself, give rise to tax residence in New Zealand.  A place of abode will be a person’s permanent place of abode if it is a lasting or enduring place where they usually live, or a place in which they can live or dwell when required, in a locality with which they have a durable connection and that is a current focal point of their living (See further \[67\]). To be a permanent place of abode the dwelling must be a place that the person is able and likely to live on an enduring rather than temporary basis.  To determine whether a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode, the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand and the durability of the person’s association with their place of abode here must be considered.  To determine whether a person has a durable association with their place of abode, the person’s overall connections with their place of abode and with New Zealand must be weighed up. It is then necessary to evaluate the extent to which those connections indicate that the person has an enduring relationship with their place of abode here, such that it can be considered to be their permanent place of abode. Acquiring and losing a permanent place of abode 118. When a person becomes a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, the time that their tax residence commences must be identified. Individuals can become resident as a result of the operation of either the permanent place of abode test, or the 183-day rule (discussed from \[160\]). When a person satisfies the 183-day rule, their tax residence is back-dated (under s YD 1(4)) to the first day of the 183 days that they were present in New Zealand in the 12-month period. In most situations where a person becomes tax resident in New Zealand, it will be the 183-day rule and s YD 1(4) that establish when their residence commences. However, a person could become resident under the permanent place of abode test from a time prior to the first day of their presence in New Zealand under the 183-day rule. 119. This could occur, for example, if someone moved to New Zealand but was out the country for much of the year on business and did not trigger the 183-day rule for some time. In those circumstances, the date at which the person acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand would need to be determined, as their New Zealand tax residence could commence from that point. 120. When a person leaves New Zealand, the time when their New Zealand tax residence ends must also be identified. A person will not cease to be tax resident here until they have been absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period and no longer have a permanent place of abode here. The date that a person loses their permanent place of abode in New Zealand will therefore be relevant if it occurs some time after the 325 days of absence. The date that a person loses their permanent place of abode will also be relevant if it occurs during the 12-month period in which they satisfy the 325- day rule. In this situation, the interaction between the permanent place of abode test in s YD 1(2) and the back-dating rule in s YD 1(6) would result in the person ceasing to be tax resident in New Zealand from the time they lost their permanent place of abode. 25 121. The time at which a person acquires or loses their permanent place of abode is determined by an evaluation of the circumstances of each case. The objective is to determine the point in time at which either the person acquires a permanent place of abode in New Zealand by being present here and establishing connections of an enduring nature, or the person loses their permanent place of abode by ceasing to have an enduring or usual place of abode here. 122. If a person’s circumstances change at any point during their absence from New Zealand, it is necessary to reconsider whether they have a permanent place of abode here. It may be that the change in circumstances results in the acquisition or loss of a permanent place of abode here. It is relevant to consider the time of occurrence of such events as:  commencement or termination of employment;  changes in the location of the person’s family;  purchase or sale of real or personal property;  commencement or termination of a lease;  transferral of financial affairs;  appointment to, or resignation from, trade, professional, sporting or cultural associations; and  departure from, or arrival in, New Zealand for an extended period. In some situations, the combination of such factors may indicate that a person acquires or loses their permanent place of abode at a time other than arrival in or departure from New Zealand. Examples illustrating the concept of “permanent place of abode” The following examples deal only with the permanent place of abode test. They do not consider the 183-day rule, the 325-day rule, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. The examples illustrate the way in which a person’s overall circumstances need to be considered to determine if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The conclusions in the examples are based on the facts that are known at a particular point in time. If what in fact eventuates differs from this, the results could be different for some or all of the years in question. It is important to bear in mind that if a person’s circumstances change during their absence from New Zealand, it is necessary to reconsider whether they have a permanent place of abode here. Example 1 123. Facts: Cate, who is normally resident in New Zealand, is seconded to Canada in connection with her employment for a fixed period of three years. Cate intends to return to New Zealand after the period of secondment, and the terms of her secondment are such that her job will definitely be available for her to return to. Cate’s partner and children accompany her to Canada. The family home in New Zealand is owned by a family trust, of which Cate’s parents and their solicitor are trustees. Cate, her partner and their children, together with Cate’s siblings and their families, are the beneficiaries of the trust. The house is rented out while the family is in Canada. Cate and her family leave their furniture and most of their other personal belongings in storage in New Zealand during their absence. Cate retains her New Zealand investments and her connections with several 26 professional and sporting associations here. Cate and her family return to New Zealand each year to spend Christmas with family and have a summer holiday here. 124. Result: Cate has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during the period of her absence. 125. Explanation: Cate has a place of abode in New Zealand – being the house she and her family lived in before departing for Canada. Although the house is owned in trust, Cate’s parents are trustees, and the family are all beneficiaries. It is reasonable to infer that the trustees will enable the family to resume living in the family home upon their return. Cate has retained ties with New Zealand – she still has a dwelling and most of her personal property here, maintains membership of several professional and sporting associations, and has investments here. Cate also retains employment ties with New Zealand, as her secondment is in connection with her New Zealand employment. Cate has a definite intention to return to New Zealand at the end of the three-year secondment and to resume living in the family home here. 126. Although Cate will be absent from New Zealand for three years, this is not inconsistent with her place of abode here remaining a permanent place of abode. All of the relevant factors must be weighed up. In this case, the strength of Cate’s enduring connections with New Zealand and with her place of abode here are sufficient to establish that her home here continues to be a permanent place of abode. 127. If Cate had not intended to return to New Zealand after the period of secondment, but rather to take up other work opportunities in Canada, and the terms of her secondment were such that her employer in New Zealand would make its best endeavours to have a position available for her to return to should she wish, but could not guarantee this, and if Cate and her family had taken most of their furniture and other belongings with them, then Cate would not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Example 2 128. Facts: Mike departs from New Zealand on a working holiday (his “OE”). He intends to return to New Zealand after his OE, though he is not sure exactly when that will be. Before he left New Zealand, Mike had been living in a rented flat in Wellington for a couple of years, prior to which he had lived with his parents (also in Wellington). Mike terminates his lease when he leaves New Zealand. Mike resigns from his job and stores his personal effects with his parents, who are happy for Mike to return to live with them if he wishes upon his return. Mike leaves his KiwiSaver account in New Zealand and takes a contributions holiday. Mike ends up returning to New Zealand to live after 18 months. 129. Result: Mike does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand while he is overseas. 130. Explanation: Mike has a potential place of abode in New Zealand – being his parents’ house, where his parents have told him he would be able to live upon his return. He has stored his personal effects in New Zealand and has family ties here, as his family still live here. However, these ties do not suggest that Mike’s parents’ house would be his permanent place of abode. Mike lived independently from his parents for a couple of years prior to leaving New Zealand. Although he could return to live with his parents, he would be unlikely to do so on an enduring rather than temporary basis. Mike intends to return to New Zealand after his OE, but there is no place of abode here with which he has a durable connection and to which he would likely return to live on a permanent basis. 27 131. If Mike had never lived independently from his parents prior to going overseas, his parents’ house would be his permanent place of abode during his absence from New Zealand. Although when he leaves Mike does not know exactly when he will return to New Zealand, he is going on an OE and does not have the intention of leaving New Zealand permanently. Mike has left his personal effects at his parents’ house, has family ties here, intends to return to New Zealand after his OE, and in fact returned to New Zealand to live after 18 months. In this scenario, because Mike had lived with his parents before going overseas, their house would be the place he usually lives, and would remain a place of abode in which he could live when required. In those circumstances Mike’s parents’ house would be the likely place to which he would return and live after his OE, and would remain his permanent place of abode during his absence. Example 3 132. Facts: Li is a New Zealand citizen who has extensive business interests in New Zealand and Australia. Li owns a house in each country, and both houses are continuously available for his use. Li spends most of his time in Australia, but he regularly travels to New Zealand in connection with his business here. In aggregate, Li spends up to five months of the year in New Zealand, staying in his house here most of the time he is here (except when his business requires him to be elsewhere in New Zealand). These trips vary in length from two days up to several weeks. Li has significant investments in New Zealand, and he is a member of a number of cultural and sporting associations here. Li’s immediate family live in Australia. 133. Result: Li has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 134. Explanation: Li has a place of abode in New Zealand – being the house he owns here. He has significant connections with New Zealand because he has extensive business interests here, a house here continually at his disposal, and connections with New Zealand sporting and cultural associations. 135. Li’s presence in New Zealand is generally for short periods; that is, his presence here is not of a continuous nature. However, the fact that Li has substantial connections with New Zealand, and that these connections are maintained through regular trips to New Zealand, indicate that his place of abode here is a permanent place of abode. It is a place in which he can (and does) live when required, with which he has a durable connection, and that is a current focal point of his living. Although he also has a place of abode in Australia, Li usually or typically lives in both of his places of abode on an enduring rather than temporary basis. Example 4 136. Facts: Ronan is a software developer who has lived in Wellington for 12 years and has a partner there. He and his partner own the apartment they live in and another similar apartment in a nearby building. Ronan accepts a two-year contract in Dublin. For the first year of his contract, Ronan returns to Wellington every few months to see his partner, after which she decides to take a year of unpaid leave and join him in Ireland for the remainder of his contract. At that time, they sell the apartment they had lived in, given that they will be down to one income and wish to travel a little in Europe in the second year of Ronan’s contract. They sold the apartment they lived in rather than the investment property because it was not subject to a lease and so was easier to sell promptly. The couple intend to return to Wellington after Ronan’s contract; they have many friends there and Ronan’s partner’s family live there. In addition to the investment property he owns with his partner, Ronan has a sizeable New Zealand share portfolio. 28 137. Result: Ronan has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during his absence. 138. Explanation: Ronan has a place of abode in New Zealand – in the first year of his absence the apartment he and his partner owned and in which they lived, and subsequently the apartment the couple own as an investment property. Although Ronan has not lived in that apartment, it is a dwelling that would be able to be used by Ronan and his partner as a place of abode. 139. Ronan has a number of enduring connections with New Zealand, and Wellington in particular – he has lived in Wellington for 12 years and intends to return there with his partner after his two-year contract, he has family ties there (his partner’s family), and he has substantial investments in New Zealand. These connections are sufficient to establish that the apartment Ronan lived in was a permanent place of abode, and after its sale the apartment that Ronan and his partner own became a permanent place of abode. Although Ronan has not lived in the investment property, it is a place of abode in which he and his partner could live when required, and is a likely place in which they would live upon their return to New Zealand. A property that has always been held as an investment would not commonly be a person’s permanent place of abode, however it could be in some circumstances. In this case, given that the apartment is similar to the apartment Ronan and his partner lived in and is nearby to where they lived, it is a likely place in which they would live upon their return, given their particular circumstances. Example 5 140. Facts: Melanie and her husband and four young children live in Tauranga. Melanie gets a lucrative job offer in London and the family decide to move there. They have no intention to return to New Zealand to live in the foreseeable future, and they intend the move to be a permanent one. The couple decide to sell their family home. Melanie moves to London in October to commence her new job. Her husband stays behind in Tauranga until December to enable their school-aged children to finish the school year, and to arrange the sale of their home. Once Melanie arrives in London, she enrols the children in schools there from the start of the following year. Melanie and her husband retain a one-bedroom rental property in Tauranga which they have owned for a number of years, and leave their share portfolio to be managed by their New Zealand broker. They have life insurance policies with a New Zealand insurance company, and retain those policies. The family home is sold in November, and Melanie’s husband and children move to London at the end of the school-year as planned. 141. Result: Melanie does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from the date of her departure in October. 142. Explanation: Although Melanie, at least initially, continues to have strong connections to New Zealand, her place of abode here is no longer her permanent place of abode. In the two months after she leaves New Zealand, her husband and children remain here, living in their family home. However, this is so the children can finish the school year here, and Melanie’s husband can arrange the sale of the family home. In the circumstances, it does not indicate that the family home continues to be Melanie’s permanent place of abode. Melanie has no intention to return to live in New Zealand in the foreseeable future. The sale of the family home supports this. The retention of some investments in New Zealand is not by itself significant. Maintaining life insurance with an insurance company is not a strong connection to New Zealand. 143. The rental property that Melanie and her husband own is not a place to which Melanie and her family would likely live upon their return to New Zealand, even if 29 they did intend to return to New Zealand within a few years. It is not suitable to be used by them as a place of abode and, even if they maintained very strong ties to New Zealand, the rental property would not be Melanie’s permanent place of abode. 144. Even if the rental property were a suitable house for Melanie and her family to live in, it would not be her permanent place of abode. Melanie does not intend to return to live in New Zealand in the foreseeable future – the move to London is intended to be a permanent one. The sale of the family home supports this stated intention. The investment property was acquired solely as an investment and has always been used as such. Even if it were a suitable house for Melanie and her family to live in, the fact that they do not intend to return to New Zealand to live in the foreseeable future and have not retained significant ties to New Zealand means that the rental property would not be Melanie’s permanent place of abode. Melanie’s family home in New Zealand would not continue to be her permanent place of abode from the time she leaves, so on the same basis her rental property would clearly not be, regardless of the nature of the property. Example 6 145. Facts: Cameron is a civil engineer who goes to Japan with work for 18 months. Cameron’s children are about to start high school, and the family had intended to move from Christchurch to Dunedin soon, to be closer to extended family. Cameron and his wife agree that she and the children will stay in New Zealand for the 18 months, during which time they will move to Dunedin so that the children can start high school there. Cameron’s wife and children make the move from Christchurch to Dunedin, and he will join them there once he returns from Japan. 146. Result: Cameron has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during his absence. 147. Explanation: Cameron has a place of abode in New Zealand – being the original family home in Christchurch, and then the new family home in Dunedin. Although Cameron has not previously lived in Dunedin, his family home has been established there during his absence, and he will join his family there upon his return. The home is able to be used by Cameron as a place of abode. 148. Cameron has a durable association with the original family home in Christchurch. Once the family move to Dunedin, Cameron has a durable association with the new family home there through his wife and children living there and his intention to live there upon his return. This association establishes that the new family home is Cameron’s permanent place of abode. Example 7 149. Facts: Charlie and his wife own a house in Auckland where they live with their children, and where he is a member of a number of local clubs. Charlie works as a miner in Moranbah in Queensland (Australia) for periods of six weeks at a time, between which he returns to his home in Auckland for four weeks off. Charlie’s wages are paid into an Australian bank account, in Australian dollars, though most of his wages are automatically transferred from there into the New Zealand bank account he holds jointly with his wife. Charlie’s employer provides him with accommodation at the mine site. On his home visits, Charlie maintains his sporting and social ties. 150. Result: Charlie has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 151. Explanation: Charlie has a place of abode in New Zealand – being the house that he and his wife own. Although Charlie is absent from New Zealand for more than 30 half of each year, his absences are solely because of the nature of his job. Charlie’s home, family, and personal property are in New Zealand. 152. Charlie’s place of abode in New Zealand is a permanent place of abode because he has a durable association with it – he lives there with his family when he is in New Zealand. Although Charlie is out of New Zealand more than he is here, that is solely for work purposes, and his home in Auckland is the lasting or enduring place where he usually lives. Example 8 153. Facts: Daniel is an engineer who has lived in Napier all of his life. He accepts a two-year contract working on an oil rig in Malaysia for periods of four weeks at a time. When he takes up the job, Daniel terminates the lease on the flat he has lived in for the last couple of years. Between his stints on the rig, Daniel has two weeks off. He has a periodic lease on an apartment in Malaysia, and for most of his weeks off he stays there. At other times he travels elsewhere, sometimes returning to New Zealand to visit family and friends here. When he is back in New Zealand, Daniel stays at his parents’ house in Napier. Daniel’s wages are paid into his Malaysian bank account, in American dollars. He has no plans to return to New Zealand permanently – his intention is to work and live in Malaysia indefinitely. Daniel’s employer has sponsored his Malaysian work permit and will continue to do so as long as Daniel stays with the company. 154. Result: Daniel does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 155. Explanation: Although Daniel has a potential place of abode in New Zealand – his parents’ house – it is not his permanent place of abode. He stays at his parents’ house during some of his time off, when he returns to New Zealand to catch up with friends and family. He would also presumably stay there temporarily if and when he ultimately returns to Napier to live. However, as Daniel has not lived with his parents for some time, it seems likely that this would only be until he found a new place to live. Daniel’s use of his parents’ house as a place of abode is temporary in nature, not enduring or indefinite. It is not a place where he usually lives or a place to which he would likely return and live on an enduring rather than temporary basis. 156. Even if Daniel had recently graduated from his engineering degree before leaving New Zealand, and so had lived with his parents immediately prior to going overseas, his parents’ house would not be his permanent place of abode once he leaves New Zealand. Daniel has not retained sufficient connections with New Zealand for his parents’ house here to remain his permanent place of abode. Although Daniel periodically visits his parents and friends in Napier, he has no other significant ties here, does not intend to return to New Zealand permanently, and intends to work and live in Malaysia indefinitely. Daniel’s employer will continue to sponsor his work permit, which indicates that this intention would seem to be reasonably held. In this scenario, Daniel would have lived with his parents before leaving New Zealand because he was still studying. However, by the time he left New Zealand he would have completed his degree and been financially independent. That, together with the fact that Daniel has no intention to return to New Zealand permanently and intends to work and live in Malaysia indefinitely, makes it unlikely that Daniel would return and live with his parents again on an enduring rather than temporary basis. 31 The day-count rules 157. In addition to the permanent place of abode test, there are day-count rules in the Act, under which a person can become resident in New Zealand or lose New Zealand tax residence (provided the person does not have a permanent place of abode here). These day-count rules are discussed below. The part-day rule 158. For convenience and simplicity, s YD 1(8) establishes a part-day rule for the purposes of the 183-day and 325-day rules. Section YD 1(8) states: YD 1 Residence of natural persons ... Presence for part-days (8) For the purposes of this section, a person personally present in New Zealand for part of a day is treated as— (a) present in New Zealand for the whole day; and (b) not absent from New Zealand for any part of the day. 159. Therefore, days of arrival in, and departure from, New Zealand are treated as full days of presence in New Zealand for the 183-day and 325-day rules. The 183-day rule Description of the rule 160. Section YD 1(3) provides that a person is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period. Section YD 1(4) then provides that if that is the case, the person is treated as resident from the first of those 183 days, until they are treated as ceasing to be resident under subs (5) (the 325-day rule). Those provisions state: YD 1 Residence of natural persons ... 183 days in New Zealand (3) A person is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period. Person treated as resident from first of 183 days (4) If subsection (3) applies, the person is treated as resident from the first of the 183 days until the person is treated under subsection (5) as ceasing to be a New Zealand resident. Ending residence: 325 days outside New Zealand (5) A person treated as a New Zealand resident only under subsection (3) stops being a New Zealand resident if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period. Person treated as non-resident from first of 325 days (6) The person is treated as not resident from the first of the 325 days until they are treated again as resident under this section. 161. It should be noted that the 183-day rule operates in conjunction with the permanent place of abode test in s YD 1(2). The permanent place of abode test applies despite anything else in s YD 1. Therefore, if a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they will be resident in New Zealand even if they have not been present here for more than 183 days in total in any 12-month period. Because the tests operate in conjunction with one another, a person who has acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand (ie, someone who has moved here from overseas) may have their residence back-dated to a time before that under the 183-day rule and s YD 1(4). This could occur, for example, if the 32 person came to New Zealand for a holiday or job interview prior to moving here, or it could occur because they did not acquire a permanent place of abode immediately upon moving to New Zealand, but some time later. 162. The 183-day rule does not focus on any particular income year, or indeed any particular 12-month period. It does not need to span the date as at which residence is being assessed, and the days of presence do not need to be consecutive. If a person was present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in any 12-month period, that person will be treated as resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of presence until they lose residence. To lose residence they would need to satisfy the 325-day rule (discussed below from \[172\]) and also not have a permanent place of abode here. Examples illustrating the 183-day rule The following examples deal only with the 183-day rule. They do not consider the permanent place of abode test, the 325-day rule, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example 9 163. Facts: Amy arrived in New Zealand on 1 October 2012 and stayed here until 1 March 2013, a total of 152 days of presence in New Zealand. Amy was then absent from New Zealand for 200 days. She then returned to New Zealand on 18 September 2013, and stayed here for a further seven months. It is assumed that Amy was resident outside New Zealand prior to 1 October 2012 and that she has never previously been resident in New Zealand. 164. Result: Amy is resident in New Zealand from 18 September 2013. 165. Explanation: Amy was not personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period commencing prior to 18 September 2013. Because of her absence between 2 March 2013 and 17 September 2013, Amy was only in New Zealand for 165 days in the 12-month period commencing on 1 October 2012 (152 days from 1 October 2012 to 1 March 2013 plus 13 days from 18 September 2013 to 30 September 2013). 166. However, Amy was present in New Zealand for seven months (213 days), in the 12-month period commencing on 18 September 2013. Therefore, Amy is resident from the first day of presence in that period (ie, from 18 September 2013). Amy will continue to be resident in New Zealand until she ceases to be resident under the 325-day rule (assuming she has no permanent place of abode here). 1 Oct 2012 1 Mar 2013 18 Sept 2013 18 Apr 2014 152 days in NZ 200 days out of NZ 213 days in NZ 33 Example 10 167. Facts: Ben arrived in New Zealand on 1 June 2012 and stayed here until 20 June 2012, a total of 20 days. Ben returned to New Zealand on 1 August 2012 and stayed here until 17 January 2013, a total of 170 days. It is assumed that Ben was not resident in New Zealand prior to 1 June 2012. 168. Result: Ben is resident in New Zealand from 1 June 2012. 169. Explanation: Ben was personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days (ie, 190 days), during the 12-month period commencing on 1 June 2012. Ben will continue to be resident in New Zealand until he ceases to be resident under the 325-day rule (assuming he has no permanent place of abode here). Non-resident seasonal workers 170. Despite the 183-day rule, a person who is a “non-resident seasonal worker” is treated as non-resident during the time that they are employed under the recognised seasonal employment scheme (s YD 1(11)). The recognised seasonal employer policy is published by the Department of Labour under s 13A of the Immigration Act 1987 (see: http://www.dol.govt.nz/initiatives/strategy/rse). 171. The non-resident seasonal worker rule does not override the permanent place of abode test, so in the event that a non-resident seasonal had or acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand they would be resident here. The 325-day rule Description of the rule 172. Section YD 1(5) provides that a person who is resident only under the 183-day rule (ie, they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand) stops being resident here if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period. Section YD 1(6) then provides that the person will be treated as non-resident from the first of those 325 days. 173. The 325-day rule is satisfied if a person is absent from New Zealand for 325 days or more in total in any 12-month period; it does not relate to income years. The days of absence do not need to be consecutive. 174. The 325-day rule only applies to make someone non-resident if they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. If someone has a permanent place of abode here, they will remain resident even if they are absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period. 175. A person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days and who does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand immediately prior to their departure will have their non-residence back-dated to the first day of the period of absence. However, a person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 20 Jun 2012 1 Jun 2012 1 Aug 2012 17 Jan 2013 20 days in NZ 170 days in NZ Out of NZ 34 325 days and who has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at the time of their departure will only have their non-residence back-dated to the day after the day they lose their permanent place of abode in New Zealand. In this situation it is not necessary to commence the day counting again after the person loses their permanent place of abode. If the person is absent for, say, 100 days before losing their permanent place of abode, those 100 days will be taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule. When the person is finally absent for more than 325 days they will cease to be resident from day 101 (ie, the day after the day on which they lost their New Zealand permanent place of abode). 176. The combined effect of the 325-day rule and the permanent place of abode test is that after 325 days of absence from New Zealand in a 12-month period, a person ceases to be resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of absence on which they do not have a permanent place of abode here. Once a person ceases to be resident, they will remain non-resident until they either acquire a permanent place of abode here or satisfy the 183-day rule. Examples illustrating the 325-day rule The following examples deal only with the 325-day rule. They do not consider the permanent place of abode test, the 183-day rule, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example 11 177. Facts: Jeremy left New Zealand on 1 May 2013 and returned again on 1 August 2013, a total of 91 days of absence. Jeremy stayed in New Zealand until 20 August 2013, a total of 20 days of presence. Jeremy remained absent until 1 February 2014, a total of 164 days. Jeremy stayed in New Zealand from 1 February 2014 until 16 February 2014, a total of 16 days. After leaving again on 16 February 2014, Jeremy returned to New Zealand on 30 April 2014, after a period of absence of 72 days. It is assumed that Jeremy does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand and that Jeremy was resident in New Zealand prior to his departure on 1 May 2013 by virtue of the 183-day rule. 178. Result: Jeremy is non-resident from 2 May 2013. 179. Explanation: Jeremy was absent for 327 days in total in the 12-month period commencing on 1 May 2013 (91 days commencing on 2 May 2013 and ending on 31 July 2013, 164 days commencing on 21 August 2013 and ending on 31 January 2014, and 72 days commencing on 17 February 2014 and ending on 29 April 2014). Jeremy is therefore non-resident from the first day of absence in that period (ie, 2 May 2013). Jeremy will remain non-resident until he acquires a 1 May 2013 1 Aug 2013 30 Apr 2014 20 Aug 2013 1 Feb 2014 16 Feb 2014 164 days out of NZ 16 days in NZ 72 days out of NZ 91 days out of NZ 20 days in NZ 35 permanent place of abode here or until he is present here for more than 183 days in any period of 12 months. Example 12 180. Facts: Claire leaves New Zealand on 1 April 2014 and returns on 1 August 2015. Claire has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at all times during this period; she owns a house here, has strong economic and personal ties with New Zealand, and remains in the employment of her New Zealand employer. 181. Result: Claire remains resident in New Zealand at all times during her absence. 182. Explanation: Although Claire is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days (ie, 365 days) in the 12-month period commencing on 2 April 2014, she remains resident here because she has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at all times during her absence. Example 13 183. Facts: James was seconded to the Australian office of his employer for six months, and left New Zealand on 1 May 2014. James had always lived in New Zealand (with his parents), had a boyfriend here, and intended to return after the six -month period. James left most of his personal property, including his car, with his parents. After he had been in Australia for three months, James was offered a permanent job there, which he accepted. James stayed in Australia, and arranged to have his personal property transported to Australia and his New Zealand bank accounts closed. James asked his parents to sell his car, and he ended his relationship with his boyfriend. James intends to remain in Australia indefinitely. 184. Result: James lost his New Zealand permanent place of abode on 1 August 2014, when he resigned from his substantive position in New Zealand and accepted the permanent job in Australia. Although it was in the following weeks that James made arrangements to have his property transported to Australia, closed his New Zealand bank accounts, and ended his relationship, the decision to resign from his position in New Zealand and accept the permanent position in Australia is the time from which it is apparent that James had formed the intention to remain in Australia indefinitely. Accordingly, James ceased to be resident in New Zealand from this time. 185. Explanation: James was personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in the 12-month period commencing on 2 May 2014. 186. However, James did not lose his New Zealand permanent place of abode when he originally departed on 1 May 2014 because he had a place of abode available to him (his parents’ house, where he had lived prior to his departure), he retained close personal and employment ties with New Zealand, and he intended to return after a brief period of absence. James lost his New Zealand permanent place of abode on 1 August 2014 when he resigned from his job in New Zealand and accepted the job in Australia, from which point he had decided to stay there indefinitely. 187. Although James was absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12- month period commencing on 2 May 2014, he did not cease to be resident in New Zealand until 1 August 2014 when he lost his New Zealand permanent place of abode. 36 Relationship between the permanent place of abode test and the day-count rules Overlap of the rules 188. As noted above, if a person is personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period they are resident here, and treated as such from the first of those days of presence. The person then remains resident until they cease to be resident under the 325-day rule. The combined effect of the 325-day rule and the permanent place of abode test is that a person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in any 12-month period is treated as non-resident from the first of those days of absence, or from the first day during the period of absence on which they no longer have a permanent place of abode here, whichever is later. 189. The effect of the back-dating of both the 183-day and 325-day rules means that where a person has travelled in and out of New Zealand there may be an overlap between those rules. This is because a person who is resident under the 183-day rule may have been temporarily absent from New Zealand at some time before the 183-day rule was satisfied. If the person then satisfies the 325-day rule, they will cease to be resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of absence (assuming they have no permanent place of abode in New Zealand), even though that day falls before the final day which is taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule. In this situation the period of absence taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule overlaps with the period of presence taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule. This may result in the person being treated as a New Zealand resident for a period of less than 183 days, even though they were present here for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. 190. The two rules may also overlap in the converse situation. A person who ceases to be resident under the 325-day rule may have been temporarily present in New Zealand at some time before the 325-day rule was satisfied. If the person then satisfies the 183-day rule by being present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period, the person will become resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of presence, even though that day falls before the final day which is taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule. This may result in the person being treated as non-resident for a period of less than 325 days even though they were absent for more than 325 days in a 12-month period. 191. Where there is an overlap between a period taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule and a period taken into account for the purposes of the 325- day rule, the later period operates to confer residence or non-residence, respectively, from the first day of that period. 37 Examples illustrating the relationship between the 183-day and 325-day rules The following examples deal only with the relationship between the 183-day and 325- day rules. They do not consider the permanent place of abode test, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example 14 192. Facts: Henry left New Zealand on 1 May 2013 and returned on 1 January 2014, after 244 days of absence. Henry left New Zealand again on 1 February 2014 after 32 days of presence here. Henry returned on 28 April 2014, after 85 days of absence, and remained in New Zealand from that point onwards. It is assumed that Henry did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand until after he returned on 28 April 2014. It is also assumed that Henry was resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule prior to his departure on 1 May 2013. 193. Result: Henry is treated as non-resident from 2 May 2013 until 31 December 2013. Henry is treated as resident in New Zealand again from 1 January 2014. 194. Explanation: Henry was personally absent from New Zealand for 329 days in total in the 12-month period commencing on 2 May 2013 (ie, for 244 days from 2 May 2013 to 31 December 2013, and for 85 days from 2 February 2014 to 27 April 2014). Henry is therefore treated as non-resident in New Zealand from the first day of absence, ie, 2 May 2013. 195. Henry was personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in the 12- month period commencing on 1 January 2014 (ie, for 32 days from 1 January 2014 to 1 February 2014, and 248 days from 28 April 2014 to 31 December 2014 – a total of 280 days). Henry is therefore treated as resident from the first of those days of presence, ie, 1 January 2014. 196. The period taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule cuts into the period taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule. Therefore, Henry is only treated as non-resident from the commencement of the period of absence (ie, 2 May 2013) until the day before the beginning of the period taken into account for the purposes of the 183 -day rule (ie, 31 December 2014). 1 May 2013 1 Jan 2014 1 Feb 2014 28 Apr 2014 244 days out of NZ 32 days in NZ 85 days out of NZ 38 Example 15 197. Facts: Belinda arrived in New Zealand on 1 November 2012 and stayed here for 150 days, until 30 March 2013. Belinda left New Zealand on 30 March 2013 and returned on 5 May 2013, a period of absence of 35 days (ie, from 31 March 2013 to 4 May 2013). Belinda was present in New Zealand from 5 May 2013 to 11 June 2013, a total of 38 days. Belinda left the country again on 12 June 2013 and has remained outside New Zealand since that time. It is assumed that Belinda was resident outside New Zealand before she arrived on 1 November 2012, and that she did not at any time have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 198. Result: Belinda is treated as resident in New Zealand from 1 November 2012 to 30 March 2013. Belinda is treated as non-resident from 31 March 2013. 199. Explanation: Belinda was present in New Zealand for 188 days in the 12-month period commencing on 1 November 2012 (ie, for 150 days from 1 November 2012 to 30 March 2013, and for 38 days from 5 May 2013 to 11 June 2013). Belinda is treated as resident from the first of those days of presence, ie, 1 November 2012. 200. Belinda was absent from New Zealand for 327 days in the 12-month period commencing on 31 March 2013 (ie, for 35 days from 31 March 2013 until 4 May 2013, and for 292 days from 12 June 2013 to 30 March 2014). Belinda is treated as non-resident from the first of those days of absence, ie, 31 March 2013. 201. The period taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule cuts into the period taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule. As a result, Belinda is only treated as resident from the commencement of the period of presence (ie, 1 November 2012) until the day before the beginning of the period taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule (ie, 30 March 2013). Government service rule 202. There is a special residence rule for people absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government (s YD 1(7)). This rule provides that any person who is absent from New Zealand in the service, in any capacity, of the government of New Zealand is treated as a New Zealand resident during the period of absence. 203. Section s YD 1(7) states: Government servants (7) Despite subsection (5), a person who is personally absent from New Zealand in the service, in any capacity, of the New Zealand Government is treated as a New Zealand resident during the absence. 1 Nov 2012 30 Mar 2013 5 May 2013 11 Jun 2013 150 days in NZ 35 days out of NZ 38 days in NZ 39 204. Section YD 1(7) overrides the 325-day rule. Therefore, a person absent from New Zealand in the service of the government is resident here irrespective of the length of their absence from New Zealand or whether they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The provision applies while they remain in that service. 205. The purpose of s YD 1(7) is for New Zealand to retain the taxing rights to the income of people absent from New Zealand but who remain closely connected to New Zealand because they are representatives and servants of the New Zealand government abroad. The section is consistent with the longstanding tax treaty practice of countries retaining exclusive rights to tax the personal services-type income of their government representatives and servants abroad. This treaty practice conforms to the rules of international courtesy and mutual respect between countries, and is also consistent with the provisions of the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations 7 . This int ernational approach to taxing government servants explains the reason for s YD 1(7), as without the provision the employment income of New Zealand government servants abroad may not be taxed at all. 206. For the government service rule in s YD 1(7) to apply the person needs to be “personally absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government”. To meet this requirement, the Commissioner considers the person must have been present in New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government before their departure. Further, based on the wording of s YD 1(7), and taking into account the purpose of the rule, the Commissioner considers that being in the service of the New Zealand government should be the reason for the person departing from New Zealand. For example, s YD 1(7) will apply to an existing government employee being sent from New Zealand to pursue their duties for the New Zealand government abroad, or a government employee departing from New Zealand to undertake study overseas for their government department. This is because there is a sufficient connection between the person’s absence from New Zealand and their service to the New Zealand government. 207. In the Commissioner’s view, the government service rule in s YD 1(7) does not apply to treat people as New Zealand residents if they accept “local office” positions with the New Zealand government when they are abroad. For example, a person who is living in Paris and is recruited by the New Zealand embassy in Paris would not be treated as a New Zealand resident under s YD 1(7). It also does not apply if a person leaves New Zealand to take up a “local office” New Zealand government position overseas but they are not already in the service of the New Zealand government when they leave. 208. Employees of government departments (or their departmental agencies), and members of the New Zealand Defence Force and New Zealand Police, who are posted overseas from New Zealand will be considered to be absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. This includes government servants who are pursuing studies overseas for the New Zealand government. 209. Employees of State-owned enterprises and contractors to the New Zealand government are not considered to be in the service of the New Zealand government as they are not so closely connected to the New Zealand government. They are not treated as New Zealand residents under s YD 1(7). 210. Employees of other public bodies will be subject to s YD 1(7) if their employing body is so closely controlled by the Government that it is an agent or instrument 7 The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 500 UNTS 95 (opened for signature 18 April 1961, ratified by New Zealand on 23 September 1970) and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 596 UNTS 261 (opened for signature 24 April 1963, signed by New Zealand on 10 September 1974). 40 of the New Zealand government. Control is measured by how much independence and discretion the body can insist on, not by how much control is actually enjoyed by the body. When the nature and degree of control exercised by the government is uncertain, or a public body has a substantial measure of independent discretion, the courts have indicated a reluctance to recognise the public body as an agent of the government. 211. Most public bodies listed as government agents in the Crown Entities Act 2004 are sufficiently controlled by the government to satisfy the common law test of control, and will therefore be agents of the government. Similarly, wholly owned subsidiaries of those government agents will also likely be sufficiently controlled to satisfy the test. This means employees of those bodies will probably be considered to be in the service of the New Zealand government. However, decisions need to be made on a body-by-body basis, taking into account the particular facts and governing rules for each body. 212. Bodies such as autonomous government entities, independent government entities, school boards of trustees and tertiary education institutions will most likely be too independent and enjoy too much dis cretion to be agents of the government. This means that employees of these bodies will not be in the service of the New Zealand government. 213. If a person ceases to be in the service of the New Zealand government while overseas, they will be non-resident from the date they cease their service, provided that they have satisfied the 325-day rule and do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 214. Section YD 1(7) does not apply to a spouse/partner or child accompanying someone in the service of the government on overseas postings. Their residence status needs to be determined independently under s YD 1. 215. Some DTAs that New Zealand is a party to have a specific article that allocates taxing rights in relation to remuneration for services rendered by government servants. Accordingly, when a person who is treated as a New Zealand resident under s YD 1(7) is serving in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, the provisions of that DTA need to be considered. Examples illustrating the government service rule The following examples deal only with the government service rule. They do not consider the permanent place of abode test or any DTA implications. Example 16 216. Facts: Aroha is an employee of a government department, living and working in Wellington. The government department needs Aroha to work overseas for four years. She will continue to be employed and paid by the government department during her absence. Aroha’s husband and children will accompany her overseas. 217. Result: Aroha is treated as a New Zealand resident under s YD 1(7), and will continue to be for as long as she is absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. Aroha’s husband and children are not absent on government service so s YD 1(7) does not apply to them. 218. Explanation: Section YD 1(7) provides that despite the 325-day rule, a person who is absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government is treated as a New Zealand resident during the absence. 41 219. Aroha is absent from New Zealand in the service of the government. The reason for Aroha’s absence from New Zealand is to carry out her duties for the government department that she works for. As such, she is treated as a New Zealand resident under s YD 1(7), and will continue to be for as long as she is absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. 220. Each person’s tax residence needs to be determined individually. Aroha’s husband and children are not absent on government service so s YD 1(7) does not apply to them. Example 17 221. Facts: Justine, a New Zealand expatriate, has been living and working in London for five years for an American bank. Justine is non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes. She hears that a New Zealand government department is looking for a person to work in its London office. She applies for the position and is successful. 222. Result: Justine will not become a New Zealand resident merely because she has started working for the New Zealand government in London. 223. Explanation: Justine is not absent from New Zealand in order to carry out her duties for the New Zealand government. She had been living away from New Zealand prior to her appointment to the position; the performance of her duties was not the reason for her absence from New Zealand. Transitional resident rules 224. New migrants and returning New Zealanders may be transitional residents under s HR 8(2). If a person is a transitional resident they are entitled to tax exemptions for certain income. 225. Under s HR 8(2), a person will be a transitional resident if:  they are a New Zealand resident through acquiring a permanent place of abode here, or through the 183-day rule;  for a continuous period of at least 10 years immediately before acquiring a permanent place of abode or satisfying the 183-day rule (ignoring the rule in s YD 1(4)) they did not meet those requirements, and were not resident in New Zealand;  they have not previously been a transitional resident; and  they have not ceased to be a transitional resident. 226. A person meeting the requirements for transitional residence will be a transitional resident (unless they elect not to be) from the first day that they are tax resident in New Zealand (under either the permanent place of abode test or the 183-day rule). If the person becomes a New Zealand tax resident under the 183-day rule, their tax residence will be back-dated under s YD 1(4) to the first of the 183 days of presence in New Zealand, and their transitional residence will start from that date. They will remain a transitional resident until the earliest of the following:  the end of the 48 th month after the month in which they acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or satisfied the 183-day rule (ignoring the back-dating rule in s YD 1(4)), whichever is earlier,  the date on which they stop being a New Zealand resident, or  the date on which they stop being a transitional resident because they elect not to be one (under s HR 8(4) or (5)). 227. The transitional resident rules provide a temporary tax exemption (s CW 27) for all foreign-sourced income except for: 42  employment income in connection with employment or service performed while the person is a transitional resident; and  income from a supply of services. 228. The transitional resident rules also ensure that other provisions in the Act apply to produce a result for income tax purposes that is the same as if the transitional resident were non-resident (for example the CFC rules, the FIF rules, the financial arrangements (FA) rules, the trust rules and the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules) (see s HR 8(1)). 229. Transitional residents and the spouses/partners of transitional residents are not entitled to working for families tax credits under the family scheme (ss MC 5, MD 7, and HR 8(5)). 230. The transitional resident rules apply to people who satisfy the requirements to be a transitional resident on or after 1 April 2006, for the 2005-06 and subsequent income years. 231. For further information about the transitional resident rules, and examples of how they apply, see “Temporary exemption from tax on foreign income for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) at 103, and “Temporary exemption for transitional residents” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) at 83. 232. However, it is noted that those TIB items are not accurate in two respects. Firstly, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) states that the period of transitional residence starts on the first day of the month in which the person migrates to New Zealand. However, as noted in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) and discussed above, the starting point for transitional residence is aligned with the start of a person’s tax residence in New Zealand (including when the period of tax residence is back-dated under s YD 1(4) – for example where a person has visited New Zealand prior to moving here). 233. Secondly, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) states that transitional residence lasts for 48 months after migration. However, as noted at \[226\], it in fact lasts till the end of the 48 th month after the month in which the person acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand (which will not necessarily be at the time of migration here) or satisfied the 183-day rule. To the extent that the TIB items on transitional residence suggest otherwise, they should not be relied on. Example illustrating the transitional resident rules The following example deals only with the transitional resident rules. It does not consider the 183-day and 325-day rules, the permanent place of abode test, or any DTA implications. Though the application of the 183-day rule is not considered in the example, it is referred to in the explanation. This is because it is necessary to know the time from which a person becomes tax resident in New Zealand, and whether they satisfied the 183-day rule or the permanent place of abode test first, in order to establish the period during which the person will be a transitional resident. 43 Example 18 \[This example is taken from “Temporary exemption for transitional residents” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007), though it has undergone some minor editing and the explanation for the result is slightly expanded.\] 234. Facts: Robert visited New Zealand on 1 February 2011 for a job interview. On 15 May 2011 he relocated here permanently and acquired a permanent place of abode at that time. On 29 October 2011 he satisfied the 183-day rule and was deemed to be tax resident in New Zealand from 1 February 2011 because of the back-dating rule in s YD 1(4). He has never been tax resident in New Zealand before, and has not elected not to be a transitional resident. 235. Result: Robert would qualify for transitional residence. His status as a transitional resident would run from 1 February 2011 to 31 May 2015, provided he remains resident here and does not make an election not to be a transitional resident. 236. Explanation: Robert is resident in New Zealand from 1 February 2011, under the 183-day rule and s YD 1(4). Robert has never been a tax resident or transitional resident in New Zealand before, and he has not elected to not be a transitional resident. He therefore satisfies the requirements of s HR 8(2). 237. Although Robert is treated as tax resident in New Zealand from 1 February 2011 (because of the back-dating rule in s YD 1(4)), he did not meet the requirements of either s YD 1(2) or (3) (ignoring the back-dating rule) for being a resident until 15 May 2011, when he moved here and acquired a permanent place of abode here. Robert acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand before he satisfied the 183-day rule. His status as a transitional resident would therefore run from 1 February 2011 (the date from which Robert is tax resident in New Zealand) to 31 May 2015 (the end of the 48 th month after the month in which he acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand). 1 Feb 2011 31 May 2015 29 Oct 2011 15 May 2011 Resident under the 183-day rule from this date (because of the back-dating rule). Moved to NZ and acquired a PPA here. Satisfied the 183-day rule. Transitional resident Robert’s transitional resident status starts from the first day of his NZ tax residence (1 Feb 2011). It ends at the end of the 48 th month after the month in which he satisfied either the PPA test or 183-day rule (whichever is earlier). Robert satisfied the PPA test before he satisfied the 183-day rule, so his transitional resident status runs until the end of the 48 th month after May 2011 (the month he acquired a PPA). 44 Changes in residence 238. The residence of a person may change during an income year if:  the person acquires a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during the year,  the first day of more than 183 days of presence in New Zealand in any 12- month period falls within the year,  the person ceases to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, or  the first day of more than 325 days of absence from New Zealand in any 12-month period falls within the year. 239. Some of the more significant income tax considerations that may be relevant when the residence status of a person changes during an income year are set out below. A change in residence may also have implications for the application of a DTA. Further, if a person is a settlor or beneficiary of a trust and their residence status changes there may be tax implications – see from \[456\]. (a) Taxation of foreign-sourced income 240. If the person derived income from sources outside New Zealand during the income year, that income will (subject to the transitional resident rules) be assessable income for New Zealand tax purposes if it was derived while the person was resident here (s BD 1(5)). Therefore, where a person’s residence status changes during an income year, the amount of any foreign-sourced income derived by the person while they were resident in New Zealand must be determined. To do so, the total foreign-sourced income derived will need to be reasonably apportioned to the periods of residence and non-residence. (b ) Foreign dividend payments \[applicable up until 31 March 2013\] 241. If the person derived dividends from a New Zealand resident company that has elected under s OC 1 to be a foreign dividend payment account company, any foreign dividend payment (FDP) credits attached to dividends derived by the person are creditable, whether or not the person was resident when the dividends were derived. If the dividends were derived while the person was non-resident, the FDP credits can be credited against any non-resident withholding tax liability in respect of the dividend. Any excess credits are creditable against any other tax liability of the person to the extent of that liability, with any further excess credits being refundable. (c ) The financial arrangements rules 242. The financial arrangements rules are a timing regime that spreads income and expenditure under a financial arrangement over the term of the arrangement. If a person becomes a New Zealand resident during an income year and is a party to a financial arrangement, they may become subject to the financial arrangements rules. Where this is the case, they are treated as having assumed the accrued obligation to pay consideration under the financial arrangement immediately after the time at which they became resident, and as having paid the market value that a contract to assume the obligation had at that time (s EW 37(2)). The deemed acquisition price will then be taken into account in any subsequent base price adjustment required under s EW 29. To the extent that the exemption from the financial arrangements rules for non-residents (s EW 9) previously applied, that exemption will cease to apply when the person becomes resident. 243. If the person ceases to be a New Zealand resident during an income year and is a party to a financial arrangement, they must calculate a base price adjustment for 45 the financial arrangement as at the date of ceasing to be resident (s EW 29). If the base price adjustment is positive, it will be income derived by the person in the year for which the calculation is made (s EW 31(3)). If the base price adjustment is negative, it will be expenditure incurred by the person in the year for which the calculation is made, and a deduction may be allowed for that expenditure under s DB 6, s DB 7, s DB 8 or s DB 11 (s EW 31(4)). An exception exists if the person is a cash basis person and they cease to be a New Zealand resident before the first day of the fourth income year following the income year in which they first became a New Zealand resident. In that case, they do not need to calculate a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement that they were a party to both before becoming and after ceasing to be a New Zealand resident (s EW 30(1)). 244. A financial arrangement will be an excepted financial arrangement for a transitional resident if no other party is a New Zealand resident and the financial arrangement is not for a purpose of a business carried on in New Zealand by a party to the arrangement (s EW 5(17)). (d ) Provisional tax 245. If the person ceases to be a New Zealand resident during the income year, they may cease to be a provisional taxpayer for the purposes of the provisional tax rules (being the provisions listed in s RC 2). Conversely, if the person becomes a New Zealand resident during the income year, they may become a provisional taxpayer and liable to pay provisional tax in accordance with the provisional tax rules regime (s RC 3). Relevance of double taxation agreements 246. New Zealand is party to DTAs with a number of countries. Where someone is tax resident in both New Zealand and a country with which we have a DTA, the DTA will determine what taxing rights each country has. 247. For a list of countries that New Zealand has DTAs with see http://www.ird.govt.nz/international/residency/dta/. Dual residence 248. Dual residence occurs when an individual is resident in two countries under the laws of each of those countries. This can easily arise, as different countries have different tests of residence, or they may use more than one residence test. One situation where dual residence is likely to arise in practice is where one country has a personal presence test and another relies on more permanent connections focusing on other factors, such as the location of a person’s home or their domicile. For example, if country A deems a person resident after they have been present there for 183 days, and country B employs a test based on other factors, a person normally resident in country B who is present in country A for a six -month period may be resident in both countries. Consequently, if both countries tax on a worldwide basis an element of double taxation may occur. 249. The New Zealand residence rules for individuals are intended to make it relatively easy to become resident here, and more difficult to lose residence. As such, dual residence may occur quite easily in the New Zealand context. Individuals who become resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule may also be resident in another country under a test based on other factors, such as domicile. Conversely, individuals leaving New Zealand may remain resident here under the permanent place of abode test, while at the same time becoming resident in another country under a personal presence rule. 46 250. Where there is a DTA between New Zealand and another country, dual residence issues will be resolved by application of the residence article in the DTA. The object of that article is to ensure that taxpayers are precluded from having dual residence for DTA purposes. Where a taxpayer is resident under the domestic laws of New Zealand and the treaty partner, dual residence is avoided for the purposes of the DTA by applying a series of “tie-breaker” tests to allocate residence to one of the countries. Once residence has been allocated in this manner, the tax liability of the person, in relation to the items covered by the DTA, is determined on the basis of that residence status. Section BH 1(4) states: Overriding effect (4) Despite anything in this Act, except subsection (5), or in any other Inland Revenue Act or the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993, a double tax agreement has effect in relation to— (a) income tax: (b) any other tax imposed by this Act: (c) the exchange of information that relates to a tax, as defined in paragraphs (a)(i) to (v) of the definition of tax in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 251. The Court of Appeal in CIR v ER Squibb & Sons (NZ) Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,146 at 9,154 said this means that “wherever and to the extent that there is any difference between the domestic legislation and the double tax agreement provision, the agreement has overriding effect”. This means that the domestic legislation must be read together with the relevant DTA articles. 252. When a person who is tax resident in New Zealand under domestic law is deemed to be resident in another country for the purposes of a DTA, the person remains liable to New Zealand income tax on their worldwide income on the basis of their residence here. However, the liability is modified by any restrictions imposed by the DTA on New Zealand’s right to tax persons who are deemed to be resident in the other country for the purposes of the DTA. For example, if the person receives dividends from a New Zealand resident company, the dividend resident withholding tax (RWT) would be calculated on the basis of the normal rate, but would be subject to the limitation imposed by the DTA on New Zealand’s right to tax dividends derived by someone deemed to be resident of the DTA partner for DTA purposes. In most cases, the amount of tax that could be levied in New Zealand could not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividend. 253. It is emphasised that the DTA residence articles are only relevant for the purposes of the DTAs. Someone who is resident in two countries under the domestic tax laws of those countries remains resident in both countries for other tax purposes – for example, goods and services tax. Residence article 254. The residence article in many of New Zealand’s DTAs closely follows the residence article contained in the OECD’s Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (the OECD Model Convention). The residence article (art 4) of the OECD Model Convention, as it relates to individuals, provides: 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or capital situated therein. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows: a) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be 47 deemed to be a resident only of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); b) if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has an habitual abode; c) if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which he is a national; d) if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 255. As can be seen, the article applies when a person is a resident of both countries (Contracting States) under para \[1\]. This does not include any person who is liable to tax in a State in respect only of income from sources in that State. When the article applies, the person’s residence status for the purposes of the Convention is determined by applying a series of “tie-breaker” tests. The “tie- breaker” tests in the relevant DTA are applied in order, until residence can be determined under one of them. 256. The DTA residence “tie-breaker” tests only potentially apply where the person concerned is resident of both countries under para \[1\] of art 4. Therefore, if a person comes to New Zealand from, say, Canada, becomes resident in New Zealand and ceases to be resident in Canada (and thus ceases to be liable to tax in Canada by reason of any of the listed criterion or similar criterion), it is clear that the person is resident in New Zealand for both the purposes of the Act and the DTA with Canada. The residence allocation rules will not be relevant in these circumstances because the person would not be a resident of Canada under para \[1\] of art 4. The DTA will still be relevant in terms of allocating taxing rights for any Canadian-sourced income. Interpretation of terms used in the residence article 257. The terms “permanent home”, “personal and economic relations” (or “centre of vital interests”) and “habitual abode” are not defined in any of New Zealand’s DTAs. 258. The “ general definitions” article of New Zealand’s DTAs typically provides that in applying the DTA, “unless the context otherwise requires”, any term not defined in the DTA has the meaning which it has under the laws of that State relating to the taxes to which the DTA applies. 259. The OECD commentary on art 3 (the “General definitions” article) of the OECD Model Convention states that the paragraph of the article concerning undefined terms was amended in 1995 to conform more closely to the general understanding of member States. The commentary notes that for the purposes of this paragraph of the article, the meaning of any undefined term may be ascertained by reference to the meaning it has for the purposes of any relevant provision of the domestic law (whether a tax law or not) of a Contracting State. This means that the meaning of an undefined term in a DTA may be ascertained by reference to domestic laws generally, not just tax laws (though any tax law meaning will prevail). 260. But, as noted, reference to any meaning that those terms may have under domestic law is only relevant if the context does not require otherwise. One of the general rules of treaty interpretation in art 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 8 , which New Zealand has ratified, is that a special meaning 8 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1155 UNTS 331 (opened for signature 23 May 1969, ratified by New Zealand on 4 August 1971). 48 shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended (para \[4\] of art 31). 261. If a DTA between New Zealand and another country uses the wording of a particular article in the OECD Model Convention (or very similar wording), the Commissioner considers that it can be inferred that the OECD commentary on that article reflects the meaning the parties intended to be given to any undefined terms in that article. The Commissioner considers that in such circumstances the OECD commentary will be a significant aid to interpreting the relevant undefined terms. In such a case, the Commissioner considers that the context requires that the undefined term not simply be regarded as having the meaning (if any) that it has under domestic law – which is the default position under the “general definitions” article. 262. The OECD commentary on the residence article gives guidance on the meanings to be given to the above undefined terms (“permanent home”, “personal and economic relations” (or “centre of vital interests”) and “habitual abode”). New Zealand’s DTAs generally follow, or closely follow, the wording in the OECD Model Convention. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the OECD commentary on those terms will be a significant aid to interpreting their meaning, and any case law (New Zealand or foreign) that considers the meaning of the undefined term in a DTA context should also be considered. Permanent home test 263. The first test in the residence articles in New Zealand’s DTAs gives preference to the country in which the person “has a permanent home available to \[them\]”. There are three elements to the test: there must be a home, it must be permanent, and it must be available for use. 264. It is evident from the OECD commentary that the concept of “home” is used in its physical sense (the commentary states that any form of home may be taken into account – ie, a house, apartment, rented or furnished room). 265. The OECD commentary states that for a home to be permanent “the individual must have arranged and retained it for his permanent use as opposed to staying at a particular place under such conditions that it is evident that the stay is intended to be of short duration” (OECD commentary on art 4 at \[12\]). The test is therefore an objective one, and it is necessary to consider the conditions under which the person retained the home and then conclude from that whether the home has the quality of permanence. 266. The OECD commentary on art 4 of the OECD Model Convention emphasises that the permanence of the home is essential, and states that this means that “the person has arranged to have the dwelling available to him at all times continuously, and not occasionally for the purposes of a stay which, owing to the reasons for it, is necessarily of short duration” (OECD commentary on art 4 at \[13\]). The OECD commentary gives as examples travel for pleasure, business travel, educational travel, attending a course at a school, etc. 267. The home must be available for the person’s use. Availability in this context is not based on mere occupation, or immediate availability for occupation. “Available” is a broad term that includes several concepts including factual availability and legal availability (ie, legal rights and controls over the property). Determining whether a home is available involves assessing factors such as whether: 9  the home is capable of being used by the person; 9 See Case 12/2011 \[2011\] NZTRA 08, (2011) 25 NZTC 1-012 and Case J41. 49  the person has the right to determine occupancy and possession of the property;  the person has the power to dispose of the property. 268. Applying these factors, the Commissioner considers that when a home is let out on an arm’s length basis to an unassociated person it will generally be unavailable to the landlord as a permanent home. As a result, the Commissioner considers a house that is let under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (including one let on a periodic tenancy) will generally be unavailable to the landlord as a permanent home. If the house is let to an associated person or friend it might still be available to the owner as a permanent home. 269. The Commissioner is of the view that owning or personally renting accommodation is not fundamental to a person having a permanent home available to them. For example, a person may have a permanent home where accommodation is owned or leased by an employer, spouse/partner, company or trust (not controlled by the person), or where the person is able to live somewhere rent-free. If a person owns or personally rents a home that will be a relevant consideration, but if a home is arranged or retained in some other way (by or through a third party, for example) this will not of itself be determinative of whether the person has a permanent home. This is consistent with the view expressed in G A Harris, New Zealand’s International Taxation, Auckland, OUP, 1990. To the extent that Case 12/2011 may arguably suggest otherwise, the Commissioner does not agree. 270. If it is apparent that a person who is dual resident has a permanent home available in one country or jurisdiction that will be an end to the matter unless the person can establish that they also have a permanent home available in the other country or jurisdiction. Where a person has a permanent home available in both countries, the next test will generally be the personal and economic relations test. \[The DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia, signed on 19 March 1976, differs in that if residence cannot be resolved under the permanent home test, the next test is the habitual abode test, followed by the personal and economic relations test.\] 271. Where a person does not have a permanent home available to them in either country, the next test for consideration will generally be the habitual abode test. However, this is not the case under New Zealand’s DTAs with Australia 10 , Thailand 11 , the Republic of South Africa 12 , the United Arab Emirates 13 , Spain 14 and Papua New Guinea 15 . Under those DTAs where a person does not have a permanent home available to them in either country the next test is the personal and economic relations test, followed by the habitual abode test. Personal and economic relations (centre of vital interests) test 272. Generally the next test in the residence articles in New Zealand’s DTAs gives preference to the country “with which \[the person’s\] personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests)”. 273. In applying this test, the person’s personal and economic relations with both New Zealand and the other country must be considered, and the country with which these relations are closer (or in other words, their centre of vital interests) must be determined. The OECD commentary on art 4 of the OECD Model Convention 10 Signed on 26 June 2009. 11 Signed on 22 October 1998. 12 Signed on 6 February 2002. 13 Signed on 22 September 2003. 14 Signed on 28 July 2005. 15 Signed on 29 October 2012. 50 indicates that the following types of factors may be taken into account in applying the test (at \[15\]): ... regard will be had to his family and social relations, his occupations, his political, cultural or other activities, his place of business, the place from which he administers his property, etc. The circumstances must be examined as a whole, but it is nevertheless obvious that considerations based on the personal acts of the individual must receive special attention. If a person who has a home in one State sets up a second in the other State while retaining the first, the fact that he retains the first in the environment where he has always lived, where he has worked, and where he has his family and possessions, can, together with other elements, go to demonstrate that he has retained his centre of vital interests in the first State. 274. It is clear from the commentary that the “personal relations” referred to are wider than immediate family relations. Social relations are also taken into account, as are political, cultural and other activities. Sporting activities, for example, would fall into this latter category. Overall, a wide range of personal connections is taken into account. 275. The importance of the location of a person’s family depends on the person’s circumstances (ie, for some people the location of family is going to be significant, for others not so). In many circumstances personal relations will be more significant than economic relations because the location of a person’s family is often highly significant. However, the issue needs to be determined on the specific facts relating to the person. 276. In Hertel v MNR 93 DTC 721 at 723, Sobier TCCJ commented that: In determining the centre of vital interests, it is not enough to simply weigh or count the number of factors or connections on each side. The depth of the roots of one’s centre of vital interests is more important than their number. 277. Assessing the depth of a person’s roots requires weighing up the circumstances as a whole to determine which locality is of greater significance to the person. Some commentators have suggested that greater weight is to be given to personal relations. However, the Commissioner considers that the better view is that the “centre of vital interests” concept is a composite one, and does not give preference to either personal or economic relations. The OECD commentary states that “considerations based on the personal acts of the individual must receive special attention”. The Commissioner considers that “personal acts” encompasses acts concerning both economic relations (such as seeking employment in a country) and personal relations (such as activities related to a person’s family). 278. If a person’s economic and personal relations are overall evenly balanced between New Zealand and another country (though personal relations are stronger with one country and economic relations with the other), the person will have no centre of vital interests, as the factors are regarded as being of equal weight. In this situation, the next test will need to be considered. 279. A person’s historical association with a country is relevant when considering the personal and economic relations test. If a person has always lived and worked in one country and retains a home, family and possessions there, it is likely that their personal and economic relations will be closer with that country even if a new home is established in another country (see Gaudreau v R 2005 DTC 66 (TCC) and Yoon v R 2005 DTC 1109). For example, a university lecturer going overseas on sabbatical leave for 12 months who has lived and worked in New Zealand for a significant time, and who retains their home and possessions in New Zealand, will have closer personal and economic relations with New Zealand than with the other country. 280. The focus of the test is on determining the country with which the person has closer personal and economic relations (their centre of vital interests). If such a 51 determination cannot be made under the personal and economic relations test, the next test needs to be considered. Generally, the next test will be the habitual abode test. Habitual abode test 281. Generally, the habitual abode test applies in two situations:  if a person has a permanent home available in both countries, and the country with which their personal and economic relations are closer (their centre of vital interests) cannot be established; or  if a person has no permanent home available in either country 16 . 282. The focus of the test is on whether the person has a habitual abode in New Zealand and/or the other country. As stated by the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal in Lingle v R 2010 FCA 152, the concept of a habitual abode: ... involves notions of frequency, duration and regularity of stays of a quality which are more than transient. To put it differently, the concept refers to a stay of some substance in the jurisdiction as a matter of habit, so that the conclusion can be drawn that this is where the taxpayer normally lives. A person will have a habitual abode in a country if they live there habitually or normally. A person may habitually live in more than one country; the enquiry is not about assessing the country in which the person’s abode is more habitual, but about whether they have a habitual abode in New Zealand and/or the other country. 283. The OECD commentary on art 4 of the OECD Model Convention indicates that the test is applied by taking into account all of a person’s stays in a country, not only those at a home the person owns or rents there. For example, if a person has permanent homes available in both New Zealand and Australia, all stays in New Zealand, whether at their permanent home or elsewhere, are considered in determining whether the person has a habitual abode here. 284. It is important to consider the particular circumstances of the person when determining whether they have a habitual abode in a country. In assessing whether a stay is more than transient, the reasons for the stay are relevant. For example, where a person spends approximately 100 days in New Zealand in a year because they return to New Zealand every weekend, this may suggest that the person has a habitual abode here. On the other hand, three stays of approximately 30 days duration each in a year, for a course of medical treatment, may indicate that those stays are transient and not by themselves indicative of a habitual abode here. 285. The OECD commentary also indicates that the test is not applied by focusing only on the income year concerned. The OECD commentary states that: ... \[t\]he comparison must cover a sufficient length of time for it to be possible to determine whether the residence in each of the two States is habitual and to determine also the intervals at which the stays take place”. 286. It is important to note though, that the focus is on where the person normally lives during the period of dual residence. In obvious cases there is no need to consider other periods. However, a wider view (ie, looking beyond the period of dual residence) may assist in cases where it is unclear, or when determining 16 As noted at \[271\], the DTAs between New Zealand and Australia (signed on 26 June 2009), Thailand (signed on 22 October 1998), South Africa (signed on 6 February 2002), the UAE (signed on 22 September 2003), Spain (signed on 28 July 2005) and PNG (signed on 29 October 2012) are exceptions to this. Under those DTAs, where a person does not have a permanent home available to them in either country the next test for consideration will be the personal and economic relations test. 52 whether the stays in a particular country are either transient or of substance. The Commissioner considers that the appropriate length of time outside of the period of dual residence to consider will be just the amount that is necessary to determine whether the person had a habitual abode in New Zealand during the period of dual residence. The Commissioner now considers that the period looked at in applying the habitual abode test in the matter that became Case 12/2011 was inappropriately long. In any event, it is noted that the TRA’s discussion of how the habitual abode test would apply to the facts of that case (which was along the lines of submissions made by counsel) was obiter, the TRA having already found the taxpayer to be solely resident in New Zealand at all material times under the earlier tie-breaker tests. Nationality and mutual agreement 287. When a person has a habitual abode in both countries, or in neither of them, residence is generally determined under New Zealand’s DTAs on the basis of nationality or citizenship. In cases where nationality is stated to be the test, the concept of nationality (for individuals) is generally defined in relation to New Zealand to be a person who is a New Zealand citizen. A New Zealand citizen is someone who has citizenship here under the Citizenship Act 1977. 288. If the residence issue cannot be resolved under the tie-breaker tests, the residence article provides that the question may be resolved by mutual agreement between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. Examples illustrating the DTA residence tie-breaker tests The following examples deal only with the DTA residence tie-breaker tests. They do not consider the domestic residence tests in detail, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example 19 289. Facts: Stacey, who is employed as a university lecturer, travels to the United Kingdom for 15 months sabbatical leave at a United Kingdom university. While on leave, Stacey remains in the employment of a New Zealand university, and is required to work for the university on her return to New Zealand. Stacey and her partner let their house in New Zealand out to tenants while they are in the United Kingdom. The tenancy is a periodic tenancy under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, so is terminable with a 42-day notice period if Stacey requires it as her principal place of residence. The tenants are not associated with or friends of Stacey or her partner. Stacey’s partner travels with her to the United Kingdom. Stacey remains a member of a number of local clubs and organisations in New Zealand, and keeps most of her personal property, including investments, in New Zealand (looked after and managed by family members). While in the United Kingdom, Stacey and her partner rent a house near the university where Stacey spends her sabbatical leave. For the purposes of this example it is assumed that Stacey is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom under the relevant United Kingdom legislation. 290. Result: Stacey is resident in both New Zealand and the United Kingdom under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and the United Kingdom, she is deemed to be a resident of the United Kingdom. 291. Explanation: Stacey is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 of the Act because she has a permanent place of abode here. As noted above, it is assumed that she 53 is also resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom under the relevant United Kingdom legislation. 292. The question of Stacey’s residence for the purposes of the DTA is resolved by the permanent home test. Stacey does not have a permanent home available in New Zealand because she and her partner have rented out their New Zealand home on arm’s length terms to tenants who are not associated with them or friends of theirs. Stacey has a permanent home in the United Kingdom as she has rented a house there for 15 months. Although Stacey’s stay in the United Kingdom is for a known and fixed duration, it is sufficiently long that it cannot be regarded as temporary. 293. As Stacey has a permanent home in the United Kingdom and does not have one in New Zealand, she is deemed to be a resident of the United Kingdom for the purposes of the DTA. Example 20 294. Facts: Luke owns a house in New Zealand and one in Malaysia. He has extensive business interests in both New Zealand and Malaysia. Luke regularly spends short periods in New Zealand, and these add up to approximately five months of the year. Luke’s visits to New Zealand are primarily for business purposes, but he also spends time catching up with family here. Luke works and lives in Malaysia for the remainder of the time, where he also occupies a number of positions of responsibility in the community. Luke is married, and his wife and children live in Malaysia. For the purposes of this example it is assumed that Luke is resident for tax purposes in Malaysia under the relevant Malaysian legislation. 295. Result: Luke is resident in both New Zealand and Malaysia under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia, Luke is treated solely as a Malaysian resident. 296. Explanation: Luke is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 of the Act as he has a permanent place of abode here. As noted above, it is assumed that he is also resident for tax purposes in Malaysia under the relevant Malaysian legislation. 297. Luke has permanent homes available to him in both New Zealand and Malaysia because his houses in both countries are continuously available to him for use. As Luke has a permanent home available to him in both countries, the next question is whether he has a habitual abode in either country. \[As noted at \[270\], the order of the tie-breaker tests in the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia, signed on 19 March 1976, differs from that in New Zealand’s other DTAs. Under New Zealand’s other DTAs, if a person has a permanent home available in both countries, the personal and economic relations test would be applied next.\] Luke has a habitual abode in Malaysia because he habitually lives there for seven months of the year. Luke also has a habitual abode in New Zealand because he habitually spends approximately five months of the year here. The reasons for Luke’s stays in New Zealand (business and visiting family) suggest that the stays are more than transient in nature. 298. As Luke has a habitual abode in both New Zealand and Malaysia, it is necessary to determine whether his personal and economic relations are closer with Malaysia or with New Zealand. \[Again, note the difference in the order of the tie- breaker tests in the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia, signed on 19 March 1976, compared to New Zealand’s other DTAs.\] Luke has close economic relations with both countries due to his extensive business interests in both countries. Luke also has personal relations with both countries. These personal relations are considered to be stronger with Malaysia, given that Luke’s wife and children live there, and also that he is involved in the community there. As such, 54 weighing up the circumstances as a whole, Luke’s personal and economic relations are closer with Malaysia. Luke is therefore treated solely as a Malaysian resident for the purposes of the DTA. Example 21 299. Facts: Megan, who normally resides in Canada, is seconded to New Zealand by her Canadian employer for a period of 18 months. While in New Zealand, Megan works for the New Zealand subsidiary of her Canadian employer. While she is in New Zealand, Megan lets her house in Canada out for a fixed-term of 18 months. The tenant is not associated with or a friend of Megan’s. Megan lives in rented accommodation in New Zealand. Megan leaves most of her personal property in Canada, and most of her investments are in Canada. For the purposes of this example it is assumed that Megan is resident for tax purposes in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. 300. Result: Megan is resident in both New Zealand and Canada under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and Canada, Megan is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand. 301. Explanation: Megan is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 as she is present here for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. As noted above, it is assumed that she is also resident in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. 302. Megan has a permanent home available to her in New Zealand as she has rented accommodation here for 18 months. Although Megan’s stay in New Zealand is for a known and fixed duration, it is sufficiently long that it cannot be regarded as temporary. Megan does not have a permanent home available to her in Canada as her house there is rented out on arm’s length terms to a tenant who is not associated with her or a friend of hers. As Megan has a permanent home available to her in New Zealand but not in Canada, she is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand for the purposes of the DTA. Example 22 303. Facts: Jonty grew up in South Africa, and moved to Canada with his parents when he was 16 years old (when his father was temporarily transferred there for work). After three years, his parents moved back to South Africa. By this time, Jonty had started university in Canada and decided to stay there. Jonty graduated and had been working in Canada for two years when he was offered a two-year secondment to New Zealand by his Canadian employer. While in New Zealand, Jonty is employed by the New Zealand subsidiary of his Canadian employer. Jonty retains his bank accounts in Canada and opens new ones in New Zealand. He does not transfer his Canadian superannuation into his New Zealand superannuation fund, as he may well return to Canada at the end of his secondment. Jonty lived in a rented flat in Canada, which he gave up when he moved to New Zealand. Jonty has to travel between Auckland and Wellington, on a roughly week-about basis, for work, and he lives in his employer’s serviced apartments in both cities. Jonty has very little personal property. What he does have he either brings with him to New Zealand or sells before leaving Canada. At the end of the two-year secondment, Jonty’s position in New Zealand is extended for another 18 months. During the three and a half years that Jonty lives in New Zealand, he returns to Canada once, for a three-week holiday. For the purposes of this example it is assumed that Jonty is resident for tax purposes in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. 304. Result: Jonty is resident in both New Zealand and Canada under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and Canada, Jonty is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand. 55 305. Explanation: Jonty is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 of the Act as he is personally present here for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. As noted above, it is assumed that he is also resident for tax purposes in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. Jonty does not have a permanent home available to him in Canada because he gave up his rented flat there. Jonty does not have a permanent home available in New Zealand because his homes here (a series of serviced apartments) are not permanent. 306. As Jonty does not have a permanent home available in either country, the question is whether Jonty has a habitual abode in either country. 307. Jonty has a habitual abode in New Zealand because he habitually or normally lives here during the period of dual residence. The period of dual residence is sufficiently long that it is not necessary to look beyond that period to determine whether Jonty’s time in New Zealand is transient or of substance. It is apparent that for the three and a half years of dual residence Jonty has a habitual abode in New Zealand. Jonty clearly does not have a habitual abode in Canada during the period of dual residence – he returned there only once in that time, for a holiday of short duration. Consequently, Jonty is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand for the purposes of the DTA. 56 Part 2 Residence of companies Overview 308. Section YD 2 of the Act sets out when a company is a New Zealand resident, stating (relevantly) that: YD 2 Residence of companies Four bases for residence (1) A company is a New Zealand resident for the purposes of this Act if— (a) it is incorporated in New Zealand: (b) its head office is in New Zealand: (c) its centre of management is in New Zealand: (d) its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company in New Zealand, even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside New Zealand. International tax rules (2) Despite subsection (1), for the purpose of the international tax rules, a company is treated as remaining resident in New Zealand if it becomes a foreign company but is resident in New Zealand again within 183 days afterwards. ... 309. A company may easily satisfy more than one, or even all, of these tests. Such a company will clearly be resident in New Zealand. However, it is noted that the tests are alternatives, and a company only needs to satisfy one of them to be resident here. 310. A “foreign company” is a company not resident in New Zealand and not treated as resident in New Zealand under a DTA (s YA 1). Section YD 3 sets out different tests to determine the country in which a foreign company is treated as resident for the purposes of the “international tax rules” (as defined in s YA 1). This is discussed briefly from \[429\]. 311. The discussion of the residence rules for companies is structured as follows: Company definition .................................................................................................. 57 Place of incorporation test ........................................................................................ 57 Head office test ....................................................................................................... 58 Centre of management test ...................................................................................... 59 Description of the test ........................................................................................... 59 Centre of management of the entire company .......................................................... 59 Comparison between the centre of management test and the head office test ............. 59 Director control test ................................................................................................. 60 Description ........................................................................................................... 60 Definition of director .............................................................................................. 60 Persons carrying out director’s duties .................................................................... 60 Persons giving directions or instructions to nominated directors ............................... 60 Companies without conventional directors ............................................................. 61 Companies as directors ....................................................................................... 61 Control by directors ............................................................................................... 61 De facto test ...................................................................................................... 61 Distinction between de facto control, influence and the provision of services .............. 63 Exercise of powers in NZ and in another country .................................................... 63 Residence of directors ......................................................................................... 64 Continuing test ................................................................................................... 64 Control of the entire company .............................................................................. 64 Comparison between director control and head office and centre of management tests .. 64 Examples illustrating the company residence tests ....................................................... 64 Changes in company residence.................................................................................. 67 Dual resident companies .......................................................................................... 70 Examples illustrating dual residence and the grouping of losses ..................................... 72 Residence of foreign companies ................................................................................. 73 57 Company definition 312. “Company” is defined in s YA 1. The relevant definition for the purposes of the residence rules is: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise— ... company— (a) means a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether it is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere: (ab) does not include a partnership: (abb) does not include a look-through company, except in the PAYE rules, the FBT rules, the NRWT rules, the RWT rules, the ESCT rules, the RSCT rules, and for the purposes of subpart FO (Amalgamation of companies): (ac) includes a listed limited partnership: (ad) includes a foreign corporate limited partnership: (b) includes a unit trust: (c) includes a group investment fund that is not a designated group investment fund, but only to the extent to which the fund results from investments made into it that are— (i) not from a designated source, as defined in section HR 3(5) (Definitions for section HR 2: group investment funds); and (ii) not made before 23 June 1983, including an amount treated as invested at that date under the definition of pre-1983 investment in section HR 3(8): (d) includes an airport operator: (e) includes a statutory producer board: (f) includes a society registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908: (g) includes a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908: (h) includes a friendly society: (i) includes a building society: ... 313. As the definition extends to any entity with a legal existence separate from that of its members, t his would include a wide range of entities established under the laws of other countries that, although not companies in the strict sense, are equivalent to companies. If any such entity satisfied any of the company residence tests in s YD 2, it would be a New Zealand resident company and would therefore be liable for tax here on its worldwide income. 314. Usually a look-through company is treated as being transparent, but for some tax purposes it is still treated as a company. For example, a look-through company is not transparent for the purposes of the NRWT rules and the RWT rules. In those circumstances the residence of the owners of the company is not relevant. This means that someone paying passive income to a look-through company that meets the requirements of subpart HB can assume that they are making a payment to a NZ resident company and not to the owners of the company. The company can be assumed to be a New Zealand resident company because to qualify as a look-through company in the first place the company needs to be a New Zealand resident under s YD 2 and any applicable DTA. Place of incorporation test 315. Section YD 2(1)(a) provides that a company is a New Zealand resident if it is incorporated in New Zealand. This is an objective and easily ascertainable test of corporate residence: a company is resident if it has been through a process of 58 incorporation in New Zealand. A company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 would be resident here. 316. The place of incorporation test obviously cannot apply to companies that are not capable of being incorporated. For example, there is no incorporation procedure for unit trusts in New Zealand, so they could not be resident here under s YD 2(1)(a). However, companies that cannot be incorporated may be resident in New Zealand under one of the other tests in s YD 2. Head office test 317. Section YD 2(1)(b) provides that a company is a New Zealand resident if its head office is in New Zealand. 318. The word “office” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, 3 rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2013, accessed 3 March 2014) (relevantly) as meaning: office, n. 6. a. A room, set of rooms, or building used as a place of business for nonmanual work; a room or department for clerical or administrative work. Also (in extended use): the staff of such a room, department, etc. 319. The Commissioner therefore considers that “office” in the context of the head office test means a physical place from where the business is conducted; a place where the administration and management (in the broadest sense) of a business is carried out. The head office of a company is the office that is above all others: the place of administration and management that is superior to all others. It is the office from which the business of the company is directed and carried on. An office will be superior to other offices of the company if individuals working in those other offices are responsible to individuals located in that office. The focus of the test is therefore on a physical place, in the sense of a building, from which the overall operations of the company are directed and carried on. 320. In determining whether a company has its head office in New Zealand the following factors may be relevant:  The location of senior management staff. If senior management operate from an office in New Zealand, this would be a strong indicator that the New Zealand office is the company’s head office.  Where the major strategic and policy decisions are made. If individuals working in other offices act in accordance with decisions and policy made at a particular office, that office is likely to be the head office.  Whether specialised functions, for example of an advisory nature, are carried out in a particular office. If a number of specialised functions are carried out in a particular office this may indicate that the office is the head office, although the significance of this factor will depend on the overall structure of the company.  Whether the staff of the company consider that an office is the head office. 321. Weighing up these factors should identify whether a company’s head office is in New Zealand. Usually there will not be uncertainty as to the location of a company’s head office. If a company is engaged in carrying on business activities, identifying the company’s highest office should not be difficult. An example where it could be more difficult is where a company is merely a passive investment vehicle. The passive nature of the company’s activities may make identifying its highest office difficult, or the company may simply have no office. 59 Centre of management test Description of the test 322. Section YD 2(1)(c) provides that a company is a New Zealand resident if its centre of management is in New Zealand. The focus of the test is on the centre of management of the company as a whole, not the management of only part of a company’s operations. In determining where the centre of management of a company as a whole is, acts of management at various levels may be relevant (see: Vinelight Nominees Limited and Weyand Investments Limited v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 655). 323. The test is a de facto test: that is, the focus is on where the company’s centre of management is as a matter of fact (NZ Forest Products Finance NV v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,073). The test is not limited to consideration of the company’s formal management structures, such as those set out in corporate governance documents. The test focuses on how the company is managed in reality, even if that conflicts with the governance documents or formal structures. 324. Therefore, if the senior executives of a company established in a foreign country manage the company on the basis of instructions from persons located in New Zealand, without exercising their independent minds as to how the company should be managed, the centre of management of the company will be in New Zealand rather than in the foreign country. This is the case even if the persons giving instructions from New Zealand are not officers of the company under the company’s constitution. That said, there may well be persons who influence the decisions made by the executives managing a company, or who provide guidance to them. This will not amount to de facto management of the company if those charged with the management are in fact exercising that management function independently, not merely doing the bidding of others who are in reality managing the company. Centre of management of the entire company 325. The centre of management test focuses on the centre of management of the entire company. Therefore, if a company that operates in several countries has a centre of management in New Zealand, but that centre of management only relates to the company’s New Zealand operations, the company will not be resident here under the centre of management test. 326. In some cases, multinational companies conduct business in New Zealand directly through a branch rather than through a locally established subsidiary. The local branch may have its own executives and, occasionally, its own board of directors. In this situation, although the company has significant links with New Zealand, it will not be resident here under the centre of management test. The management of the branch does not constitute the centre of management of the company as a whole, only the centre of management of a part of the company. 327. On the other hand, companies incorporated outside New Zealand, that conduct operations outside New Zealand, may ha ve their centre of management in New Zealand. Such companies will be resident in New Zealand under the centre of management test despite their close connections with other countries. Comparison between the centre of management test and the head office test 328. It may well be that a company satisfies both the head office and centre of management tests, as the centre of management of a company will commonly be located in its head office. However, the focus of the two tests is different. The head office test concentrates on a physical place, ie, on an office that constitutes a company’s highest office. By contrast, the focus of the centre of management 60 test is not on identifying the quality of a particular office, but rather on the broader question of whether the management of a company is centred in New Zealand. A company does not need to have an office in New Zealand to satisfy the centre of management test. 329. A company may have no office (and therefore obviously no head office) in New Zealand, but its centre of management may be here because the management decisions are effectively undertaken from New Zealand. In this situation, the company will be resident under the centre of management test, even though the head office test is not satisfied. Director control test Description 330. Section YD 2(1)(d) provides that a company is a New Zealand resident if its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company in New Zealand. A company that satisfies this test is resident whether or not the directors’ decision-making is confined to New Zealand. Definition of director Section YA 1 definition 331. The relevant definition of “director” in s YA 1 provides that: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise— ... director— (a) means— (i) a person occupying the position of director, whatever title is used: (ii) a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the persons occupying the position of directors of a company are accustomed to act: (iii) a person treated as being a director by any other provision of this Act: (iv) in the case of an entity that does not have directors and that is treated as, or assumed to be, a company by a provision of this Act, any trustee, manager, or other person who acts in relation to the entity in the same way as a director would act, or in a similar way to that in which a director would act, were the entity a company incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993: ... 332. This extended definition of director ensures that de facto directors are included when considering whether a company is a New Zealand resident under the director control test. Persons carrying out director’s duties 333. A person is treated as a director if they occupy the position of director, whether or not that title is used. That is, any person carrying out the duties of a director is a director. Persons giving directions or instructions to nominated directors 334. A person is treated as a director if those occupying the position of directors of a company are accustomed to act in accordance with the person’s directions or instructions. For example, if the directors of a company incorporated in Hong Kong were accustomed to act in accordance with instructions from a New Zealand resident individual, that individual would be a director of the company. The company may therefore potentially be a New Zealand resident under the director 61 control test, as control of the company by a director is exercised from here. \[See further from \[353\] as to the considerations to have regard to when there is exercise of directorial control both in New Zealand and elsewhere.\] 335. In practical terms, it will be necessary to consider a pattern of decision-making to determine whether the nominated directors are accustomed to act in accordance with another person’s directions or instructions (whether formal or otherwise). 336. The Commissioner considers that the directions or instructions do not need to be given directly to the person occupying the position of directors. For example, where there is a chain of companies that have directors who are accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of another person, the chain must be traced through to establish on whose directions or instructions the directors are accustomed to act. That person will be considered a director under the Act. For example, if the directors of company X are accustomed to act under instructions from the directors of company Y, and the directors of company Y act under instructions from a New Zealand resident A, then A will be a director of both X and Y under the definition of “director” in s YA 1. Companies without conventional directors 337. The definition of “director” in the Act extends to entities that do not have directors in the conventional sense. In the case of an entity that is treated as or assumed to be a company under the Act, a person who acts in the same or in a similar way to that in which a director would act is treated as a director. A person will fall within this part of the definition if they are involved in making the types of decisions that a director of a company would normally make. These would include major strategic and policy decisions. 338. Therefore, the manager of a unit trust would be a director because they are involved in making the major decisions in relation to the unit trust: for example, the decisions in relation to the management of the unit trust’s investments, the marketing of interests in the unit trust, and the distribution policy of the unit trust. If the manager exercises control of the unit trust from New Zealand, the unit trust will be a New Zealand resident. Companies as directors 339. The definition of director in the Act is broad enough to encompass both natural persons and companies that are appointed as or that act as directors. This may result in a New Zealand resident company being treated as a director of a company established in another jurisdiction (see Example 23 below). Control by directors 340. The director control test focuses on where the directors exercise their directorial control of the company from, ie, the place from which the strategic and policy decisions are made. A company will be resident in New Zealand under this test if directors are effectively controlling the company from New Zealand, ie, if the central and directing mind of the company is here. 341. The test is only satisfied if directors acting in their capacity as directors exercise control from New Zealand. If directors control a company from New Zealand in their capacity as shareholders, but not in their capacity as directors, the company will not be resident here under the director control test. De facto test 342. The director control test is satisfied if control of a company is exercised in New Zealand, whether or not decision-making by directors is confined to New Zealand. 62 The test is one of de facto control. That is, the question is whether control of the company by directors is actually exercised from New Zealand. 343. There are a number of ways in which directors may exercise control of a company. For example, control may be exercised through:  decisions made in the course of formal directors’ meetings;  decisions made in the course of a telephone / video link up etc between directors;  the signing of resolutions outside directors’ meetings;  informal decisions made by directors, acting in their capacity as directors, outside the course of the directors’ meetings. 344. The method by which directors exercise control of a company may vary considerably from case to case. Each case must be considered on its facts to determine the place from which the directors actually exercise control of the company. 345. The significance of the location of directors’ meetings will vary from case to case. If directors exercise control only in the course of directors’ meetings, then the location of the meetings will be of paramount importance. On the other hand, if control is exercised outside the directors’ meetings, and the meetings are merely to formalise decisions that have already been made, the location of the meetings will be of little significance. 346. The fact that directors of a company exercise directorial functions from New Zealand does not necessarily mean that control of the company by its directors is exercised from New Zealand. For example, if the directors ordinarily exercise their powers in the course of directors’ meetings held in Australia, the fact that New Zealand directors occasionally sign resolutions in New Zealand or occasionally participate in telephone conferences from New Zealand does not mean that the directors are exercising control of the company from New Zealand. See Case 11/2011 (2011) 25 NZTC 1-011, \[2011\] NZTRA 07. 347. If the nominated directors do not exercise control of a company, but rather de facto directors exercise control from New Zealand, the company will be resident in New Zealand even though the de facto directors are not directors under the company’s constitution. 348. Determining whether the nominated directors exercise true control requires consideration of how the company is, in reality, controlled. The fact that the nominated directors may be accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of another person does not necessarily mean that they are not exercising true control of the company (though it will mean that the person in accordance with whose directions or instructions they are accustomed to act would also be a director under the definition in s YA 1). If the nominated directors exercise their independent minds in undertaking their directorial functions, rather than acting as mere pawns or “rubber stamping” the decisions of others, they will be exercising true control of the company. 349. In considering whether the nominated directors are truly exercising directorial control, the remuneration provided to them may be a relevant consideration. If their remuneration does not reflect their apparent duties and responsibilities, the nominated directors may not be carrying the burden of decision-making responsibility. It is also appropriate to consider who the nominated directors are. In tax havens, for example, directors commonly have several hundred directorships. Such a situation may suggest that the directors are not actively involved in making decisions, and that their directorial functions are exercised in 63 accordance with outside instructions without the independent thought required for them to be considered to be exercising true control of the company. The circumstances of the exercise of the directorial functions would need to be considered closely to determine whether the nominated directors are in fact exercising the directorial function independently, or merely doing the bidding of others who are in reality controlling the company. Distinction between de facto control, influence and the provision of services 350. In practice, it may be difficult to determine whether the nominated directors of a company are acting under directions or instructions from another person or are merely influenced but not controlled by another person. A majority shareholder, for example a parent company, will normally influence to some extent the actions of the company in which it is a shareholder. However, if the majority shareholder only exercises the powers that such a shareholder would have in general meetings — for example, to appoint and dismiss members of the board, and to approve and initiate changes to the financial structure of the company — then that shareholder will not be controlling the company in terms of the director control test. 351. By contrast, if the majority shareholder assumes the functions of the company’s board, or if that board merely “rubber stamps” decisions made by the majority shareholder without independent consideration being given to the decisions, the majority shareholder will be a director of the company under the definition in the Act. This is consistent with the common law approach – see for example Unit Construction Co Ltd v Bullock \[1959\] 3 All ER 831 (UKHL). If this is the case, and if the majority shareholder exercises control of the company from New Zealand, the company will be resident here under the director control test. In considering whether someone has de facto control over a company, the degree of autonomy exercised by the members of the company’s board in relation to matters like investment, production, marketing, finance and procurement must be considered. If the board cannot make decisions about matters of this type without prior approval from the major shareholder, then the majority shareholder is likely to be in de facto control of the company. 352. In relation to companies that are subsidiaries, the de facto exercise of control by the parent company must be distinguished from the mere provision of advisory services. Often, large corporate organisations establish centralised advisory departments to provide administrative, financial, accounting, and other services for companies that are members of the organisation. When a parent company provides services of this nature to a subsidiary, it is not in control of the subsidiary under the director control test merely because of the provision of those services. Exercise of powers in New Zealand and in another country 353. In cases where a company has both New Zealand and foreign directors, the functions performed by the New Zealand directors from New Zealand must be considered to determine whether they constitute the exercise of control of the company by its directors from New Zealand. If the powers of all directors are equal, the issue may be resolved by simply looking to where the majority exercise their control. For example, if a company has directors with equal powers, three of whom live in Australia and two in New Zealand, and control is exercised through directors’ meetings held in Australia and through occasional teleconferences between the Australian and New Zealand directors, the company would not be resident in New Zealand under the director control test. In these circumstances, when the directors exercise their powers concurrently from New Zealand and Australia, the majority of the directors are located in Australia. 64 Consequently, on a simple majority approach, control of the company by its directors is not exercised from New Zealand. 354. However, a simple majority approach is not appropriate where any of the directors have exclusive special powers that enable them to control the company. Nor is it appropriate where any of the directors are otherwise in de facto control of the company, for example, because the other directors are merely nominees. In these circumstances, it is necessary to determine whether the controlling dir ectors exercise control of the company from New Zealand. Residence of directors 355. The residence status of a company’s directors is not relevant in determining whether the director control test has been satisfied. The focus of the test is on whether the directors exercise control of the company from New Zealand. In cases where the simple majority approach outlined at \[353\] is appropriate, the question is not whether a simple majority of the directors are resident in New Zealand but rather whether a simple majority of the directors exercise their directorial powers from New Zealand. Continuing test 356. The director control test will be satisfied if the directors exercise control of a company from New Zealand on a continuing basis. If control is ordinarily exercised from New Zealand, but is occasionally exercised from outside New Zealand, the company will be resident in New Zealand on the basis that the directors exercise control from here. Control of the entire company 357. A company will not be resident here under the director control test unless the control exercised by directors from New Zealand is control of the company as a whole. Therefore, if New Zealand directors exercise control only in relation to the New Zealand operations of the company, and directors elsewhere exercise control of the company as a whole, the company will not be resident here under the director control test. Comparison between the director control test and the head office and centre of management tests 358. The centre of management test focuses on the management of the company as a whole. Acts of management at various levels may be relevant to determining where the centre of management is. This differs from the director control test, which concentrates on the directorial control of the company, ie, the place from which the strategic and policy decisions are made. In some cases there may not be a clear distinction between aspects of the management of the company and the directorial decision making and control because, for example, the directors are involved in managing the company. 359. The head office of a company may also be the place from which the directors exercise control of the company. However, the two tests are different in nature. The head office test focuses on a physical place, ie, on the office from which the business of the company is directed and carried on. In contrast, the director control test looks to the place from which the directors ultimately control the company. 65 Examples illustrating the company residence tests Example 23 360. Facts: Company A is incorporated in Hong Kong and carries on a business manufacturing clothes there. A’s operations are all managed from Hong Kong. A has no office in New Zealand. All meetings of the board of directors are held in Hong Kong, but the Hong Kong directors always act on the instructions of company A’s New Zealand parent company, and unquestioningly implement the decisions made by the parent company. 361. Result: Company A is resident in New Zealand under the director control test. 362. Explanation: A is incorporated in Hong Kong and therefore is not resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. 363. The centre of A’s operations is in Hong Kong, and A has its centre of management there. A has no office in New Zealand. As such, A is not resident in New Zealand under either the head office or the centre of management tests. 364. The Hong Kong directors of A act on the instructions of the New Zealand parent company. The New Zealand parent is therefore a director of A (under paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of “director” in s YA (1)). The New Zealand parent is exercising de facto control of A, because the Hong Kong directors implement the decisions of the parent company without question. The Hong Kong directors are not exercising true directorial control of A. A is resident in New Zealand because the parent company is a director of A and exercises directorial control of A from New Zealand. The Hong Kong directors of A do not exercise true directorial control, so this is not a situation where it is necessary to weigh up the level of control exercised from New Zealand and from elsewhere. Example 24 365. Facts: B is a holding company incorporated in Singapore. B has an office in Singapore and the company’s operations are managed from this office. B has no office in New Zealand. B has five directors: three are resident in Australia, and two in New Zealand. The powers of the directors are equal. The board of directors meets six-monthly in Singapore to review decisions made by its subsidiaries. The directors regularly hold video conferences to discuss particular issues, and investment decisions are made in the course of these conferences. 366. Result: B is not resident in New Zealand. 367. Explanation: B is incorporated in Singapore and is therefore not resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. 368. B has no office in New Zealand and is therefore not resident here under the head office test. 369. B is managed from Singapore and therefore has its centre of management in Singapore rather than in New Zealand. 370. Although the board of directors meets only in Singapore, control of the company is also exercised outside the board meetings during the video conferences between the New Zealand and Australian directors. The New Zealand directors therefore occasionally exercise their directorial functions from New Zealand. However, as the powers of each director are equal, B is not controlled by its directors from New Zealand, as the majority of directors are in Australia. B is therefore not resident in New Zealand under the director control test. 66 Example 25 371. Facts: C is an Australian incorporated bank. C conducts business in New Zealand through a branch. The New Zealand branch has its own executives and board of directors who operate from the bank’s Wellington office. The worldwide operations of C are conducted from the Australian office, and all of the major decisions concerning C are made by the Australian directors in Australia. The New Zealand executives and board are only responsible for managing C’s New Zealand operations. 372. Result: C is not resident in New Zealand. 373. Explanation: C is incorporated in Australia and therefore is not resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. 374. C’s head office is not in New Zealand. The Wellington office is the company’s highest New Zealand office but it is not the highest office of the company as a whole. C’s Australian office is its head office. 375. The centre of C’s management is in Australia. The New Zealand branch management is only responsible for managing C’s New Zealand operations. Therefore, C does not have its centre of management in New Zealand. 376. The Australian directors exercise control of C from Australia. The director control test is only satisfied if the directors exercise control of the company as a whole in New Zealand. However, in this case the control exercised by the New Zealand directors relates only to C’s New Zealand branch. Therefore, C is not resident by virtue of the director control test. Example 26 377. Facts: D is a unit trust that has been established under the Unit Trusts Act 1960 (NZ). D invests primarily in shares issued by New Zealand and overseas publicly listed companies. The manager of D is a New Zealand incorporated company. The manager makes all of the major decisions relating to marketing interests in D, investments, distributions, etc. These decisions are all made from New Zealand. 378. Result: D is a company under the extended definition of “company” in the Act. D is resident in New Zealand under the director control test. 379. Explanation: D is not incorporated. The incorporation test is therefore not applicable. The fact that D’s manager is incorporated in New Zealand is irrelevant to D’s residence status. 380. D’s manager is a director of D under para (a)(iv) of the extended definition of “director” in s YA 1 of the Act because D’s manager acts in the same way a director of a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 would act, ie, it makes all the major decisions in relation to investments. 381. The manager exercises control from New Zealand. Therefore, D is resident in New Zealand because its director exercises control of D from New Zealand. Example 27 382. Facts: E is incorporated in Australia and is a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of an Australian company. The Australian parent is in the business of manufacturing a number of products. E’s business mainly involves the marketing of those products in New Zealand. The management of E takes place from its Auckland office. E does not have an office in Australia, but it has several branch offices in New Zealand outside Auckland. The overall strategic control of the company by its directors is exercised from Australia. 67 383. Result: E is resident in New Zealand under the head office and centre of management tests. 384. Explanation: E is not resident in New Zealand under the director control test because its directors exercise control from Australia. 385. E’s Auckland office constitutes its head office because it is the office from which the business of the company is managed and carried on. E is therefore resident in New Zealand under the head office test. 386. The management of E takes place from the Auckland office. E is therefore also resident in New Zealand because its centre of management is here. Example 28 387. Facts: F is a company incorporated in the Cook Islands, and is used as a financing vehicle for a group of companies based in New Zealand. G, which is also incorporated in the Cook Islands, is the sole nominated director of F. With respect to the affairs of both F and G, the directors of G act on instructions received from a New Zealand resident company (NZ Co) that is a member of the group, without discussing or considering those instructions. Both F and G are managed from the Cook Islands. Neither F nor G has an office in New Zealand. 388. Result: Both F and G are resident in New Zealand under the director control test. 389. Explanation: F and G are both incorporated in the Cook Islands. Therefore, they are not resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. 390. F and G are both managed from the Cook Islands. Therefore, they are not resident in New Zealand under the centre of management test. Further, as neither F nor G has an office in New Zealand, they are not resident here under the head office test. 391. The nominated directors of G act in accordance with instructions from NZ Co in relation to G’s affairs. NZ Co is therefore a director of G. NZ Co exercises de facto control of G because the directors of G act on NZ Co’s instructions without discussing or considering those instructions. The directors of G are not exercising true directorial control of G. As NZ Co exercises control of G from New Zealand, G is resident here under the director control test. 392. The nominated director of F (ie, G) acts in accordance with instructions from the nominated directors of G, who in turn act in accordance with instructions from NZ Co. The nominated director of F therefore acts in accordance with instructions from NZ Co, making NZ Co a director of F. NZ Co exercises de facto control of F because the directors of G (which is the director of F) act on NZ Co’s instructions with respect to the affairs of F (as with the affairs of G) without discussing or considering those instructions. G, the nominated director of F, is not exercising true directorial control. F is resident in New Zealand because NZ Co is a director of F and exercises directorial control of F from New Zealand. G does not exercise true directorial control, so this is not a situation where it is necessary to weigh up the level of control exercised from New Zealand and from elsewhere. Changes in company residence 393. As a company will be resident in New Zealand if it has its head office or centre of management here, or its directors exercise control of the company here, a company’s residence may change if the location of its head office, centre of management, or place of directorial control changes. For example, a company that is resident in New Zealand under the centre of management test may cease to be resident here if it moves its centre of management to Australia, o r a company that is not resident in New Zealand may become resident here if it shifts 68 its head office here. A company may also transfer its place of incorporation from New Zealand to overseas. 394. Some of the more significant income tax consequences that may arise when the residence of a company changes between New Zealand and another country are set out below. A change in residence may also have implications for the application of a DTA. Further, if a company is a settlor or beneficiary of a trust and its residence status changes there may be tax implications – see from \[456\]. (a) Company migration rules 395. A company that ceases to be a New Zealand resident is an “emigrating company”, and under the company migration rules it is treated for tax purposes as if, immediately before emigrating, it had disposed of its property at market value, liquidated, and distributed the full amount available for distribution as dividends (s FL 1). (b) Taxation of foreign-sourced income 396. A company will be assessable for income tax on foreign-sourced income it derives while resident in New Zealand (s BD 1(5)(c)). In the case of a change in residence, therefore, the foreign-sourced income derived by a company while it was resident in New Zealand must be calculated, or a reasonable apportionment of the total foreign-sourced income must be made to the periods of residence and non-residence. (c) Company imputation 397. A company that is resident in New Zealand (an imputation credit account (ICA) company) will generally be required to establish and maintain an imputation credit account (s OB 1). \[It is noted that some companies are specifically excluded from being ICA companies – see \[416\] below\]. A company that is resident in Australia may, in some circumstances, elect to establish and maintain an imputation credit account in New Zealand (s OB 2; see also definition of “Australian ICA company” in s YA 1). Otherwise, companies that are not resident in New Zealand are not permitted to establish an imputation credit account. A company that becomes resident in New Zealand during an imputation year therefore needs to establish and maintain an imputation credit account. Conversely, a company that ceases to be resident in New Zealand during an imputation year loses the right to maintain an imputation credit account (unless it becomes an Australian ICA company). When a company becomes a New Zealand resident during an imputation year, it is not entitled to credit to its imputation credit account any income tax paid in respect of income derived when it was resident outside New Zealand (s OB 4(3)(b)). 398. In the converse situation, where a company ceases to be a New Zealand resident, the company is required to debit its imputation credit account by the amount of any credit existing in the account immediately before the company stopped being an ICA company (ie, when it ceased being resident) (s OB 56(1)), or to pay further income tax for a debit balance in its imputation credit account when it ceased being an ICA company (s OB 66). A company that ceases to be an ICA company is also required to furnish an imputation return within two months from the day on which it ceased to be an ICA company (s 70(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). (d) Controlled foreign company regime 399. A change of residence between New Zealand and another country may also have implications in relation to the CFC regime. Under s EX 24(1), when a company becomes a “foreign company” (being a company that is not resident in New 69 Zealand, or is treated as not resident in New Zealand under a DTA) a new accounting period of the company starts on that day. The result is that if the company becomes a CFC because of its change in residence, only income derived after the company became a CFC will be attributed under the CFC regime to residents holding interests in the company. 400. In the converse situation, a new accounting period starts on the day when a company ceases to be a foreign company (s EX 24(2)). The effect is that if the company was a CFC before it ceased to be a foreign company, only income derived before the company ceased to be a foreign company will be attributed to residents under the CFC regime. (e ) The financial arrangements rules 401. When a company becomes a New Zealand resident during an income year and the company is a party to a financial arrangement, the company may become subject to the financial arrangements rules (note, it may be that they were already within the rules, ie, if t hey had previously carried on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment and were a party to a financial arrangement for the purposes of that business). Where a company enters the financial arrangements rules as a result of becoming a resident in New Zealand, the company is treated as having assumed the accrued obligation to pay consideration under the financial arrangement immediately after the time at which it became resident, and as having paid the market value that a contract to assume the obligation had at that time (s EW 37(2)). The deemed acquisition price will then be taken into account in any subsequent base price adjustment required under s EW 29. To the extent that the exemption from the financial arrangements rules for non-residents (s EW 9) previously applied, that exemption will cease to apply when the company becomes resident. 402. When a company ceases to be resident in New Zealand and the company is a party to a financial arrangement, it must calculate a base price adjustment for the financial arrangement as at the date of ceasing to be resident (s EW 29). If the base price adjustment is positive it will be income derived by the company in the year for which the calculation is made (s EW 31(3)). If the base price adjustment is negative it will be expenditure incurred by the company in the year for which the calculation is made, and a deduction will be allowed for that expenditure (s EW 31(4)). An exception exists if a cash basis person ceases to be a New Zealand resident before the first day of the fourth income year following the income year in which they first became a New Zealand resident. In that case, they do not need to calculate a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement that they were a party to both before becoming and after ceasing to be a New Zealand resident (s EW 30(1)). Also, a party to a financial arrangement who ceases to be a New Zealand resident does not need to calculate a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement to the extent to which the arrangement relates to a business the party carries on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (s EW 30(2)). 403. When a company ceases to be a New Zealand resident, the financial arrangements rules will cease to apply to the company except to the extent to which the company is a party to a financial arrangement for the purpose of a business carried on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (s EW 9). (f) Grouping of losses 404. A change in residence between New Zealand and another country may also affect the grouping of tax losses under subpart IC of the Act. Section IC 5 stipulates that for a company to be able to make its tax losses available to another company in the group, the company with the losses must (among other things) 70 meet the residence requirements of s IC 7. Section IC 7 requires that, for the commonality period, the company with the available losses must be either incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on business through a fixed establishment here. In addition, the company must not be treated as not being resident in New Zealand under a DTA for the purposes of the DTA, and must not be liable to income tax in another country because of domicile, residence, or place of incorporation. However, losses not available for grouping may be available for carry forward under s IA 3. (g) Provisional tax 405. When a company becomes a New Zealand resident during an income year it may become a provisional taxpayer that is subject to the provisional tax regime contained in subpart RC. When a company ceases to be a New Zealand resident it may cease to be a provisional taxpayer (s RC 3). Dual resident companies Dual residence 406. In some cases a company may be resident in both New Zealand, under s YD 2, and another country, under the domestic tax law of that country. Dual residence has a number of implications in relation to the application of the Act and New Zealand’s DTAs. 407. When a company is resident in New Zealand and in a country with which we have a DTA, the DTA will generally allocate residence to one of the countries for the purpose of determining how income and gains covered by the DTA are taxed. The objective here is to decide which country has the primary taxing right and to therefore reduce the incidence of double taxation. 408. In the context of the Act, dual residence has implications in the following areas: imputation, the dividend withholding payment regime, the CFC and FIF regimes, and the grouping of losses. Dual residence and double taxation agreements 409. Double taxation may arise where a company is resident in both New Zealand and another country if each country taxes the worldwide income of the company. This issue may be resolved where there is a DTA between New Zealand and the other country. The DTA will generally allocate residence to one of the countries for the purposes of the DTA. In determining the treatment of income covered by the DTA, the company is then treated as being resident only in the country to which residence has been allocated. 410. Where a New Zealand resident company (under s YD 2) is deemed to be resident in another country for the purposes of a DTA, New Zealand’s right to tax foreign- sourced income may be restricted, and limitations may be imposed on New Zealand’s right to tax New Zealand-sourced income. As discussed in relation to individuals at \[252\] and \[253\], the company will remain liable to New Zealand income tax on income treated (under s YD 4) as having a source in New Zealand (s BD 1(5)). However, the liability is modified by any restrictions imposed by the DTA on New Zealand’s right to tax persons who are deemed to be resident in the other country for the purposes of the DTA. Therefore, the residence rules contained in s YD 2 cannot always be read in isolation. When a company satisfies the domestic tax residence requirements in both New Zealand and another country, the impact of the DTA (if there is one) must be considered. 411. New Zealand’s DTAs contain a number of different rules for allocating company residence for DTA purposes. As is the case with individuals, these rules do not apply for non-treaty purposes. Under these rules, which vary from one DTA to 71 another, residence may be allocated according to the company’s “place of effective management”, its “day-to-day management”, the “centre of its administrative or practical management” and the location of its “head office”. In the case of some of New Zealand’s DTAs it may fall to the competent authorities of the Contracting States to settle the question by mutual agreement (in some instances with regard to specified factors). 412. As noted at \[261\] in relation to individuals, if a DTA between New Zealand and another country uses the wording of a particular article in the OECD Model Convention (or very similar wording), the Commissioner considers that it can be inferred that the OECD commentary on that article reflects the meaning the parties intended to be given to any undefined terms in that article. In such circumstances the OECD commentary will be a significant aid to interpreting the relevant undefined terms. In such a case, the Commissioner considers that the context requires the meaning of the undefined terms to be considered without reference to any meaning those terms may have under domestic law. 413. There is only one residence tie-breaker test for dual-resident non-individuals in the OECD Model Convention. That tie-breaker allocates residence, for DTA purposes, to the State in which the person’s “place of effective management” is situated. Where New Zealand’s DTAs adopt this test, the Commissioner considers that reference should be made to the OECD commentary on the meaning of this term. 414. Where New Zealand’s DTAs adopt residence allocation tests for non-individuals other than “place of effective management”, it may be necessary to have recourse to the domestic law meaning (if any) of any undefined term in that test. Dual residence and imputation 415. Section OB 1 provides that, subject to a number of special exclusions, a company that is resident in New Zealand must establish and maintain an imputation credit account for each tax year. Imputation credit account companies (ICA companies) may attach imputation credits to dividends they pay (s OB 60). 416. Several categories of company are specifically excluded from being ICA companies and, therefore, from passing on imputation credits to their shareholders (s OB 1(2)). Among these are companies that are resident in New Zealand but are treated as not being resident in New Zealand under a DTA. The situation contemplated is a dual resident company that, for the purposes of a DTA, is deemed not to be resident in New Zealand and so is not liable for New Zealand tax on all or part of its income. To ensure that dual resident companies cannot be used to undermine the international tax regime by obtaining the benefit of the imputation regime even though treated as not resident here, companies in this category are not able to pass on imputation credits. This is consistent with the anti-stapled stock provisions, contained in s GB 37, which also prevent companies from avoiding the international tax regime while at the same time being able to pass on imputation credits. Dual residence and the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund regimes 417. The CFC and FIF regimes are contained in subpart EX. When a resident has an interest in a CFC, income and losses of the CFC may be attributed to the resident for income tax purposes. When a resident has an interest in a FIF, the annual change in value of the interest is taken into account for income tax purposes. 418. The CFC and FIF regimes both apply in relation to foreign companies. A foreign company is one that is not resident in New Zealand, or is treated under a DTA as not being resident in New Zealand. Companies that are dual resident under domestic law, but treated as resident outside of New Zealand for DTA purposes, 72 may be brought within the CFC and FIF regimes. In the case of the CFC regime, this will occur if the closely held ownership test is satisfied. In the case of the FIF regime, it will occur if none of the exceptions apply. This is to ensure that dual resident companies cannot be structured with a view to defeating the CFC and FIF regimes. Dual residence and the grouping of losses 419. Section IA 3(2) allows companies within the same group of companies (as defined in s IC 3) to group their income and losses (see also subpart IC). This is subject to the requirements of s IC 5, which include that the company with the available losses must meet the residence requirements of s IC 7. Section IC 7 provides that for the commonality period (s IC 6) the company with the losses must be either incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on a business here through a fixed establishment. The company must also not be treated as not resident in New Zealand under a DTA, for the purposes of the DTA, and must not be liable by the law of another country or territory to income tax there through domicile, residence, or place of incorporation. Therefore a dual resident company cannot make its tax losses available to another company in the same group either by election or subvention payment under s IC 5(2). Examples illustrating dual residence and the grouping of losses Example 29 420. Facts: H is incorporated in New Zealand and managed from Australia. H is a member of a group of New Zealand and Australian companies. H incurs a loss of $1 million during the income year ending 31 March 2012. 421. Result: H’s loss cannot be grouped with income earned by other New Zealand resident companies in the group. 422. Explanation: H is resident in both New Zealand and Australia under the domestic law of both countries. However, under the DTA between New Zealand and Australia, H is treated as a resident only of Australia, as its place of effective management is Australia. As such, the requirements of s IC 7 are not satisfied, and H cannot make its tax losses available to other New Zealand companies in the group. Example 30 423. Facts: I is incorporated in Hong Kong and controlled by its directors from New Zealand. I is a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of a UK company. J is a New Zealand incorporated company that is controlled by its directors from New Zealand and has its centre of management here. J is also a 100 per cent subsidiary of the UK company. During the income year ending 31 March 2012, I incurs a loss of $1 million and J earns assessable income of $2 million. 424. Result: I’s $1 million loss cannot be grouped with J’s $2 million income. 425. Explanation: I is resident in New Zealand because control by its directors is exercised from New Zealand. However, it is not incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment here. As such, s IC 7(1) prevents I’s losses from being grouped with J’s income. Example 31 426. Facts: K is a United States incorporated and managed company. K operates directly in New Zealand through several branch offices, and a significant amount of business is transacted through these offices. L is a New Zealand incorporated company that is controlled by its directors here and has its centre of management 73 here. L is a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of K. During the income year ending 31 March 2012, K’s New Zealand branch operations sustain a loss of $1 million and L earns assessable income of $2 million. 427. Result: The $1 million loss incurred by K’s New Zealand branch operations can be grouped with L’s $2 million income provided the other requirements of subpart IC are satisfied. 428. Explanation: Though it is not incorporated in New Zealand, K is carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment here (ie, it has a fixed place of business here through which substantial business is carried on). Section IC 7(1) therefore does not prevent its New Zealand losses from being grouped. If K’s New Zealand branch operations had been profitable, those profits would have been liable to tax here under the DTA between New Zealand and the United States, as profits of an enterprise attributable to a permanent establishment. Residence of foreign companies 429. As noted at \[310\], a “foreign company” is a company not resident in New Zealand, and not treated as resident in New Zealand under a DTA (s YA 1). Section YD 3 sets out different tests to determine the country in which a foreign company is treated as resident for the purposes of the international tax rules. 430. Section YD 3 provides: YD 3 Country of residence of foreign companies When this section applies (1) This section applies for the purposes of the international tax rules to determine the country in which a foreign company is treated as resident for an accounting period. Liability to income tax (2) The company is treated as resident in a country if, at any time during the accounting period, it is liable to income tax in the country because any of the following is located in the country— (a) its domicile: (b) its residence: (c) its place of management: (d) any other criterion of a similar nature. Further rule: first application (3) Subsection (4) applies if the application of subsection (2) for an accounting period means that— (a) the company is resident in 2 or more countries: (b) the company is not resident in any country. Applying New Zealand rules (4) The company is treated as resident in the country in which— (a) it is incorporated: (b) it has its head office: (c) it has its centre of management: (d) its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company, even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside the country. Further rule: second application (5) The company is treated as resident in the country in which its centre of management is located for the accounting period if no 1 country of residence is identified under subsection (4). 74 Final rule (6) The Commissioner must determine the country of residence if no 1 country of residence is identified under subsection (5). 431. Section YD 3(2) provides that a foreign company will be treated as resident in a country if, at any time during the accounting period, it is liable to income tax in the country because its domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature is located in the country. If subs (2) results in the company being resident in multiple countries, or not in any country, the company will be treated (under subs (4)) as resident in the country in which it is incorporated, has its head office or centre of management, or in which its directors, in their capacity as such, exercise control of the company (even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside the country). If the application of subs (4) results in no one country of residence being identified, the company will be treated (under subs (5)) as resident in the country in which its centre of management is located for the accounting period. Finally, if the application of subs (5) results in no one country of residence being identified, subs (6) provides that the Commissioner must determine the country of residence. 75 Part 3: Residence and trusts Introduction 432. Trusts are not treated as separate entities for income tax purposes. Consequently, there are no rules in the Act governing the residence of trusts. The residence of the persons connected with the trust, ie, the settlor, trustee and beneficiary, determines the treatment of trust income. 433. The trust rules in the Act modify the general position that New Zealand residents are assessable on worldwide income and non-residents are assessable only on New Zealand-sourced income. In most cases the residence of the trustee is not relevant in determining the treatment of foreign-sourced trustee income; rather, the residence of the settlor is relevant. Therefore, if the tax residence of a settlor of a trust changes, there may be tax implications in relation to the treatment of trustee income. Beneficiary income is taxed according to the normal rules about residence and source, though there is a special rule in relation to beneficiaries who cease to be resident in New Zealand and become resident again within five years (see \[454\]). 434. This part provides an overview of the implications of the residence status of settlors, trustees and beneficiaries for the taxation of income derived by trustees of a trust. Before discussing the relevance of the residence of the persons connected with the trust, \[436\] – \[ 438\] set out when income will be beneficiary income and when it will be trustee income. Table – How trust income is taxed 435. The following table shows how trust income is taxed, depending on whether it is beneficiary income or trustee income, and on the residence of the persons connected with the trust. 76 1 And the trust was not, at any time in the income year, a superannuation fund, or a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust of which any settlor was resident in NZ when they died. 3 With the exception noted at \[442\]. 2 With the exceptions noted at \[444\].

The income derived from property held in trust is taxed as either beneficiary income or trustee income. Only trustees can claim deductions for expenditure or losses incurred in deriving the income. 437. Trustee income is the income derived by the trustee of a trust, to the extent to which it is not beneficiary income (s HC 7(1)). Certain beneficiary income derived by a minor will also be treated as if it were trustee income for the purposes of determining the relevant tax rate, paying the tax, and providing returns of income (s HC 7(2)). 438. Section HC 6 provides that an amount will be beneficiary income to the extent to which either it vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year, or it is paid to a beneficiary of the trust during the income year or by the later of:  a date within six months of the end of the income year, or  the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee files a return of income for the year, or - the date by which they must file a return for the year. Settlor residence Settlor residence and liability of trustee 439. Trustees are liable to tax on New Zealand-sourced trustee income as if they were an individual beneficially entitled to that income (s HC 24). This is the case whether or not the trustee or any settlor is resident in New Zealand. However, the residence of the settlor of the trust is relevant in determining whether foreign-sourced trustee income is liable to tax in New Zealand. 440. The residence of the settlor is determined under the rules contained in either s YD 1 or s YD 2, depending on whether the settlor is a natural person or a company. 441. A foreign-sourced amount derived by a New Zealand resident trustee will be exempt income (s HC 26) if:  no settlor of the trust is at any time during the relevant income year a New Zealand resident (who is not a transitional resident); and  the trust is not: - a superannuation fund, or - a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust of which any settlor was resident in New Zealand when they died (whether or not they died during the relevant income year). 442. There is another situation in which foreign-sourced amounts derived by a New Zealand resident trustee will not be exempt income under s HC 26. A New Zealand “resident foreign trustee” 17 of a foreign trust 18 must disclose to the Commissioner certain information relating to the trust (s 59B of the TAA 1994), and maintain certain financial and other records in relation to the trust (ss 22(2)(fb) and (m), 22(2C) and 22(7)(d) of the TAA 1994). Foreign-sourced amounts derived by the trustee may not be exempt income under s HC 26 if the trustee is convicted of a knowledge offence under s 143A of the TAA 1994 in connection with information relating to the income year in which the foreign- sourced amount is derived. This will be the case if the trustee is not a “qualifying 17 Defined in s 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA 1994). 18 Defined in s HC 11. 78 resident foreign trustee” (defined in s 3(1) of the TAA 1994). However, if the offence committed is an offence under s 143A(1)(b) of the TAA 1994 (knowingly not providing certain information to the Commissioner) and the required information is subsequently provided to the Commissioner, the foreign-sourced income will be exempt under s HC 26(1). 443. A foreign-sourced amount derived by a non-resident trustee will, subject to the exceptions noted at \[444\], be assessable income of the trustee (under s HC 25) if, at any time in the income year:  a settlor of the trust is a New Zealand resident (who is not a transitional resident); or  the trust is a superannuation fund; or  the trust is a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust of which: - a trustee is resident in New Zealand; and - any settlor was resident in New Zealand when they died (whether or not they died during the relevant income year). 444. The two exceptions to this (contained in s HC 25(3) and (4)) are where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand for the entire income year and either:  no settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987, and the trustee has not made an election referred to in s HZ 2 (an election under the Income Tax Act 1976 on or before 31 May 1989 to pay tax on trustee income); or  any settlement made on the trust after 17 December 1987 was made only by a settlor who was not resident in New Zealand at any time from 17 December 1987 up to (and including) the date of settlement. Settlor residence and liability of settlor 445. Under s HC 29, a settlor may be liable as agent of the trustee for income tax payable by the trustee on trustee income derived in an income year. This will be the case where the settlor has made a settlement to or for the benefit of a trust after 17 December 1987 (whether or not they settled property on the trust on or before that date), and the trustee derives trustee income in an income year in which the settlor is resident in New Zealand. Where there is more than one settlor to whom s HC 29 applies, the liability is joint and several. However, this rule does not apply:  to income tax that the trustee is liable for under s HC 32 (which relates to the trustee’s liability as agent for the tax liability of a beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived);  if the trust has a resident trustee for the whole income year, or if the first settlement was made during the income year, from the day of that settlement until the end of the income year;  where the trust is a charitable trust or a superannuation fund;  to the extent to which the trustee income is derived from the settlor remitting an amount under a financial arrangement to which either s EW 31 or s EZ 38 (which relate to base price adjustments) applies;  if the settlor is a natural person who was not resident at the time of any settlement on the trust, and had not after 17 December 1987 previously been resident in New Zealand (unless they have made an election under s HC 33 to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee); or 79  to the extent to which the settlor can establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that, having regard to the settlements made by that settlor and by other settlors, another settlor should be liable. 446. It is noted that where s HC 29 applies, the settlor is liable for tax on trustee income as agent for the trustee. Therefore, the trustee will remain liable for the tax on the trustee income. The provisions of subpart HD, dealing with the liability for tax of principals and agents, are relevant. Trustee residence 447. As noted at \[438\], s HC 6 provides that an amount will be beneficiary income to the extent to which either it vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year, or it is paid to a beneficiary of the trust during the income year or by the later of:  a date within six months of the end of the income year, or  the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee files a return of income for the year, or - the date by which they must file a return for the year. 448. The trustee of a trust is liable as agent for the income tax liability of the beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived (s HC 32). This liability, therefore, depends on the residence of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary is resident in New Zealand, the trustee is liable for tax as agent of the beneficiary on worldwide beneficiary income. If the beneficiary is resident outside New Zealand, the trustee is liable for tax as agent only in respect of New Zealand-sourced beneficiary income. 449. The residence of the trustee is generally not relevant in determining the treatment of trustee income: New Zealand-sourced trustee income is always subject to tax, and foreign-sourced trustee income is subject to tax on the basis of the residence of the settlor (see \[439\] – \[ 443\]). As noted at \[444\], there are two exceptions to this general principle where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand for the entire income year. 450. The trustee’s non-residence may also be relevant if they derive certain passive income having a New Zealand source. If the trustee derives non-resident passive income as defined in s RF 2, NRWT will be payable on that amount. 451. The residence of the trustee is determined under the rules contained in either s YD 1 or s YD 2, depending on whether the trustee is a natural person or a company. When a trust has co-trustees, the trustees are treated as a notional single person (s HC 2). Where one of the co-trustees is resident, then all of the co-trustees as the notional single person under s HC 2 are resident in that capacity. If all of the co-trustees are non-resident, then the notional single person under s HC 2 will be non-resident. Beneficiary residence 452. Beneficiaries are required to include in their assessable income all beneficiary income that they derive in an income year (ss HC 17 and CV 13). The normal rules about residence and source apply to determine which items of beneficiary income are included in the beneficiary’s assessable income. 453. When the beneficiary is resident in New Zealand the beneficiary will be required to include all beneficiary income in their assessable income (s BD 1). When the beneficiary is resident outside New Zealand, only New Zealand-sourced beneficiary income is included in assessable income. In this situation there will be an NRWT liability if the New Zealand-sourced income is non-resident passive 80 income. Income derived by a beneficiary from a trust will have a source in New Zealand to the extent to which the income of the trust fund has a source in New Zealand (s YD 4(13)). As noted at \[448\], the trustee of a trust is liable as agent for the income tax liability of the beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived (s HC 32). 454. There is a special rule in relation to beneficiaries who cease to be resident in New Zealand and who become resident again within five years of ceasing to be resident. In this situation, the beneficiary is treated as deriving income to the extent to which they would have been treated as deriving beneficiary income or taxable distributions from a foreign trust or a non-complying trust if they had remained in New Zealand during the period of their absence (ss CV 15 and HC 23). Any such income is treated as derived on the day on which the beneficiary becomes resident again (s CV 15). 455. The residence of a beneficiary is determined under the rules contained in either s YD 1 or s YD 2, depending on whether the beneficiary is a natural person or a company. Changes in residence 456. As noted at \[439\], the residence of settlors of trusts is relevant in determining whether a foreign-sourced amount of trustee income is liable to tax in New Zealand. If at any time in an income year a settlor of a trust is resident in New Zealand (and is not a transitional resident) foreign-sourced trustee income derived in that year will be taxed in New Zealand (subject to the exceptions noted at \[444\] in relation to foreign-sourced amounts derived by non-resident trustees). 457. Therefore, if the tax residence of any settlor of a trust changes, there could be tax implications. If there are no New Zealand resident settlors of a trust and then a settlor becomes resident in New Zealand (and is not a transitional resident) foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee in the year that the settlor became resident will generally be assessable. If a settlor ceases to be New Zealand resident and there are no other New Zealand resident settlors of the trust, foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee in the following year will be exempt (provided that no settlor is resident in New Zealand at any point in that income year). 458. If a settlor becomes resident in New Zealand, a settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust may be able to make an election (under s HC 33) to satisfy the trustee’s income tax liability in respect of the trustee income they have derived (see \[459\]). The person making the election is liable for the income tax payable by the trustee, other than income tax that the trustee is liable for as agent (HC 33(2)). Whether an election is made within the relevant 12-month period will determine the assessability of various distributions from the trust, and the rate at which they are taxed. If an election is made, the trust will be treated as noted at \[460\] and distributions will be taxed as noted at \[461\]. If an election is not made, the trust will be treated as noted at \[462\] and distributions will be taxed as noted at \[463\]. 459. A settlor, trustee or beneficiary of a trust may elect to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee if a settlor of the trust is a natural person who:  becomes a New Zealand resident (and is not a transitional resident); or  stops being a transitional resident and continues to be a New Zealand resident (either of these days is the “transition date”) provided that the trust would be a foreign trust in relation to a distribution if a distribution were made immediately before the settlor became resident (ss HC 30 and HC 33). 81 460. This election can be made at any time within 12 months of the transition date. If an election is made, the trust is treated:  as a foreign trust to the extent to which distributions consist of amounts derived by the trustee before the date of the election;  as a complying trust to the extent to which distributions consist of amounts derived by the trustee on or after the date on which the election is made if the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a) are met for the trustee income derived after the date of the election; and  as a non-complying trust for distributions that do not consist of amounts derived by the trustee before the date of the election, if the election is made but the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a) are not met. 461. If an election is made, distributions of income from the foreign trust portion will be assessable to beneficiaries at their normal rates. Distributions of amounts other than beneficiary income from the complying trust portion are not assessable to the beneficiary, as tax will already have been borne by the person who made the s HC 33 election. 462. If a s HC 33 election is not made within the 12-month period, the trust is treated:  as a foreign trust to the extent to which distributions consist of amounts derived by the trustee before the date of the election; and  as a non-complying trust to the extent to which distributions consist of amounts derived by the trustee after the time for making the election has expired. 463. If an election is not made, distributions of income from the foreign trust portion will be assessable to beneficiaries at their normal rates. Distributions of income (other than beneficiary income) and capital gains from the non-complying trust portion will be assessable at the rate of 45 per cent. 464. As noted at \[454\], there is also a special rule in relation to beneficiaries who cease to be resident in New Zealand and who become resident again within five years of ceasing to be resident. 82 References Related rulings/statements “Determining a person’s permanent place of abode” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 1 (July 1995) “Is a person working overseas while on leave of absence for two years resident for tax purposes?” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 10 (November 1999) “Residence status of public servant and family while overseas” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 11 (April 1995) “Returning resident’s visas – when a person seeking such a visa is resident for tax purposes” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 11 (December 1999) “Temporary exemption for transitional residents” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) “Temporary exemption from tax on foreign income for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) Subject references Residence Permanent place of abode 183-day rule Non-resident seasonal workers 325-day rule Government service rule Transitional residents Double tax agreements Permanent home Personal and economic relations Centre of vital interests Habitual abode Place of incorporation Head office Centre of management Director control Settlor residence Trustee residence Beneficiary residence Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007 – ss BD 1, BH 1(4), CF 3, CV 13, CV 15, CW 27, CW 28B, DB 6, DB 7, DB 8, DB 11, EW 5(17), EW 9, EW 29, EW 30, EW 31, EW 37(2), EX 24, EZ 38, FL 1, GB 37, HC 2, HC 6, HC 7, HC 10(1)(a), HC 11, HC 17, HC 23, HC 24, HC 25, HC 26, HC 29, HC 30, HC 32, HC 33, HR 8, HZ 2, IA 3, IC 3, IC 5, IC 6, IC 7, LJ 2, MA 8, MC 5, MD 7, OB 1, OB 2, OB 4(3)(b), OB 56(1), OB 60, OB 66, OC 1, RC 2, RC 3, RF 2, YA 1, YD 1, YD 2, YD 3 and YD 4, subparts EX, HD, and IC, and the definitions of “Australian ICA company”, “company”, “director”, “FIF superannuation interest”, “foreign company”, “international tax rules” and “New Zealand resident” in s YA 1 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – ss 2 and 8, and the definition of “resident” in s 2 Tax Administration Act 1994 – ss 22, 59B, 70(2) and 143A, and the definitions of “qualifying resident foreign trustee” and “resident foreign trustee” in s 3(1) Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 – the definition of “New Zealand-based” in s 4(1) Case references Boer v FCT \[2012\] AATA 574, (2012) ATC ¶10-269 Case B25 (1976) 2 NZTC 60,205 Case F96 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,036 Case F138 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,237 Case F139 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,245 Case H97 (1986) 8 NZTC 664 Case J41 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,240 Case J98 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,555 Case N31, 81 ATC 167 Case Q55 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,313 Case Q68, 83 ATC 343 Case S19, 85 ATC 225 Case U17 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,174 Case U110, 87 ATC 663 Case W13, 89 ATC 196 Case 11/2011 (2011) 25 NZTC 1-011, \[2011\] NZTRA 07 Case 12/2011 \[2011\] NZTRA 08, (2011) 25 NZTC 1-012 CIR v ER Squibb & Sons (NZ) Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,146 at 9,154 Executors of the Estate of Subrahmanyam v FCT (2002) ATC 2303 FCT v Applegate 79 ATC 4307 (FCAFC) Gaudreau v R 2005 DTC 66 (TCC) Geothermal Energy New Zealand Limited v CIR (1979) 4 NZTC 61,478 Hertel v MNR 93 DTC 721 Lingle v R 2010 FCA 152 Minin v The Queen 2008 TCC 429 NZ Forest Products Finance NV v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,073 Salt v The Queen 2007 TCC 118 Shand v FCT \[2003\] AATA 279, (2003) ATC 2080 Tanumihardjo v FCT 97 ATC 4817 (FCA) TRA 43/11 \[2013\] NZTRA 10 Troon Place Investments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,175 (HC) Unit Construction Co Ltd v Bullock \[1959\] 3 All ER 831 (UKHL) Vinelight Nominees Limited and Weyand Investments Limited v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 655 Yoon v R 2005 DTC 1109 Other references G A Harris, New Zealand’s International Taxation, (Auckland, OUP, 1990) The OECD’s Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (1977), and related commentary The Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, 3 rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2013, accessed 3 March 2014) The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 596 UNTS 261 (opened for signature 24 April 1963, signed by New Zealand on 10 September 1974) The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 500 UNTS 95 (opened for signature 18 April 1961, ratified by New Zealand on 23 September 1970) The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1155 UNTS 331 (opened for signature 23 May 1969, ratified by New Zealand on 4 August 1971) Valabh Committee, International Tax Reform: Full Imputation Part II (Consultative Committee on Full Imputation and International Tax Reform, July 1988) 83 Appendix – Legislation Income Tax Act 2007 A1.

This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s position on whether and when a unit trust can have a single unit holder for income tax purposes. A unit trust is a type of trust that is treated as a company for income tax purposes. 2. The commentary to BR Pub 95/5A: “Relationship between the “unit trust” and “qualifying trust” definitions” stated that a unit trust must have more than one unit holder. The Commissioner has been asked to reconsider this position. This statement sets out the Commissioner’s revised position. 3. The statement considers three issues. The first issue is whether a unit trust always needs more than one unit holder. It is concluded that a unit trust does not always need more than one unit holder. Rather, the “unit trust” definition requires only that the trust scheme or arrangement is “made for the purpose” or “has the effect” of providing facilities for multiple (more than one) unit holders. 4. The second issue is whether the “numbers rule” in s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1999 means that the “unit trust” definition can be satisfied even where facilities are provided for only one unit holder. The Interpretation Act provides that, unless the context requires a different interpretation, words in the Income Tax Act in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular. If this interpretation was applied to the definition of “unit trust”, it would only be necessary for a unit trust to provide facilities for one unit holder. Classified Public 2 5. However, the numbers rule does not always apply. Case law on the numbers rule shows that it is necessary to determine whether Parliament would have intended for the words in a provision to be read in the singular or plural. This requires consideration of the purpose of the provision, its text and its context in the enactment. 6. At the time the definition was enacted, unit trusts were not commonly used in New Zealand and existing ones were all widely-held investment vehicles. Further, the unit trust regime in the Income Tax Act was enacted to ensure that investors could not use unit trusts to avoid the two levels of taxation that were imposed on companies under the classical system of taxation. At the time, the companies legislation required companies to have more than one shareholder. In the Commissioner’s view, Parliament would not have intended the “unit trust” definition to apply to a trust that could only have a single unit holder. Therefore, a unit trust must provide facilities for multiple subscribers to meet the Income Tax Act definition. 7. The third issue is when a trust with a single unit holder will be a unit trust. As noted above, to be a unit trust a trust must be made for the purpose or have the effect of providing facilities for multiple unit holders. There are two main ways that this requirement could be interpreted. The first is that it is determined purely by examining whether the legal relationships provide facilities for multiple unit holders. The second possibility is that there must also be an intention for the trust to have multiple unit holders. Either interpretation is available on the words. 8. On balance, the Commissioner concludes that whether a trust is made for the purpose or has the effect of providing facilities for multiple unit holders to invest should be determined by considering the legal relationships governing the trust – most importantly, the trust deed. Under this interpretation, the essential feature of a unit trust is the provision of the facilities for subscribers to participate, and that is not altered by there being only one subscriber. 9. The main reason for this conclusion is based on the workability of the different interpretations. Under this approach, the relevant inquiry is not a factual one to determine whether, in practice, multiple persons are actually participating in the facilities provided. Therefore, an entity can be a unit trust within the definition if there is only one subscriber, provided there are facilities for multiple subscribers. An interpretation that considers only legal relationships means that a unit trust that satisfies the test will always do so (barring any change to its trust deed). It is also easy to determine whether a trust provides facilities for multiple unit holders by looking at the legal arrangements. 10. On the other hand, intention can change over time. Therefore, an interpretation that takes account of intention could mean that a trust falls in and out of the unit trust regime as intentions change. It may also be difficult to determine whether the requisite intention exists at any given time – making the test potentially difficult to apply. It seems unlikely that this would have been Parliament’s intention when enacting the provision. Consequently, on balance, the Commissioner’s view is that the purpose of the “unit trust” definition is most consistent with a legal relationships test. Given this, it is not necessary to establish an intention for a trust to have multiple unit holders. Introduction 11. This statement sets out the Commissioner’s position on whether and when a unit trust can have a single unit holder. Determining whether a trust is a “unit trust” for income tax purposes is important as the tax treatment is different. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes; whereas other trusts are subject to the trust rules. Classified Public 3 12. The commentary to BR Pub 95/5A: “Relationship between the “unit trust” and “qualifying trust” definitions” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996): 15) included the following statement: The \[unit\] trust must have more than one unit holder. The use of the plural when referring to “subscribers, purchasers, or contributors” in the definition \[of unit trust\] supports this interpretation. 13. BR Pub 95/5A and its commentary were concerned with the issue of whether a unit trust is taxed as a trust or a company. The issue arose because a unit trust could potentially be within the definition of “qualifying trust” and also treated as a company under the Act. The ruling concluded that the company rules apply. The statement that the definition of “unit trust” requires more than one unit holder was not central to the discussion and conclusion. However, it does represent the Commissioner’s published view on that point. 14. BR Pub 95/5A applied from the 1997/98 income year to the 1999/2000 income year. In Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 5 (May 2000): 4, the Commissioner stated: The Commissioner has determined that upon expiry the above-referenced public ruling \[BR Pub 95/5A\] will not be re-issued. It is considered that the legislation on the subject matter covered by the ruling is clear. The non-renewal of the ruling should not be taken as indication of change to the interpretation of the legislation as set out in the ruling. The Commissioner’s view on the issue remains the same. 15. The Commissioner has been asked to reconsider whether a unit trust requires more than one unit holder and when this is possible. To the extent that BR Pub 95/5A (in conjunction with the above TIB statement) suggests that a unit trust is required to have more than one unit holder, this no longer represents the Commissioner’s view. This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on this issue. Analysis 16. Unit trusts are a type of trust. They can be set up at law and are not created by any legislation. However, there is legislation that applies to tax and regulate them. The commercial understanding of unit trusts is that they are a means for small investors to pool their funds to earn a potentially greater return than investing individually. 17. Unit trusts were first regulated in New Zealand with the enactment of the Unit Trusts Act 1960. Changes were made to the income tax legislation to explicitly provide for the treatment of unit trusts around the same time. The Act taxes unit trusts as companies rather than as trusts. Units are treated as shares and unit holders as shareholders. 18. This statement will consider three issues:  whether a unit trust always needs more than one unit holder;  whether a unit trust requires facilities for multiple unit holders or whether facilities for a single unit holder are sufficient (s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1999); and  when a trust with a single unit holder will be a unit trust. Classified Public 4 Whether a unit trust always needs more than one unit holder 19. If a unit trust is always required to have multiple unit holders, then a trust could never be a unit trust while it had only a single unit holder (whether permanently or at a particular point in time). 20. “Unit trust” is defined in s YA 1 as follows: unit trust— (a) means a scheme or arrangement that is made for the purpose or has the effect of providing facilities for subscribers, purchasers, or contributors to participate, as beneficiaries under a trust, in income and capital gains arising from the property that is subject to the trust; ... For ease of reading, this statement will often just refer to “subscribers” as shorthand for “subscribers, purchasers or contributors”. 21. Paragraph (b) of the definition contains a number of specific exclusions from the definition that are not relevant here. 22. There is nothing in the wording of the definition of “unit trust” that requires a unit trust to, in fact, have more than one unit holder. Rather, the trust scheme or arrangement must be “made for the purpose” or “have the effect” of providing facilities for subscribers (to participate as beneficiaries in income and gains from the trust property). 23. However, the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules contain provisions that suggest that multiple unit holders may, in fact, be necessary to be a “unit trust” as defined. Section HM 3(1) relevantly states: HM 3 Foreign PIE equivalents General definition (1) A foreign PIE equivalent means an entity that— ... (b) is— ... (iii) the trustee of a trust that would be a unit trust if it had more than 1 subscriber, purchaser, or contributor participating as beneficiaries under the trust; and ... 24. Similarly, s HM 9(c) relevantly states: HM 9 Collective schemes The entity must be— ... (c) the trustee of a trust that would be a unit trust if there were more than 1 subscriber, purchaser, or contributor participating as beneficiaries under the trust: 25. The use of the phrase “that would be a unit trust if there were more than 1 subscriber, purchaser, or contributor” suggests that these sections were drafted based on the assumption that a unit trust must have two or more subscribers (rather than merely facilities for them). 26. Against this, it can be argued that an inference cannot be drawn about the definition of “unit trust” from the wording used in these other provisions. Arguably, the approach used in ss HM 3(1)(b)(iii) and HM 9(c) (with reference to subscribers) does not modify the definition of “unit trust”. Rather, the sections could be read as asking for an assumption to be made as to the number of subscribers in the context of the PIE rules, with no bearing on the interpretation of Classified Public 5 the definition of “unit trust”. This is particularly so, given that the words of the definition seem to be satisfied simply with facilities for many subscribers. 27. Another argument against inferring anything from these provisions is that, in drafting and enacting this legislation, it is likely Parliament and the drafters had in mind the Commissioner’s published position in BR Pub 95/5A. If that is the case, not much can be drawn from these words about the correct interpretation of the definition of “unit trust”. Case law has established that if Parliament makes a mistaken assumption about the law, this is not enough to make that interpretation the law – IRC v Dowdall O’Mahoney & Co Ltd \[1952\] AC 401 (HL), Birmingham City Corp v West Midland Baptist (Trust) Association (Inc) \[1970\] AC 874 (HL), and West Coast ENT Incorporated v Buller Coal Ltd & Ors \[2013\] NZSC 87. 28. In the Commissioner’s view, these provisions in the PIE rules should not be read as suggesting that a unit trust is required to have multiple unit holders. A scheme or arrangement can be made for the purpose or have the effect of providing facilities for multiple subscribers to participate even where only one subscriber is currently participating. The circumstances where this is possible will be considered later. Whether a unit trust requires facilities for multiple unit holders or whether facilities for a single unit holder are sufficient (s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1999) 29. The next issue that will be considered is whether s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1999 (the IA 99) means that a trust with facilities for only a single unit holder can be a unit trust. If s 33 applies in this way then a trust that can only ever have a single unit holder could still be a unit trust. 30. Section 4 of the IA 99 provides that the IA 99 applies to New Zealand acts unless the particular act provides otherwise, or unless the context otherwise requires (see also s AA 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007). Relevantly, s 33 of the IA 99 contains a rule concerning numbers (the numbers rule): 33 Numbers Words in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular. 31. Therefore, unless the context requires a different interpretation, words in the Income Tax Act in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular. 32. The result of substituting the singular for the plural in para (a) of the definition of “unit trust” is as follows: unit trust— (a) means a scheme or arrangement that is made for the purpose or has the effect of providing \[a facility\] for \[a subscriber\], \[purchaser\], or \[contributor\] to participate, as \[a beneficiary\] under a trust, in income and capital gains arising from the property that is subject to the trust; 33. The issue is whether the context requires that the words in the plural in the definition not include the singular. The numbers rule is a useful drafting tool that assists the legislature to avoid cumbersome wording. However, the numbers rule does not always apply. It is, therefore, necessary to consider how case law has applied the numbers rule. 34. There are a number of cases that consider s 33 of the IA 99 and its international equivalents. The leading case is Blue Metal Industries v Dilley \[1969\] 3 All ER 437 (PC). Other cases include Sin Poh Amalgamated (H.K) Ltd \[1965\] 1 All ER 225 (PC), Case F25 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,674, Alliance Group Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,066 (HC), CIR v Nicholson \[2005\] NZFLR 385 (HC), McDonald & Anor v Australian Guarantee Corporation (NZ) Ltd \[1990\] 1 NZLR 227 (HC), R v Cara Classified Public 6 \[2005\] 1 NZLR 823 (HC), R v K \[1995\] 3 NZLR 159 (CA) and Floor v Davis \[1979\] 2 All ER 677 (HL). 35. The following principles can be drawn from the case law:  The question is ultimately one of statutory interpretation – did Parliament intend for the words in a provision to be read in the singular or plural? Accordingly, the purpose of the provision, its text and its context in the enactment are all relevant.  A contrary intention would appear if the application of the numbers rule would change the policy underlying the legislation.  If there is a careful choice between the use of singular and plural expressions, that would suggest there is a contrary intention to reading words in the singular to include the plural (and vice versa).  The effect of applying the numbers rule to the particular provision must be considered. If the application produces uncertainties in the provision’s application, or suggests that the drafter would have drafted parts of the provision differently if the inclusion of the plural or singular had been intended, then this is evidence of a contrary intention.  In considering whether the context requires departure from the numbers rule, a broad range of intrinsic and extrinsic material can be considered. 36. In summary, the case law on the numbers rule establishes that the rule applies in the present case if, when examining the purpose and context of the “unit trust” definition, we can conclude that Parliament would have intended to include the singular, but wanted to avoid cumbersome wording. If, however, the purpose of the legislation suggests that the use of the plural was deliberate, the numbers rule will not apply. 37. The scheme and purpose of the unit trust provisions are considered in greater detail below. However, a summary of the relevant points is set out here. 38. The “unit trust” definitions in the Income Tax Act and the Unit Trust Act were introduced in 1960 to deal with the practical matters around the regulation and operation (including tax) of unit trusts. In particular, the income tax rules were Parliament’s response to pre-existing unit trusts, which were a form of trust that operated in New Zealand prior to the enactment of this law. It can be inferred that the definition chosen was designed to describe the essential attributes of such trusts. 39. As discussed in more detail later, the unit trust regime in the Income Tax Act was enacted to ensure that investors could not use unit trusts to avoid the two levels of taxation that were imposed on companies under the classical system of taxation (income tax was imposed at both the entity level and the investor level). At the time, the companies legislation required companies to have more than one shareholder. 40. In summary, a unit trust was widely understood as being a collective investment vehicle and it is reasonable to assume that the collective nature of such trusts was therefore intentionally reflected in their definitions. This is also supported by discussion in the NZ Parliamentary Debates at the time the Income Tax Act and Unit Trust Act provisions were being enacted. At the time, there were only four unit trusts in New Zealand and these were all widely-held investment vehicles. 41. Further, it is noted that there still appears to be a common view amongst commentators as to the purpose and features of unit trusts. For example, Edna Carew The Language of Money (George Allen & Unwin, Sydney, 1996) seems indicative of the material on this point. It states that a unit trust is structured to Classified Public 7 allow small investors to pool their money, which enables them to earn a greater return than if each investor had acted individually. 42. Given this it seems reasonable to conclude that the type of trusts Parliament was concerned with at the time of enactment of the unit trust legislation were collective investment vehicles, ie, multi-unit-holder trusts that had the attributes found in the definition. In short, trusts that, through their constituting documents, enable a group of investors (subscribers, purchasers, or contributors) to participate (as a group of beneficiaries) in the income and capital gains arising from the trust property. As a collective investment vehicle, it was usual for an initial subscriber to subscribe for a unit, which had the effect of settling trust property, and then for the unit trust manager to seek investments from either the public or private investors. 43. In the Commissioner’s view, there is a significant practical difference between a trust with facilities for multiple investors to participate in the income and capital gains arising out of trust property and a trust where such a facility is restricted to a single investor (in the sense that the way it is set up only allows for a single investor). The unit trust provisions were clearly aimed at unit trusts with facilities for multiple investors. In the Commissioner’s view, Parliament would not have contemplated or intended the “unit trust” definition to apply to a trust that was restricted to a single subscriber. Such a vehicle was not within the general understanding of a unit trust at the time. Nor would it have been a substitute for a company at the time (as companies required multiple shareholders). 44. Consequently, it is the Commissioner’s view that the numbers rule does not apply to the “unit trust” definition. Therefore, a unit trust must provide facilities for multiple subscribers to meet the Income Tax Act definition. The circumstances where a unit trust will have such facilities are considered next. When a trust with a single unit holder will be a unit trust 45. The following analysis will first consider the requirement that a “unit trust” be a “trust”. It will then consider the meaning of “facilities”, followed by the meaning of “subscribers, purchasers, or contributors”. Lastly it will consider the meaning of “made for the purpose or has the effect”. In particular, it will consider whether that phrase is satisfied by examining whether the legal relationships provide facilities for multiple unit holders, or whether there must also be an intention to have multiple unit holders. Analysis of the words of the “unit trust” definition Trust 46. There must be a “trust” for the definition of “unit trust” to apply. “Trust” is defined in s YA 1: trust, in the definitions of superannuation scheme and unit trust, has the meaning given by the Trustee Act 1956. 47. The definition of “trust” in the Trustee Act 1956 does not define a trust. Instead, the definition sets out specific inclusions and exclusions from the definition. Therefore, it is necessary to turn to the common law for the meaning of “trust”. Greg Kelly and Chris Kelly in Garrow and Kelly Law of Trusts and Trustees (7th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2013) define a “trust” at p 3 as follows: A trust is an equitable obligation under which a person (the ‘trustee’) has control of property but is bound to deal with that property either: (a) for the benefit of definite persons (that trustee may be one of them) and any one of them may enforce the obligation; or (b) for some object or purpose permitted by law. Classified Public 8 48. There are four essential elements of a trust. There must be a trustee, trust property and a beneficiary, and the trustees must have an obligation to deal with the trust property for the benefit of the beneficiaries (see Garrow and Kelly Law of Trusts and Trustees at p 8). Facilities 49. The Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, 3rd ed, Oxford University Press, accessed 22 January 2016) (OED) contains no separate entry for “facilities” but provides the following relevant definitions for “facility”: facility, n. 2. a. Opportunity, esp. of an unlimited kind, to do something; capability, ability, provision; an instance of this. Also with for, of. b. Freq. in pl. Favourable conditions or circumstances for the easy or easier performance of something. Also in sing., esp. in every facility. c. orig. U.S. In pl.: the physical means or equipment required for doing something, or the service provided by this; freq. with modifying word, as educational facilities, postal facilities, retail facilities, etc. In sing.: a service or feature of a specified kind; (also) a building or establishment that provides such a service. 50. There do not seem to be any relevant cases on the meaning of “facilities”. From the dictionary definition, the word “facilities” in the definition of “unit trust” might be said to refer to the provision of an opportunity or ability for subscribers to participate in the income and capital gains of the trust. 51. The definition of “unit trust” does not specify any particular requirements as to the form of the facilities. However, the Act gives some guidance as to what form is envisaged and, so, what facilities Parliament had in mind. The Act defines a “unit holder”, for a “unit trust”, as meaning “a person who holds a beneficial interest in the property that is subject to the trust” and defines a “share” to include “a unit in a unit trust”. In the context of the meaning of “unit trust”, for facilities to exist, a unit trust would be expected to provide a trust deed, trust property, a trustee and a trust manager. In addition, the beneficial interests in that trust property would be divided into units and those units would be able to be held by unit holders. Subscribers, purchasers, or contributors 52. The Act does not define the words “subscribers”, “purchasers”, or “contributors”. Therefore, they should each be given their ordinary meaning as interpreted in light of the context. 53. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) (COD) states that the word “subscriber” is the noun derivative of the word “subscribe” and provides the following (relevant) definition of the word “subscribe”: subscribe v. 1 (usu. subscribe to) ... ▪ contribute or undertake to contribute a sum of money to a project or cause ▪ apply to participate in ▪ apply for an issue of shares ... 54. The OED (accessed 22 January 2016) provides the following relevant meanings of “subscriber”: subscriber n. 2. a. A person who subscribes to a specified object or institution, the funds of a company, etc. b. A contributor. Obs. nonce-use. 3. Classified Public 9 a. A person who makes regular payment in return for entitlement to receive a periodical, membership of a society, access to a commercially provided service, etc. 55. “Subscriber” is, therefore, capable of different meanings. It can mean someone who has (or will) contribute money for something. It is also capable of a wider meaning such as a person who signs up or joins something, often, but not necessarily, for money. 56. Where courts are attempting to find definitions that reflect common usage in particular subject areas or sectors, they often refer to legal dictionaries. Legal dictionaries in the context of company and securities law show that the common commercial usage is the narrower one. That is a “subscriber” is a person that provides, or will provide, consideration. For example, see Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases (8th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, UK, 2013) that states: SUBSCRIBE. ... “Subscribe” very frequently means to pay money; and then it means (1) to have made an actual payment, or (2) to agree to contribute (Thames Tunnel Co v Sheldon, 6 B. & C. 341). And Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed, Thomson West, USA, 2014) provides: subscribe, vb. ... 10. To agree to buy or pay for (shares, stock, etc) 57. The Commissioner considers that the common commercial usage of “subscriber” is to be preferred in the context of unit trusts. The Act treats “unit trusts” as companies and unit holders as shareholders in a company. Therefore, applying the commonly understood meaning of “subscriber” in a company law context seems appropriate. Further, as discussed in more detail below, when Parliament enacted both the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and added the “unit trust” definition to the Income Tax Act, unit trusts were understood to be investment vehicles. An interpretation that requires “subscribers” to give consideration is consistent with this. This interpretation is also consistent with the meaning of the terms “purchaser” and “contributor”, both of which require the giving of consideration (see below). 58. The COD states that the word “purchaser” is the noun derivative of the word “purchase” and provides the following (relevant) definition of the word “purchase”: purchase v. 1 buy (something) ... n. 1 the action of buying ... ▪ Law the acquisition of property by one’s personal action rather than by inheritance. 59. The OED (accessed 22 January 2016) provides the following relevant meaning of “purchaser”: purchaser, n. 4. A person who purchases something with money (or an equivalent); a buyer. Now the usual sense. Also fig. and in extended use. 60. The OED (2nd ed) (accessed 22 January 2016) provides the following relevant definition of “contributor”: contributor, n. a. One that contributes or gives to a common fund; one that bears part in effecting a result. 61. Having regard to the dictionary definitions, the words “subscribers, purchasers, or contributors” in the definition of “unit trust” are used in the sense of meaning a person who provides money (or its equivalent) in exchange for receiving something of value. While there are variations in the meaning of the three terms, a trust only needs to have facilities for one of the types to be within the “unit trust” definition. 62. The requirement for “subscribers”, “purchasers”, or “contributors” is one of the key differences between a standard trust and a unit trust. Unit trusts provide subscribers with a means to enter and exit the trust through the ability to buy and sell units that represent a share in trust property. That ability can be contrasted Classified Public 10 with trusts where the settlor determines the beneficiaries and those beneficiaries remain beneficiaries unless the trust comes to an end. The beneficiaries in a standard trust have limited ability to control the release of trust funds. Consequently, a discretionary trust will not be a “unit trust” even where the beneficiaries have settled property on the trust. In a “unit trust” it is the terms of the units that give unit holders the right to participate in income and capital gains arising from the trust property. Made for the purpose or has the effect 63. The Act does not define the words “purpose” or “effect” or the expression “made for the purpose or has the effect”. 64. The COD defines “made” as the past tense and past participle of “make”. The verb “make” means: 2 bring about or perform; cause • cause to be, become or seem 65. “Purpose” is defined as: The reason for which something is done or for which something exists. 66. “Effect” is relevantly defined as: 1 a change which is a result or consequence of an action or other cause. 67. The ordinary meaning of “purpose” can be interpreted as requiring an identification of the reasons why a unit trust is set up. This would include ascertaining the intention of those setting up the entity (and could include both objective and subjective considerations). This view is also supported by the use of the word “made”. Grammatically, the sentence would make sense without the word “made”, suggesting it was included for a purpose. Arguably, the word “made” alludes to the intention of those who set up or run the scheme or arrangement. Therefore, a scheme or arrangement “made for the purpose” of providing facilities for multiple investors is one where the reason for which the scheme or arrangement is undertaken is to provide facilities for multiple investors. 68. The ordinary meaning of “effect” is what has been achieved. Therefore, in the context of the meaning of the term “unit trust”, a scheme or arrangement that results in the provision of facilities for multiple investors to participate in the income or capital gains arising from the trust property is a trust that has the required effect. 69. An alternative view is that “made for the purpose or has the effect” should be read as a composite phrase. This would be a purely objective test that looks at whether the requisite facilities exist. Support for this view can be found in case law on the words “purpose” and “effect” in another context. In New Zealand’s tax avoidance jurisprudence, the meaning of the phrase “purpose or effect” and the approach to determining the “purpose or effect” of an arrangement is settled law. “Purpose”, in the context of tax avoidance, means the intended effect the arrangement seeks to achieve and not the motive of the parties. The courts have distinguished between purpose and effect by referring to the purpose of the arrangement as the “intended effect” (Ashton v CIR (1975) 2 NZTC 61,030 (PC)) or the purpose as “the effect which \[the arrangement\] sought to achieve” (Tayles v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,311 (CA)). “Effect” means the end accomplished or achieved by the arrangement. Although there are these subtle differences in meaning, in almost all cases the purpose and effect of an arrangement will be the same. The intended aim of the arrangement (the objective purpose), if successfully achieved, will be the arrangement’s effect. 70. Tax avoidance cases on these words are clear that the purpose of an arrangement must be determined objectively. The subjective motives and purposes of the Classified Public 11 parties are irrelevant. An arrangement’s purpose is determined by considering (objectively) the effect it has had ─ what it has achieved ─ and its effect must be taken to have been the arrangement’s purpose. In Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 116, (2009) 24 NZTC 23,236, the Supreme Court said: \[38\] ...Once you put the purpose of the parties to one side and seek by objective examination to find the purpose of the arrangement, you must necessarily do that by considering the effect which the arrangement has had — what it has achieved — and then, by working backwards as it were from the effect, you are able to determine what objectively the arrangement must be taken to have had as its purpose. 71. The phrases “purpose or effect” and “made for the purpose or has the effect” are arguably materially indistinguishable. It is possible, therefore, that a court would construe the phrase “purpose or has the effect” in the definition of “unit trust” in the same way as it has construed the phrase “purpose or effect” in the definition of “tax avoidance arrangement”. That is, it would do so by considering the objective features of the arrangement rather than the motivations of its participants. 72. In summary, the words “made for the purpose or has the effect” could be read as directing and confining the inquiry to the legal relationships entered into when the entity is established. Alternatively, they could be interpreted as requiring an examination of all the facts, including the intention of the settlor, trustees or managers. Avoidance law would potentially support the former approach. The two approaches are discussed in more detail below. Legal relationships test – only objective evidence 73. This approach examines the legal relationships entered into, usually by looking at the establishing documents (and any other relevant documents) to see whether, objectively speaking, the entity provides facilities of the specified kind. A scheme or arrangement “made for the purpose” or “having the effect” of providing facilities for multiple subscribers is one where the scheme or arrangement is set up and undertaken, objectively speaking, to provide facilities for multiple subscribers to participate in the income or capital gains arising from the trust property. 74. When examining the tax treatment of a transaction, the first step is to ascertain the transaction’s true nature (Buckley & Young v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA)). As was said in Re Securitibank (No 2) \[1978\] 2 NZLR 136 (CA), the true nature of a transaction can only be found by careful consideration of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out. In the case of a legal vehicle such as a unit trust, arguably this would generally be done by examining the documents that establish the unit trust. Therefore, determining whether the definition was satisfied would require an analysis of the scheme or arrangement to establish whether the legal rights and obligations created by it provide facilities of the necessary kind. 75. Under this approach, the relevant inquiry is not a factual one to determine whether, in practice, multiple persons are actually participating in the facilities provided. Therefore, an entity can be a unit trust within the definition if there is only one subscriber, provided there are facilities for multiple subscribers. The test should take account of intention 76. The second approach looks not only at the legal relationships, but at all of the information available, particularly the intention of the settlor of the unit trust, and at what actually happens in practice. As discussed above, the use of the words “made for the purpose” arguably suggests that intention is relevant (although “effect” is less suggestive of intention). 77. This approach is based on the premise that the purpose or effect of a scheme or arrangement is not limited to the terms of the trust deed. Arguably, the effect of Classified Public 12 the scheme or arrangement is its result, outcome, or end product. In certain situations, the fact that the trust deed says it is possible for the trust to have multiple subscribers participating will not be enough to establish that the arrangement is made for the purpose of multiple subscribers participating. Nor will it be enough to establish that the arrangement has the effect of enabling multiple subscribers to participate. This will be the case if an overall assessment of the facts establishes that no such opportunity for multiple subscribers to participate is actually provided (or intended to be provided) by the scheme or arrangement. 78. Therefore, under this approach, if a scheme or arrangement provides the requisite facilities for multiple subscribers and the facts establish that the intention is to operate as a vehicle for multiple subscribers, the entity will be a “unit trust” within the definition even if there is only one unit holder. Objective, intention and other factors 79. A variation on the second approach is one that takes all the facts into account and includes intention as just one of the factors in reaching a view. Both the second approach and its variation start from the position that a unit trust is, in most cases, an investment vehicle for many subscribers. However, both contemplate that there may be instances when, for whatever reason, there is only one subscriber. In such circumstances, a decision has to be reached whether the trust comes within the “unit trust” definition. A court might consider such unit trusts within the definition if having one unit holder was not a permanent feature. Factors a court might consider include whether there was the prospect of more unit holders, whether there had been more unit holders in the past, whether measures had been taken by the trustees or manager to secure more subscribers, and whether there were commercial reasons why, at a particular time, there was only one unit holder. The settlor’s intention in setting up the unit trust could be relevant too, as well as how reasonably held that intention was. Summary of analysis of the words of the “unit trust” definition 80. There is nothing in the wording of the “unit trust” definition to suggest whether a legal relationships test or an intention test (or a combination of both) should be preferred. As set out above, the wording can be read consistently with either approach. 81. Next this statement will consider the legislative history and context to try and determine the purpose of the unit trust regime. Legislative history, context and purpose 82. Section 5 of the IA 99 requires the meaning of the text of an enactment to be ascertained in the light of its purpose. In determining purpose, both the immediate and general legislative context are considered, and it may also be relevant to consider the social, commercial, or other object of the statute (Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-Operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36). It is helpful to begin by examining the legislative history of the “unit trust” definition. Introduction of the classical taxation system in 1958 83. The Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (LITA 54) came into force on 1 April 1955. Section 86(1)(i) provided that dividends were exempt income for individuals and companies. 84. Section 6 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1958 amended s 86(1)(i) of the LITA 54 by removing the exemption for dividends derived by an individual. In short, s 6 of the 1958 Amendment Act introduced the classical tax system of company taxation. Under the classical system, a company is taxed on Classified Public 13 its income and individual shareholders are taxed on dividends received without reference to the tax paid at the company level on the same income. 85. The 1958 Amendment Act also introduced an excess retention tax. This was an anti-avoidance measure to counter companies retaining profits to avoid the dividend tax on individuals. 86. The introduction of the classical tax system for companies created a tax advantage for trusts and their beneficiaries because (unlike companies) they were taxed only once between them on the same income – either at the trustee or the beneficiary level (s 155 LITA 54). Enactment of “unit trust” definition in 1960 87. The “unit trust” definition was inserted (as s 153B) into the LITA 54 in 1960 by s 20 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1960. As discussed below, the definition appears to originate from the definition of a “unit trust” in the Unit Trusts Act 1960. As originally enacted, the definition (in s 153B(1)) provided: “Unit trust” means any scheme or arrangement, whether made before or after the commencement of this section, that is made for the purpose or has the effect of providing facilities for the participation, as beneficiaries under a trust, by subscribers or purchasers, in income and gains (whether in the nature of capital or income) arising from the money, investments, and other property that are for the time being subject to the trust; but does not include - ... 88. Section 153B(2) of the LITA 54 provided (among other matters) that for the purposes of the LITA 54:  every unit trust shall be deemed a company and the term “company” where used in the LITA 54 shall be deemed to be extended accordingly;  the interests of the unit holders in the unit trust shall be deemed to be shares in the company;  the unit holders shall be deemed to be shareholders in the company. 89. Deeming a unit trust to be a company meant the following:  The assessable income of the unit trust was subject to classical taxation. The income of the unit trust was taxed at the level of the unit trust (as a deemed company) and then taxed at the unit holder (shareholder) level on payment of a distribution (dividend).  A unit trust was subject to the loss carry forward rule for companies in s 137(3). In summary, the rule provided that the Commissioner must be satisfied that the shareholders of the company on the last day of the year in which the loss was incurred were substantially the same as the shareholders on the last day of the income year immediately preceding the year of assessment. Substantially the same meant not less than two-thirds of the paid-up capital and not less than two-thirds of the nominal capital had to be held by the same persons.  The excess retention tax provisions applied to unit trusts. 90. It seems reasonable to infer that deeming a unit trust to be a company was directed at the mischief of subscribers using unit trusts to avoid the impost of tax at both the company and shareholder level. Parliamentary debates – Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill 1960 91. In introducing the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill 1960 to the Whole House, the Minister of Finance observed that unit trusts had just developed in New Zealand. It was, therefore, necessary to have a provision to deal with them and Classified Public 14 the proper way to do this was to treat them as companies – (7 September 1960) 324 NZPD 2156. 92. During the second reading, the Minister of Finance repeated that unit trusts had only come into operation in New Zealand earlier in the year (1960). He explained that it had been considered desirable to introduce legislation (the Unit Trusts Bill) dealing specifically with unit trusts to avoid some of the abuses that had arisen in connection with unit trusts in overseas countries – (7 October 1960) 324 NZPD 2846. The Minister then went on to explain the purpose of cl 20 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill – (7 October 1960) 324 NZPD 2846: This measure provides that unit trusts shall be treated as companies. Legislation has been passed in the United Kingdom this year providing that for taxation purposes unit trusts are to be treated as companies, the trustees are to be treated as directors, and the unit holders are to be treated as shareholders. Apparently they receive some allowance for management expenses without becoming liable for profits tax. Legislation \[Unit Trusts Bill\], as I have said, has already been introduced dealing with the general control of unit trusts. I would emphasise that this particular clause deals only with the taxation of these trusts, and in general the principle is that they will be treated as companies for the purpose of the law. 93. Opposition members were opposed to unit trusts being treated as companies. Their main reason was that interest income would be subject to classical taxation and this would discourage unit trusts from investing in Government stock and local body debentures and would result in unit trusts investing in company shares because of the inter-corporate dividend exemption. 94. It can be inferred from the Parliamentary debates that Parliament had a general understanding that unit trusts were similar to widely-held investment vehicles (ie, similar to public investment companies). The illustration of this is contained in a passage of the Hon J T Watts during the committee stage debate on the Unit Trusts Bill 1960, which Parliament was considering in parallel with the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill 1960. That passage is set out at \[103\] below as part of the discussion of the Unit Trusts Act 1960. 95. It seems from the Parliamentary debates on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill 1960 that Parliament’s primary concern was with the new development in New Zealand of the use of widely-held investment trusts. Parliament’s purpose for the definition of a “unit trust” and the related provisions was for unit trusts to be taxed as companies rather than trusts. This was to ensure that unit trusts could not be used to avoid the double taxation of a company’s investment income under the classical system and was based on a perceived similarity between companies and unit trusts as investment vehicles. In particular, both unit trusts and companies involve the member providing money to the vehicle in return for an interest (ie, shares or units) in that vehicle’s property and income. Income Tax Act 1976 – amendments to the definition of “unit trust” 96. On enactment of the Income Tax Act 1976 (ITA 76), the definition of “unit trust” was in the same form as the LITA 54 definition. 97. From the income year commencing 1 April 1988, the definition was amended by s 22(1)(a) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 by substituting the words “subscribers, purchasers, or contributors” for the former words “subscribers or purchasers”. The effect of the amendment was to expand the definition of “unit trust” to persons who were “contributors” to a unit trust. 98. The same amendment act inserted Part 4A (the foreign investment fund (FIF) regime) into the ITA 76. It seems that the intention behind expanding the definition of “unit trust” to include “contributors” was so that the FIF regime would apply to a person who contributed to a foreign unit trust where that unit trust was a superannuation scheme. The addition of the word “contributors” to the definition Classified Public 15 does not seem to shed any light on when a scheme or arrangement will meet the definition of “unit trust” and, in particular, whether the provision of the requisite facilities should be determined by legal relationships only or whether intention is relevant. 99. The imputation system was introduced with effect from 1 April 1988 and replaced the classical tax system of company taxation. The imputation system allows companies (including unit trusts) to pass the full benefit of tax paid at the company level on to shareholders (unit holders) with their dividends (distributions). The replacement of the classical system substantially reduced the difference between companies and (non-unit) trusts from a taxation point of view. Relevantly, the imputation system largely removed the tax advantage previously enjoyed by (non- unit) trusts under the classical system. This is because, imputation had the effect in broad terms, that a company and its shareholders are taxed only once between them. 100. However, there are differences in the tax treatment of trusts and companies, so there continues to be relevant purpose considerations in reaching a view on how unit trusts are taxed. For example, there may be a benefit in using a trust where the top personal tax rate is higher than the trust tax rate (as the tax on income from a trust can be capped at the trust rate), or where a person’s marginal tax rate is lower than the company tax rate, or the person is exempt or in losses (due to the non-refundability of imputation credits). Some other rules in the Act also apply differently to trusts and companies. 101. Consequently, statutory purposes still exist in taxing unit trusts as companies rather than trusts post imputation, although these purposes are significantly less important than when the definition was introduced. The enactment of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 102. As noted above, Parliament enacted the “unit trust” provisions into the LITA 54 in parallel with the enactment of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 (UTA 60). The Attorney General, in moving that the Unit Trusts Bill be committed to the Committee of the Whole House, explained that unit trusts were beginning to appear in New Zealand. He said that there was a positive duty on Parliament to take notice of the development and enact legislation to regulate unit trusts to protect the investing public from possible misconduct and unscrupulous or reckless management – (19 October 1960) 325 NZPD 3086–3088. 103. The comments of the Minister of Finance when introducing the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill 1960 to the Whole House were referred to above. His comment was that unit trusts had just developed in New Zealand. During the committee stage debate on the Unit Trusts Bill 1960, the Hon J T Watts, the opposition member for Fendalton, said that he was personally interested in two unit trusts and explained that the drafting of the Bill had occurred over a 12 to 18 month period and that there were, at that time, four unit trusts in existence – (19 October 1960) 325 NZPD 3090: The New Zealand legislation has been carefully drawn over the last year or 18 months. I saw an early draft of the Bill and made some comments on it, and those interested in promoting unit trusts gave their representations to the Justice Department. As a result, I think we have a practical Bill for regulating the operation of this form of investment. There are at present four unit trusts in existence – two in Wellington, one in Auckland, and one in Christchurch. As the House knows, for I disclosed it when discussing the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill, I am connected with the two unit trusts in Wellington, in which over £1 million has been invested. That sum has come in to those two trusts in the last four or five months, and there are about 8,000 to 9,000 different investors having that amount of money invested in industry in New Zealand and Australia through these two trusts. Classified Public 16 Similarity of the definitions 104. The definition of “unit trust” in the LITA 54 is nearly identical to the definition of “unit trust” in the UTA 60. The one difference is that the UTA 60 definition requires that the scheme or arrangement have the purpose or effect of providing facilities for the participation by subscribers or purchasers as “members of the public”. Under the Income Tax Act there is no reference to members of the public. 105. This distinction was noted in Re Mortgage Management Ltd & Another \[1978\] 1 NZLR 494 (SC) (the only reported New Zealand decision to consider the meaning of “unit trust” in the UTA 60). The court made some general comments about the definition of “unit trust”, as well as a comment on the difference in wording between the UTA 60 definition and the definition for income tax purposes. 106. The relevant issue in that case was whether a contributory mortgage was a unit trust. The court observed, at 511, that the definition of “unit trust” in the UTA 60 had some resemblance to the definition of “unit trust” in the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958 (UK). The UK Act defined “unit trust scheme” as: any arrangements made for the purpose, or having the effect, of providing facilities for the participation by persons, as beneficiaries under a trust, in profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of securities or any other property whatsoever. 107. The court made comments in passing about the tax implications. It stated that an implication of being a unit trust was that it would be taxed as if it were a company. This comment implied the court considered that an entity that was a unit trust under the UTA 60 would also be a unit trust under the definition in the Land and Income Tax Act. Barker J said that the tax definition was wider. At 512, his Honour observed that the reason for the omission of the words “members of the public” from the definition of “unit trust” in s 153B of the LITA 54 was not clear. Barker J said that this difference in wording could mean that something that was not a “unit trust” under the UTA 60 might still be a “unit trust” for taxation purposes. 108. The difference in the definition can most likely be explained by the different purposes of the two Acts. The UTA 60 was enacted as a means to protect investors. Private unit trusts (that do not seek funds from the public) do not have the same risk to investors. On the other hand, the purpose of the Income Tax legislation treatment of unit trusts was to prevent tax avoidance opportunities that arose from using unit trusts instead of companies. It makes sense to include private unit trusts in this as the tax avoidance risk is as great (if not greater) than for public unit trusts. 109. For completeness, it is noted that the UTA 60 was repealed by the Financial Markets (Repeals and Amendments) Act 2013 (2013 No 70). Unit trusts will now be regulated by the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Current legislative context (the context of the Income Tax Act) 110. Unit trusts do not have their own regime in the Act. Therefore, few provisions concerned exclusively with unit trusts exist that can be analysed to assist in understanding Parliament’s purpose. Instead, as already mentioned, unit trusts are included in the definition of “company”, and so the rules applying to companies apply to unit trusts. 111. As noted above from \[23\], some provisions in the PIE rules suggest a trust must have multiple, actual unit holders, rather than mere facilities for unit holders. However, it has been concluded that the definition of “unit trust” does not require a trust to, in fact, have multiple unit holders. Classified Public 17 112. In the Commissioner’s view, nothing in the general legislative context assists with determining whether a legal relationships approach or an approach that takes account of intention should be preferred. Purpose considerations – summary and conclusion 113. It appears that Parliament did not turn its mind to whether the provision of facilities for multiple subscribers should be tested solely by the legal relationships established/entered into or should also take account of intention. At the time, unit trusts were seen as large investment vehicles, so it is unlikely that a unit trust with a single unit holder was envisaged (except maybe when a new unit trust was starting up). 114. In considering the purpose of the legislation, it is relevant to identify any mischief Parliament intended to overcome by enacting the provisions. When originally enacted in 1960, the purpose of the definition was to prevent subscribers using unit trust structures (in the place of investment companies) to avoid the classical system of taxation that applied to companies. 115. An interpretation that looks only at legal relationships seems to be slightly more consistent with the anti-avoidance purpose of the “unit trust” definition at the time it was enacted. Also requiring evidence of a current intention to have multiple unit holders would have made it easier to avoid the application of the company provisions. However, this is not a particularly strong indicator, especially given the lack of single unit holder unit trusts at the time. 116. In the Commissioner’s view, the most helpful indicator of purpose in this context is the workability of the different interpretations. There is a presumption that Parliament intends to legislate in a manner that produces a practical, workable, and sensible result (The Laws of New Zealand Statutes (online ed, accessed 22 January 2016) at \[177\]). A statute must, if possible, be construed in the sense that makes it operative and that does not defeat the manifest intentions of the legislature. In cases where a provision may have several possible meanings, the courts look for the one that produces a practical result. Examples of cases where this presumption has been applied include CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175 (CA); and Frucor Beverages Ltd v Rio Beverages Ltd \[2001\] 2 NZLR 604 (CA). 117. An interpretation that considers only legal relationships means that a unit trust that satisfies the test will always do so (barring any change to its trust deed). It is also easy to determine whether a trust provided facilities for multiple unit holders by looking at the legal arrangements. 118. On the other hand, intention can change over time. Therefore, an interpretation that takes account of intention could mean that a trust falls in and out of the unit trust regime as intentions change. It may also be difficult to determine whether the requisite intention exists at any given time – making the test potentially difficult to apply. It seems unlikely that this would have been Parliament’s intention when enacting the provision. 119. The results seem even more likely to be outside Parliament’s purpose when thinking about the tax consequences. A unit trust that no longer met the definition would forfeit any imputation credits and other company-specific tax entitlements. Further, it could result in a continuity loss, as the trust would no longer be looked through to its ultimate owners upon ceasing to be a unit trust. Such an outcome is arguably not sensible or workable. 120. Consequently, on balance, the Commissioner’s view is that the purpose of the “unit trust” definition is most consistent with a legal relationships test. Classified Public 18 Conclusion 121. This statement considers whether and when a unit trust can have a single unit holder. The conclusions reached are set out in the following paragraphs. 122. First, a unit trust does not need to, in fact, have multiple unit holders. Instead, a unit trust must only have facilities for multiple unit holders. 123. Second, the numbers rule in s 33 of the IA 99 does not apply. If the numbers rule applied, the plural elements of the definition of “unit trust” could be read as including the singular. This would mean that a trust that provided for only a single unit holder could be within the definition. However, in the Commissioner’s view such an interpretation would be inconsistent with Parliament’s purpose when it enacted the definition. Consequently, facilities for multiple unit holders are required for a trust to be a unit trust. 124. Finally, whether a trust provides facilities for multiple unit holders to invest should be determined by considering the legal relationships governing the trust – most importantly, the trust deed. Under this interpretation, the essential feature of a “unit trust” is the provision of the facilities for subscribers to participate, and that is not altered by there being only one subscriber. Example 125. The following example is included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example: Trust deed provides for multiple unit holders 126. XYZ Ltd wanted to set up a unit trust that its employees could invest in. It sought expressions of interest from employees. Initially only one employee, Melvin, wished to invest. He subscribed for 10,000 units at $1 each. The XYZ Unit Trust was established by a trust deed between XYZ Ltd and the Trustee. 127. The trust deed provides that the trustee may from time to time issue additional units to any employee of XYZ Ltd – the cost of those units being calculated based on the value of the existing units at the date of application. Currently, Melvin remains the sole unit holder. 128. The XYZ Unit Trust is a “unit trust” for income tax purposes. The trust deed provides facilities for multiple subscribers to participate in the unit trust. The fact that there is currently only one investor does not matter.

This Interpretation Statement explains the residence rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. 2. The analysis in this Interpretation Statement is in three parts. The first part (from \[17\]) deals with the rules governing the residence of natural persons (individuals), and discusses the relationship between those rules and the residence articles contained in New Zealand’s double taxation agreements (DTAs). It also discusses the transitional resident rules. The second part (from \[290\]) explains the residence rules for companies. It also explains the consequences of a company being a dual resident, and briefly discusses the relationship of the company residence rules to the controlled foreign company (CFC) regime. The final part (from \[414\]) of this Interpretation Statement deals with residence and the taxation regime for trusts. 3. This Interpretation Statement updates and replaces IS 14/01 – Tax Residence (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 3, April 2014). 4. The following items should not be relied on to the extent that they are inconsistent with this Interpretation Statement:  “Temporary exemption from tax on foreign income for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) (that item’s inconsistency with this Interpretation Statement is noted at \[214\]); and  “Temporary exemption for transitional residents” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) (that item’s inconsistency with this Interpretation Statement is noted at \[215\]). Relevance of residence 5. The concept of residence is a central feature of the Act and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GSTA 1985). 6. Under the Act, residence is relevant for determining whether a person is assessable for tax on worldwide income or only on New Zealand-sourced income. New Zealand residents are assessable on worldwide income (other than exempt income and excluded income), and non-residents are assessable only on New Zealand-sourced income (other than exempt income and excluded income) (s BD 1(5)). New Zealand residents may be entitled to a credit for foreign income tax paid on foreign-sourced income (s LJ 2). 7. Tax residence is relevant to the rules for the taxation of interests in foreign superannuation schemes. From 1 April 2014, lump sum withdrawals or transfers from foreign superannuation schemes will generally be taxed on an amount that approximates the gains made during the period the person is a New Zealand resident under either one of two new methods – the “schedule” method or the “formula” method. Both of these methods require the person to determine the length of their “assessable period” (CF 3(8)). The duration of a person’s tax residence is relevant to determining the length of the “assessable period”. 8. In addition to this, there is an exemption period for lump sum foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers for people who acquired the interest in the scheme when they were non-resident 1 (see ss CW 28B and CF 3). The exemption period runs until the end of the 48 th month after the month in which 1 Provided they have not had such an exemption period before acquiring the interest. 3 the person satisfied the residence requirements in the Act ─ similar to the temporary exemption for transitional residents 2 ─ (see s CF 3(6)). Unlike the transitional resident rules there is no minimum period of non-residence required to qualify for the exemption period. 9. From 1 April 2014 the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes. However, one of the situations where the FIF rules will continue to apply is where a person acquires an interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while they are a New Zealand resident (see the definition of “FIF superannuation interest” in s YA 1). 10. Tax residence is also relevant to a person’s eligibility for working for families tax credits under the family scheme. However, there are further additional residence requirements that either the principal caregiver or the dependent child must meet for the purposes of the family scheme. These relate to: being “New Zealand resident” as defined in s MA 8 (which means ordinarily and lawfully resident, other than only because of holding a temporary entry class visa), presence in New Zealand, and the transitional residence status of the principal caregiver and their spouse/partner (ss MC 5 and MD 7). 11. Under the GSTA 1985, residence is relevant for determining the place of supply of goods and services. Supplies by residents are deemed to be made in New Zealand, and supplies by non-residents are generally deemed to be made outside New Zealand (s 8(2) of the GSTA 1985). It is noted that the term “resident” in the GSTA 1985 means resident as determined in accordance with ss YD 1 and YD 2 (excluding s YD 2(2)) of the Act. However the definition of “resident” in the GSTA 1985 3 also provides that:  a person is deemed to be resident in New Zealand to the extent that they carry on a taxable activity or any other activity here while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity; and  a person who is an unincorporated body (which includes a partnership, a joint venture, and the trustee of a trust) is deemed to be resident in New Zealand if the body has its centre of administrative management here. It is also noted that supplies by non-residents may be treated as being supplied in New Zealand under s 8(3), (4) and (4B) of the GSTA 1985. 12. Residence under the Act may also be relevant for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (the SLSA 2011). Borrowers who are not physically in New Zealand may, in some circumstances, be treated as being physically in New Zealand. Some of the circumstances in which a borrower may be treated as being physically in New Zealand are subject to the condition that the borrower is tax resident in New Zealand (for example in the case of an unplanned absence from New Zealand, or unexpected delay in returning to New Zealand). Being physically in New Zealand, or treated as such, is relevant to whether a borrower is “New Zealand-based” 4 for the purposes of the SLSA 2011. Whether a borrower is New Zealand-based determines if their loan is interest-free, and also determines the repayment obligations that will apply to them. 13. In addition, tax residence may be relevant to a New Zealand-based borrower’s filing requirements under the SLSA 2011. 2 Discussed from \[206\]. 3 It is noted that if enacted the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2013, introduced on 22 November 2013, will amend the definition of “resident” in the GSTA 1985. The proposed amendment would result in the back-dating rules in s YD 1(4) and (6) being ignored in determining the residence or non-residence of natural persons for GST purposes. 4 Defined in s 4(1) of the SLSA 2011. 4 Examples 14. Throughout this Interpretation Statement, examples are given to illustrate points made. These examples are merely illustrative; they obviously do not cover the infinite number of factual scenarios that may arise. The relevant legislative provisions must be considered and applied to each case on its particular facts. That is, conclusions should not be drawn by determining whether the facts of a particular case may be analogous with a particular example, but rather on the basis of applying the correct tests established by the law. There are no “bright- line” tests, and different results in different examples should not be construed as indicating that there are. The examples deal with discrete residence tests, as identified by the headings under which they appear. They do not consider other tests – for example the permanent place of abode examples do not consider the day-count rules, any potential DTA implications, or the application of the transitional resident rules. Legislation 15. “New Zealand resident” is defined in s YA 1 of the Act, which states: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise,— ... New Zealand resident— (a) means a person resident in New Zealand under— (i) section EY 49 (Non-resident life insurer becoming resident): (ii) sections YD 1 to YD 3 (which relate to residence): (b) is defined in section MA 8 (Some definitions for family scheme) for the purposes of subparts MA to MF and MZ (which relate to tax credits for families) 16. Section YD 1 deals with the residence of natural persons (individuals) – discussed from \[17\]. Section YD 2 deals with the residence of companies – discussed from \[290\]. Analysis Part 1: Residence of natural persons (individuals) Overview 17. An individual is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period (s YD 1(3)) (“the 183-day rule”). The person will then be treated as resident from the first of those 183 days (s YD 1(4)). A person is also resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere (s YD 1(2)). 18. A person who is resident by virtue only of the 183 day rule will stop being a New Zealand resident if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period (s YD 1(5)) (“the 325-day rule”). The person will then be treated as not resident from the first of those 325 days (s YD 1(6)). 19. However the permanent place of abode test is the overriding residence rule for individuals. This means that a person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period will remain a New Zealand resident if they continue to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Equally, a person who is present in New Zealand for less than 183 days in a 12-month period is still a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 5 A person who is absent for more than 325 days in a 12-month period, but who has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at any time during that period, cannot cease to be resident any earlier than the day they lose their permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 20. The permanent place of abode test is most relevant to people leaving New Zealand. People moving to New Zealand will typically be resident under the 183- day rule and will not need to consider the permanent place of abode test. However in situations where someone moves between New Zealand and another country or countries, New Zealand residence could be triggered under either test. Also, someone moving to New Zealand could potentially establish a permanent place of abode prior to the first day of their presence under the 183-day rule. 21. In applying the 183-day and 325-day rules, a person present in New Zealand for part of a day is treated as present in New Zealand for the whole day and not absent for any part of the day (s YD 1(8)). For example, if someone arrived in New Zealand at 3pm on 28 July, that day would be counted as a full day of presence. Presence in New Zealand embassies or New Zealand consulate offices overseas is not presence in New Zealand. 22. A person who is personally absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government is treated as a New Zealand resident during that time (s YD 1(7)). See further from \[184\]. 23. A person who is employed under the recognised seasonal employment scheme will be treated as non-resident even if they satisfy the 183-day rule, provided they do not have a permanent place of abode here (s YD 1(11)). See further from \[152\]. 24. The discussion of the residence rules for individuals is structured as follows: Flowchart – How to establish if an individual is tax resident in NZ .................................. 7 Permanent place of abode ........................................................................................ 8 Examples illustrating the concept of “permanent place of abode” ................................... 19 The day-count rules ................................................................................................. 26 The 183-day rule ..................................................................................................... 26 Examples illustrating the 183-day rule ....................................................................... 27 Non-resident seasonal workers .................................................................................. 28 The 325-day rule ..................................................................................................... 29 Examples illustrating the 325-day rule ....................................................................... 29 Relationship between the PPA test and the day-count rules ........................................... 31 Examples illustrating the relationship between the 183-day and 325-day rules ................ 32 Government service rule .......................................................................................... 33 Examples illustrating the government service rule ....................................................... 35 Transitional resident rules......................................................................................... 36 Examples illustrating the transitional resident rules ...................................................... 37 Changes in residence ............................................................................................... 39 Relevance of double taxation agreements ................................................................... 40 Examples illustrating the DTA tie-breaker tests ........................................................... 47 Flowchart – How to establish if an individual is tax resident in New Zealand 25. The following flowchart sets out the matters to be considered in establishing if an individual is tax resident in New Zealand, and shows the interrelationship between the various residence tests for individuals. 6 26. It should be noted that if someone is tax resident in New Zealand and also in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, the DTA will determine what taxing rights each country has. See further from \[228\]. 27. It should also be noted that new migrants or returning New Zealanders may be eligible to be transitional residents, and entitled to tax exemptions for certain foreign-sourced income. See further from \[206\]. 7 Yes 183-day rule Have you ever been in NZ for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period? No No Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes No No Not Resident 1 Resident Resident Resident Resident Resident 3 Not Non-resident seasonal workers Are you employed under the recognised seasonal employer policy published by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment? (see: http://employment.govt.nz/er/rse/) Government service rule Are you absent from NZ in the service of the Government of NZ? 325-day rule Have you been out of NZ for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period? Do you have a permanent place of abode in NZ? If there is a place of abode (ie, a dwelling) in NZ where you habitually reside, even if you are overseas for a time, it will be your PPA. You need to consider all of your circumstances to decide if this is the case, including the following: How often and for how long you are in NZ / away from NZ, and the reasons for your trips to NZ; Any connections you have to your place of abode and to NZ that indicate whether it is likely that you will be returning to NZ to live in the abode, including: ◦ The extent to which you have lived in the place of abode before, and if you intend to return to NZ to live in it; ◦ Your intentions about your future presence in / absence from NZ. Also consider what has occurred if it is different to what was intended; ◦ Any family or social ties in NZ that indicate you will likely be returning to live in the abode (location of family you normally live with, and other social ties, such as memberships of clubs etc). ◦ Any employment, business or economic interests or ties you have that suggest you will be returning to NZ to live in the abode; ◦ What personal property you have in NZ and where it is. Permanent place of abode (PPA) Have you satisfied the 183-day rule since last satisfying the 325-day rule? 2 2 The back-dating of the 183-day and 325-day rules means that travel in and out of NZ may result in an overlap between those rules. See further from \[170\]. 3 If you subsequently satisfy the 183-day rule, the back- dating of that rule may mean that you are in fact resident as at this date. See further from \[170\]. No How to establish if an individual is tax resident in New Zealand 1 Unless you have a PPA in NZ (this would not be common). 8 Permanent place of abode 28. As noted at \[19\], the permanent place of abode test is the overriding residence rule for individuals. If a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand they will be a New Zealand resident irrespective of the day-count rules. The permanent place of abode test primarily needs to be considered in relation to people leaving New Zealand, though it may also be relevant in other contexts. Meaning of “permanent place of abode” 29. Section YD 1(2) states: YD 1 Residence of natural persons ... Permanent place of abode in New Zealand (2) Despite anything else in this section, a person is a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere. 30. The term “permanent place of abode” is not defined in the Act. It has been described by the Court of Appeal as meaning a place where a taxpayer habitually resides from time to time even if they spend periods of time overseas (CIR v Diamond \[2015\] NZCA 613). In addition to the Diamond case, the permanent place of abode test has been considered in different factual contexts in a number of Taxation Review Authority cases. 31. A person must have a place of abode (ie, a dwelling) in New Zealand to have a permanent place of abode here. This is because, as pointed out by the Court of Appeal in Diamond, “abode” means a “habitual residence, house or home or place in which the person stays, remains or dwells”. But simply having a dwelling is not sufficient. The dwelling must be the person’s permanent place of abode. 32. Deciding if someone habitually resides at a dwelling here such that it is a permanent place of abode for them requires an overall assessment of the person’s circumstances and the nature and quality of the use the person habitually makes of the place of abode. It is not just the situation during the person’s absence from New Zealand that is relevant. The situation before and after periods of absence from New Zealand should be considered in assessing how close the person’s connection with their place of abode is (Diamond and Case Q55 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,313). 33. The permanent place of abode test will usually be considered where someone who has habitually resided at a dwelling in New Zealand has left New Zealand for a time. In that situation, the question is whether they can be regarded as continuing to habitually reside at their place of abode in New Zealand, despite a period or periods of absence, such that it can still be considered to be a permanent place of abode for them. The factors discussed below will help determine that. 34. It does not matter how strong a person’s ties to New Zealand are if those ties do not indicate that the particular dwelling in question is the person’s permanent place of abode. For example, if a person has strong connections to New Zealand, but the only dwelling they have here is a property that they have never lived in and never intend to live in, that property could not be their permanent place of abode. They clearly could not be regarded as habitually residing there. 35. A place of abode does not need to be vacant or able to be occupied immediately by a person to be a permanent place of abode for them. Often someone who is temporarily overseas will lease their property to a third party, or enable someone else to use it during their absence. A place of abode can be a person’s permanent 9 place of abode even if it is rented to, or otherwise used by, someone else while the person is overseas. If the person habitually resides in the property, despite being absent from New Zealand for a time, the property can still be their permanent place of abode, irrespective of whether the property is occupied by someone else for limited periods of time. See, for example, Case Q55, Case F138 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,237, Case J98 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,555 and Case J41 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,240. 36. Permanent means the opposite of temporary, and the Court of Appeal observed in Diamond that something is permanent when it is “continuing or designed to continue indefinitely without change”. However, it is clear from the New Zealand case law that the person does not need to intend to live somewhere for the rest of their life for it to be their permanent place of abode (Case H97 (1986) 8 NZTC 664, Case J98, Case Q55). 37. It should be noted that a person can be resident in New Zealand under the permanent place of abode test even if they also have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand. The focus is not on determining which place the person has the strongest connections to, but on whether their place of abode here is a permanent place of abode. 38. In determining whether a person habitually resides at a place of abode in New Zealand such that it is a permanent place of abode for them, it is necessary to consider:  the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand; and  the durability of the person’s association with the place of abode and how close their connection with it is. (Diamond, FCT v Applegate 79 ATC 4307 (FCAFC), Case H97, Case J98, Case Q55). 39. The above is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s summary in Diamond of the main factors that may help in determining if someone has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, and the things to bear in mind as part of that enquiry. In this regard, the court said at \[59\]: The following (non-exhaustive) factors may inform the inquiry: (a) The continuity or otherwise of the taxpayer’s presence in New Zealand and in the dwelling; (b) The duration of that presence; (c) The durability of the taxpayer’s association with the particular place; (d) The closeness or otherwise of the taxpayer’s connection with the dwelling — the situation before and after a period or periods of absence from New Zealand should be considered. (e) The requirement for permanency is to distinguish merely transient or temporary places of abode. Permanency refers to the continuing availability of a place on an indefinite (but not necessarily everlasting) basis. (f) The existence of another permanent place of abode outside New Zealand does not preclude a finding that the taxpayer has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 40. Paragraphs (a) to (d) in the court’s list of factors are the factors that have long been considered relevant to determining if someone has a permanent place of abode – continuity and duration of the person’s presence, and durability of association with the place of abode (see, for example, Applegate, Case H97, Case J98, Case Q55). The observations at paras (e) and (f) are things to bear in mind as part of the enquiry as to whether someone has a permanent place of abode in 10 New Zealand, and are also consistent with the earlier cases that have considered the permanent place of abode test. When will a place of abode be a person’s permanent place of abode? 41. In most cases it will be a simple matter to establish whether a person’s place of abode in New Zealand is a permanent place of abode. Assume, for example, that a person who normally lives in New Zealand, who owns and occupies a house here and who has employment ties here, is absent for a fixed period of, say, 12 months. This person has an enduring relationship with their New Zealand place of abode, and it is the place where they usually live. That place of abode is their permanent place of abode – they habitually reside there even though they are away from New Zealand for a time. 42. More difficult cases will arise where the person has been absent from New Zealand for a substantial period, or where the person is here intermittently. Where the answer is not clear, all relevant factors must be weighed carefully. As noted above, this will involve considering the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand, and the durability of the person’s association with the place of abode and how close their connection with it is. 43. Paragraphs \[59\] – \[ 84\] discuss the relevant factors to consider in assessing the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand and the durability of the person’s association with the place of abode and how close their connection with it is. It is important to understand that those factors are not of equal weight, and the significance that each of them has will depend on the person’s particular circumstances. The question is whether, having regard to the overall picture, there is a place of abode in New Zealand in which the person habitually resides, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them. 44. A person’s connections to the location in New Zealand where their place of abode is situated are relevant in objectively assessing whether a particular place of abode is a permanent place of abode for them. The strength of such connections may indicate that the abode is a place the person habitually resides, even though they are away for a time, and a place to which the person will likely return to live on an enduring basis. 45. A person may also have connections to New Zealand generally, such as keeping a New Zealand bank account, having membership in professional or trade associations, or maintaining medical insurance with a New Zealand company (see further from \[76\]). Such connections could be relevant to any location in New Zealand and are not by their nature tied to any specific dwelling or location. General connections to New Zealand will only be relevant to the extent that they provide some indication about whether the person is likely to return to New Zealand to live in their abode here, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them. Factors to consider 46. As noted above, the permanent place of abode test will usually be considered in a situation where someone who has habitually resided at a dwelling in New Zealand has left New Zealand for a time. In that situation, the question is whether they can be regarded as continuing to habitually reside at their place of abode in New Zealand, despite a period or periods of absence, such that it can be considered to still be their permanent place of abode. 47. The permanent place of abode test can also be relevant when someone who was not a New Zealand tax resident, and who has not become resident under the 183- day rule, establishes a place of abode here. The question in that scenario is 11 whether, and at what point, the person can be considered to have begun habitually residing at their abode here, such that it can be considered to be their permanent place of abode (irrespective of whether they also have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand). 48. As noted above, the court in Diamond stated, consistent with the earlier case law on the permanent place of abode test, that the factors that will assist in determining whether a place of abode is the person’s permanent place of abode include:  the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand; and  the durability of the person’s association with the place of abode and how close their connection with it is. (Diamond, Applegate, Case H97, Case J98, Case Q55) 49. In assessing the durability of a person’s association with their place of abode, the courts have looked at numerous different connections – these are discussed below at \[59\] – \[ 84\]. 50. In Diamond, the taxpayer had never resided, or intended to reside, in his dwelling in New Zealand. The dwelling had only ever been used as an investment property. In those circumstances, the court considered that the dwelling could not be the taxpayer’s permanent place of abode, irrespective of any of the ties he had to New Zealand. Because there was simply no question about whether the taxpayer habitually resided in the dwelling before he left New Zealand (he did not), there could be no question about whether he continued to habitually reside there during the tax years in question (the first four years of his absence from New Zealand). As such, the court did not need to analyse and weigh up the nature and extent of each of the connections the taxpayer had to New Zealand. No matter how strong the taxpayer’s connections to New Zealand were, because he did not have any residential connections to the dwelling at all, none of his connections to New Zealand could indicate that the dwelling was a permanent place of abode for him. On any overall assessment of the taxpayer’s circumstances, the property was not a permanent place of abode for him before or after his departure. Continuity and duration of presence in New Zealand 51. As a general rule, the longer a person is present in New Zealand, the more likely it is that their place of abode here is a permanent place of abode for them. Conversely, the longer a person is absent from New Zealand, the less likely it is that their place of abode here will continue to be a permanent place of abode for them. 52. This is not to say that periods of presence in, or absence from, New Zealand are the overriding consideration. However, where a person is absent from New Zealand for an extended period, it is less likely that the person’s place of abode here continues to be a permanent place of abode for them, even though they may still have connections with New Zealand. The longer the period of absence, the less likely that the abode can be considered a place in which they habitually reside. 53. Where a person is absent from New Zealand, a point would eventually be reached where it would no longer be reasonable to consider that a place of abode they have in New Zealand is still a permanent place of abode for them. Such an assessment would be made taking all material facts into account. This would include whether the person has maintained connections in New Zealand that indicate they will be returning to live at the place of abode on a durable basis. 12 54. The longer a person is away from New Zealand, the fewer ties to New Zealand they are likely to retain. This would typically support a conclusion that their dwelling here is no longer a permanent place of abode for them. That said, there may be situations in which a person lives in another country for an extended time but still maintains strong ties to New Zealand. Depending on the circumstances, the person may continue to have a permanent place of abode here. As noted below at \[85\], it is clear from s YD 1(2) that a person may have more than one permanent place of abode. 55. There is no specific length of presence in, or absence from, New Zealand that results in a person acquiring or losing a permanent place of abode here. If a person has strong connections with New Zealand and their place of abode here, it could be expected that a longer period of absence would be required for their place of abode to no longer be considered their permanent place of abode than if the person’s connections to New Zealand and the place of abode were weaker. The totality of the particular circumstances must be considered in each case. 56. The duration of presence factor focuses on the length of the person’s presence or presences in New Zealand. The continuity of presence factor refers to whether the person is present in New Zealand for continuous or interrupted periods. 57. The more continuous the periods a person is at their place of abode in New Zealand, the stronger the indication that their place of abode here is their permanent place of abode. This is because they are actually living here, rather than merely visiting for brief periods. Likewise, the more continuous the periods of absence from New Zealand are, the more that might indicate the person’s place of abode here is no longer a permanent place of abode for them. This can be compared to a situation where someone frequently returns to New Zealand. 58. However, while frequent trips back to New Zealand are a factor that might help determine whether a person’s place of abode here is a permanent place of abode for them, this is not necessarily the case, and such trips must be viewed in context. For example, regular visits may be explicable because the person is returning to see children who live here with an ex-spouse, or to visit extended family. The weight to be given to frequent visits should be considered in light of all of the circumstances (including whether they stay at their abode on those visits) and the reasons for the person’s trips to New Zealand. Durability of association 59. Consideration of the durability of a person’s association with a place of abode involves an examination of the extent and strength of the attachments that the person has established and maintained in New Zealand. The strength of such connections may indicate whether the abode is a place the person habitually resides, even though they are away for a time. (See, for example, Case Q55, Case F138, Case J98, and Case U17 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,174). 60. The above cases establish that some of the material factors to be considered when assessing whether a person has a durable association with a place of abode, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them, are:  the nature and use of the dwelling and the person’s connection with the dwelling;  the person’s intentions;  the person’s family and social ties;  the person’s employment, business interests and economic ties; 13  the person’s personal property; and  any other factors that shed light on whether the place of abode is a permanent place of abode for the person. The nature and use of the dwelling and the person’s connection with the dwelling 61. As noted above, a person must have a place of abode in New Zealand to have a permanent place of abode here. This does not mean that the dwelling needs to be one that is owned by the person, or vacant or able to be occupied immediately. For example, the property might be rented, held in a family trust, or owned by a family company or other family member. 62. That said, the nature and use of a dwelling that a person has in New Zealand, and the connection that the person has with the dwelling, are fundamental to determining whether it is a permanent place of abode for them. If the person owns a house or apartment in New Zealand that they have previously lived in, for example, this would likely be a stronger indication of an enduring connection with the place of abode than, say, the ability to reside at a parent’s house that had previously been lived in. 63. A situation that often arises is where a young person lives away from the family home some of the time, for example during university terms, but returns to the family home during holidays. If the young person goes overseas after their studies, there is often a question about whether the family home is a permanent place of abode for them. In such circumstances, it may well be that the person had two permanent places of abode before they left New Zealand – the family home and the student accommodation – because they habitually resided in both places. It could therefore be that although they no longer have the abode that was their student accommodation once they leave New Zealand (eg, because they gave up the lease) the family home continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. As in any other circumstances, this will depend on the nature and quality of the use the person habitually makes of that abode. In this particular context it would be relevant to consider how often and for how long the person returned to the family home – both before they left New Zealand and after their departure, the extent to which they are financially independent, and their intended future use of the abode (which may change over time). Whether the family home is the person’s permanent place of abode is a question of fact, and will require an overall assessment of the particular circumstances and the nature and quality of the use the person habitually makes of the abode. 64. As noted above, the permanent place of abode test will usually be considered in a situation where someone who has habitually resided at a dwelling in New Zealand has left New Zealand for a time. In that situation, the question is whether they can be regarded as continuing to habitually reside at their place of abode in New Zealand, despite a period or periods of absence, such that it can be considered to be a permanent place of abode for them. It is clear from Diamond that a property that a person has never lived in, never intended to live in, and that has only ever been used as an investment could not be a permanent place of abode for the person – it would clearly not be a place where they habitually reside. 65. However, there may potentially be circumstances where a place of abode that a person has not yet lived in, but intends to live in in the future, is their permanent place of abode. While this would only be in limited situations, the Commissioner considers that it could occur. For example, if the person’s permanent place of abode had been the family home, and the family shifted during the person’s absence from New Zealand, the new family home could be their permanent place of abode even though they had not yet lived in it. The Court of Appeal in 14 Diamond did not consider this type of scenario, but the Commissioner considers that such an approach would be consistent with the approach and reasoning of the court and the tenor of the judgment. The totality of the circumstances must be considered. In the absence of changed circumstances, in such a scenario the new family home could be viewed as essentially being a substitute for the previous family home, which was clearly the person’s permanent place of abode. If a person habitually resides in the family home, despite a period of absence from New Zealand, the Commissioner considers that a shift in the location of the family home would not alter the conclusion that the person continues to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 66. On the other hand, someone who lived overseas and bought a house in New Zealand would not have a permanent place of abode here merely by virtue of that, even if they intended to live there in the future. However, the house might potentially become a permanent place of abode for the person at some stage prior to them moving here, or even if they do not ever move here to live all of the time. For example, if they started coming to New Zealand and living in the house at regular intervals or for significant periods of time, it may become their permanent place of abode at some stage, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere. It is always necessary to consider the circumstances as a whole, including the continuity and duration of presences, the nature of the visits and the reasons for them, and what occurs over time (ie, the pattern over a number of years). 67. The extent to which a person has lived in a dwelling will be a relevant consideration in assessing whether the dwelling is a permanent place of abode for them. Intention 68. Determining whether a person’s place of abode in New Zealand is a permanent place of abode for them is an objective enquiry (Case H97, Case J98 and Case Q55). However a person’s intention can also be considered in such an enquiry (Case F138, Case F139 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,245, Case H97 and Case Q55). 69. A person’s intentions about their presence in, or absence from, New Zealand and about a place of abode they have here will be important factors, although a person’s intentions are not the central consideration. It is necessary to consider not only what was intended, but what in fact occurred (Case F139 and Case H97). 70. In cases where a person is overseas, the intention to return to New Zealand to live may be indicative of their place of abode here continuing to be a permanent place of abode for them – a place in which they habitually reside, despite a period of time overseas. However, it is important to balance intention with all other relevant factors. For example, if a person has departed from New Zealand for an extended period, but ultimately intends to return, that intention alone will not establish that the person’s place of abode here remains a permanent place of abode for them. On the other hand, if a person has departed for a relatively short period of fixed duration, the intention to return will be a strong indicator that the person’s place of abode here continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. 71. A person’s intention is subjective. However, how much weight a person’s stated intention is given will depend on the extent to which the circumstances support that stated intention. 15 Family and social ties 72. The location of a person’s family may be a factor of some importance. For example, if a person is absent from New Zealand, but their immediate family (eg, spouse/partner and dependent children) remain here, that will tend to support a conclusion that the person’s place of abode here continues to be a permanent place of abode for the person. Once again, however, family ties must be considered in relation to all the other relevant factors. If a person is absent from New Zealand for a relatively short period, the fact that their family accompanies them overseas will not mean the person does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 73. The weight to be attached to family ties may vary from individual to individual, and in light of the nature and quality of the relationships. In determining the weight to be given to any family ties, it is important to bear in mind the person’s particular circumstances. 74. For example, in some circumstances it might be relevant that a person has dependent children in New Zealand, and in other circumstances this would not be a relevant consideration. For instance, if someone’s spouse/partner and children remain in the family home in New Zealand while the person is overseas for a time, those family connections will be relevant, and will indicate that the abode continues to be a permanent place of abode for the person. On the other hand, if someone has dependent children in New Zealand, but they are estranged from their children (as in Case U17), or they have agreed for their children to remain in New Zealand with an ex-spouse (as in Diamond), the fact that the children are here will not provide any indication as to whether the person’s place of abode here continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. Although in the latter situation the person has important, close family ties to New Zealand, and may well make regular trips back to New Zealand to see their children, those connections need to be viewed in light of all the other circumstances and will not suggest that any place of abode the person has in New Zealand continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. Of course, if the person returns to New Zealand from time to time to visit family and they stay at their place of abode here, the fact that they habitually stay at their abode would be a relevant consideration. 75. Other social ties, such as membership of sporting and cultural associations, may also be relevant in establishing whether a person’s place of abode here continues to be a permanent place of abode for them – a place they habitually reside. Such ties will not necessarily be of much weight by themselves, but may suggest that the person will be returning to New Zealand to live (and in particular to the location in which their place of abode is), and, together with other ties to that location or place of abode, may be indicative of the person’s place of abode here continuing to be a permanent place of abode for them. Employment, business interests and economic ties 76. If a person is absent from New Zealand but retains employment, business, trade or professional ties with New Zealand, that may be relevant to the extent that it indicates the person is likely to or intends to return to live in their place of abode here. 77. For example, university lecturers who take sabbatical leave overseas generally continue to be employed and paid by the university during their absence. The continued employment ties in such a situation will be important in determining whether the person’s place of abode in New Zealand remains a permanent place of abode for them. The weight to be given to employment ties will depend on their strength – for example, whether employment is guaranteed after the 16 absence or is likely still to be open to the person, and the reasons for the employment arrangements being as they are. 78. Memberships of trade and professional associations may provide some indication as to whether a person is likely to or intends to return to live in their place of abode in New Zealand so should be taken into account, but would not by themselves carry much weight. 79. The person’s overall economic connections with New Zealand will only be relevant to the extent they indicate the person is likely to or intends to return to New Zealand and live in their place of abode here. Such connections will often be of no assistance in determining this. There are numerous reasons a person might retain a bank account or credit card facility in New Zealand, or have insurance coverage from New Zealand, superannuation in New Zealand, or investments here or managed from here. Unless, in the particular circumstances, these factors indicate the person habitually resides in their place of abode here, they will not be relevant. 80. The Commissioner considers that paying child support for children in New Zealand is not relevant, as it does not provide any indication about whether the person is likely to return to New Zealand to live in their abode here, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them. Personal property 81. If the person has personal property (eg, furniture or a vehicle) situated in New Zealand, this could be taken into account to the extent that it indicates they are likely to or intend to return to live in their abode here. 82. The weight to be given to the fact that a person has personal property in New Zealand will depend on the nature of the property and the person’s circumstances. For example, if someone leaves the bulk of their furniture and other personal effects in New Zealand, this would be of far more weight than someone leaving, say, a few personal effects with a relative or friend. Other factors 83. Other factors, such as whether the person receives New Zealand social welfare assistance, or whether the person regularly spends their holidays in New Zealand, may also be relevant, but again, only to the extent that they indicate the person is likely to or intends to return to live in their place of abode here. 84. There is no exhaustive list of factors that can be taken into account. Any factor showing a person has a durable connection to their place of abode in New Zealand may be relevant, as it may assist in drawing the inference that the person intends to continue to habitually reside in their place of abode in New Zealand, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them. A person may have a permanent place of abode elsewhere 85. As noted above, s YD 1(2) provides that a natural person is a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, “even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere”. Therefore, it is clear from s YD 1(2) that a person may have more than one permanent place of abode. 86. It should be emphasised that the focus of the permanent place of abode test is on the person’s connections with their place of abode in New Zealand, rather than on whether the person’s connections are closer with the place of abode in New Zealand or with a place of abode in another country. A person may be resident in 17 New Zealand under the permanent place of abode test even if they have closer connections with a place of abode in another country. 87. That said, factors that suggest a person has a durable connection to their place of abode in New Zealand must be weighed against contrary factors that indicate the person no longer habitually resides at their place of abode here. Such contrary factors could include evidence of the person’s connections to a foreign country or to a place of abode in that country; for example, the purchase of a home in another country, or family, social or other ties to another country. 88. If a person has established strong connections to another country, it is less likely they will return to their place of abode in New Zealand, and so less likely they can be regarded as continuing to habitually reside there. Conversely, the lack of strong connections to another country make it more likely the person will return to their place of abode in New Zealand, and so more likely they can be regarded as still habitually residing there: see, for example, Case H97. 89. However, there may be situations where a person has a permanent place of abode in more than one country and moves between those countries. The fact that a person has established strong connections in another country will not preclude them having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 90. There may also be situations where a person has no permanent place of abode anywhere. Lack of strong connections in another country will therefore not necessarily mean that a person’s place of abode in New Zealand is their permanent place of abode. For example, in Case 10/2013 (2013) 26 NZTC 2- 009, \[2013\] NZTRA 10 5 Judge Sinclair did not place any particular weight on the taxpayer not having established roots in Iraq, noting that this was not surprising given the security issues in that country and the nature of the taxpayer’s employment. 91. The extent of a person’s connections to a foreign country will be relevant in assessing the person’s connections to New Zealand and their place of abode here. However, the permanent place of abode test does not involve a comparison of the relative “permanence” of different permanent places of abode. So long as a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they will be resident here under s YD 1(2). Summary – permanent place of abode 92. In summary:  A person must have a place of abode (ie, a dwelling) in New Zealand to have a permanent place of abode here. But simply having a dwelling is not sufficient, and would not give rise to tax residence in New Zealand.  A place of abode will be a person’s permanent place of abode if it is a place where they habitually reside from time to time even if they spend periods of time overseas. To be a permanent place of abode, the abode must be a place where the person habitually resides on an enduring, rather than temporary, basis.  Deciding if a dwelling is someone’s permanent place of abode requires an overall assessment of the person’s circumstances and the nature and quality of the use the person habitually makes of the place of abode.  In determining whether a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode, it is necessary to consider the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand and the durability of the person’s association with their place of abode here and how close their connection with it is. 5 The TRA decision in the Diamond case, which was ultimately decided by the Court of Appeal. 18  To determine whether a person has a durable association with their place of abode, the person’s overall connections with their place of abode and with New Zealand must be weighed up. It is then necessary to evaluate the extent to which those connections indicate the person has an enduring relationship with their place of abode here, such that it can be considered to be their permanent place of abode.  It does not matter how strong a person’s ties to New Zealand are if those ties do not indicate the particular dwelling in question is a permanent place of abode for the person. For example, if a person has strong connections to New Zealand, but the only dwelling they have here is a property that they have never lived in and never intend to live in, that property could not be a permanent place of abode for them. Acquiring and losing a permanent place of abode 93. When a person becomes a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, the time that their tax residence commences must be identified. Individuals can become resident as a result of the operation of either the permanent place of abode test or the 183-day rule (discussed from \[142\]). 94. When a person satisfies the 183-day rule, their tax residence is back-dated (under s YD 1(4)) to the first day of the 183 days that they were present in New Zealand in the 12-month period. In most situations where a person becomes tax resident in New Zealand, it will be the 183-day rule and s YD 1(4) that establish when their residence commences. 95. However, a person could become resident under the permanent place of abode test from a time prior to the first day of their presence in New Zealand under the 183-day rule. This could occur, for example, if someone moved to New Zealand but was out of the country for much of the year on business and did not trigger the 183-day rule for some time. In those circumstances, the date at which the person acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand would need to be determined, as their New Zealand tax residence could commence from that point. 96. When a person leaves New Zealand, the time when their New Zealand tax residence ends must also be identified. A person will not cease to be tax resident here until they have been absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period and no longer have a permanent place of abode here. 97. The date that a person loses their permanent place of abode in New Zealand will therefore be relevant if it occurs some time after the 325 days of absence. The date that a person loses their permanent place of abode will also be relevant if it occurs during the 12-month period in which they satisfy the 325-day rule. In this situation, the interaction between the permanent place of abode test in s YD 1(2) and the back-dating rule in s YD 1(6) (see \[154\]) results in the person ceasing to be tax resident in New Zealand from the time they lose their permanent place of abode. 98. The time at which a person acquires or loses their permanent place of abode is determined by an evaluation of the circumstances of each case. The objective is to determine the point in time at which either the person acquires a permanent place of abode in New Zealand by being present here and establishing an enduring connection with a place of abode here, or the person loses their permanent place of abode by ceasing to habitually reside at a place of abode here. 99. If a person’s circumstances change at any point, it is necessary to reconsider whether they have a permanent place of abode here. It may be that the change 19 in circumstances results in the acquisition or loss of a permanent place of abode here. It is relevant to consider the time of occurrence of such events as:  commencement or termination of employment;  changes in the location of the person’s family;  changes in personal circumstances such as the status of relationships;  purchase or sale of real or personal property;  commencement or termination of a lease;  transfer of financial affairs;  appointment to, or resignation from, trade, professional, sporting or cultural associations; and  departure from, or arrival in, New Zealand for an extended period. 100. In some situations, the combination of such factors may indicate that a person acquires or loses their permanent place of abode at a time other than arrival in or departure from New Zealand. Examples illustrating the concept of “permanent place of abode” The following examples deal only with the permanent place of abode test. They do not consider the 183-day rule, the 325-day rule, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. The examples illustrate the way in which a person’s overall circumstances need to be considered to determine if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The conclusions in the examples are based on the facts that are known at a particular point in time. If what in fact eventuates differs from this, the results could be different for some or all of the years in question. It is important to bear in mind that if a person’s circumstances change during their absence from New Zealand, it is necessary to reconsider whether they have a permanent place of abode here. Example 1 101. Facts: Cate, who is normally resident in New Zealand, is seconded to Canada in connection with her employment for a fixed period of three years. Cate intends to return to New Zealand after the period of secondment, and the terms of her secondment are such that her job will definitely be available for her to return to. Cate’s partner and children accompany her to Canada. The family home in New Zealand is owned by a family trust, of which Cate’s parents and their solicitor are trustees. Cate, her partner and their children, together with Cate’s siblings and their families, are the beneficiaries of the trust. The house is rented out while the family is in Canada. Cate and her family leave their furniture and most of their other personal belongings in storage in New Zealand during their absence. Cate retains her New Zealand investments and her connections with several professional and sporting associations here. Cate and her family return to New Zealand each year to spend Christmas with family and have a summer holiday here. 102. Result: Cate would have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand when she leaves for Canada. During the period of her absence, her place of abode here may cease to be her permanent place of abode. This will depend on what eventuates. Cate should assess her overall circumstances throughout the period 20 of her absence from New Zealand to ascertain whether she continues to have a permanent place of abode here. 103. Explanation: Cate has a place of abode in New Zealand that she habitually resided in before leaving for Canada. The question is whether, during her absence from New Zealand, that house continues to be a place Cate habitually resides. 104. Although Cate will be absent from New Zealand for three years, this is not of itself inconsistent with her place of abode here remaining a permanent place of abode – a place she habitually resides. All of the relevant factors must be weighed up. In this case, Cate has retained ties with New Zealand – she still has most of her personal property here, maintains membership of several professional and sporting associations, and has investments here. Cate also retains employment ties with New Zealand, as her secondment is in connection with her New Zealand employment. Cate has a definite intention to return to New Zealand at the end of the 3-year secondment and to resume living in the family home here. Although the house is owned in trust, Cate’s parents are trustees, and the family are all beneficiaries. It is reasonable to infer that the trustees will enable the family to resume living in the family home on their return. At the time she leaves New Zealand, the strength of Cate’s enduring connections with New Zealand and with her place of abode here are sufficient to establish that her home here continues to be a permanent place of abode. 105. If, at the time she left New Zealand, Cate’s circumstances had been different, she may not have had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from the time of her departure. For example, Cate would not have had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from the time she left if: she had not intended to return to New Zealand after the secondment, she did not have a guaranteed position available for her to return to, and she and her family had taken most of their furniture and other belongings with them. 106. However, whatever Cate’s circumstances at the time of her departure, realistically those circumstances are unlikely to remain exactly as they were. Over the period of her secondment in Canada, decisions Cate makes and events that occur might lead to a conclusion that her place of abode here ceases to be her permanent place of abode from a particular point in time, or might support a conclusion that it remains her permanent place of abode. For example, Cate and her family might decide they love Canada and want to stay, and Cate or her partner might secure work and visas to enable them to do that, and take their belongings out of storage and move them to Canada. In those circumstances, Cate would cease to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from that point in time. On the other hand, Cate might not enjoy living in Canada, and might try to renegotiate her secondment arrangements to return to New Zealand earlier, or at least form the definite intention to return as soon as possible. Further to the need to consider the circumstances as they evolve, another relevant factor is whether Cate and her family stay in their place of abode here on their trips back each summer (ie, because the property is rented during the university year, but able to be used by them between December and February). In those circumstances, Cate’s place of abode here may well continue to be her permanent place of abode throughout the 3-year period. 107. It is always necessary to make an overall assessment of a person’s circumstances and the nature and quality of the use they make of their place of abode in New Zealand in deciding if it continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. Life events and changes in circumstances may mean that someone ceases to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, so it is necessary to periodically consider the situation throughout the period of someone’s absence. 21 Example 2 108. Facts: Mike departs from New Zealand on a working holiday (his “OE”). He intends to return to New Zealand after his OE, though he is not sure exactly when that will be. Before he left New Zealand, Mike had been living in a rented flat in Wellington for a couple of years, prior to which he had lived with his parents (also in Wellington). Mike terminates his lease when he leaves New Zealand. Mike resigns from his job and stores his personal effects with his parents, who are happy for Mike to return to live with them if he wishes on his return. Mike leaves his KiwiSaver account in New Zealand and takes a contributions holiday. Mike ends up returning to New Zealand to live after 18 months. 109. Result: Mike does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand while he is overseas. 110. Explanation: Mike terminated the lease on the flat he lived in before he left New Zealand. Obviously, therefore, it does not continue to be a place he habitually resides from that point. Although Mike could return to live with his parents when he comes back to New Zealand, the fact that he lived independently from his parents for a couple of years prior to leaving New Zealand means that he no longer habitually resided at their house before his departure from New Zealand. 111. It is therefore irrelevant that Mike intends to return to New Zealand after his OE, or that he has stored his personal effects here and has family ties here. 112. If Mike had never lived independently from his parents prior to going overseas, his parents’ house might continue to be his permanent place of abode when he leaves New Zealand. Although when he leaves Mike does not know exactly when he will return to New Zealand, he is going on an OE and does not have the intention of leaving New Zealand permanently. Mike has left his personal effects at his parents’ house, has family ties here, and intends to return to New Zealand after his OE. In this scenario, because Mike had lived with his parents before going overseas, their house might continue to be his permanent place of abode because it is the place he habitually resides, despite a period of absence from New Zealand. However, this will be a question of fact, and would require an overall assessment of the circumstances, including the extent to which Mike is financially independent, and whether he intends to return to his parent’s house to live more than temporarily. Of course, even if Mike’s parent’s house is still his permanent place of abode at the time he leaves New Zealand, there could come a point at which it ceases to be, because he no longer habitually resides there – this would depend on what ultimately occurs. It is always necessary to make an overall assessment of a person’s circumstances and the nature and quality of the use they make of their place of abode in New Zealand in deciding if it continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. Example 3 113. Facts: Li is a New Zealand citizen who has extensive business interests in New Zealand and Australia. Li owns a house in each country, neither of which are rented out, and both of which are available for his use. Li spends most of his time in Australia, but he regularly travels to New Zealand in connection with his business here. In aggregate, Li spends up to five months of the year in New Zealand, staying in his house here most of the time he is here (except when his business requires him to be elsewhere in New Zealand). These trips vary in length from two days up to several weeks. Li has significant investments in New Zealand, and he is a member of a number of cultural and sporting associations here. Li’s immediate family live in Australia. 114. Result: Li has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 22 115. Explanation: Li has a place of abode in New Zealand that he habitually resides in. He spends up to five months of the year in New Zealand, and for most of that time (whenever possible) he resides in his house here. Li’s presence in New Zealand is generally for short periods; that is, his presence here is not of a continuous nature. However, Li resides in his house here for long enough each year that there is no question he habitually resides there, and that it is therefore a permanent place of abode for him. In addition, it is noted that Li has substantial connections with New Zealand, and that those connections are maintained through regular trips to New Zealand. Those factors further bolster the conclusion that his place of abode here is a permanent place of abode. Although he also has a place of abode in Australia, Li usually or typically lives in both of his places of abode on an enduring, rather than temporary, basis. Example 4 116. Facts: Ronan is a software developer who has lived in Wellington for 12 years and has a partner there. He and his partner own the apartment they live in and another similar apartment in a nearby building. Ronan accepts a 2-year contract in Dublin. For the first year of his contract, Ronan returns to Wellington every few months to see his partner, after which she decides to take a year of unpaid leave and join him in Ireland for the remainder of his contract. At that time, they sell the apartment they had lived in, given that they will be down to one income and wish to travel a little in Europe in the second year of Ronan’s contract. They sold the apartment they lived in rather than the investment property because it was not subject to a lease and so was easier to sell promptly. The couple intend to return to Wellington after Ronan’s contract; they have many friends there and Ronan’s partner’s family live there. In addition to the investment property he owns with his partner, Ronan has a sizeable New Zealand share portfolio. 117. Result: Ronan has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during the first year of his absence. 118. Explanation: In the first year of Ronan’s absence, there is a place of abode in New Zealand that he habitually resided in before leaving for Ireland – the apartment he and his partner owned and in which they lived. Although Ronan was away from New Zealand, it remained his permanent place of abode for the first year of his absence. His partner continued to live there, and Ronan returned to see her every few months. The apartment would have been furnished with Ronan and his partner’s belongings, and Ronan intended to return to New Zealand to live after his 2-year contract. In addition, Ronan has a number of enduring connections with New Zealand, and Wellington in particular – he has lived in Wellington for 12 years and intends to return there with his partner after his 2-year contract, he has family ties there (his partner’s family), and he has substantial investments in New Zealand. These factors support a conclusion that he was likely to continue living in the apartment in Wellington on his intended return to New Zealand, and that it therefore remained a place in which he habitually resided, despite a period of absence. 119. In the second year of Ronan’s absence from New Zealand, after the sale of the apartment in which he had lived, Ronan ceased to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Once the apartment was sold, Ronan no longer has an abode in New Zealand in which he habitually resides. Although Ronan and his partner own an investment property that is very similar to the apartment in which they lived, and they may indeed decide to live in it on their return to New Zealand, Ronan has never lived in that property, and it has only ever been used as an investment property. It is therefore irrelevant in respect of the second year of his absence that Ronan intends to return to New Zealand after his contract finishes, or that he has numerous ties to New Zealand generally and Wellington 23 more specifically – none of those ties indicate that the investment property is Ronan’s permanent place of abode. Example 5 120. Facts: Melanie and her husband and four young children live in Tauranga. Melanie gets a lucrative job offer in London and the family decide to move there. They have no intention to return to New Zealand to live in the foreseeable future, and they intend the move to be a permanent one. The couple decide to sell their family home. Melanie moves to London in October to commence her new job. Her husband stays behind in Tauranga until December to enable their school-aged children to finish the school year, and to arrange the sale of their home. Once Melanie arrives in London, she enrols the children in schools there from the start of the following year. Melanie and her husband retain a one-bedroom rental property in Tauranga, which they have owned for a number of years, and leave their share portfolio to be managed by their New Zealand broker. They have life insurance policies with a New Zealand insurance company and retain those policies. The family home is sold in November. The sale settles in mid- December, at the end of the school year, at which time Melanie’s husband and children move to London as planned. 121. Result: Melanie does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from the date of her departure in October. Her husband does not have a permanent place of abode from when the sale of the family home settles in mid-December. 122. Explanation: Although Melanie, at least initially, continues to have strong connections to New Zealand, her place of abode here is no longer her permanent place of abode. In the two months after she leaves New Zealand, her husband and children remain here, living in their family home. However, this is so the children can finish the school year here, and Melanie’s husband can arrange the sale of the family home. In the circumstances, it does not indicate that the family home continues to be Melanie’s permanent place of abode – she no longer habitually resides there. Melanie has no intention to return to live in New Zealand in the foreseeable future, nor to live in the home again, and the sale of the home shortly after her departure supports this. The retention of some investments and insurance in New Zealand is not by itself significant, and does not indicate that the home continued to be Melanie’s permanent place of abode until it was sold. 123. Melanie has never resided at the rental property that she and her husband own – it was acquired solely as an investment and has always been used as such. It is not a place they habitually live. It would therefore not be Melanie’s permanent place of abode even if she maintained very strong ties to New Zealand after her departure. 124. Melanie’s husband continues to habitually reside in the family home until the sale settles in mid-December. It therefore remains his permanent place of abode until that time. 125. If some time after Melanie left New Zealand but before the family home was sold, circumstances changed such that Melanie ended up forgoing the job opportunity in London and returning to New Zealand to the family home to live, the home would become her permanent place of abode once again from that time. This would not alter the fact that on her departure the family home ceased to be her permanent place of abode. Example 6 126. Facts: Cameron is a civil engineer who goes to Japan with work for 18 months. Cameron’s children are about to start high school, and the family had intended to move from Christchurch to Dunedin soon, to be closer to extended family. 24 Cameron and his wife agree that she and the children will stay in New Zealand for the 18 months, during which time they will move to Dunedin so that the children can start high school there. Cameron’s wife and children make the move from Christchurch to Dunedin, and he will join them there once he returns from Japan. 127. Result: Cameron has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during his absence. 128. Explanation: Cameron has a place of abode in New Zealand that he habitually resides in – being the family home. Cameron lived in the original family home in Christchurch before going to Japan. He had a durable association with the home in Christchurch, and it continued to be his permanent place of abode despite his absence. Once the family home shifts because the family move to Dunedin, Cameron has a durable association with the new family home there through his wife and children living there and his intention to live there on his return. This association establishes that the new family home is Cameron’s permanent place of abode. Although Cameron has not previously lived in Dunedin, his family home has been established there during his absence, and he will join his family there on his return. Cameron habitually resides in the family home with his wife and children, and the fact that the family home has shifted during Cameron’s absence does not alter that. Example 7 129. Facts: Charlie and his wife own a house in Auckland, where they live with their children, and where he is a member of a number of local clubs. Charlie starts working as a miner in Moranbah in Queensland (Australia), where he works for periods of eight weeks at a time, between which he returns to his home in Auckland for a week off. Charlie’s wages are paid into an Australian bank account, in Australian dollars, though most of his wages are automatically transferred from there into the New Zealand bank account he holds jointly with his wife. Charlie’s employer provides him with accommodation at the mine site. On his home visits, Charlie maintains his sporting and social ties. 130. Result: Charlie has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 131. Explanation: Charlie has a place of abode in New Zealand that he habitually resides in – the house that he and his wife own and that is their family home. Although Charlie is absent from New Zealand for the bulk of each year, his absences are solely because of the nature of his job, and there is no question that his home in Auckland continues to be a place he habitually resides, and that it is therefore a permanent place of abode for him. Example 8 132. Facts: Daniel is an engineer who has lived in Napier all of his life. He accepts a 2-year contract working on an oil rig in Malaysia for periods of four weeks at a time. When he takes up the job, Daniel terminates the lease on the flat he has lived in for the last year. Between his stints on the rig, Daniel has two weeks off. He has a periodic lease on an apartment in Malaysia, and for most of his weeks off he stays there. At other times he travels elsewhere, sometimes returning to New Zealand to visit family and friends here. When he is back in New Zealand, Daniel stays at his parents’ house in Napier. Daniel’s wages are paid into his Malaysian bank account, in American dollars. He has no plans to return to New Zealand permanently – his intention is to work and live in Malaysia indefinitely. Daniel’s employer has sponsored his Malaysian work permit and will continue to do so as long as Daniel stays with the company. 133. Result: Daniel does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 25 134. Explanation: Daniel terminated the lease on the flat he lived in before he left New Zealand. Obviously, therefore, it does not continue to be a place he habitually resides from that point. Although Daniel might potentially be able to return to live with his parents when he comes back to New Zealand, the fact that he lived independently from his parents for at least a year prior to leaving New Zealand means that he no longer habitually resided at their house before his departure from New Zealand. The fact that he stays at his parents’ house during some of his time off, when he returns to New Zealand to catch up with friends and family, does not suggest that he habitually resides there. 135. Even if Daniel had recently graduated from his engineering degree before leaving New Zealand, and so had lived with his parents immediately prior to going overseas, his parents’ house would not be his permanent place of abode once he leaves New Zealand. This is because Daniel has not retained sufficient connections with New Zealand for his parents’ house here to remain his permanent place of abode. Although Daniel periodically visits his parents and friends in Napier, he has no other significant ties here, does not intend to return to New Zealand permanently, and intends to work and live in Malaysia indefinitely. Daniel’s employer will continue to sponsor his work permit, which indicates that this intention would seem to be reasonably held. In this scenario, Daniel would have lived with his parents before leaving New Zealand because he was still studying. However, by the time he left New Zealand he would have completed his degree and been financially independent. That, together with the fact that Daniel has no intention to return to New Zealand permanently and intends to work and live in Malaysia indefinitely, indicate that Daniel would no longer be said to habitually reside at his parents’ home. Example 9 136. Facts: Edward, a citizen of the UK, moved to New Zealand with his wife Amelia, a New Zealander, in 1982 and they both had a permanent place of abode here from that time. They married in 1985, and Edward was granted a permanent residence visa. In 1995, the couple and their two children moved to Singapore because of a job opportunity for Edward. In 2000, Edward and Amelia purchased a small lifestyle property just out of Auckland to use as a holiday home. They stayed in the property when they were back in New Zealand for holidays – approximately two to three months a year. Other family members in New Zealand also used the property for holidays. In 2002 Amelia moved back to New Zealand to care for her mother who was terminally ill. Edward and Amelia decided that the children should attend school in New Zealand, so the children moved here in January 2003 and went to a boarding school. Amelia lived in the property that had previously been used as a holiday home, and the children lived there during school holidays. In 2003, Edward came to New Zealand regularly to see Amelia and the children – approximately two and a half months in total. After Amelia’s mother passed away in 2004, Amelia stayed in New Zealand as one of the children had been injured in a car accident. From that point, Edward re- arranged his work commitments so he could come to New Zealand not just for holidays, but more frequently, to support Amelia and the children. From that point Edward spent approximately four months of each year in New Zealand with Amelia and the children. It became clear that the injuries would require long- term treatment, including surgeries and rehabilitation. At that point Edward decided to live in New Zealand all of the time. He did so from 2006, giving up his lease in Singapore and bringing the rest of his personal effects from there to the family home in New Zealand. 137. Result: Edward has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from 2004, when he re-arranged his work commitments so he could come to New Zealand 26 more frequently – from which time he spent approximately four months of each year here. 138. Explanation: Edward had a place of abode in New Zealand from 2000, when he and Amelia purchased the property that they used as a holiday house. However, the house was not Edward’s permanent place of abode at that time, as he did not habitually reside there on a permanent basis, but rather for temporary periods during holidays in New Zealand. The permanent place of abode test needs to be considered on an individual basis. The fact that Amelia and the children moved back to New Zealand in 2002 and 2003, respectively, does not mean that the house here became Edward’s permanent place of abode by virtue of the family living there. This is because Edward continued to live in Singapore, where he had lived since 1995, he did not habitually reside in the New Zealand house on a permanent basis – coming back only for relatively short holidays, and he had no intention to do otherwise at that time. It was after his daughter’s accident, when Edward re-arranged his work commitments so he could come to New Zealand more frequently – spending approximately four months of each year here – that he established a permanent place of abode here. From that point, Edward started habitually residing in the family home more than just temporarily for relatively short holidays, though he continued to also habitually reside in his residence in Singapore. From that point, the nature and quality of the Edward’s use of the property changed. The house here therefore became Edward’s permanent place of abode from that point. The day-count rules 139. In addition to the permanent place of abode test, there are day-count rules in the Act, under which a person can become resident in New Zealand or lose New Zealand tax residence (provided the person does not have a permanent place of abode here). These day-count rules are discussed below. The part-day rule 140. For convenience and simplicity, s YD 1(8) establishes a part-day rule for the purposes of the 183-day and 325-day rules. Section YD 1(8) states: YD 1 Residence of natural persons ... Presence for part-days (8) For the purposes of this section, a person personally present in New Zealand for part of a day is treated as— (a) present in New Zealand for the whole day; and (b) not absent from New Zealand for any part of the day. 141. Therefore, days of arrival in, and departure from, New Zealand are treated as full days of presence in New Zealand for the 183-day and 325-day rules. The 183-day rule Description of the rule 142. Section YD 1(3) provides that a person is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period. Section YD 1(4) then provides that if that is the case, the person is treated as resident from the first of those 183 days, until they are treated as ceasing to be resident under subs (5) (the 325-day rule). Those provisions state: YD 1 Residence of natural persons ... 183 days in New Zealand 27 (3) A person is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period. Person treated as resident from first of 183 days (4) If subsection (3) applies, the person is treated as resident from the first of the 183 days until the person is treated under subsection (5) as ceasing to be a New Zealand resident. Ending residence: 325 days outside New Zealand (5) A person treated as a New Zealand resident only under subsection (3) stops being a New Zealand resident if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period. Person treated as non-resident from first of 325 days (6) The person is treated as not resident from the first of the 325 days until they are treated again as resident under this section. 143. It should be noted that the 183-day rule operates in conjunction with the permanent place of abode test in s YD 1(2). The permanent place of abode test applies despite anything else in s YD 1. Therefore, if a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they will be resident in New Zealand even if they have not been present here for more than 183 days in total in any 12-month period. Because the tests operate in conjunction with one another, a person who has acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand (ie, someone who has moved here from overseas) may have their residence back-dated to a time before that under the 183-day rule and s YD 1(4). This could occur, for example, if the person came to New Zealand for a holiday or job interview prior to moving here, or it could occur because they did not acquire a permanent place of abode immediately upon moving to New Zealand, but some time later. 144. The 183-day rule does not focus on any particular income year, or indeed any particular 12-month period. It does not need to span the date as at which residence is being assessed, and the days of presence do not need to be consecutive. If a person was present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in any 12-month period, that person will be treated as resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of presence until they lose residence. To lose residence they would need to satisfy the 325-day rule (discussed below from \[154\]) and also not have a permanent place of abode here. Examples illustrating the 183-day rule The following examples deal only with the 183-day rule. They do not consider the permanent place of abode test, the 325-day rule, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example 9 1 Oct 2012 1 Mar 2013 18 Sept 2013 18 Apr 2014 152 days in NZ 200 days out of NZ 213 days in NZ 28 145. Facts: Amy arrived in New Zealand on 1 October 2012 and stayed here until 1 March 2013, a total of 152 days of presence in New Zealand. Amy was then absent from New Zealand for 200 days. She then returned to New Zealand on 18 September 2013, and stayed here for a further seven months. It is assumed that Amy was resident outside New Zealand prior to 1 October 2012 and that she has never previously been resident in New Zealand. 146. Result: Amy is resident in New Zealand from 18 September 2013. 147. Explanation: Amy was not personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period commencing prior to 18 September 2013. Because of her absence between 2 March 2013 and 17 September 2013, Amy was only in New Zealand for 165 days in the 12-month period commencing on 1 October 2012 (152 days from 1 October 2012 to 1 March 2013 plus 13 days from 18 September 2013 to 30 September 2013). 148. However, Amy was present in New Zealand for seven months (213 days), in the 12-month period commencing on 18 September 2013. Therefore, Amy is resident from the first day of presence in that period (ie, from 18 September 2013). Amy will continue to be resident in New Zealand until she ceases to be resident under the 325-day rule (assuming she has no permanent place of abode here). Example 10 149. Facts: Ben arrived in New Zealand on 1 June 2012 and stayed here until 20 June 2012, a total of 20 days. Ben returned to New Zealand on 1 August 2012 and stayed here until 17 January 2013, a total of 170 days. It is assumed that Ben was not resident in New Zealand prior to 1 June 2012. 150. Result: Ben is resident in New Zealand from 1 June 2012. 151. Explanation: Ben was personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days (ie, 190 days), during the 12-month period commencing on 1 June 2012. Ben will continue to be resident in New Zealand until he ceases to be resident under the 325-day rule (assuming he has no permanent place of abode here). Non-resident seasonal workers 152. Despite the 183-day rule, a person who is a “non-resident seasonal worker” is treated as non-resident during the time that they are employed under the recognised seasonal employment scheme (s YD 1(11)). The recognised seasonal employer policy is published by the Department of Labour under s 13A of the Immigration Act 1987 (see: http://www.dol.govt.nz/initiatives/strategy/rse). 153. The non-resident seasonal worker rule does not override the permanent place of abode test, so in the event that a non-resident seasonal had or acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand they would be resident here. 20 Jun 2012 1 Jun 2012 1 Aug 2012 17 Jan 2013 20 days in NZ 170 days in NZ Out of NZ 29 The 325-day rule Description of the rule 154. Section YD 1(5) provides that a person who is resident only under the 183-day rule (ie, they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand) stops being resident here if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period. Section YD 1(6) then provides that the person will be treated as non-resident from the first of those 325 days. 155. The 325-day rule is satisfied if a person is absent from New Zealand for 325 days or more in total in any 12-month period; it does not relate to income years. The days of absence do not need to be consecutive. 156. The 325-day rule only applies to make someone non-resident if they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. If someone has a permanent place of abode here, they will remain resident even if they are absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period. 157. A person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days and who does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand immediately prior to their departure will have their non-residence back-dated to the first day of the period of absence. However, a person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days and who has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at the time of their departure will only have their non-residence back-dated to the day after the day they lose their permanent place of abode in New Zealand. In this situation it is not necessary to commence the day counting again after the person loses their permanent place of abode. If the person is absent for, say, 100 days before losing their permanent place of abode, those 100 days will be taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule. When the person is finally absent for more than 325 days they will cease to be resident from day 101 (ie, the day after the day on which they lost their New Zealand permanent place of abode). 158. The combined effect of the 325-day rule and the permanent place of abode test is that after 325 days of absence from New Zealand in a 12-month period, a person ceases to be resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of absence on which they do not have a permanent place of abode here. Once a person ceases to be resident, they will remain non-resident until they either acquire a permanent place of abode here or satisfy the 183-day rule. Examples illustrating the 325-day rule The following examples deal only with the 325-day rule. They do not consider the permanent place of abode test, the 183-day rule, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example 11 1 May 2013 1 Aug 2013 30 Apr 2014 20 Aug 2013 1 Feb 2014 16 Feb 2014 164 days out of NZ 16 days in NZ 72 days out of NZ 91 days out of NZ 20 days in NZ 30 159. Facts: Jeremy left New Zealand on 1 May 2013 and returned again on 1 August 2013, a total of 91 days of absence. Jeremy stayed in New Zealand until 20 August 2013, a total of 20 days of presence. Jeremy remained absent until 1 February 2014, a total of 164 days. Jeremy stayed in New Zealand from 1 February 2014 until 16 February 2014, a total of 16 days. After leaving again on 16 February 2014, Jeremy returned to New Zealand on 30 April 2014, after a period of absence of 72 days. It is assumed that Jeremy does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand and that Jeremy was resident in New Zealand prior to his departure on 1 May 2013 by virtue of the 183-day rule. 160. Result: Jeremy is non-resident from 2 May 2013. 161. Explanation: Jeremy was absent for 327 days in total in the 12-month period commencing on 1 May 2013 (91 days commencing on 2 May 2013 and ending on 31 July 2013, 164 days commencing on 21 August 2013 and ending on 31 January 2014, and 72 days commencing on 17 February 2014 and ending on 29 April 2014). Jeremy is therefore non-resident from the first day of absence in that period (ie, 2 May 2013). Jeremy will remain non-resident until he acquires a permanent place of abode here or until he is present here for more than 183 days in any period of 12 months. Example 12 162. Facts: Claire leaves New Zealand on 1 April 2014 and returns on 1 August 2015. Claire has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at all times during this period; she owns a house here, has strong economic and personal ties with New Zealand, and remains in the employment of her New Zealand employer. 163. Result: Claire remains resident in New Zealand at all times during her absence. 164. Explanation: Although Claire is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days (ie, 365 days) in the 12-month period commencing on 2 April 2014, she remains resident here because she has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at all times during her absence. Example 13 165. Facts: James was seconded to the Australian office of his employer for six months, and left New Zealand on 1 May 2014. James had always lived in New Zealand (with his parents), had a boyfriend here, and intended to return after the six-month period. James left most of his personal property, including his car, with his parents. After he had been in Australia for three months, James was offered a permanent job there, which he accepted. James stayed in Australia, and arranged to have his personal property transported to Australia and his New Zealand bank accounts closed. James asked his parents to sell his car, and he ended his relationship with his boyfriend. James intends to remain in Australia indefinitely. 166. Result: James los t his New Zealand permanent place of abode on 1 August 2014, when he resigned from his substantive position in New Zealand and accepted the permanent job in Australia. Although it was in the following weeks that James made arrangements to have his property transported to Australia, closed his New Zealand bank accounts, and ended his relationship, the decision to resign from his position in New Zealand and accept the permanent position in Australia is the time from which it is apparent that James had formed the intention to remain in Australia indefinitely. Accordingly, James ceased to be resident in New Zealand from this time. 31 167. Explanation: James was personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in the 12-month period commencing on 2 May 2014. 168. However, James did not lose his New Zealand permanent place of abode when he originally departed on 1 May 2014 because he had a place of abode available to him (his parents’ house, where he had lived prior to his departure), he retained close personal and employment ties with New Zealand, and he intended to return after a brief period of absence. James lost his New Zealand permanent place of abode on 1 August 2014 when he resigned from his job in New Zealand and accepted the job in Australia, from which point he had decided to stay there indefinitely. 169. Although James was absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12- month period commencing on 2 May 2014, he did not cease to be resident in New Zealand until 1 August 2014 when he lost his New Zealand permanent place of abode. Relationship between the permanent place of abode test and the day-count rules Overlap of the rules 170. As noted above, if a person is personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period they are resident here, and treated as such from the first of those days of presence. The person then remains resident until they cease to be resident under the 325-day rule. The combined effect of the 325-day rule and the permanent place of abode test is that a person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in any 12-month period is treated as non-resident from the first of those days of absence, or from the first day during the period of absence on which they no longer have a permanent place of abode here, whichever is later. 171. The effect of the back-dating of both the 183-day and 325-day rules means that where a person has travelled in and out of New Zealand there may be an overlap between those rules. This is because a person who is resident under the 183-day rule may have been temporarily absent from New Zealand at some time before the 183-day rule was satisfied. If the person then satisfies the 325-day rule, they will cease to be resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of absence (assuming they have no permanent place of abode in New Zealand), even though that day falls before the final day which is taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule. In this situation the period of absence taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule overlaps with the period of presence taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule. This may result in the person being treated as a New Zealand resident for a period of less than 183 days, even though they were present here for more than 183 days in a 12- month period. 172. The two rules may also overlap in the converse situation. A person who ceases to be resident under the 325-day rule may have been temporarily present in New Zealand at some time before the 325-day rule was satisfied. If the person then satisfies the 183-day rule by being present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period, the person will become resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of presence, even though that day falls before the final day which is taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule. This may result in the person being treated as non-resident for a period of less than 325 days even though they were absent for more than 325 days in a 12-month period. 173. Where there is an overlap between a period taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule and a period taken into account for the purposes of the 325- day rule, the later period operates to confer residence or non-residence, respectively, from the first day of that period. 32 Examples illustrating the relationship between the 183-day and 325-day rules The following examples deal only with the relationship between the 183-day and 325- day rules. They do not consider the permanent place of abode test, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example 14 174. Facts: Henry left New Zealand on 1 May 2013 and returned on 1 January 2014, after 244 days of absence. Henry left New Zealand again on 1 February 2014 after 32 days of presence here. Henry returned on 28 April 2014, after 85 days of absence, and remained in New Zealand from that point onwards. It is assumed that Henry did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand until after he returned on 28 April 2014. It is also assumed that Henry was resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule prior to his departure on 1 May 2013. 175. Result: Henry is treated as non-resident from 2 May 2013 until 31 December 2013. Henry is treated as resident in New Zealand again from 1 January 2014. 176. Explanation: Henry was personally absent from New Zealand for 329 days in total in the 12-month period commencing on 2 May 2013 (ie , for 244 days from 2 May 2013 to 31 December 2013, and for 85 days from 2 February 2014 to 27 April 2014). Henry is therefore treated as non-resident in New Zealand from the first day of absence, ie, 2 May 2013. 177. Henry was personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in the 12- month period commencing on 1 January 2014 (ie, for 32 days from 1 January 2014 to 1 February 2014, and 248 days from 28 April 2014 to 31 December 2014 – a total of 280 days). Henry is therefore treated as resident from the first of those days of presence, ie, 1 January 2014. 178. The period taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule cuts into the period taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule. Therefore, Henry is only treated as non-resident from the commencement of the period of absence (ie , 2 May 2013) until the day before the beginning of the period taken into account for the purposes of the 183 -day rule (ie, 31 December 2014). 1 May 2013 1 Jan 2014 1 Feb 2014 28 Apr 2014 244 days out of NZ 32 days in NZ 85 days out of NZ 33 Example 15 179. Facts: Belinda arrived in New Zealand on 1 November 2012 and stayed here for 150 days, until 30 March 2013. Belinda left New Zealand on 30 March 2013 and returned on 5 May 2013, a period of absence of 35 days (ie, from 31 March 2013 to 4 May 2013). Belinda was present in New Zealand from 5 May 2013 to 11 June 2013, a total of 38 days. Belinda left the country again on 12 June 2013 and has remained outside New Zealand since that time. It is assumed that Belinda was resident outside New Zealand before she arrived on 1 November 2012, and that she did not at any time have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 180. Result: Belinda is treated as resident in New Zealand from 1 November 2012 to 30 March 2013. Belinda is treated as non-resident from 31 March 2013. 181. Explanation: Belinda was present in New Zealand for 188 days in the 12-month period commencing on 1 November 2012 (ie , for 150 days from 1 November 2012 to 30 March 2013, and for 38 days from 5 May 2013 to 11 June 2013). Belinda is treated as resident from the first of those days of presence, ie, 1 November 2012. 182. Belinda was absent from New Zealand for 327 days in the 12-month period commencing on 31 March 2013 (ie, for 35 days from 31 March 2013 until 4 May 2013, and for 292 days from 12 June 2013 to 30 March 2014). Belinda is treated as non-resident from the first of those days of absence, ie, 31 March 2013. 183. The period taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule cuts into the period taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule. As a result, Belinda is only treated as resident from the commencement of the period of presence (ie, 1 November 2012) until the day before the beginning of the period taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule (ie, 30 March 2013). Government service rule 184. There is a special residence rule for people absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government (s YD 1(7)). This rule provides that any person who is absent from New Zealand in the service, in any capacity, of the government of New Zealand is treated as a New Zealand resident during the period of absence. 185. Section s YD 1(7) states: Government servants (7) Despite subsection (5), a person who is personally absent from New Zealand in the service, in any capacity, of the New Zealand Government is treated as a New Zealand resident during the absence. 1 Nov 2012 30 Mar 2013 5 May 2013 11 Jun 2013 150 days in NZ 35 days out of NZ 38 days in NZ 34 186. Section YD 1(7) overrides the 325-day rule. Therefore, a person absent from New Zealand in the service of the government is resident here irrespective of the length of their absence from New Zealand or whether they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The provision applies while they remain in that service. 187. The purpose of s YD 1(7) is for New Zealand to retain the taxing rights to the income of people absent from New Zealand but who remain closely connected to New Zealand because they are representatives and servants of the New Zealand government abroad. The section is consistent with the longstanding tax treaty practice of countries retaining exclusive rights to tax the personal services-type income of their government representatives and servants abroad. This treaty practice conforms to the rules of international courtesy and mutual respect between countries, and is also consistent with the provisions of the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations. 6 This international approach to taxing government servants explains the reason for s YD 1(7), as without the provision the employment income of New Zealand government servants abroad may not be taxed at all. 188. For the government service rule in s YD 1(7) to apply the person needs to be “personally absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government”. To meet this requirement, the Commissioner considers the person must have been present in New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government before their departure. Further, based on the wording of s YD 1(7), and taking into account the purpose of the rule, the Commissioner considers that being in the service of the New Zealand government should be the reason for the person departing from New Zealand. For example, s YD 1(7) will apply to an existing government employee being sent from New Zealand to pursue their duties for the New Zealand government abroad, or a government employee departing from New Zealand to undertake study overseas for their government department. This is because there is a sufficient connection between the person’s absence from New Zealand and their service to the New Zealand government. 189. In the Commissioner’s view, the government service rule in s YD 1(7) does not apply to treat people as New Zealand residents if they accept “local office” positions with the New Zealand government when they are abroad. For example, a person who is living in Paris and is recruited by the New Zealand embassy in Paris would not be treated as a New Zealand resident under s YD 1(7). It also does not apply if a person leaves New Zealand to take up a “local office” New Zealand government position overseas but they are not already in the service of the New Zealand government when they leave. 190. Employees of government departments (or their departmental agencies), and members of the New Zealand Defence Force and New Zealand Police, who are posted overseas from New Zealand will be considered to be absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. This includes government servants who are pursuing studies overseas for the New Zealand government. 191. Employees of State-owned enterprises and contractors to the New Zealand government are not considered to be in the service of the New Zealand government as they are not so closely connected to the New Zealand government. They are not treated as New Zealand residents under s YD 1(7). 192. Employees of other public bodies will be subject to s YD 1(7) if their employing body is so closely controlled by the Government that it is an agent or instrument 6 The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 500 UNTS 95 (opened for signature 18 April 1961, ratified by New Zealand on 23 September 1970) and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 596 UNTS 261 (opened for signature 24 April 1963, signed by New Zealand on 10 September 1974). 35 of the New Zealand government. Control is measured by how much independence and discretion the body can insist on, not by how much control is actually enjoyed by the body. When the nature and degree of control exercised by the government is uncertain, or a public body has a substantial measure of independent discretion, the courts have indicated a reluctance to recognise the public body as an agent of the government. 193. Most public bodies listed as government agents in the Crown Entities Act 2004 are sufficiently controlled by the government to satisfy the common law test of control, and will therefore be agents of the government. Similarly, wholly owned subsidiaries of those government agents will also likely be sufficiently controlled to satisfy the test. This means employees of those bodies will probably be considered to be in the service of the New Zealand government. However, decisions need to be made on a body-by-body basis, taking into account the particular facts and governing rules for each body. 194. Bodies such as autonomous government entities, independent government entities, school boards of trustees and tertiary education institutions will most likely be too independent and enjoy too much discretion to be agents of the government. This means that employees of these bodies will not be in the service of the New Zealand government. 195. If a person ceases to be in the service of the New Zealand government while overseas, they will be non-resident from the date they cease their service, provided that they have satisfied the 325-day rule and do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 196. Section YD 1(7) does not apply to a spouse/partner or child accompanying someone in the service of the government on overseas postings. Their residence status needs to be determined independently under s YD 1. 197. Some DTAs that New Zealand is a party to have a specific article that allocates taxing rights in relation to remuneration for services rendered by government servants. Accordingly, when a person who is treated as a New Zealand resident under s YD 1(7) is serving in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, the provisions of that DTA need to be considered. Examples illustrating the government service rule The following examples deal only with the government service rule. They do not consider the permanent place of abode test or any DTA implications. Example 16 198. Facts: Aroha is an employee of a government department, living and working in Wellington. The government department needs Aroha to work overseas for four years. She will continue to be employed and paid by the government department during her absence. Aroha’s husband and children will accompany her overseas. 199. Result: Aroha is treated as a New Zealand resident under s YD 1(7), and will continue to be for as long as she is absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. Aroha’s husband and children are not absent on government service so s YD 1(7) does not apply to them. 200. Explanation: Section YD 1(7) provides that despite the 325-day rule, a person who is absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government is treated as a New Zealand resident during the absence. 36 201. Aroha is absent from New Zealand in the service of the government. The reason for Aroha’s absence from New Zealand is to carry out her duties for the government department that she works for. As such, she is treated as a New Zealand resident under s YD 1(7), and will continue to be for as long as she is absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand government. 202. Each person’s tax residence needs to be determined individually. Aroha’s husband and children are not absent on government service so s YD 1(7) does not apply to them. Example 17 203. Facts: Justine, a New Zealand expatriate, has been living and working in London for five years for an American bank. Justine is non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes. She hears that a New Zealand government department is looking for a person to work in its London office. She applies for the position and is successful. 204. Result: Justine will not become a New Zealand resident merely because she has started working for the New Zealand government in London. 205. Explanation: Justine is not absent from New Zealand in order to carry out her duties for the New Zealand government. She had been living away from New Zealand prior to her appointment to the position; the performance of her duties was not the reason for her absence from New Zealand. Transitional resident rules 206. New migrants and returning New Zealanders may be transitional residents under s HR 8(2). If a person is a transitional resident they are entitled to tax exemptions for certain income. 207. Under s HR 8(2), a person will be a transitional resident if:  they are a New Zealand resident through acquiring a permanent place of abode here, or through the 183-day rule;  for a continuous period of at least 10 years immediately before acquiring a permanent place of abode or satisfying the 183-day rule (ignoring the rule in s YD 1(4)) they did not meet those requirements, and were not resident in New Zealand;  they have not previously been a transitional resident; and  they have not ceased to be a transitional resident. 208. A person meeting the requirements for transitional residence will be a transitional resident (unless they elect not to be) from the first day that they are tax resident in New Zealand (under either the permanent place of abode test or the 183-day rule). If the person becomes a New Zealand tax resident under the 183-day rule, their tax residence will be back-dated under s YD 1(4) to the first of the 183 days of presence in New Zealand, and their transitional residence will start from that date. They will remain a transitional resident until the earliest of the following:  the end of the 48 th month after the month in which they acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or satisfied the 183-day rule (ignoring the back-dating rule in s YD 1(4)), whichever is earlier,  the day before they stop being a New Zealand resident, or  the date on which they stop being a transitional resident because they elect not to be one (under s HR 8(4) or (5)). 209. The transitional resident rules provide a temporary tax exemption (s CW 27) for all foreign-sourced income except for: 37  employment income in connection with employment or service performed while the person is a transitional resident; and  income from a supply of services. 210. The transitional resident rules also ensure that other provisions in the Act apply to produce a result for income tax purposes that is the same as if the transitional resident were non-resident (for example the CFC rules, the FIF rules, the financial arrangements (FA) rules, the trust rules and the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules) (see s HR 8(1)). 211. Transitional residents and the spouses/partners of transitional residents are not entitled to working for families tax credits under the family scheme (ss MC 5, MD 7, and HR 8(5)). 212. The transitional resident rules apply to people who satisfy the requirements to be a transitional resident on or after 1 April 2006, for the 2005-06 and subsequent income years. 213. For further information about the transitional resident rules, and examples of how they apply, see “Temporary exemption from tax on foreign income for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) at 103, and “Temporary exemption for transitional residents” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) at 83. 214. However, it is noted that those TIB items are not accurate in two respects. Firstly, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) states that the period of transitional residence starts on the first day of the month in which the person migrates to New Zealand. However, as noted in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) and discussed above, the starting point for transitional residence is aligned with the start of a person’s tax residence in New Zealand (including when the period of tax residence is back-dated under s YD 1(4) – for example where a person has visited New Zealand prior to moving here). 215. Secondly, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) states that transitional residence lasts for 48 months after migration . However, as noted at \[208\], it in fact lasts till the end of the 48 th month after the month in which the person acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand (which will not necessarily be at the time of migration here) or satisfied the 183-day rule. To the extent that the TIB items on transitional residence suggest otherwise, they should not be relied on. Example illustrating the transitional resident rules The following example deals only with the transitional resident rules. It does not consider the 183-day and 325-day rules, the permanent place of abode test, or any DTA implications. Though the application of the 183-day rule is not considered in the example, it is referred to in the explanation. This is because it is necessary to know the time from which a person becomes tax resident in New Zealand, and whether they satisfied the 183-day rule or the permanent place of abode test first, in order to establish the period during which the person will be a transitional resident. 38 Example 18 \[This example is taken from “Temporary exemption for transitional residents” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007), though it has undergone some minor editing and the explanation for the result is slightly expanded.\] 216. Facts: Robert visited New Zealand on 1 February 2011 for a job interview. On 15 May 2011 he relocated here permanently and acquired a permanent place of abode at that time. On 29 October 2011 he satisfied the 183-day rule and was deemed to be tax resident in New Zealand from 1 February 2011 because of the back-dating rule in s YD 1(4). He has never been tax resident in New Zealand before, and has not elected not to be a transitional resident. 217. Result: Robert would qualify for transitional residence. His status as a transitional resident would run from 1 February 2011 to 31 May 2015, provided he remains resident here and does not make an election not to be a transitional resident. 218. Explanation: Robert is resident in New Zealand from 1 February 2011, under the 183-day rule and s YD 1(4). Robert has never been a tax resident or transitional resident in New Zealand before, and he has not elected to not be a transitional resident. He therefore satisfies the requirements of s HR 8(2). 219. Although Robert is treated as tax resident in New Zealand from 1 February 2011 (because of the back-dating rule in s YD 1(4)), he did not meet the requirements of either s YD 1(2) or (3) (ignoring the back-dating rule) for being a resident until 15 May 2011, when he moved here and acquired a permanent place of abode here. Robert acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand before he satisfied the 183-day rule. His status as a transitional resident would therefore run from 1 February 2011 (the date from which Robert is tax resident in New Zealand) to 31 May 2015 (the end of the 48 th month after the month in which he acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand). 1 Feb 2011 31 May 2015 29 Oct 2011 15 May 2011 Resident under the 183-day rule from this date (because of the back-dating rule). Moved to NZ and acquired a PPA here. Satisfied the 183-day rule. Transitional resident Robert’s transitional resident status starts from the first day of his NZ tax residence (1 Feb 2011). It ends at the end of the 48 th month after the month in which he satisfied either the PPA test or 183-day rule (whichever is earlier). Robert satisfied the PPA test before he satisfied the 183-day rule, so his transitional resident status runs until the end of the 48 th month after May 2011 (the month he acquired a PPA). 39 Changes in residence 220. The residence of a person may change during an income year if:  the person acquires a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during the year,  the first day of more than 183 days of presence in New Zealand in any 12- month period falls within the year,  the person ceases to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, or  the first day of more than 325 days of absence from New Zealand in any 12-month period falls within the year. 221. Some of the more significant income tax considerations that may be relevant when the residence status of a person changes during an income year are set out below. A change in residence may also have implications for the application of a DTA. Further, if a person is a settlor or beneficiary of a trust and their residence status changes there may be tax implications – see from \[438\]. (a) Taxation of foreign-sourced income 222. If the person derived income from sources outside New Zealand during the income year, that income will (subject to the transitional resident rules) be assessable income for New Zealand tax purposes if it was derived while the person was resident here (s BD 1(5)). Therefore, where a person’s residence status changes during an income year, the amount of any foreign-sourced income derived by the person while they were resident in New Zealand must be determined. To do so, the total foreign-sourced income derived will need to be reasonably apportioned to the periods of residence and non-residence. (b ) Foreign dividend payments \[applicable up until 31 March 2013\] 223. If the person derived dividends from a New Zealand resident company that has elected under s OC 1 to be a foreign dividend payment account company, any foreign dividend payment (FDP) credits attached to dividends derived by the person are creditable, whether or not the person was resident when the dividends were derived. If the dividends were derived while the person was non-resident, the FDP credits can be credited against any non-resident withholding tax liability in respect of the dividend. Any excess credits are creditable against any other tax liability of the person to the extent of that liability, with any further excess credits being refundable. (c ) The financial arrangements rules 224. The financial arrangements rules are a timing regime that spreads income and expenditure under a financial arrangement over the term of the arrangement. If a person becomes a New Zealand resident during an income year and is a party to a financial arrangement, they may become subject to the financial arrangements rules. Where this is the case, they are treated as having assumed the accrued obligation to pay consideration under the financial arrangement immediately after the time at which they became resident, and as having paid the market value that a contract to assume the obligation had at that time (s EW 37(2)). The deemed acquisition price will then be taken into account in any subsequent base price adjustment required under s EW 29. To the extent that the exemption from the financial arrangements rules for non-residents (s EW 9) previously applied, that exemption will cease to apply when the person becomes resident. 225. If the person ceases to be a New Zealand resident during an income year and is a party to a financial arrangement, they must calculate a base price adjustment for 40 the financial arrangement as at the date of ceasing to be resident (s EW 29). If the base price adjustment is positive, it will be income derived by the person in the year for which the calculation is made (s EW 31(3)). If the base price adjustment is negative, it will be expenditure incurred by the person in the year for which the calculation is made, and a deduction may be allowed for that expenditure under s DB 6, s DB 7, s DB 8 or s DB 11 (s EW 31(4)). An exception exists if the person is a cash basis person and they cease to be a New Zealand resident before the first day of the fourth income year following the income year in which they first became a New Zealand resident. In that case, they do not need to calculate a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement that they were a party to both before becoming and after ceasing to be a New Zealand resident (s EW 30(1)). 226. A financial arrangement will be an excepted financial arrangement for a transitional resident if no other party is a New Zealand resident and the financial arrangement is not for a purpose of a business carried on in New Zealand by a party to the arrangement (s EW 5(17)). (d ) Provisional tax 227. If the person ceases to be a New Zealand resident during the income year, they may cease to be a provisional taxpayer for the purposes of the provisional tax rules (being the provisions listed in s RC 2). Conversely, if the person becomes a New Zealand resident during the income year, they may become a provisional taxpayer and liable to pay provisional tax in accordance with the provisional tax rules regime (s RC 3). Relevance of double taxation agreements 228. New Zealand is party to DTAs with a number of countries. Where someone is tax resident in both New Zealand and a country with which we have a DTA, the DTA will determine what taxing rights each country has. 229. For a list of countries that New Zealand has DTAs with see http://www.ird.govt.nz/international/residency/dta/. Dual residence 230. Dual residence occurs when an individual is resident in two countries under the laws of each of those countries. This can easily arise, as different countries have different tests of residence, or they may use more than one residence test. One situation where dual residence is likely to arise in practice is where one country has a personal presence test and another relies on more permanent connections focusing on other factors, such as the location of a person’s home or their domicile. For example, if country A deems a person resident after they have been present there for 183 days, and country B employs a test based on other factors, a person normally resident in country B who is present in country A for a six-month period may be resident in both countries. Consequently, if both countries tax on a worldwide basis an element of double taxation may occur. 231. The New Zealand residence rules for individuals are intended to make it relatively easy to become resident here, and more difficult to lose residence. As such, dual residence may occur quite easily in the New Zealand context. Individuals who become resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule may also be resident in another country under a test based on other factors, such as domicile. Conversely, individuals leaving New Zealand may remain resident here under the permanent place of abode test, while at the same time becoming resident in another country under a personal presence rule. 41 232. Where there is a DTA between New Zealand and another country, dual residence issues will be resolved by application of the residence article in the DTA. The object of that article is to ensure that taxpayers are precluded from having dual residence for DTA purposes. Where a taxpayer is resident under the domestic laws of New Zealand and the treaty partner, dual residence is avoided for the purposes of the DTA by applying a series of “tie-breaker” tests to allocate residence to one of the countries. Once residence has been allocated in this manner, the tax liability of the person, in relation to the items covered by the DTA, is determined on the basis of that residence status. Section BH 1(4) states: Overriding effect (4) Despite anything in this Act, except subsection (5), or in any other Inland Revenue Act or the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993, a double tax agreement has effect in relation to— (a) income tax: (b) any other tax imposed by this Act: (c) the exchange of information that relates to a tax, as defined in paragraphs (a)(i) to (v) of the definition of tax in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 233. The Court of Appeal in CIR v ER Squibb & Sons (NZ) Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,146 at 9,154 said this means that “wherever and to the extent that there is any difference between the domestic legislation and the double tax agreement provision, the agreement has overriding effect”. This means that the domestic legislation must be read together with the relevant DTA articles. 234. When a person who is tax resident in New Zealand under domestic law is deemed to be resident in another country for the purposes of a DTA, the person remains liable to New Zealand income tax on their worldwide income on the basis of their residence here. However, the liability is modified by any restrictions imposed by the DTA on New Zealand’s right to tax persons who are deemed to be resident in the other country for the purposes of the DTA. For example, if the person receives dividends from a New Zealand resident company, the dividend resident withholding tax (RWT) would be calculated on the basis of the normal rate, but would be subject to the limitation imposed by the DTA on New Zealand’s right to tax dividends derived by someone deemed to be resident of the DTA partner for DTA purposes. In most cases, the amount of tax that could be levied in New Zealand could not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividend. 235. It is emphasised that the DTA residence articles are only relevant for the purposes of the DTAs. Someone who is resident in two countries under the domestic tax laws of those countries remains resident in both countries for other tax purposes – for example, goods and services tax. Residence article 236. The residence article in many of New Zealand’s DTAs closely follows the residence article contained in the OECD’s Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (the OECD Model Convention). The residence article (art 4) of the OECD Model Convention, as it relates to individuals, provides: 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or capital situated therein. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows: a) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be 42 deemed to be a resident only of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); b) if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has an habitual abode; c) if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which he is a national; d) if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 237. As can be seen, the article applies when a person is a resident of both countries (Contracting States) under para \[1\]. This does not include any person who is liable to tax in a State in respect only of income from sources in that State. When the article applies, the person’s residence status for the purposes of the Convention is determined by applying a series of “tie-breaker” tests. The “tie- breaker” tests in the relevant DTA are applied in order, until residence can be determined under one of them. 238. The DTA residence “tie-breaker” tests only potentially apply where the person concerned is resident of both countries under para \[1\] of art 4. Therefore, if a person comes to New Zealand from, say, Canada, becomes resident in New Zealand and ceases to be resident in Canada (and thus ceases to be liable to tax in Canada by reason of any of the listed criterion or similar criterion), it is clear that the person is resident in New Zealand for both the purposes of the Act and the DTA with Canada. The residence allocation rules will not be relevant in these circumstances because the person would not be a resident of Canada under para \[1\] of art 4. The DTA will still be relevant in terms of allocating taxing rights for any Canadian-sourced income. Interpretation of terms used in the residence article 239. The terms “permanent home”, “personal and economic relations” (or “centre of vital interests”) and “habitual abode” are not defined in any of New Zealand’s DTAs. 240. The “ general definitions” article of New Zealand’s DTAs typically provides that in applying the DTA, “unless the context otherwise requires”, any term not defined in the DTA has the meaning which it has under the laws of that State relating to the taxes to which the DTA applies. 241. The OECD commentary on art 3 (the “General definitions” article) of the OECD Model Convention states that the paragraph of the article concerning undefined terms was amended in 1995 to conform more closely to the general understanding of member States. The commentary notes that for the purposes of this paragraph of the article, the meaning of any undefined term may be ascertained by reference to the meaning it has for the purposes of any relevant provision of the domestic law (whether a tax law or not) of a Contracting State. This means that the meaning of an undefined term in a DTA may be ascertained by reference to domestic laws generally, not just tax laws (though any tax law meaning will prevail). 242. But, as noted, reference to any meaning that those terms may have under domestic law is only relevant if the context does not require otherwise. One of the general rules of treaty interpretation in art 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 7 which New Zealand has ratified, is that a special meaning 7 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1155 UNTS 331 (opened for signature 23 May 1969, ratified by New Zealand on 4 August 1971). 43 shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended (para \[4\] of art 31). 243. If a DTA between New Zealand and another country uses the wording of a particular article in the OECD Model Convention (or very similar wording), the Commissioner considers that it can be inferred that the OECD commentary on that article reflects the meaning the parties intended to be given to any undefined terms in that article. The Commissioner considers that in such circumstances the OECD commentary will be a significant aid to interpreting the relevant undefined terms. In such a case, the Commissioner considers that the context requires that the undefined term not simply be regarded as having the meaning (if any) that it has under domestic law – which is the default position under the “general definitions” article. 244. The OECD commentary on the residence article gives guidance on the meanings to be given to the above undefined terms (“permanent home”, “personal and economic relations” (or “centre of vital interests”) and “habitual abode”). New Zealand’s DTAs generally follow, or closely follow, the wording in the OECD Model Convention. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the OECD commentary on those terms will be a significant aid to interpreting their meaning, and any case law (New Zealand or foreign) that considers the meaning of the undefined term in a DTA context should also be considered. Permanent home test 245. The first test in the residence articles in New Zealand’s DTAs gives preference to the country in which the person “has a permanent home available to \[them\]”. There are three elements to the test: there must be a home, it must be permanent, and it must be available for use. 246. It is evident from the OECD commentary that the concept of “home” is used in its physical sense (the commentary states that any form of home may be taken into account – ie, a house, apartment, rented or furnished room). 247. The OECD commentary states that for a home to be permanent “the individual must have arranged and retained it for his permanent use as opposed to staying at a particular place under such conditions that it is evident that the stay is intended to be of short duration” (OECD commentary on art 4 at \[12\]). The test is therefore an objective one, and it is necessary to consider the conditions under which the person retained the home and then conclude from that whether the home has the quality of permanence. 248. The OECD commentary on art 4 of the OECD Model Convention emphasises that the permanence of the home is essential, and states that this means that “the person has arranged to have the dwelling available to him at all times continuously, and not occasionally for the purposes of a stay which, owing to the reasons for it, is necessarily of short duration” (OECD commentary on art 4 at \[13\]). The OECD commentary gives as examples travel for pleasure, business travel, educational travel, attending a course at a school, etc. 249. The home must be available for the person’s use. Availability in this context is not based on mere occupation, or immediate availability for occupation. “Available” is a broad term that includes several concepts including factual availability and legal availability (ie, legal rights and controls over the property). Determining whether a home is available involves assessing factors such as whether: 8  the home is capable of being used by the person; 8 See Case 12/2011 \[2011\] NZTRA 08, (2011) 25 NZTC 1-012 and Case J41. 44  the person has the right to determine occupancy and possession of the property;  the person has the power to dispose of the property. 250. Applying these factors, the Commissioner considers that when a home is let out on an arm’s length basis to an unassociated person it will generally be unavailable to the landlord as a permanent home. As a result, the Commissioner considers a house that is let under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (including one let on a periodic tenancy) will generally be unavailable to the landlord as a permanent home. If the house is let to an associated person or friend it might still be available to the owner as a permanent home. 251. The Commissioner is of the view that owning or personally renting accommodation is not fundamental to a person having a permanent home available to them. For example, a person may have a permanent home where accommodation is owned or leased by an employer, spouse/partner, company or trust (not controlled by the person), or where the person is able to live somewhere rent-free. If a person owns or personally rents a home that will be a relevant consideration, but if a home is arranged or retained in some other way (by or through a third party, for example) this will not of itself be determinative of whether the person has a permanent home. This is consistent with the view expressed in G A Harris, New Zealand’s International Taxation, Auckland, OUP, 1990. To the extent that Case 12/2011 may arguably suggest otherwise, the Commissioner does not agree. 252. If it is apparent that a person who is dual resident has a permanent home available in one country or jurisdiction that will be an end to the matter unless the person can establish that they also have a permanent home available in the other country or jurisdiction. Where a person has a permanent home available in both countries, the next test will generally be the personal and economic relations test. \[The DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia, signed on 19 March 1976, differs in that if residence cannot be resolved under the permanent home test, the next test is the habitual abode test, followed by the personal and economic relations test.\] 253. Where a person does not have a permanent home available to them in either country, the next test for consideration will generally be the habitual abode test. However, this is not the case under New Zealand’s DTAs with Australia, 9 Thailand, 10 the Republic of South Africa, 11 the United Arab Emirates, 12 Spain 13 and Papua New Guinea. 14 Under those DTAs where a person does not have a permanent home available to them in either country the next test is the personal and economic relations test, followed by the habitual abode test. Personal and economic relations (centre of vital interests) test 254. Generally the next test in the residence articles in New Zealand’s DTAs gives preference to the country “with which \[the person’s\] personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests)”. 255. In applying this test, the person’s personal and economic relations with both New Zealand and the other country must be considered, and the country with which these relations are closer (or in other words, their centre of vital interests) must be determined. The OECD commentary on art 4 of the OECD Model Convention 9 Signed on 26 June 2009. 10 Signed on 22 October 1998. 11 Signed on 6 February 2002. 12 Signed on 22 September 2003. 13 Signed on 28 July 2005. 14 Signed on 29 October 2012. 45 indicates that the following types of factors may be taken into account in applying the test (at \[15\]): ... regard will be had to his family and social relations, his occupations, his political, cultural or other activities, his place of business, the place from which he administers his property, etc. The circumstances must be examined as a whole, but it is nevertheless obvious that considerations based on the personal acts of the individual must receive special attention. If a person who has a home in one State sets up a second in the other State while retaining the first, the fact that he retains the first in the environment where he has always lived, where he has worked, and where he has his family and possessions, can, together with other elements, go to demonstrate that he has retained his centre of vital interests in the first State. 256. It is clear from the commentary that the “personal relations” referred to are wider than immediate family relations. Social relations are also taken into account, as are political, cultural and other activities. Sporting activities, for example, would fall into this latter category. Overall, a wide range of personal connections is taken into account. 257. The importance of the location of a person’s family depends on the person’s circumstances (ie, for some people the location of family is going to be significant, for others not so). In many circumstances personal relations will be more significant than economic relations because the location of a person’s family is often highly significant. However, the issue needs to be determined on the specific facts relating to the person. 258. In Hertel v MNR 93 DTC 721 at 723, Sobier TCCJ commented that: In determining the centre of vital interests, it is not enough to simply weigh or count the number of factors or connections on each side. The depth of the roots of one’s centre of vital interests is more important than their number. 259. Assessing the depth of a person’s roots requires weighing up the circumstances as a whole to determine which locality is of greater significance to the person. Some commentators have suggested that greater weight is to be given to personal relations. However, the Commissioner considers that the better view is that the “centre of vital interests” concept is a composite one, and does not give preference to either personal or economic relations. The OECD commentary states that “considerations based on the personal acts of the individual must receive special attention”. The Commissioner considers that “personal acts” encompasses acts concerning both economic relations (such as seeking employment in a country) and personal relations (such as activities related to a person’s family). 260. If a person’s economic and personal relations are overall evenly balanced between New Zealand and another country (though personal relations are stronger with one country and economic relations with the other), the person will have no centre of vital interests, as the factors are regarded as being of equal weight. In this situation, the next test will need to be considered. 261. A person’s historical association with a country is relevant when considering the personal and economic relations test. If a person has always lived and worked in one country and retains a home, family and possessions there, it is likely that their personal and economic relations will be closer with that country even if a new home is established in another country (see Gaudreau v R 2005 DTC 66 (TCC) and Yoon v R 2005 DTC 1109). For example, a university lecturer going overseas on sabbatical leave for 12 months who has lived and worked in New Zealand for a significant time, and who retains their home and possessions in New Zealand, will have closer personal and economic relations with New Zealand than with the other country. 262. The focus of the test is on determining the country with which the person has closer personal and economic relations (their centre of vital interests). If such a 46 determination cannot be made under the personal and economic relations test, the next test needs to be considered. Generally, the next test will be the habitual abode test. Habitual abode test 263. Generally, the habitual abode test applies in two situations:  if a person has a permanent home available in both countries, and the country with which their personal and economic relations are closer (their centre of vital interests) cannot be established; or  if a person has no permanent home available in either country. 15 264. The focus of the test is on whether the person has a habitual abode in New Zealand and/or the other country. As stated by the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal in Lingle v R 2010 FCA 152, the concept of a habitual abode: ... involves notions of frequency, duration and regularity of stays of a quality which are more than transient. To put it differently, the concept refers to a stay of some substance in the jurisdiction as a matter of habit, so that the conclusion can be drawn that this is where the taxpayer normally lives. A person will have a habitual abode in a country if they live there habitually or normally. A person may habitually live in more than one country; the enquiry is not about assessing the country in which the person’s abode is more habitual, but about whether they have a habitual abode in New Zealand and/or the other country. 265. The OECD commentary on art 4 of the OECD Model Convention indicates that the test is applied by taking into account all of a person’s stays in a country, not only those at a home the person owns or rents there. For example, if a person has permanent homes available in both New Zealand and Australia, all stays in New Zealand, whether at their permanent home or elsewhere, are considered in determining whether the person has a habitual abode here. 266. It is important to consider the particular circumstances of the person when determining whether they have a habitual abode in a country. In assessing whether a stay is more than transient, the reasons for the stay are relevant. For example, where a person spends approximately 100 days in New Zealand in a year because they return to New Zealand every weekend, this may suggest that the person has a habitual abode here. On the other hand, three stays of approximately 30 days duration each in a year, for a course of medical treatment, may indicate that those stays are transient and not by themselves indicative of a habitual abode here. 267. The OECD commentary also indicates that the test is not applied by focusing only on the income year concerned. The OECD commentary states that: ... \[t\]he comparison must cover a sufficient length of time for it to be possible to determine whether the residence in each of the two States is habitual and to determine also the intervals at which the stays take place”. 268. It is important to note though, that the focus is on where the person normally lives during the period of dual residence. In obvious cases there is no need to consider other periods. However, a wider view (ie, looking beyond the period of dual residence) may assist in cases where it is unclear, or when determining 15 As noted at \[253\], the DTAs between New Zealand and Australia (signed on 26 June 2009), Thailand (signed on 22 October 1998), South Africa (signed on 6 February 2002), the UAE (signed on 22 September 2003), Spain (signed on 28 July 2005) and PNG (signed on 29 October 2012) are exceptions to this. Under those DTAs, where a person does not have a permanent home available to them in either country the next test for consideration will be the personal and economic relations test. 47 whether the stays in a particular country are either transient or of substance. The Commissioner considers that the appropriate length of time outside of the period of dual residence to consider will be just the amount that is necessary to determine whether the person had a habitual abode in New Zealand during the period of dual residence. The Commissioner now considers that the period looked at in applying the habitual abode test in the matter that became Case 12/2011 was inappropriately long. In any event, it is noted that the TRA’s discussion of how the habitual abode test would apply to the facts of that case (which was along the lines of submissions made by counsel) was obiter, the TRA having already found the taxpayer to be solely resident in New Zealand at all material times under the earlier tie-breaker tests. Nationality and mutual agreement 269. When a person has a habitual abode in both countries, or in neither of them, residence is generally determined under New Zealand’s DTAs on the basis of nationality or citizenship. In cases where nationality is stated to be the test, the concept of nationality (for individuals) is generally defined in relation to New Zealand to be a person who is a New Zealand citizen. A New Zealand citizen is someone who has citizenship here under the Citizenship Act 1977. 270. If the residence issue cannot be resolved under the tie -breaker tests, the residence article provides that the question may be resolved by mutual agreement between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. Examples illustrating the DTA residence tie-breaker tests The following examples deal only with the DTA residence tie-breaker tests. They do not consider the domestic residence tests in detail, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example 19 271. Facts: Stacey, who is employed as a university lecturer, travels to the United Kingdom for 15 months sabbatical leave at a United Kingdom university. While on leave, Stacey remains in the employment of a New Zealand university, and is required to work for the university on her return to New Zealand. Stacey and her partner let their house in New Zealand out to tenants while they are in the United Kingdom. The tenancy is a periodic tenancy under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, so is terminable with a 42-day notice period if Stacey requires it as her principal place of residence. The tenants are not associated with or friends of Stacey or her partner. Stacey’s partner travels with her to the United Kingdom. Stacey remains a member of a number of local clubs and organisations in New Zealand, and keeps most of her personal property, including investments, in New Zealand (looked after and managed by family members). While in the United Kingdom, Stacey and her partner rent a house near the university where Stacey spends her sabbatical leave. For the purposes of this example it is assumed that Stacey is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom under the relevant United Kingdom legislation. 272. Result: Stacey is resident in both New Zealand and the United Kingdom under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and the United Kingdom, she is deemed to be a resident of the United Kingdom. 273. Explanation: Stacey is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 of the Act because she has a permanent place of abode here. As noted above, it is assumed that she 48 is also resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom under the relevant United Kingdom legislation. 274. The question of Stacey’s residence for the purposes of the DTA is resolved by the permanent home test. Stacey does not have a permanent home available in New Zealand because she and her partner have rented out their New Zealand home on arm’s length terms to tenants who are not associated with them or friends of theirs. Stacey has a permanent home in the United Kingdom as she has rented a house there for 15 months. Although Stacey’s stay in the United Kingdom is for a known and fixed duration, it is sufficiently long that it cannot be regarded as temporary. 275. As Stacey has a permanent home in the United Kingdom and does not have one in New Zealand, she is deemed to be a resident of the United Kingdom for the purposes of the DTA. Example 20 276. Facts: Luke owns a house in New Zealand and one in Malaysia. He has extensive business interests in both New Zealand and Malaysia. Luke regularly spends short periods in New Zealand, and these add up to approximately five months of the year. Luke’s visits to New Zealand are primarily for business purposes, but he also spends time catching up with family here. Luke works and lives in Malaysia for the remainder of the time, where he also occupies a number of positions of responsibility in the community. Luke is married, and his wife and children live in Malaysia. For the purposes of this example it is assumed that Luke is resident for tax purposes in Malaysia under the relevant Malaysian legislation. 277. Result: Luke is resident in both New Zealand and Malaysia under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia, Luke is treated solely as a Malaysian resident. 278. Explanation: Luke is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 of the Act as he has a permanent place of abode here. As noted above, it is assumed that he is also resident for tax purposes in Malaysia under the relevant Malaysian legislation. 279. Luke has permanent homes available to him in both New Zealand and Malaysia because his houses in both countries are continuously available to him for use. As Luke has a permanent home available to him in both countries, the next question is whether he has a habitual abode in either country. \[As noted at \[252\], the order of the tie-breaker tests in the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia, signed on 19 March 1976, differs from that in New Zealand’s other DTAs. Under New Zealand’s other DTAs, if a person has a permanent home available in both countries, the personal and economic relations test would be applied next.\] Luke has a habitual abode in Malaysia because he habitually lives there for seven months of the year. Luke also has a habitual abode in New Zealand because he habitually spends approximately five months of the year here. The reasons for Luke’s stays in New Zealand (business and visiting family) suggest that the stays are more than transient in nature. 280. As Luke has a habitual abode in both New Zealand and Malaysia, it is necessary to determine whether his personal and economic relations are closer with Malaysia or with New Zealand. \[Again, note the difference in the order of the tie- breaker tests in the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia, signed on 19 March 1976, compared to New Zealand’s other DTAs.\] Luke has close economic relations with both countries due to his extensive business interests in both countries. Luke also has personal relations with both countries. These personal relations are considered to be stronger with Malaysia, given that Luke’s wife and children live there, and also that he is involved in the community there. As such, 49 weighing up the circumstances as a whole, Luke’s personal and economic relations are closer with Malaysia. Luke is therefore treated solely as a Malaysian resident for the purposes of the DTA. Example 21 281. Facts: Megan, who normally resides in Canada, is seconded to New Zealand by her Canadian employer for a period of 18 months. While in New Zealand, Megan works for the New Zealand subsidiary of her Canadian employer. While she is in New Zealand, Megan lets her house in Canada out for a fixed-term of 18 months. The tenant is not associated with or a friend of Megan’s. Megan lives in rented accommodation in New Zealand. Megan leaves most of her personal property in Canada, and most of her investments are in Canada. For the purposes of this example it is assumed that Megan is resident for tax purposes in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. 282. Result: Megan is resident in both New Zealand and Canada under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and Canada, Megan is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand. 283. Explanation: Megan is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 as she is present here for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. As noted above, it is assumed that she is also resident in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. 284. Megan has a permanent home available to her in New Zealand as she has rented accommodation here for 18 months. Although Megan’s stay in New Zealand is for a known and fixed duration, it is sufficiently long that it cannot be regarded as temporary. Megan does not have a permanent home available to her in Canada as her house there is rented out on arm’s length terms to a tenant who is not associated with her or a friend of hers. As Megan has a permanent home available to her in New Zealand but not in Canada, she is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand for the purposes of the DTA. Example 22 285. Facts: Jonty grew up in South Africa, and moved to Canada with his parents when he was 16 years old (when his father was temporarily transferred there for work). After three years, his parents moved back to South Africa. By this time, Jonty had started university in Canada and decided to stay there. Jonty graduated and had been working in Canada for two years when he was offered a two-year secondment to New Zealand by his Canadian employer. While in New Zealand, Jonty is employed by the New Zealand subsidiary of his Canadian employer. Jonty retains his bank accounts in Canada and opens new ones in New Zealand. He does not transfer his Canadian superannuation into his New Zealand superannuation fund, as he may well return to Canada at the end of his secondment. Jonty lived in a rented flat in Canada, which he gave up when he moved to New Zealand. Jonty has to travel between Auckland and Wellington, on a roughly week-about basis, for work, and he lives in his employer’s serviced apartments in both cities. Jonty has very little personal property. What he does have he either brings with him to New Zealand or sells before leaving Canada. At the end of the two-year secondment, Jonty’s position in New Zealand is extended for another 18 months. During the three and a half years that Jonty lives in New Zealand, he returns to Canada once, for a three-week holiday. For the purposes of this example it is assumed that Jonty is resident for tax purposes in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. 286. Result: Jonty is resident in both New Zealand and Canada under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and Canada, Jonty is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand. 50 287. Explanation: Jonty is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 of the Act as he is personally present here for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. As noted above, it is assumed that he is also resident for tax purposes in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. Jonty does not have a permanent home available to him in Canada because he gave up his rented flat there. Jonty does not have a permanent home available in New Zealand because his homes here (a series of serviced apartments) are not permanent. 288. As Jonty does not have a permanent home available in either country, the question is whether Jonty has a habitual abode in either country. 289. Jonty has a habitual abode in New Zealand because he habitually or normally lives here during the period of dual residence. The period of dual residence is sufficiently long that it is not necessary to look beyond that period to determine whether Jonty’s time in New Zealand is transient or of substance. It is apparent that for the three and a half years of dual residence Jonty has a habitual abode in New Zealand. Jonty clearly does not have a habitual abode in Canada during the period of dual residence – he returned there only once in that time, for a holiday of short duration. Consequently, Jonty is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand for the purposes of the DTA. 51 Part 2 Residence of companies Overview 290. Section YD 2 of the Act sets out when a company is a New Zealand resident, stating (relevantly) that: YD 2 Residence of companies Four bases for residence (1) A company is a New Zealand resident for the purposes of this Act if— (a) it is incorporated in New Zealand: (b) its head office is in New Zealand: (c) its centre of management is in New Zealand: (d) its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company in New Zealand, even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside New Zealand. International tax rules (2) Despite subsection (1), for the purpose of the international tax rules, a company is treated as remaining resident in New Zealand if it becomes a foreign company but is resident in New Zealand again within 183 days afterwards. ... 291. A company may easily satisfy more than one, or even all, of these tests. Such a company will clearly be resident in New Zealand. However, it is noted that the tests are alternatives, and a company only needs to satisfy one of them to be resident here. 292. A “foreign company” is a company not resident in New Zealand and not treated as resident in New Zealand under a DTA (s YA 1). Section YD 3 sets out different tests to determine the country in which a foreign company is treated as resident for the purposes of the “international tax rules” (as defined in s YA 1). This is discussed briefly from \[411\]. 293. The discussion of the residence rules for companies is structured as follows: Company definition .................................................................................................. 52 Place of incorporation test ........................................................................................ 52 Head office test ....................................................................................................... 53 Centre of management test ...................................................................................... 54 Description of the test ........................................................................................... 54 Centre of management of the entire company .......................................................... 54 Comparison between the centre of management test and the head office test ............. 54 Director control test ................................................................................................. 55 Description ........................................................................................................... 55 Definition of director .............................................................................................. 55 Persons carrying out director’s duties .................................................................... 55 Persons giving directions or instructions to nominated directors ............................... 55 Companies without conventional directors ............................................................. 56 Companies as directors ....................................................................................... 56 Control by directors ............................................................................................... 56 De facto test ...................................................................................................... 56 Distinction between de facto control, influence and the provision of services .............. 58 Exercise of powers in NZ and in another country .................................................... 58 Residence of directors ......................................................................................... 59 Continuing test ................................................................................................... 59 Control of the entire company .............................................................................. 59 Comparison between director control and head office and centre of management tests .. 59 Examples illustrating the company residence tests ....................................................... 60 Changes in company residence.................................................................................. 62 Dual resident companies .......................................................................................... 65 Examples illustrating dual residence and the grouping of losses ..................................... 67 Residence of foreign companies ................................................................................. 68 52 Company definition 294. “Company” is defined in s YA 1. The relevant definition for the purposes of the residence rules is: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise— ... company— (a) means a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether it is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere: (ab) does not include a partnership: (abb) does not include a look-through company, except in the PAYE rules, the FBT rules, the NRWT rules, the RWT rules, the ESCT rules, the RSCT rules, and for the purposes of subpart FO (Amalgamation of companies): (ac) includes a listed limited partnership: (ad) includes a foreign corporate limited partnership: (b) includes a unit trust: (c) includes a group investment fund that is not a designated group investment fund, but only to the extent to which the fund results from investments made into it that are— (i) not from a designated source, as defined in section HR 3(5) (Definitions for section HR 2: group investment funds); and (ii) not made before 23 June 1983, including an amount treated as invested at that date under the definition of pre-1983 investment in section HR 3(8): (d) includes an airport operator: (e) includes a statutory producer board: (f) includes a society registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908: (g) includes a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908: (h) includes a friendly society: (i) includes a building society: ... 295. As the definition extends to any entity with a legal existence separate from that of its members, this would include a wide range of entities established under the laws of other countries that, although not companies in the strict sense, are equivalent to companies. If any such entity satisfied any of the company residence tests in s YD 2, it would be a New Zealand resident company and would therefore be liable for tax here on its worldwide income. 296. Usually a look-through company is treated as being transparent, but for some tax purposes it is still treated as a company. For example, a look-through company is not transparent for the purposes of the NRWT rules and the RWT rules. In those circumstances the residence of the owners of the company is not relevant. This means that someone paying passive income to a look-through company that meets the requirements of subpart HB can assume that they are making a payment to a NZ resident company and not to the owners of the company. The company can be assumed to be a New Zealand resident company because to qualify as a look-through company in the first place the company needs to be a New Zealand resident under s YD 2 and any applicable DTA. Place of incorporation test 297. Section YD 2(1)(a) provides that a company is a New Zealand resident if it is incorporated in New Zealand. This is an objective and easily ascertainable test of corporate residence: a company is resident if it has been through a process of 53 incorporation in New Zealand. A company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 would be resident here. 298. The place of incorporation test obviously cannot apply to companies that are not capable of being incorporated. For example, there is no incorporation procedure for unit trusts in New Zealand, so they could not be resident here under s YD 2(1)(a). However, companies that cannot be incorporated may be resident in New Zealand under one of the other tests in s YD 2. Head office test 299. Section YD 2(1)(b) provides that a company is a New Zealand resident if its head office is in New Zealand. 300. The word “office” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, 3 rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2013, accessed 3 March 2014) (relevantly) as meaning: office, n. 6. a. A room, set of rooms, or building used as a place of business for nonmanual work; a room or department for clerical or administrative work. Also (in extended use): the staff of such a room, department, etc. 301. The Commissioner therefore considers that “office” in the context of the head office test means a physical place from where the business is conducted; a place where the administration and management (in the broadest sense) of a business is carried out. The head office of a company is the office that is above all others: the place of administration and management that is superior to all others. It is the office from which the business of the company is directed and carried on. An office will be superior to other offices of the company if individuals working in those other offices are responsible to individuals located in that office. The focus of the test is therefore on a physical place, in the sense of a building, from which the overall operations of the company are directed and carried on. 302. In determining whether a company has its head office in New Zealand the following factors may be relevant:  The location of senior management staff. If senior management operate from an office in New Zealand, this would be a strong indicator that the New Zealand office is the company’s head office.  Where the major strategic and policy decisions are made. If individuals working in other offices act in accordance with decisions and policy made at a particular office, that office is likely to be the head office.  Whether specialised functions, for example of an advisory nature, are carried out in a particular office. If a number of specialised functions are carried out in a particular office this may indicate that the office is the head office, although the significance of this factor will depend on the overall structure of the company.  Whether the staff of the company consider that an office is the head office. 303. Weighing up these factors should identify whether a company’s head office is in New Zealand. Usually there will not be uncertainty as to the location of a company’s head office. If a company is engaged in carrying on business activities, identifying the company’s highest office should not be difficult. An example where it could be more difficult is where a company is merely a passive investment vehicle. The passive nature of the company’s activities may make identifying its highest office difficult, or the company may simply have no office. 54 Centre of management test Description of the test 304. Section YD 2(1)(c) provides that a company is a New Zealand resident if its centre of management is in New Zealand. The focus of the test is on the centre of management of the company as a whole, not the management of only part of a company’s operations. In determining where the centre of management of a company as a whole is, acts of management at various levels may be relevant (see: Vinelight Nominees Limited and Weyand Investments Limited v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 655). 305. The test is a de facto test: that is, the focus is on where the company’s centre of management is as a matter of fact (NZ Forest Products Finance NV v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,073). The test is not limited to consideration of the company’s formal management structures, such as those set out in corporate governance documents. The test focuses on how the company is managed in reality, even if that conflicts with the governance documents or formal structures. 306. Therefore, if the senior executives of a company established in a foreign country manage the company on the basis of instructions from persons located in New Zealand, without exercising their independent minds as to how the company should be managed, the centre of management of the company will be in New Zealand rather than in the foreign country. This is the case even if the persons giving instructions from New Zealand are not officers of the company under the company’s constitution. That said, there may well be persons who influence the decisions made by the executives managing a company, or who provide guidance to them. This will not amount to de facto management of the company if those charged with the management are in fact exercising that management function independently, not merely doing the bidding of others who are in reality managing the company. Centre of management of the entire company 307. The centre of management test focuses on the centre of management of the entire company. Therefore, if a company that operates in several countries has a centre of management in New Zealand, but that centre of management only relates to the company’s New Zealand operations, the company will not be resident here under the centre of management test. 308. In some cases, multinational companies conduct business in New Zealand directly through a branch rather than through a locally established subsidiary. The local branch may have its own executives and, occasionally, its own board of directors. In this situation, although the company has significant links with New Zealand, it will not be resident here under the centre of management test. The management of the branch does not constitute the centre of management of the company as a whole, only the centre of management of a part of the company. 309. On the other hand, companies incorporated outside New Zealand, that conduct operations outside New Zealand, may have their centre of management in New Zealand. Such companies will be resident in New Zealand under the centre of management test despite their close connections with other countries. Comparison between the centre of management test and the head office test 310. It may well be that a company satisfies both the head office and centre of management tests, as the centre of management of a company will commonly be located in its head office. However, the focus of the two tests is different. The head office test concentrates on a physical place, ie, on an office that constitutes a company’s highest office. By contrast, the focus of the centre of management 55 test is not on identifying the quality of a particular office, but rather on the broader question of whether the management of a company is centred in New Zealand. A company does not need to have an office in New Zealand to satisfy the centre of management test. 311. A company may have no office (and therefore obviously no head office) in New Zealand, but its centre of management may be here because the management decisions are effectively undertaken from New Zealand. In this situation, the company will be resident under the centre of management test, even though the head office test is not satisfied. Director control test Description 312. Section YD 2(1)(d) provides that a company is a New Zealand resident if its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company in New Zealand. A company that satisfies this test is resident whether or not the directors’ decision-making is confined to New Zealand. Definition of director Section YA 1 definition 313. The relevant definition of “director” in s YA 1 provides that: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise— ... director— (a) means— (i) a person occupying the position of director, whatever title is used: (ii) a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the persons occupying the position of directors of a company are accustomed to act: (iii) a person treated as being a director by any other provision of this Act: (iv) in the case of an entity that does not have directors and that is treated as, or assumed to be, a company by a provision of this Act, any trustee, manager, or other person who acts in relation to the entity in the same way as a director would act, or in a similar way to that in which a director would act, were the entity a company incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993: ... 314. This extended definition of director ensures that de facto directors are included when considering whether a company is a New Zealand resident under the director control test. Persons carrying out director’s duties 315. A person is treated as a director if they occupy the position of director, whether or not that title is used. That is, any person carrying out the duties of a director is a director. Persons giving directions or instructions to nominated directors 316. A person is treated as a director if those occupying the position of directors of a company are accustomed to act in accordance with the person’s directions or instructions. For example, if the directors of a company incorporated in Hong Kong were accustomed to act in accordance with instructions from a New Zealand resident individual, that individual would be a director of the company. The company may therefore potentially be a New Zealand resident under the director 56 control test, as control of the company by a director is exercised from here. \[See further from \[335\] as to the considerations to have regard to when there is exercise of directorial control both in New Zealand and elsewhere.\] 317. In practical terms, it will be necessary to consider a pattern of decision-making to determine whether the nominated directors are accustomed to act in accordance with another person’s directions or instructions (whether formal or otherwise). 318. The Commissioner considers that the directions or instructions do not need to be given directly to the person occupying the position of directors. For example, where there is a chain of companies that have directors who are accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of another person, the chain must be traced through to establish on whose directions or instructions the directors are accustomed to act. That person will be considered a director under the Act. For example, if the directors of company X are accustomed to act under instructions from the directors of company Y, and the directors of company Y act under instructions from a New Zealand resident A, then A will be a director of both X and Y under the definition of “director” in s YA 1. Companies without conventional directors 319. The definition of “director” in the Act extends to entities that do not have directors in the conventional sense. In the case of an entity that is treated as or assumed to be a company under the Act, a person who acts in the same or in a similar way to that in which a director would act is treated as a director. A person will fall within this part of the definition if they are involved in making the types of decisions that a director of a company would normally make. These would include major strategic and policy decisions. 320. Therefore, the manager of a unit trust would be a director because they are involved in making the major decisions in relation to the unit trust: for example, the decisions in relation to the management of the unit trust’s investments, the marketing of interests in the unit trust, and the distribution policy of the unit trust. If the manager exercises control of the unit trust from New Zealand, the unit trust will be a New Zealand resident. Companies as directors 321. The definition of director in the Act is broad enough to encompass both natural persons and companies that are appointed as or that act as directors. This may result in a New Zealand resident company being treated as a director of a company established in another jurisdiction (see Example 23 below). Control by directors 322. The director control test focuses on where the directors exercise their directorial control of the company from, ie, the place from which the strategic and policy decisions are made. A company will be resident in New Zealand under this test if directors are effectively controlling the company from New Zealand, ie, if the central and directing mind of the company is here. 323. The test is only satisfied if directors acting in their capacity as directors exercise control from New Zealand. If directors control a company from New Zealand in their capacity as shareholders, but not in their capacity as directors, the company will not be resident here under the director control test. De facto test 324. The director control test is satisfied if control of a company is exercised in New Zealand, whether or not decision-making by directors is confined to New Zealand. 57 The test is one of de facto control. That is, the question is whether control of the company by directors is actually exercised from New Zealand. 325. There are a number of ways in which directors may exercise control of a company. For example, control may be exercised through:  decisions made in the course of formal directors’ meetings;  decisions made in the course of a telephone / video link up etc between directors;  the signing of resolutions outside directors’ meetings;  informal decisions made by directors, acting in their capacity as directors, outside the course of the directors’ meetings. 326. The method by which directors exercise control of a company may vary considerably from case to case. Each case must be considered on its facts to determine the place from which the directors actually exercise control of the company. 327. The significance of the location of directors’ meetings will vary from case to case. If directors exercise control only in the course of directors’ meetings, then the location of the meetings will be of paramount importance. On the other hand, if control is exercised outside the directors’ meetings, and the meetings are merely to formalise decisions that have already been made, the location of the meetings will be of little significance. 328. The fact that directors of a company exercise directorial functions from New Zealand does not necessarily mean that control of the company by its directors is exercised from New Zealand. For example, if the directors ordinarily exercise their powers in the course of directors’ meetings held in Australia, the fact that New Zealand directors occasionally sign resolutions in New Zealand or occasionally participate in telephone conferences from New Zealand does not mean that the directors are exercising control of the company from New Zealand. See Case 11/2011 (2011) 25 NZTC 1-011, \[2011\] NZTRA 07. 329. If the nominated directors do not exercise control of a company, but rather de facto directors exercise control from New Zealand, the company will be resident in New Zealand even though the de facto directors are not directors under the company’s constitution. 330. Determining whether the nominated directors exercise true control requires consideration of how the company is, in reality, controlled. The fact that the nominated directors may be accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of another person does not necessarily mean that they are not exercising true control of the company (though it will mean that the person in accordance with whose directions or instructions they are accustomed to act would also be a director under the definition in s YA 1). If the nominated directors exercise their independent minds in undertaking their directorial functions, rather than acting as mere pawns or “rubber stamping” the decisions of others, they will be exercising true control of the company. 331. In considering whether the nominated directors are truly exercising directorial control, the remuneration provided to them may be a relevant consideration. If their remuneration does not reflect their apparent duties and responsibilities, the nominated directors may not be carrying the burden of decision-making responsibility. It is also appropriate to consider who the nominated directors are. In tax havens, for example, directors commonly have several hundred directorships. Such a situation may suggest that the directors are not actively involved in making decisions, and that their directorial functions are exercised in 58 accordance with outside instructions without the independent thought required for them to be considered to be exercising true control of the company. The circumstances of the exercise of the directorial functions would need to be considered closely to determine whether the nominated directors are in fact exercising the directorial function independently, or merely doing the bidding of others who are in reality controlling the company. Distinction between de facto control, influence and the provision of services 332. In practice, it may be difficult to determine whether the nominated directors of a company are acting under directions or instructions from another person or are merely influenced but not controlled by another person. A majority shareholder, for example a parent company, will normally influence to some extent the actions of the company in which it is a shareholder. However, if the majority shareholder only exercises the powers that such a shareholder would have in general meetings — for example, to appoint and dismiss members of the board, and to approve and initiate changes to the financial structure of the company — then that shareholder will not be controlling the company in terms of the director control test. 333. By contrast, if the majority shareholder assumes the functions of the company’s board, or if that board merely “rubber stamps” decisions made by the majority shareholder without independent consideration being given to the decisions, the majority shareholder will be a director of the company under the definition in the Act. This is consistent with the common law approach – see for example Unit Construction Co Ltd v Bullock \[1959\] 3 All ER 831 (UKHL). If this is the case, and if the majority shareholder exercises control of the company from New Zealand, the company will be resident here under the director control test. In considering whether someone has de facto control over a company, the degree of autonomy exercised by the members of the company’s board in relation to matters like investment, production, marketing, finance and procurement must be considered. If the board cannot make decisions about matters of this type without prior approval from the major shareholder, then the majority shareholder is likely to be in de facto control of the company. 334. In relation to companies that are subsidiaries, the de facto exercise of control by the parent company must be distinguished from the mere provision of advisory services. Often, large corporate organisations establish centralised advisory departments to provide administrative, financial, accounting, and other services for companies that are members of the organisation. When a parent company provides services of this nature to a subsidiary, it is not in control of the subsidiary under the director control test merely because of the provision of those services. Exercise of powers in New Zealand and in another country 335. In cases where a company has both New Zealand and foreign directors, the functions performed by the New Zealand directors from New Zealand must be considered to determine whether they constitute the exercise of control of the company by its directors from New Zealand. If the powers of all directors are equal, the issue may be resolved by simply looking to where the majority exercise their control. For example, if a company has directors with equal powers, three of whom live in Australia and two in New Zealand, and control is exercised through directors’ meetings held in Australia and through occasional teleconferences between the Australian and New Zealand directors, the company would not be resident in New Zealand under the director control test. In these circumstances, when the directors exercise their powers concurrently from New Zealand and Australia, the majority of the directors are located in Australia. 59 Consequently, on a simple majority approach, control of the company by its directors is not exercised from New Zealand. 336. However, a simple majority approach is not appropriate where any of the directors have exclusive special powers that enable them to control the company. Nor is it appropriate where any of the directors are otherwise in de facto control of the company, for example, because the other directors are merely nominees. In these circumstances, it is necessary to determine whether the controlling dir ectors exercise control of the company from New Zealand. Residence of directors 337. The residence status of a company’s directors is not relevant in determining whether the director control test has been satisfied. The focus of the test is on whether the directors exercise control of the company from New Zealand. In cases where the simple majority approach outlined at \[335\] is appropriate, the question is not whether a simple majority of the directors are resident in New Zealand but rather whether a simple majority of the directors exercise their directorial powers from New Zealand. Continuing test 338. The director control test will be satisfied if the directors exercise control of a company from New Zealand on a continuing basis. If control is ordinarily exercised from New Zealand, but is occasionally exercised from outside New Zealand, the company will be resident in New Zealand on the basis that the directors exercise control from here. Control of the entire company 339. A company will not be resident here under the director control test unless the control exercised by directors from New Zealand is control of the company as a whole. Therefore, if New Zealand directors exercise control only in relation to the New Zealand operations of the company, and directors elsewhere exercise control of the company as a whole, the company will not be resident here under the director control test. Comparison between the director control test and the head office and centre of management tests 340. The centre of management test focuses on the management of the company as a whole. Acts of management at various levels may be relevant to determining where the centre of management is. This differs from the director control test, which concentrates on the directorial control of the company, ie, the place from which the strategic and policy decisions are made. In some cases there may not be a clear distinction between aspects of the management of the company and the directorial decision making and control because, for example, the directors are involved in managing the company. 341. The head office of a company may also be the place from which the directors exercise control of the company. However, the two tests are different in nature. The head office test focuses on a physical place, ie, on the office from which the business of the company is directed and carried on. In contrast, the director control test looks to the place from which the directors ultimately control the company. 60 Examples illustrating the company residence tests Example 23 342. Facts: Company A is incorporated in Hong Kong and carries on a business manufacturing clothes there. A’s operations are all managed from Hong Kong. A has no office in New Zealand. All meetings of the board of directors are held in Hong Kong, but the Hong Kong directors always act on the instructions of company A’s New Zealand parent company, and unquestioningly implement the decisions made by the parent company. 343. Result: Company A is resident in New Zealand under the director control test. 344. Explanation: A is incorporated in Hong Kong and therefore is not resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. 345. The centre of A’s operations is in Hong Kong, and A has its centre of management there. A has no office in New Zealand. As such, A is not resident in New Zealand under either the head office or the centre of management tests. 346. The Hong Kong directors of A act on the instructions of the New Zealand parent company. The New Zealand parent is therefore a director of A (under paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of “director” in s YA (1)). The New Zealand parent is exercising de facto control of A, because the Hong Kong directors implement the decisions of the parent company without question. The Hong Kong directors are not exercising true directorial control of A. A is resident in New Zealand because the parent company is a director of A and exercises directorial control of A from New Zealand. The Hong Kong directors of A do not exercise true directorial control, so this is not a situation where it is necessary to weigh up the level of control exercised from New Zealand and from elsewhere. Example 24 347. Facts: B is a holding company incorporated in Singapore. B has an office in Singapore and the company’s operations are managed from this office. B has no office in New Zealand. B has five directors: three are resident in Australia, and two in New Zealand. The powers of the directors are equal. The board of directors meets six-monthly in Singapore to review decisions made by its subsidiaries. The directors regularly hold video conferences to discuss particular issues, and investment decisions are made in the course of these conferences. 348. Result: B is not resident in New Zealand. 349. Explanation: B is incorporated in Singapore and is therefore not resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. 350. B has no office in New Zealand and is therefore not resident here under the head office test. 351. B is managed from Singapore and therefore has its centre of management in Singapore rather than in New Zealand. 352. Although the board of directors meets only in Singapore, control of the company is also exercised outside the board meetings during the video conferences between the New Zealand and Australian directors. The New Zealand directors therefore occasionally exercise their directorial functions from New Zealand. However, as the powers of each director are equal, B is not controlled by its directors from New Zealand, as the majority of directors are in Australia. B is therefore not resident in New Zealand under the director control test. 61 Example 25 353. Facts: C is an Australian incorporated bank. C conducts business in New Zealand through a branch. The New Zealand branch has its own executives and board of directors who operate from the bank’s Wellington office. The worldwide operations of C are conducted from the Australian office, and all of the major decisions concerning C are made by the Australian directors in Australia. The New Zealand executives and board are only responsible for managing C’s New Zealand operations. 354. Result: C is not resident in New Zealand. 355. Explanation: C is incorporated in Australia and therefore is not resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. 356. C’s head office is not in New Zealand. The Wellington office is the company’s highest New Zealand office but it is not the highest office of the company as a whole. C’s Australian office is its head office. 357. The centre of C’s management is in Australia. The New Zealand branch management is only responsible for managing C’s New Zealand operations. Therefore, C does not have its centre of management in New Zealand. 358. The Australian directors exercise control of C from Australia. The director control test is only satisfied if the directors exercise control of the company as a whole in New Zealand. However, in this case the control exercised by the New Zealand directors relates only to C’s New Zealand branch. Therefore, C is not resident by virtue of the director control test. Example 26 359. Facts: D is a unit trust that has been established under the Unit Trusts Act 1960 (NZ). D invests primarily in shares issued by New Zealand and overseas publicly listed companies. The manager of D is a New Zealand incorporated company. The manager makes all of the major decisions relating to marketing interests in D, investments, distributions, etc. These decisions are all made from New Zealand. 360. Result: D is a company under the extended definition of “company” in the Act. D is resident in New Zealand under the director control test. 361. Explanation: D is not incorporated. The incorporation test is therefore not applicable. The fact that D’s manager is incorporated in New Zealand is irrelevant to D’s residence status. 362. D’s manager is a director of D under para (a)(iv) of the extended definition of “director” in s YA 1 of the Act because D’s manager acts in the same way a director of a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 would act, ie, it makes all the major decisions in relation to investments. 363. The manager exercises control from New Zealand. Therefore, D is resident in New Zealand because its director exercises control of D from New Zealand. Example 27 364. Facts: E is incorporated in Australia and is a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of an Australian company. The Australian parent is in the business of manufacturing a number of products. E’s business mainly involves the marketing of those products in New Zealand. The management of E takes place from its Auckland office. E does not have an office in Australia, but it has several branch offices in New Zealand outside Auckland. The overall strategic control of the company by its directors is exercised from Australia. 62 365. Result: E is resident in New Zealand under the head office and centre of management tests. 366. Explanation: E is not resident in New Zealand under the director control test because its directors exercise control from Australia. 367. E’s Auckland office constitutes its head office because it is the office from which the business of the company is managed and carried on. E is therefore resident in New Zealand under the head office test. 368. The management of E takes place from the Auckland office. E is therefore also resident in New Zealand because its centre of management is here. Example 28 369. Facts: F is a company incorporated in the Cook Islands, and is used as a financing vehicle for a group of companies based in New Zealand. G, which is also incorporated in the Cook Islands, is the sole nominated director of F. With respect to the affairs of both F and G, the directors of G act on instructions received from a New Zealand resident company (NZ Co) that is a member of the group, without discussing or considering those instructions. Both F and G are managed from the Cook Islands. Neither F nor G has an office in New Zealand. 370. Result: Both F and G are resident in New Zealand under the director control test. 371. Explanation: F and G are both incorporated in the Cook Islands. Therefore, they are not resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. 372. F and G are both managed from the Cook Islands. Therefore, they are not resident in New Zealand under the centre of management test. Further, as neither F nor G has an office in New Zealand, they are not resident here under the head office test. 373. The nominated directors of G act in accordance with instructions from NZ Co in relation to G’s affairs. NZ Co is therefore a director of G. NZ Co exercises de facto control of G because the directors of G act on NZ Co’s instructions without discussing or considering those instructions. The directors of G are not exercising true directorial control of G. As NZ Co exercises control of G from New Zealand, G is resident here under the director control test. 374. The nominated director of F (ie , G) acts in accordance with instructions from the nominated directors of G, who in turn act in accordance with instructions from NZ Co. The nominated director of F therefore acts in accordance with instructions from NZ Co, making NZ Co a director of F. NZ Co exercises de facto control of F because the directors of G (which is the director of F) act on NZ Co’s instructions with respect to the affairs of F (as with the affairs of G) without discussing or considering those instructions. G, the nominated director of F, is not exercising true directorial control. F is resident in New Zealand because NZ Co is a director of F and exercises directorial control of F from New Zealand. G does not exercise true directorial control, so this is not a situation where it is necessary to weigh up the level of control exercised from New Zealand and from elsewhere. Changes in company residence 375. As a company will be resident in New Zealand if it has its head office or centre of management here, or its directors exercise control of the company here, a company’s residence may change if the location of its head office, centre of management, or place of directorial control changes. For example, a company that is resident in New Zealand under the centre of management test may cease to be resident here if it moves its centre of management to Australia, or a company that is not resident in New Zealand may become resident here if it shifts 63 its head office here. A company may also transfer its place of incorporation from New Zealand to overseas. 376. Some of the more significant income tax consequences that may arise when the residence of a company changes between New Zealand and another country are set out below. A change in residence may also have implications for the application of a DTA. Further, if a company is a settlor or beneficiary of a trust and its residence status changes there may be tax implications – see from \[438\]. (a) Company migration rules 377. A company that ceases to be a New Zealand resident is an “emigrating company”, and under the company migration rules it is treated for tax purposes as if, immediately before emigrating, it had disposed of its property at market value, liquidated, and distributed the full amount available for distribution as dividends (s FL 1). (b) Taxation of foreign-sourced income 378. A company will be assessable for income tax on foreign-sourced income it derives while resident in New Zealand (s BD 1(5)(c)). In the case of a change in residence, therefore, the foreign-sourced income derived by a company while it was resident in New Zealand must be calculated, or a reasonable apportionment of the total foreign-sourced income must be made to the periods of residence and non-residence. (c) Company imputation 379. A company that is resident in New Zealand (an imputation credit account (ICA) company) will generally be required to establish and maintain an imputation credit account (s OB 1). \[It is noted that some companies are specifically excluded from being ICA companies – see \[398\] below\]. A company that is resident in Australia may, in some circumstances, elect to establish and maintain an imputation credit account in New Zealand (s OB 2; see also definition of “Australian ICA company” in s YA 1). Otherwise, companies that are not resident in New Zealand are not permitted to establish an imputation credit account. A company that becomes resident in New Zealand during an imputation year therefore needs to establish and maintain an imputation credit account. Conversely, a company that ceases to be resident in New Zealand during an imputation year loses the right to maintain an imputation credit account (unless it becomes an Australian ICA company). When a company becomes a New Zealand resident during an imputation year, it is not entitled to credit to its imputation credit account any income tax paid in respect of income derived when it was resident outside New Zealand (s OB 4(3)(b)). 380. In the converse situation, where a company ceases to be a New Zealand resident, the company is required to debit its imputation credit account by the amount of any credit existing in the account immediately before the company stopped being an ICA company (ie, when it ceased being resident) (s OB 56(1)), or to pay further income tax for a debit balance in its imputation credit account when it ceased being an ICA company (s OB 66). A company that ceases to be an ICA company is also required to furnish an imputation return within two months from the day on which it ceased to be an ICA company (s 70(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). (d) Controlled foreign company regime 381. A change of residence between New Zealand and another country may also have implications in relation to the CFC regime. Under s EX 24(1), when a company becomes a “foreign company” (being a company that is not resident in New 64 Zealand, or is treated as not resident in New Zealand under a DTA) a new accounting period of the company starts on that day. The result is that if the company becomes a CFC because of its change in residence, only income derived after the company became a CFC will be attributed under the CFC regime to residents holding interests in the company. 382. In the converse situation, a new accounting period starts on the day when a company ceases to be a foreign company (s EX 24(2)). The effect is that if the company was a CFC before it ceased to be a foreign company, only income derived before the company ceased to be a foreign company will be attributed to residents under the CFC regime. (e ) The financial arrangements rules 383. When a company becomes a New Zealand resident during an income year and the company is a party to a financial arrangement, the company may become subject to the financial arrangements rules (note, it may be that they were already within the rules, ie, if they had previously carried on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment and were a party to a financial arrangement for the purposes of that business). Where a company enters the financial arrangements rules as a result of becoming a resident in New Zealand, the company is treated as having assumed the accrued obligation to pay consideration under the financial arrangement immediately after the time at which it became resident, and as having paid the market value that a contract to assume the obligation had at that time (s EW 37(2)). The deemed acquisition price will then be taken into account in any subsequent base price adjustment required under s EW 29. To the extent that the exemption from the financial arrangements rules for non-residents (s EW 9) previously applied, that exemption will cease to apply when the company becomes resident. 384. When a company ceases to be resident in New Zealand and the company is a party to a financial arrangement, it must calculate a base price adjustment for the financial arrangement as at the date of ceasing to be resident (s EW 29). If the base price adjustment is positive it will be income derived by the company in the year for which the calculation is made (s EW 31(3)). If the base price adjustment is negative it will be expenditure incurred by the company in the year for which the calculation is made, and a deduction will be allowed for that expenditure (s EW 31(4)). An exception exists if a cash basis person ceases to be a New Zealand resident before the first day of the fourth income year following the income year in which they first became a New Zealand resident. In that case, they do not need to calculate a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement that they were a party to both before becoming and after ceasing to be a New Zealand resident (s EW 30(1)). Also, a party to a financial arrangement who ceases to be a New Zealand resident does not need to calculate a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement to the extent to which the arrangement relates to a business the party carries on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (s EW 30(2)). 385. When a company ceases to be a New Zealand resident, the financial arrangements rules will cease to apply to the company except to the extent to which the company is a party to a financial arrangement for the purpose of a business carried on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (s EW 9). (f) Grouping of losses 386. A change in residence between New Zealand and another country may also affect the grouping of tax losses under subpart IC of the Act. Section IC 5 stipulates that for a company to be able to make its tax losses available to another company in the group, the company with the losses must (among other things) 65 meet the residence requirements of s IC 7. Section IC 7 requires that, for the commonality period, the company with the available losses must be either incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on business through a fixed establishment here. In addition, the company must not be treated as not being resident in New Zealand under a DTA for the purposes of the DTA, and must not be liable to income tax in another country because of domicile, residence, or place of incorporation. However, losses not available for grouping may be available for carry forward under s IA 3. (g) Provisional tax 387. When a company becomes a New Zealand resident during an income year it may become a provisional taxpayer that is subject to the provisional tax regime contained in subpart RC. When a company ceases to be a New Zealand resident it may cease to be a provisional taxpayer (s RC 3). Dual resident companies Dual residence 388. In some cases a company may be resident in both New Zealand, under s YD 2, and another country, under the domestic tax law of that country. Dual residence has a number of implications in relation to the application of the Act and New Zealand’s DTAs. 389. When a company is resident in New Zealand and in a country with which we have a DTA, the DTA will generally allocate residence to one of the countries for the purpose of determining how income and gains covered by the DTA are taxed. The objective here is to decide which country has the primary taxing right and to therefore reduce the incidence of double taxation. 390. In the context of the Act, dual residence has implications in the following areas: imputation, the dividend withholding payment regime, the CFC and FIF regimes, and the grouping of losses. Dual residence and double taxation agreements 391. Double taxation may arise where a company is resident in both New Zealand and another country if each country taxes the worldwide income of the company. This issue may be resolved where there is a DTA between New Zealand and the other country. The DTA will generally allocate residence to one of the countries for the purposes of the DTA. In determining the treatment of income covered by the DTA, the company is then treated as being resident only in the country to which residence has been allocated. 392. Where a New Zealand resident company (under s YD 2) is deemed to be resident in another country for the purposes of a DTA, New Zealand’s right to tax foreign- sourced income may be restricted, and limitations may be imposed on New Zealand’s right to tax New Zealand-sourced income. As discussed in relation to individuals at \[234\] and \[235\], the company will remain liable to New Zealand income tax on income treated (under s YD 4) as having a source in New Zealand (s BD 1(5)). However, the liability is modified by any restrictions imposed by the DTA on New Zealand’s right to tax persons who are deemed to be resident in the other country for the purposes of the DTA. Therefore, the residence rules contained in s YD 2 cannot always be read in isolation. When a company satisfies the domestic tax residence requirements in both New Zealand and another country, the impact of the DTA (if there is one) must be considered. 393. New Zealand’s DTAs contain a number of different rules for allocating company residence for DTA purposes. As is the case with individuals, these rules do not apply for non-treaty purposes. Under these rules, which vary from one DTA to 66 another, residence may be allocated according to the company’s “place of effective management”, its “day-to-day management”, the “centre of its administrative or practical management” and the location of its “head office”. In the case of some of New Zealand’s DTAs it may fall to the competent authorities of the Contracting States to settle the question by mutual agreement (in some instances with regard to specified factors). 394. As noted at \[243\] in relation to individuals, if a DTA between New Zealand and another country uses the wording of a particular article in the OECD Model Convention (or very similar wording), the Commissioner considers that it can be inferred that the OECD commentary on that article reflects the meaning the parties intended to be given to any undefined terms in that article. In such circumstances the OECD commentary will be a significant aid to interpreting the relevant undefined terms. In such a case, the Commissioner considers that the context requires the meaning of the undefined terms to be considered without reference to any meaning those terms may have under domestic law. 395. There is only one residence tie-breaker test for dual-resident non-individuals in the OECD Model Convention. That tie-breaker allocates residence, for DTA purposes, to the State in which the person’s “place of effective management” is situated. Where New Zealand’s DTAs adopt this test, the Commissioner considers that reference should be made to the OECD commentary on the meaning of this term. 396. Where New Zealand’s DTAs adopt residence allocation tests for non-individuals other than “place of effective management”, it may be necessary to have recourse to the domestic law meaning (if any) of any undefined term in that test. Dual residence and imputation 397. Section OB 1 provides that, subject to a number of special exclusions, a company that is resident in New Zealand must establish and maintain an imputation credit account for each tax year. Imputation credit account companies (ICA companies) may attach imputation credits to dividends they pay (s OB 60). 398. Several categories of company are specifically excluded from being ICA companies and, therefore, from passing on imputation credits to their shareholders (s OB 1(2)). Among these are companies that are resident in New Zealand but are treated as not being resident in New Zealand under a DTA. The situation contemplated is a dual resident company that, for the purposes of a DTA, is deemed not to be resident in New Zealand and so is not liable for New Zealand tax on all or part of its income. To ensure that dual resident companies cannot be used to undermine the international tax regime by obtaining the benefit of the imputation regime even though treated as not resident here, companies in this category are not able to pass on imputation credits. This is consistent with the anti-stapled stock provisions, contained in s GB 37, which also prevent companies from avoiding the international tax regime while at the same time being able to pass on imputation credits. Dual residence and the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund regimes 399. The CFC and FIF regimes are contained in subpart EX. When a resident has an interest in a CFC, income and losses of the CFC may be attributed to the resident for income tax purposes. When a resident has an interest in a FIF, the annual change in value of the interest is taken into account for income tax purposes. 400. The CFC and FIF regimes both apply in relation to foreign companies. A foreign company is one that is not resident in New Zealand, or is treated under a DTA as not being resident in New Zealand. Companies that are dual resident under domestic law, but treated as resident outside of New Zealand for DTA purposes, 67 may be brought within the CFC and FIF regimes. In the case of the CFC regime, this will occur if the closely held ownership test is satisfied. In the case of the FIF regime, it will occur if none of the exceptions apply. This is to ensure that dual resident companies cannot be structured with a view to defeating the CFC and FIF regimes. Dual residence and the grouping of losses 401. Section IA 3(2) allows companies within the same group of companies (as defined in s IC 3) to group their income and losses (see also subpart IC). This is subject to the requirements of s IC 5, which include that the company with the available losses must meet the residence requirements of s IC 7. Section IC 7 provides that for the commonality period (s IC 6) the company with the losses must be either incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on a business here through a fixed establishment. The company must also not be treated as not resident in New Zealand under a DTA, for the purposes of the DTA, and must not be liable by the law of another country or territory to income tax there through domicile, residence, or place of incorporation. Therefore a dual resident company cannot make its tax losses available to another company in the same group either by election or subvention payment under s IC 5(2). Examples illustrating dual residence and the grouping of losses Example 29 402. Facts: H is incorporated in New Zealand and managed from Australia. H is a member of a group of New Zealand and Australian companies. H incurs a loss of $1 million during the income year ending 31 March 2012. 403. Result: H’s loss cannot be grouped with income earned by other New Zealand resident companies in the group. 404. Explanation: H is resident in both New Zealand and Australia under the domestic law of both countries. However, under the DTA between New Zealand and Australia, H is treated as a resident only of Australia, as its place of effective management is Australia. As such, the requirements of s IC 7 are not satisfied, and H cannot make its tax losses available to other New Zealand companies in the group. Example 30 405. Facts: I is incorporated in Hong Kong and controlled by its directors from New Zealand. I is a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of a UK company. J is a New Zealand incorporated company that is controlled by its directors from New Zealand and has its centre of management here. J is also a 100 per cent subsidiary of the UK company. During the income year ending 31 March 2012, I incurs a loss of $1 million and J earns assessable income of $2 million. 406. Result: I’s $1 million loss cannot be grouped with J’s $2 million income. 407. Explanation: I is resident in New Zealand because control by its directors is exercised from New Zealand. However, it is not incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment here. As such, s IC 7(1) prevents I’s losses from being grouped with J’s income. Example 31 408. Facts: K is a United States incorporated and managed company. K operates directly in New Zealand through several branch offices, and a significant amount of business is transacted through these offices. L is a New Zealand incorporated company that is controlled by its directors here and has its centre of management 68 here. L is a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of K. During the income year ending 31 March 2012, K’s New Zealand branch operations sustain a loss of $1 million and L earns assessable income of $2 million. 409. Result: The $1 million loss incurred by K’s New Zealand branch operations can be grouped with L’s $2 million income provided the other requirements of subpart IC are satisfied. 410. Explanation: Though it is not incorporated in New Zealand, K is carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment here (ie, it has a fixed place of business here through which substantial business is carried on). Section IC 7(1) therefore does not prevent its New Zealand losses from being grouped. If K’s New Zealand branch operations had been profitable, those profits would have been liable to tax here under the DTA between New Zealand and the United States, as profits of an enterprise attributable to a permanent establishment. Residence of foreign companies 411. As noted at \[292\], a “foreign company” is a company not resident in New Zealand, and not treated as resident in New Zealand under a DTA (s YA 1). Section YD 3 sets out different tests to determine the country in which a foreign company is treated as resident for the purposes of the international tax rules. 412. Section YD 3 provides: YD 3 Country of residence of foreign companies When this section applies (1) This section applies for the purposes of the international tax rules to determine the country in which a foreign company is treated as resident for an accounting period. Liability to income tax (2) The company is treated as resident in a country if, at any time during the accounting period, it is liable to income tax in the country because any of the following is located in the country— (a) its domicile: (b) its residence: (c) its place of management: (d) any other criterion of a similar nature. Further rule: first application (3) Subsection (4) applies if the application of subsection (2) for an accounting period means that— (a) the company is resident in 2 or more countries: (b) the company is not resident in any country. Applying New Zealand rules (4) The company is treated as resident in the country in which— (a) it is incorporated: (b) it has its head office: (c) it has its centre of management: (d) its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company, even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside the country. Further rule: second application (5) The company is treated as resident in the country in which its centre of management is located for the accounting period if no 1 country of residence is identified under subsection (4). 69 Final rule (6) The Commissioner must determine the country of residence if no 1 country of residence is identified under subsection (5). 413. Section YD 3(2) provides that a foreign company will be treated as resident in a country if, at any time during the accounting period, it is liable to income tax in the country because its domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature is located in the country. If subs (2) results in the company being resident in multiple countries, or not in any country, the company will be treated (under subs (4)) as resident in the country in which it is incorporated, has its head office or centre of management, or in which its directors, in their capacity as such, exercise control of the company (even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside the country). If the application of subs (4) results in no one country of residence being identified, the company will be treated (under subs (5)) as resident in the country in which its centre of management is located for the accounting period. Finally, if the application of subs (5) results in no one country of residence being identified, subs (6) provides that the Commissioner must determine the country of residence. 70 Part 3: Residence and trusts Introduction 414. Trusts are not treated as separate entities for income tax purposes. Consequently, there are no rules in the Act governing the residence of trusts. The residence of the persons connected with the trust, ie, the settlor, trustee and beneficiary, determines the treatment of trust income. 415. The trust rules in the Act modify the general position that New Zealand residents are assessable on worldwide income and non-residents are assessable only on New Zealand-sourced income. In most cases the residence of the trustee is not relevant in determining the treatment of foreign-sourced trustee income; rather, the residence of the settlor is relevant. Therefore, if the tax residence of a settlor of a trust changes, there may be tax implications in relation to the treatment of trustee income. Beneficiary income is taxed according to the normal rules about residence and source, though there is a special rule in relation to beneficiaries who cease to be resident in New Zealand and become resident again within five years (see \[436\]). 416. This part provides an overview of the implications of the residence status of settlors, trustees and beneficiaries for the taxation of income derived by trustees of a trust. Before discussing the relevance of the residence of the persons connected with the trust, \[418\] – \[ 420\] set out when income will be beneficiary income and when it will be trustee income. Table – How trust income is taxed 417. The following table shows how trust income is taxed, depending on whether it is beneficiary income or trustee income, and on the residence of the persons connected with the trust. 71 1 And the trust was not, at any time in the income year, a superannuation fund, or a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust of which any settlor was resident in NZ when they died. 3 With the exception noted at \[424\]. 2 With the exceptions noted at \[426\]. Beneficiary income \[See \[420\] as to when amounts will be beneficiary income\] Beneficiary resident in NZ All beneficiary income is included as assessable income Beneficiary not resident in NZ Only NZ-sourced beneficiary income is included as assessable income NB Trustees are liable as agent for the income tax liability of a beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived Trustee income \[See \[419\] as to when amounts will be trustee income\] A settlor of the trust was resident (and not a transitional resident) in NZ at some point during the income year No settlor of the trust was resident (and not a transitional resident) in NZ at any point during the income year 1 NZ-sourced income is included as assessable income Foreign-sourced income is included as assessable income 2 Foreign-sourced income is exempt 3 Foreign-sourced income is not included as assessable income NB There is a special rule in relation to beneficiaries who cease to be resident in NZ and become resident again within five years – see \[436\] A trustee resident in NZ No trustee resident in NZ NZ-sourced income is included as assessable income How trust income is taxed 72 Trustee income and beneficiary income 418. The income derived from property held in trust is taxed as either beneficiary income or trustee income. Only trustees can claim deductions for expenditure or losses incurred in deriving the income. 419. Trustee income is the income derived by the trustee of a trust, to the extent to which it is not beneficiary income (s HC 7(1)). Certain beneficiary income derived by a minor will also be treated as if it were trustee income for the purposes of determining the relevant tax rate, paying the tax, and providing returns of income (s HC 7(2)). 420. Section HC 6 provides that an amount will be beneficiary income to the extent to which either it vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year, or it is paid to a beneficiary of the trust during the income year or by the later of:  a date within six months of the end of the income year, or  the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee files a return of income for the year, or - the date by which they must file a return for the year. Settlor residence Settlor residence and liability of trustee 421. Trustees are liable to tax on New Zealand-sourced trustee income as if they were an individual beneficially entitled to that income (s HC 24). This is the case whether or not the trustee or any settlor is resident in New Zealand. However, the residence of the settlor of the trust is relevant in determining whether foreign-sourced trustee income is liable to tax in New Zealand. 422. The residence of the settlor is determined under the rules contained in either s YD 1 or s YD 2, depending on whether the settlor is a natural person or a company. 423. A foreign-sourced amount derived by a New Zealand resident trustee will be exempt income (s HC 26) if:  no settlor of the trust is at any time during the relevant income year a New Zealand resident (who is not a transitional resident); and  the trust is not: - a superannuation fund, or - a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust of which any settlor was resident in New Zealand when they died (whether or not they died during the relevant income year). 424. There is another situation in which foreign-sourced amounts derived by a New Zealand resident trustee will not be exempt income under s HC 26. A New Zealand “resident foreign trustee” 16 of a foreign trust 17 must disclose to the Commissioner certain information relating to the trust (s 59B of the TAA 1994), and maintain certain financial and other records in relation to the trust (ss 22(2)(fb) and (m), 22(2C) and 22(7)(d) of the TAA 1994). Foreign-sourced amounts derived by the trustee may not be exempt income under s HC 26 if the trustee is convicted of a knowledge offence under s 143A of the TAA 1994 in connection with information relating to the income year in which the foreign- sourced amount is derived. This will be the case if the trustee is not a “qualifying 16 Defined in s 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA 1994). 17 Defined in s HC 11. 73 resident foreign trustee” (defined in s 3(1) of the TAA 1994). However, if the offence committed is an offence under s 143A(1)(b) of the TAA 1994 (knowingly not providing certain information to the Commissioner) and the required information is subsequently provided to the Commissioner, the foreign-sourced income will be exempt under s HC 26(1). 425. A foreign-sourced amount derived by a non-resident trustee will, subject to the exceptions noted at \[426\], be assessable income of the trustee (under s HC 25) if, at any time in the income year:  a settlor of the trust is a New Zealand resident (who is not a transitional resident); or  the trust is a superannuation fund; or  the trust is a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust of which: - a trustee is resident in New Zealand; and - any settlor was resident in New Zealand when they died (whether or not they died during the relevant income year). 426. The two exceptions to this (contained in s HC 25(3) and (4)) are where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand for the entire income year and either:  no settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987, and the trustee has not made an election referred to in s HZ 2 (an election under the Income Tax Act 1976 on or before 31 May 1989 to pay tax on trustee income); or  any settlement made on the trust after 17 December 1987 was made only by a settlor who was not resident in New Zealand at any time from 17 December 1987 up to (and including) the date of settlement. Settlor residence and liability of settlor 427. Under s HC 29, a settlor may be liable as agent of the trustee for income tax payable by the trustee on trustee income derived in an income year. This will be the case where the settlor has made a settlement to or for the benefit of a trust after 17 December 1987 (whether or not they settled property on the trust on or before that date), and the trustee derives trustee income in an income year in which the settlor is resident in New Zealand. Where there is more than one settlor to whom s HC 29 applies, the liability is joint and several. However, this rule does not apply:  to income tax that the trustee is liable for under s HC 32 (which relates to the trustee’s liability as agent for the tax liability of a beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived);  if the trust has a resident trustee for the whole income year, or if the first settlement was made during the income year, from the day of that settlement until the end of the income year;  where the trust is a charitable trust or a superannuation fund;  to the extent to which the trustee income is derived from the settlor remitting an amount under a financial arrangement to which either s EW 31 or s EZ 38 (which relate to base price adjustments) applies;  if the settlor is a natural person who was not resident at the time of any settlement on the trust, and had not after 17 December 1987 previously been resident in New Zealand (unless they have made an election under s HC 33 to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee); or 74  to the extent to which the settlor can establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that, having regard to the settlements made by that settlor and by other settlors, another settlor should be liable. 428. It is noted that where s HC 29 applies, the settlor is liable for tax on trustee income as agent for the trustee. Therefore, the trustee will remain liable for the tax on the trustee income. The provisions of subpart HD, dealing with the liability for tax of principals and agents, are relevant. Trustee residence 429. As noted at \[420\], s HC 6 provides that an amount will be beneficiary income to the extent to which either it vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year, or it is paid to a beneficiary of the trust during the income year or by the later of:  a date within six months of the end of the income year, or  the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee files a return of income for the year, or - the date by which they must file a return for the year. 430. The trustee of a trust is liable as agent for the income tax liability of the beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived (s HC 32). This liability, therefore, depends on the residence of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary is resident in New Zealand, the trustee is liable for tax as agent of the beneficiary on worldwide beneficiary income. If the beneficiary is resident outside New Zealand, the trustee is liable for tax as agent only in respect of New Zealand-sourced beneficiary income. 431. The residence of the trustee is generally not relevant in determining the treatment of trustee income: New Zealand-sourced trustee income is always subject to tax, and foreign-sourced trustee income is subject to tax on the basis of the residence of the settlor (see \[421\] – \[ 425\]). As noted at \[426\], there are two exceptions to this general principle where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand for the entire income year. 432. The trustee’s non-residence may also be relevant if they derive certain passive income having a New Zealand source. If the trustee derives non-resident passive income as defined in s RF 2, NRWT will be payable on that amount. 433. The residence of the trustee is determined under the rules contained in either s YD 1 or s YD 2, depending on whether the trustee is a natural person or a company. When a trust has co-trustees, the trustees are treated as a notional single person (s HC 2). Where one of the co-trustees is resident, then all of the co-trustees as the notional single person under s HC 2 are resident in that capacity. If all of the co-trustees are non-resident, then the notional single person under s HC 2 will be non-resident. Beneficiary residence 434. Beneficiaries are required to include in their assessable income all beneficiary income that they derive in an income year (ss HC 17 and CV 13). The normal rules about residence and source apply to determine which items of beneficiary income are included in the beneficiary’s assessable income. 435. When the beneficiary is resident in New Zealand the beneficiary will be required to include all beneficiary income in their assessable income (s BD 1). When the beneficiary is resident outside New Zealand, only New Zealand-sourced beneficiary income is included in assessable income. In this situation there will be an NRWT liability if the New Zealand-sourced income is non-resident passive 75 income. Income derived by a beneficiary from a trust will have a source in New Zealand to the extent to which the income of the trust fund has a source in New Zealand (s YD 4(13)). As noted at \[430\], the trustee of a trust is liable as agent for the income tax liability of the beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived (s HC 32). 436. There is a special rule in relation to beneficiaries who cease to be resident in New Zealand and who become resident again within five years of ceasing to be resident. In this situation, the beneficiary is treated as deriving income to the extent to which they would have been treated as deriving beneficiary income or taxable distributions from a foreign trust or a non-complying trust if they had remained in New Zealand during the period of their absence (ss CV 15 and HC 23). Any such income is treated as derived on the day on which the beneficiary becomes resident again (s CV 15). 437. The residence of a beneficiary is determined under the rules contained in either s YD 1 or s YD 2, depending on whether the beneficiary is a natural person or a company. Changes in residence 438. As noted at \[421\], the residence of settlors of trusts is relevant in determining whether a foreign-sourced amount of trustee income is liable to tax in New Zealand. If at any time in an income year a settlor of a trust is resident in New Zealand (and is not a transitional resident) foreign-sourced trustee income derived in that year will be taxed in New Zealand (subject to the exceptions noted at \[426\] in relation to foreign-sourced amounts derived by non-resident trustees). 439. Therefore, if the tax residence of any settlor of a trust changes, there could be tax implications. If there are no New Zealand resident settlors of a trust and then a settlor becomes resident in New Zealand (and is not a transitional resident) foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee in the year that the settlor became resident will generally be assessable. If a settlor ceases to be New Zealand resident and there are no other New Zealand resident settlors of the trust, foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee in the following year will be exempt (provided that no settlor is resident in New Zealand at any point in that income year). 440. If a settlor becomes resident in New Zealand, a settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust may be able to make an election (under s HC 33) to satisfy the trustee’s income tax liability in respect of the trustee income they have derived (see \[441\]). The person making the election is liable for the income tax payable by the trustee, other than income tax that the trustee is liable for as agent (HC 33(2)). Whether an election is made within the relevant 12-month period will determine the assessability of various distributions from the trust, and the rate at which they are taxed. If an election is made, the trust will be treated as noted at \[442\] and distributions will be taxed as noted at \[443\]. If an election is not made, the trust will be treated as noted at \[444\] and distributions will be taxed as noted at \[445\]. 441. A settlor, trustee or beneficiary of a trust may elect to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee if a settlor of the trust is a natural person who:  becomes a New Zealand resident (and is not a transitional resident); or  stops being a transitional resident and continues to be a New Zealand resident (either of these days is the “transition date”) provided that the trust would be a foreign trust in relation to a distribution if a distribution were made immediately before the settlor became resident (ss HC 30 and HC 33). 76 442. This election can be made at any time within 12 months of the transition date. If an election is made, the trust is treated:  as a foreign trust to the extent to which distributions consist of amounts derived by the trustee before the date of the election;  as a complying trust to the extent to which distributions consist of amounts derived by the trustee on or after the date on which the election is made if the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a) are met for the trustee income derived after the date of the election; and  as a non-complying trust for distributions that do not consist of amounts derived by the trustee before the date of the election, if the election is made but the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a) are not met. 443. If an election is made, distributions of income from the foreign trust portion will be assessable to beneficiaries at their normal rates. Distributions of amounts other than beneficiary income from the complying trust portion are not assessable to the beneficiary, as tax will already have been borne by the person who made the s HC 33 election. 444. If a s HC 33 election is not made within the 12-month period, the trust is treated:  as a foreign trust to the extent to which distributions consist of amounts derived by the trustee before the date of the election; and  as a non-complying trust to the extent to which distributions consist of amounts derived by the trustee after the time for making the election has expired. 445. If an election is not made, distributions of income from the foreign trust portion will be assessable to beneficiaries at their normal rates. Distributions of income (other than beneficiary income) and capital gains from the non-complying trust portion will be assessable at the rate of 45 per cent. 446. As noted at \[436\], there is also a special rule in relation to beneficiaries who cease to be resident in New Zealand and who become resident again within five years of ceasing to be resident. 77 References Related rulings/statements “Temporary exemption for transitional residents” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) “Temporary exemption from tax on foreign income for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) Subject references Residence Permanent place of abode 183-day rule Non-resident seasonal workers 325-day rule Government service rule Transitional residents Double tax agreements Permanent home Personal and economic relations Centre of vital interests Habitual abode Place of incorporation Head office Centre of management Director control Settlor residence Trustee residence Beneficiary residence Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007 – ss BD 1, BH 1(4), CF 3, CV 13, CV 15, CW 27, CW 28B, DB 6, DB 7, DB 8, DB 11, EW 5(17), EW 9, EW 29, EW 30, EW 31, EW 37(2), EX 24, EZ 38, FL 1, GB 37, HC 2, HC 6, HC 7, HC 10(1)(a), HC 11, HC 17, HC 23, HC 24, HC 25, HC 26, HC 29, HC 30, HC 32, HC 33, HR 8, HZ 2, IA 3, IC 3, IC 5, IC 6, IC 7, LJ 2, MA 8, MC 5, MD 7, OB 1, OB 2, OB 4(3)(b), OB 56(1), OB 60, OB 66, OC 1, RC 2, RC 3, RF 2, YA 1, YD 1, YD 2, YD 3 and YD 4, subparts EX, HD, and IC, and the definitions of “Australian ICA company”, “company”, “director”, “FIF superannuation interest”, “foreign company”, “international tax rules” and “New Zealand resident” in s YA 1 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – ss 2 and 8, and the definition of “resident” in s 2 Tax Administration Act 1994 – ss 22, 59B, 70(2) and 143A, and the definitions of “qualifying resident foreign trustee” and “resident foreign trustee” in s 3(1) Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 – the definition of “New Zealand-based” in s 4(1) Case references Case F138 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,237 Case F139 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,245 Case H97 (1986) 8 NZTC 664 Case J41 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,240 Case J98 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,555 Case Q55 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,313 Case U17 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,174 Case 10/2013 (2013) 26 NZTC 2-009, \[2013\] NZTRA 10 Case 11/2011 (2011) 25 NZTC 1-011, \[2011\] NZTRA 07 Case 12/2011 \[2011\] NZTRA 08, (2011) 25 NZTC 1-012 CIR v ER Squibb & Sons (NZ) Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,146 at 9,154 FCT v Applegate 79 ATC 4307 (FCAFC) Gaudreau v R 2005 DTC 66 (TCC) Hertel v MNR 93 DTC 721 Lingle v R 2010 FCA 152 NZ Forest Products Finance NV v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,073 Unit Construction Co Ltd v Bullock \[1959\] 3 All ER 831 (UKHL) Vinelight Nominees Limited and Weyand Investments Limited v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 655 Yoon v R 2005 DTC 1109 Other references G A Harris, New Zealand’s International Taxation, (Auckland, OUP, 1990) The OECD’s Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (1977), and related commentary The Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, 3 rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2013, accessed 3 March 2014) The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 596 UNTS 261 (opened for signature 24 April 1963, signed by New Zealand on 10 September 1974) The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 500 UNTS 95 (opened for signature 18 April 1961, ratified by New Zealand on 23 September 1970) The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1155 UNTS 331 (opened for signature 23 May 1969, ratified by New Zealand on 4 August 1971) 78 Appendix – Legislation Income Tax Act 2007 A1.

The focus of this statement is setting out how the Commissioner will treat a lump sum payment received under a settlement agreement for claims that (if successful) would have resulted in receipts of both a capital and revenue nature. 2. Whether a settlement payment is taxable depends on what it is paid for – in this case, what was given up in return for the payment – and its nature in the hands of the recipient. It is essential to first determine what a payment is for before determining whether apportionment is necessary. 3. It has been suggested that two High Court of Australia decisions: McLaurin v FCT (1961) 12 ATD 273 and Allsop v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 62 McLaurin and Allsop are authority for the proposition that, if an undissected settlement payment includes both capital and revenue amounts, the whole amount will be treated as capital. To the extent that McLaurin and Allsop stand for this proposition, the Commissioner’s view is that they would not be followed in New Zealand. Rather, where possible, New Zealand courts would seek a reasonable basis for apportioning a lump sum. 4. Given this, where a single undissected sum is received, it should be apportioned between its capital and revenue elements where possible. Any apportionment must be made on an objective basis. The starting point for determining an appropriate apportionment will be the settlement agreement and any related documents (for example, the statement of claim (if there is one)). Where necessary, the circumstances surrounding the agreement and other relevant evidence (such as evidence of any negotiations between the parties) should be considered. The onus of proof is on the taxpayer to show the apportionment is appropriate. 5. In the rare circumstance where the payment cannot be appropriately apportioned, the whole amount should be treated the same. Where the lump sum includes an 2 Classified Public amount that is taxable under a provision in Part C, the taxpayer has the burden of proving what part of the amount is not taxable. If a taxpayer is unable to show what part of a lump sum payment is capital, the Commissioner’s view is that generally the whole amount should be treated as income. Introduction 6. We have been asked to clarify the Commissioner’s position on how to treat lump sum payments made to settle claims partly capital and partly revenue in nature. There has been uncertainty as to how such payments should be treated. In particular, some people have taken the view that the lump sum should be treated as always wholly capital and, therefore, not subject to income tax. This is based on an interpretation of two High Court of Australia decisions: McLaurin v FCT (1961) 12 ATD 273 and Allsop v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 62. This item sets out the Commissioner’s view on this issue. Analysis How to determine whether an amount is capital or revenue 7. To decide whether a payment is capital or revenue, it is necessary to determine what the payment is for (Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA)). The character of a cause of action discharged by a payment will determine the nature of the payment (Federal Coke Pty Ltd v FCT 77 ATC 4255 (FCA)). Therefore, where a payment is received in return for settling claims, it is necessary to consider what the nature of any payment received would have been if those claims had been successful. A payment received to settle claims of a revenue nature would be revenue. A payment received to settle claims of a capital nature would be capital (Case V8 (2001) 20 NZTC 10,092). This is regardless of the nature of the legal rights to make the claims for payment – that is, whether made in contract or tort or under statute or in any other way in which a right to claim may arise (London & Thames Haven Oil Wharves Ltd v Attwooll \[1967\] 2 All ER 124 at 134 per Diplock LJ). 8. Sometimes a payment will be made to settle claims of both a capital and revenue nature. As discussed below, in the Commissioner’s view, generally such payments should be apportioned. An exception to this is where one of the advantages sought is ancillary or incidental to the other. In such a case it may be proper to characterise the payment as wholly capital or wholly revenue (Buckley & Young (at 61,275): Difficulties of characterisation may arise where the director or employee agrees to resign and to give a restrictive covenant. The proper conclusion may be that the payment secures one advantage and the other provision is merely ancillary or incidental, not affecting the character of the payment (cf. Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited v Dale (H.M. Inspector of Taxes) \[1932\] 1 K.B. 124, 139-140). In other cases distinct and separately identifiable advantages may be gained by the payment. There the payment is of a dual character. The statement of the problem highlights the importance of identifying the true character of the payment for which deduction is sought. \[Emphasis added\] In that case, it would not be necessary to go on and consider apportionment. 9. For an amount to be taxable, it must be “income” under a provision in Part C (and not exempt or excluded income). In the context of settlement payments, common provisions that could apply include s CB 1 (amounts derived from business) and s CE 1 (amounts derived in connection with employment). Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “revenue” amounts in this statement assume that a provision in Part C would apply to treat the amount as assessable income. 3 Classified Public 10. At issue is the tax treatment of a lump sum paid to settle claims of both a capital and revenue nature. Apportionment New Zealand approach 11. The Commissioner considers the approach of the New Zealand courts is to seek to apportion a payment into its capital and revenue elements wherever possible. This is demonstrated in Richardson J’s judgment in Buckley & Young – one of the leading New Zealand cases on apportionment. Although Buckley & Young considered the apportionment of expenditure rather than income, in the Commissioner’s view the same principles are relevant to both. Buckley & Young shows the approach of the New Zealand courts is to apportion where possible, rather than applying an all-or-nothing approach. However, an all-or-nothing approach can arise where the taxpayer fails to provide a reasonable basis for apportionment. 12. Buckley & Young concerned a series of agreements aimed at removing an unsatisfactory employee. The payments made were for both capital (restrictive covenant) and revenue (payment made to remove employee) elements. The contract did not specify how the amounts paid were to be apportioned. 13. Richardson J noted that the purpose of apportionment is to determine how much of an amount the parties have attributed to a particular item. This is done by considering the terms of the contract and, where relevant, the context and background to the agreement. Richardson J took the view that a situation where apportionment was impossible was likely to be rare and the fact an apportionment might be difficult was not, of itself, a reason not to apportion. 14. He also noted that “absolute precision” was not required, nor was it necessary that the apportionment could be “calculated by some kind of scientific process”. Apportionment cannot, however, be based on mere speculation and there must be sufficient evidence to justify the result. Ultimately, apportionment was not possible on the facts of that case as the taxpayer had not put forward any argument as to how apportionment should be made. 15. Case V8 considered the characterisation of a lump sum settlement payment. In that case, the taxpayer (the operator of a kiwifruit packhouse and storage facility) had filed a statement of claim alleging breach of contract by the supplier and manufacturer of an allegedly defective fruit-processing machine, misrepresentation and negligence. The taxpayer claimed compensation of $1,050,561.25. Mediation resulted in an out of court settlement under which the taxpayer received $170,000 from the designer of the machine and $100,000 from the manufacturer. The agreement included a denial of liability by all parties. It was also entered into in “full and final settlement of all issues between the parties in or in connection with” the proceedings. 16. Judge Barber considered that in determining the character of the settlement payment it was necessary to consider the statement of claim, the mediation agreement, the settlement agreement and the circumstances surrounding the case. As the mediation agreement referred to the attached settlement agreement and the statement of claim, these documents were intended to be read together. Judge Barber considered that the settlement payment was made to compensate the taxpayer for the losses specified in the statement of claim. 17. The taxpayer argued that, because the payment was received as a lump sum, it could not be apportioned between the ingredients of the original claim made by 4 Classified Public the taxpayer. Judge Barber held that, as the payment was made to compensate the taxpayer for loss of profits and for repair costs as per the statement of claim, the settlement payment was income, being compensation for revenue losses. The judgment suggests that if it had been established that the settlement payment was compensation for losses of both a capital and revenue nature, apportionment would have been required. Unlike in Allsop (considered in more detail below), the fact that the agreement included a general clause settling all issues between the parties was not seen as relevant – even though there may have been capital claims that the taxpayer could have (but did not) bring. Foregoing the right to sue was an incident of settlement; it did not characterise the payment. 18. Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603 related to personal grievance proceedings against an employer. The settlement agreement had been lost so the Taxation Review Authority had to consider whether (and how) a lump sum settlement payment should be apportioned (between revenue amounts (for loss of income) and capital amounts (for humiliation, loss of dignity and hurt feelings)). The taxpayer argued that the entire settlement payment was compensation for injury to feelings. 19. Judge Barber considered all of the available evidence and circumstances and chose to apportion the payments on a pro rata basis of the amounts claimed in the original proceedings. In his view, this was a fair apportionment (at 7,608): I consider that the non taxable element of the settlements needs to be now fixed by this Authority because it has heard the available evidence, and regardless of what limit may have been imposed by the Settlement Agreement. The issue must be what, in commercial and personal reality, was a fair apportionment of each settlement to compensation for feelings injury. \[Emphasis added\] 20. Sayer v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,249 involved an employment court award for wrongful dismissal. The Employment Court awarded Mr Sayer compensation including $62,142 as compensation for lost remuneration, $50,000 for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings and $5,000 for costs (a total of $117,142). Mr Sayer applied to wind up the company and also took action against the directors and shareholders of the company for any shortfall that he might suffer as a result of the company’s liability to him, as well as interest and exemplary damages. 21. Mr Sayer entered into a deed of settlement and assignment with the directors and shareholders of the company. At that time, the company owed Mr Sayer $130,944.30. Under the deed of settlement, in consideration of the amount of $100,000, Mr Sayer agreed to assign to a second company all claims that he might have against the company and to release the directors and shareholders from any claims that he had against them. The deed provided that $99,999 of the settlement amount (together with interest less withholding tax) was attributable to the consideration for the assignment of Mr Sayer’s claim against the company. 22. The Commissioner had assessed $50,000 as monetary remuneration and had attributed the other $50,000 to compensation for humiliation (capital). Mr Sayer argued that no part of the $100,000 was monetary remuneration as it was paid to bring about the discontinuance of his proceedings against the directors and shareholders (rather than to settle his dispute with the company). However, Doogue J considered that the deed of settlement made it clear that $99,999 of the settlement amount (together with interest less withholding tax) was attributable to the consideration paid for the assignment of the claim against the company and that it was not possible to go behind the deed. 5 Classified Public 23. The taxpayer also argued that the $100,000 could not be apportioned and must be considered as a whole. This was on the basis of McLaurin and Allsop (which are considered below). Doogue J rejected the taxpayer’s argument on the basis that it was not supported by the facts and distinguished McLaurin and Allsop on the basis that the settlement agreement in Sayer involved settling a claim for liquidated damages (which was squarely within one of the exceptions noted in McLaurin). 24. In Henwood v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271 the majority of the Court of Appeal (Richardson J and Hardie Boys J) held that payments received under a contract for services were partly capital in character as the payments were received in return for both acting services (income) and for the restraint of trade (capital). The majority also held the payments could be apportioned. 25. In determining an appropriate apportionment, Richardson J was willing to take into account the TRA’s finding as to what level of fee would have been commercial in the circumstances (ie attributing a value to that element of the contract). This, in conjunction with implications from the contract, provided the basis for Richardson J’s conclusion that the TRA’s apportionment was appropriate. 26. On the other hand, Hardie Boys J appears to have been trying to work out from the contract how much the parties intended to allocate to each element (which he found in clause 11 of their contract). In the absence of any indication to this eff ect, Hardie Boys J suggested that apportionment may have been impossible. Conclusion on New Zealand approach 27. The New Zealand courts have tended to take a broad approach to apportionment. The default position is that the courts will apportion where there is a reasonable basis for doing so. In determining an appropriate apportionment, the courts have looked at the documentation between the parties, as well as the relevant context and background. United Kingdom case law 28. Two United Kingdom cases directly on point are Wales v Tilley \[1943\] 1 All ER 280 (HL) and Carter v Wadman (1946) 28 TC 41 (UKCA). Both cases considered the apportionment of undissected lump sum settlement payments. 29. Wales v Tilley was a decision of the House of Lords (which was followed by the House of Lords more recently in Mairs (Inspector of Taxes) v Haughey \[1993\] 3 All ER 801). It concerned the managing director of a company. The company had agreed to pay Mr Tilley a salary of £6,000 a year and had also agreed to pay him a pension of £4,000 a year for 10 years after he ceased to be managing director. Mr Tilley agreed to release the company from the obligation to pay the pension and agreed to a reduced salary of £2,000 a year in consideration for a lump sum payment of £40,000 in two equal instalments. 30. The House of Lords held that, to the extent the payment was received for surrendering a right to a pension, it was capital and, to the extent the payment was made in consideration of a reduction of salary, it was income. There was nothing in the agreement that apportioned the amount between the two rights that had been surrendered. Nor was there any other evidence of agreement between the parties as to how the amount was calculated. 31. Viscount Simon noted that if the court considered tax was due under one head but not the other, the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Crown, had accepted the amount should be treated as apportionable. On the same point, Lord Thankerton commented that, on the issue of practicability, Mr Tilley’s accountants had 6 Classified Public provided a basis for apportionment. Lord Porter considered that although there were difficulties in determining the amount attributable to each component (which depended, for example, on when Mr Tilley’s employment ceased), it was not impossible to do so (at 285): It only remains, therefore, to see whether the sum attributable to the release of the pension can be separated from that payable for the reduction of salary. It was only faintly argued on behalf of the Crown that such a division was not possible; but it was said that there were no materials upon which such a calculation could be made inasmuch as the cessation of the salary and the commencement of the pension were dependent on many unascertainable matters, amongst others on the Appellant’s choice of the time of his retirement. No doubt there are difficulties but the resultant figure seems no more incalculable than, say, the length of time during which an injured workman would have continued to earn wages had he not received his injury, a period difficult no doubt to ascertain, but one which has constantly to be estimated in dealing with cases of personal injury. \[Emphasis added\] 32. Therefore, in considering whether an apportionment was possible, Lord Porter considered whether it was possible to objectively calculate the respective values of the rights given up in return for the lump sum payment. The fact the respective amounts would have to be estimated (as they could not be calculated exactly) did not mean apportionment was not possible. The case was referred back to the Special Commissioners to determine the appropriate apportionment. 33. A similar issue was considered by the UK Court of Appeal in Carter v Wadman. In that case, the taxpayer (Mr Carter) was employed as the resident manager of a public house for a salary of £10 per week plus a quarter share of the net profits of the business. The term of the agreement began on 30 January 1942 and ended on 24 June 1949. In 1942 the employer (Mrs Pierce) wished to assign the lease and the licence for the premises and to sell the goodwill, chattels and stock relating to the premises. Mr Carter’s consent to the assignment was required as it was a term of Mr Carter’s agreement with Mrs Pierce that she could not, without his consent, sublet or part with possession of any part of the premises or the goodwill or assets of the business, except in the ordinary course of business. 34. Mr Carter and Mrs Pierce entered into an agreement under which Mrs Pierce agreed to pay Mr Carter £2,000 in consideration of his agreeing to the transfer of the licence to the purchaser and in full settlement of “all past, present and future claims” he might have against her under the management contract. At the time the agreement was made Mr Carter had been paid his salary up to the cancellation date (2 December 1942), but his share of the profits for the 1942 year had not been calculated. In view of the agreement, Mr Carter could no longer make any claim against Mrs Pierce for a share of the profits. Subsequently, it was determined that Mr Carter’s share of the profits would have been £1,090. 35. The Court of Appeal had to determine whether any part of the £2,000 was employment income. It considered the payment was, in part, the price for the cancellation of the agreement and, in part, paid in settlement of past and present claims. One of the possible claims was for the taxpayer’s share of the profits up to 2 December 1942 (this would be employment income). The court considered it was possible to determine the value of the unexpired term of the agreement, at 52-53: Mr. Mustoe sought to argue that, as the consideration was one lump sum of £2,000, it was impossible to point to any portion of the £2,000 and say that it was a profit arising from his employment: but the Crown might equally well have argued that, as it was impossible to fix any sum which represented a capital payment, the whole must be income. ... But we respectfully agree with their Lordships \[in Wales v Tilley\] that in principle there must be apportionment, and we think that on the facts of the present case, though the calculation of the value to the Appellant of the unexpired portion of the agreement must be a matter of estimate, there is no insuperable difficulty in estimating its 7 Classified Public value. \[Emphasis added\] 36. It can be seen from this that the court was concerned with apportioning the lump sum based on the values of the respective elements. Consistent with Wales v Tilley, there was no consideration given to trying to determine any agreement between the parties as to how the amount was made up. This emphasis on valuation is consistent with the order the court gave regarding apportionment when referring the case back to the General Commissioners. 37. The court found apportionment should be made on the basis of the proportion the sum of £1,090 (the share of the profits to which the taxpayer would have been entitled) bore to the aggregate of £1,090 and the sum the taxpayer would have been entitled to recover from Mrs Pierce as damages for breach of the employment contract, if he had been paid his salary and a share of profits up to cancellation date and had then repudiated the contract. Australian case law 38. The leading Australian cases on this issue are the High Court of Australia decisions in McLaurin and Allsop. The taxpayer in McLaurin had made claims for a total amount of £30,240 as compensation for damage to property as a result of a fire that had spread from a property owned by the Commissioner of Railways. Some of the claims were for amounts that were capital in nature and some for amounts that were revenue in nature. The Commissioner of Railways made a settlement offer of £12,350 and the taxpayer accepted it “in full settlement of all claims for damage arising out of” the fire. 39. The £12,350 lump sum offer was based on a valuation of the items of property for which the claims had been made, as carried out by a valuer employed by the Commissioner of Railways. There had been various discussions between the valuer and the taxpayer in the course of the valuer arriving at his valuation. However, the court found no information was given to the taxpayer as to how the amount was arrived at. 40. The Commissioner considered £11,000 of the compensation was income, being compensation for the revenue items claimed, determined on the basis of the valuation. The court accepted the valuation was based on a list of items supplied by the taxpayer and the taxpayer could make a confident guess as to the amount allowed by the valuer for each item claimed. However, the court considered the character of the payment in the hands of the recipient could not be determined by the payer’s (the Commissioner of Railways) uncommunicated reasons for agreeing to pay the amount. The court considered the offer made and accepted was for a single undissected amount (not payments for each individual item claimed). 41. The court accepted that it may be appropriate to apportion a single payment of a mixed nature made in settlement of specific claims where at least some of the claims are for liquidated amounts or are amounts that are “otherwise ascertainable by calculation”. In this context, the court referred to Carter v Wadman and Wales v Tilley. It gave Carter v Wadman as an example of a case that included liquidated claims and Wales v Tilley as an example of a case where some of the distinct claims were ascertainable by calculation. 42. However, the court considered apportionment was not appropriate where a payment is made only for claims for unliquidated damages under a compromise that treats the payment as a single undissected payment. In such circumstances, the amount must be considered as a whole. The court considered the damage caused by the fire (whether included in the taxpayer’s claim or not) was 8 Classified Public compensated for by one entire sum. There was no factual basis for the Commissioner’s argument that the settlement payment was income on the basis it had the same character as the profits the taxpayer would otherwise have derived. The court, therefore, held the entire sum was capital in nature. 43. The court was concerned with establishing what the parties had agreed the amount was paid for. It was not relevant what one party had originally claimed was payable. It was also not relevant what the other party was willing to pay for (ie the uncommunicated reasons of the payer for making the payment were not relevant). Further, there was no discussion of the possibility of valuing the respective claims given up and apportioning on that basis. This may be because the parties had not argued the case on this basis. 44. Allsop concerned a taxpayer who was in the transport business. The taxpayer had paid the Commissioner for Motor Transport permit fees totalling £54,868 and had been allowed deductions for the permit fees. Following a decision by the Privy Council that the fees were not legally payable, the taxpayer sought recovery of the fees paid on the basis that the amounts had been improperly demanded under the colour of office. A settlement was negotiated under which the taxpayer was paid £37,500. 45. The settlement deed was made without any admission of liability on the part of the Government and the Commissioner for Motor Transport. The deed provided that, in consideration of the payment, the taxpayer released the Government and the Commissioner for Motor Transport from all actions, suits, proceedings, causes of action, arbitrations, debts, dues, demands, costs, charges and expenses the taxpayer had in connection with or arising out of anything done or omitted to be done under the relevant legislation. 46. The High Court of Australia rejected the Commissioner’s argument that, as the payment was a refund of expenditure for which a deduction had been allowed, the amount was income. The court considered there was no factual basis for the Commissioner’s argument. 47. Barwick CJ and Taylor J considered the taxpayer would have had valid claims against the Commissioner for unlawful interference with the taxpayer’s vehicles and his business (even though no such claims had been made by the taxpayer). As the settlement deed provided the amount was paid for the release of all potential claims, Barwick CJ and Taylor J considered the entire payment was made by way of compromise of all claims the taxpayer had. No part of the payment was attributable solely to the refund of the fees paid. 48. Windeyer J held the consideration for the payment was the release of a variety of claims the taxpayer had or might be thought to have had against the Government. No part of the payment was received as a refund of permit fees paid by the taxpayer. In particular, Windeyer J appears to have been seeking evidence as to how the parties had calculated the amount before he would have been willing to apportion (at 65): It does not appear from the material before us that the sum of £37,000, or any definite part of it, was computed, paid and received as a refund of particular amounts that had been paid by the appellant for road charges and which had been allowed as deductions in the assessment of his taxable income. 49. The court did not consider attempting to value the respective claims given up. Rather the court seems to have been looking for evidence as to how the parties calculated the amount (ie what they agreed the amount was paid for). As the agreement contained (and, in that case, was limited to) a general release clause covering all potential claims, it was not possible to determine that any specific 9 Classified Public amount was paid for any specific claim. The court, therefore, found the whole amount should be treated as capital. 50. McLaurin and Allsop have also been followed in later Australian decisions. In determining whether apportionment is possible, the courts have sought evidence of agreement between the parties as to how the amount was calculated. See, for example, FCT v Spedley Securities Ltd 88 ATC 4126 (FCA) at 4128: After negotiation, an entire sum of $200,000 was accepted. Its payment was the subject of agreement, but there was no agreement as to the way in which it was made up. The evidence as to the way the settlement was seen, from one side or another is scant. \[Emphasis added\] 51. The Court held that the entire amount was capital as the payment was received as a lump sum, the ingredients of which were not identified, so there was no basis for apportionment. Conclusion on apportionment 52. In the Commissioner’s view, the Australian and UK courts have taken different approaches to apportioning lump sum settlement payments. The courts in Wales v Tilley and Carter v Wadman were willing to accept apportionments based on objectively estimated values for different elements of the agreements. On the other hand, the High Court of Australia in McLaurin and Allsop seemed concerned with trying to find evidence of agreement between the parties as to how the lump sum was made up. In the absence of this, the courts found that no apportionment was possible. 53. Although McLaurin distinguished Wales v Tilley and Carter v Wadman, this, arguably, does not fully explain the different approaches to apportionment. The fact the agreement in Carter v Wadman included a liquidated amount did not appear to assist the court with determining any agreement between the parties. It was not a case where the court concluded an amount equal to the amount of the liquidated damages (in that case £1,090) was allocated to that head. In such a situation, it would be easier to argue that the parties had implicitly agreed on the amount to be allocated. However, the court found the £2,000 was paid as a lump sum to cover all of the rights given up. It found that £2,000 had to be apportioned according to the respective values of the different claims. In this regard, the fact there was an amount of liquidated damages was of no more assistance to the court than any other right that could be valued. 54. Similarly, the amounts making up the lump sum in Wales v Tilley do not seem to be any more easily “ascertainable by calculation” than the amounts in McLaurin or Allsop. 55. Neither McLaurin and Allsop nor Wales v Tilley and Carter v Wadman have been applied in New Zealand. The court in Sayer did suggest that, if the facts had been different, the taxpayer would have been able to argue that McLaurin and Allsop applied – however, this does not mean that such an argument would necessarily have been accepted. Rather, in the Commissioner’s view, the broad approach taken in New Zealand apportionment cases is more consistent with the UK approach than the Australian one. It has been suggested that McLaurin and Allsop are authority for the proposition that, if an undissected settlement payment includes both capital and revenue amounts, the whole amount will be treated as capital. To the extent that McLaurin and Allsop stand for this proposition, the Commissioner’s view is that they would not be followed in New Zealand. Rather, where possible, New Zealand courts would seek a reasonable basis for apportioning a lump sum. 10 Classified Public 56. It is noted that McLaurin and Allsop have also been judicially criticised by the High Court of Australia (see FCT v CSR Ltd No S278 of 2000, 23 November 2001). In that case, the Commissioner was seeking leave to appeal to the High Court. He argued that McLaurin and Allsop should be overturned despite their longevity. Ultimately, although critical of McLaurin and Allsop, the High Court denied the application for leave to appeal. This was because the cases had stood for (at that time) 40 years and Parliament had not chosen to overturn them by legislation. This was despite a recommendation by the Asprey Committee in 1975 that specific legislation be introduced to apportion on a valuation basis. As McLaurin and Allsop have never been applied in New Zealand, the High Court’s reasons for not considering overturning McLaurin and Allsop are not relevant. However, their criticisms are equally valid in New Zealand as in Australia. How should an appropriate apportionment be determined? 57. Any apportionment must be undertaken on an objective basis. The ultimate aim of apportionment is to determine what the amount was paid for and to split it into its capital and revenue parts. As well as considering any settlement agreement, it is likely to be necessary to look at the surrounding circumstances and other, related documentation. 58. Where it can be established that the parties to the settlement have agreed how the payment is made up, this will generally be an appropriate basis for determining the apportionment between capital and revenue amounts. However, the Commissioner may not accept such an apportionment where taking into account the relevant circumstances, the amount allocated to the capital element is excessive, the agreement is a sham, or the agreement is part of a tax avoidance arrangement (see Case S96 at 7,606). 59. Often there will be no agreement between the parties as to how the lump sum was made up. The nature of settlement agreements is that they represent a compromise between parties with competing interests. For example, an employee may want a higher payment for hurt and humiliation, but their employer may prefer a higher payment for lost wages. Other times, the parties may care only about the total amount of the payment and may not have given any thought as to how it is made up. 60. Where there is no (or insufficient) evidence of how the parties intended the amount to be apportioned, it may be appropriate to calculate (or estimate) the value of the respective claims given up in return for the payment. 61. The terms of any statement of claim should be considered. How helpful a statement of claim is will depend on the particular circumstances. For example, a statement of claim is likely to be highly relevant where there is an express link to it in the settlement agreement (as in Case V8). At the other end of the spectrum, if the dispute was settled on a different basis to the statement of claim, it may be of little or no relevance in determining an appropriate apportionment (see du Cros v Ryall (1935) 19 TC 444 (KBD)). In situations in between, it is likely to be of some assistance along with evidence of later negotiations between the parties. 62. Evidence of negotiations between the parties prior to settlement and other background facts may also be relevant if they help determine what the payment was made for. 63. The relevance of a general clause releasing a party from all liability will be similarly fact dependent. In some circumstances, it will be included as an incidental element of a settlement agreement (as in Case V8 and Sayer). In other cases, it may be intended to cover one or more claims (as in Carter v 11 Classified Public Wadman). This will generally be a question of characterisation, rather than apportionment. As discussed above, it is essential to work out what the payment is for before considering apportionment. In Allsop the agreement consisted entirely of a general release clause. In the Commissioner’s view, no apportionment would be required on the facts of Allsop as the full payment was made to settle a claim by the taxpayer of a revenue nature. 64. All relevant factors need to be considered when determining a reasonable basis for apportionment. Amounts that cannot be apportioned 65. In the Commissioner’s view, it will be possible to find an appropriate basis for apportionment in most situations. The taxpayer has the burden of proving that any apportionment is reasonable. Where a taxpayer does not make an apportionment, the Commissioner may, depending on the relevant facts and the information available, make an apportionment that the Commissioner considers is fair and reasonable. 66. There may be rare situations where no apportionment is possible. In these cases, the whole amount received should be treated the same. As noted above, for an amount to be taxable, it must be “income” under a provision in Part C. Where no part of the amount comes within a provision in Part C, none of the amount will be taxable. 67. However, where the lump sum includes an amount that is taxable under a provision in Part C, the taxpayer has the burden of proving what part of the amount is not taxable. If a taxpayer is unable to show what part of a lump sum payment is capital, the Commissioner’s view is that generally the whole amount should be treated as income. This is consistent with Buckley & Young (at 61,283): If there is insufficient evidence to arrive at a conclusion, any answer must be mere speculation and the taxpayer will have failed to discharge the onus of proof upon him ... 68. See also Case S96 at 7,606: Where the Commissioner has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, he may ask the parties to an agreement what steps they took to evaluate objectively what would be a reasonable amount to attribute to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. This would be so regardless of whether the payment was made as a result of an out of court settlement and whether or not the agreement is settled by the Human Rights Commissioner under the Human Rights Act. The onus of proof regarding the taxability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer. \[Emphasis added\] References Subject references Income Tax Lump sum Settlement payment Case references Allsop v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 62 (HCA) Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA) Carter v Wadman (1946) 28 TC 41 (UKCA) Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603 Case V8 (2001) 20 NZTC 10,092 du Cros v Ryall (1935) 19 TC 444 (KBD) FCT v CSR Ltd No S278 of 2000, 23 November 2001 Federal Coke Pty Ltd v FCT 77 ATC 4255 (FCA) Henwood v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271 (CA) McLaurin v FCT (1961) 12 ATD 273 (HCA) FCT v Spedley Securities Ltd 88 ATC 4126 (FCA) Wales v Tilley \[1943\] 1 All ER 280 (HL)

Double taxation occurs when two or more countries or territories (referred to as “states” for the purposes of this Interpretation Statement) tax the same taxpayer on the same income or gains. Many states tax residents on their worldwide income, including income sourced in a foreign state. States also tax non- residents on income sourced in that state. This can result in the same income being taxable under the tax laws of both states, based on residence and source respectively. 2. To relieve double taxation, a New Zealand tax resident taxpayer may be entitled to claim a foreign tax credit against their New Zealand income tax liability for any foreign income tax paid. There are two circumstances where a taxpayer may be entitled to claim a foreign tax credit:  if the foreign tax is covered by a Double Tax Agreement (DTA), a credit may be allowed under, and in accordance with, the terms of that DTA; or  if the foreign tax is not covered by a DTA, a foreign tax credit may be allowed directly under subpart LJ. 3. This Interpretation Statement explains how to claim a foreign tax credit where a foreign tax is covered by a DTA. A foreign tax is covered by a DTA if it is:  expressly listed in the “Taxes covered” article of the DTA (typically art 2); or  a tax on income or capital as defined in art 2(1) and (2) of the DTA; or  a subsequently enacted tax that is “identical or substantially similar” to one of the taxes covered by the DTA (typically art 2(4)). 4. If a tax is covered by a DTA, then the DTA will determine whether a foreign tax credit is available. If a foreign tax credit is available, the amount of that credit will be calculated under subpart LJ. If a foreign tax credit is not available, then there will be no foreign tax credit relief. 5. A foreign tax is not covered by a DTA if:  New Zealand does not have a DTA with the state imposing the foreign tax; or  there is a DTA between New Zealand and the state imposing the foreign tax, but the foreign tax is not a tax that the DTA applies to. 6. Where a tax is not covered by a DTA, a taxpayer may still be entitled to a foreign tax credit under subpart LJ. Taxpayers should refer to Interpretation Statement IS 14/02: “Income tax – foreign tax credits – what is a tax of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under s BB 1?” in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 5 (June 2014): 3, for further guidance. 4 Introduction 7. The following flowchart is intended as a useful framework for analysing a foreign tax credit issue. However, the flowchart is not meant to be a replacement for carefully reading and applying the relevant legislation. 5 8. After confirming that a taxpayer has paid tax outside New Zealand on their income or gains, the flowchart then looks at the domestic law preliminary requirements for foreign tax credits (ss LJ 1 and LJ 2) before considering the potential application of the DTA. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this is the most logical place to start. If you do not apply domestic law first, then you will not know if you have a New Zealand income tax liability. Without this knowledge you will not be able to determine if you are subject to double taxation. 9. This approach is consistent with most international tax law commentary. However, the Commissioner accepts there may be other approaches to analysing foreign tax credit issues. 10. This Interpretation Statement does not attempt to explain every element of the flowchart. Instead, it focuses on how the foreign tax credit rules work where a foreign tax is covered by a DTA. If a taxpayer has paid foreign tax that is not covered by a DTA, they should refer to IS 14/02 for further guidance. 11. This Interpretation Statement does not consider how the foreign tax credit rules apply to trusts, controlled foreign companies, foreign investment funds, partnerships or fiscally transparent (look-through) entities. Analysis 12. This Interpretation Statement is set out in two parts. The first part explains how the foreign tax credit rules work when a foreign tax is covered by a DTA and follows the structure set out in the flowchart. The second part contains worked examples that illustrate some of the issues discussed. Have you paid tax outside New Zealand on your income or gains? 13. The first step in the flowchart asks: have you paid tax outside New Zealand on your income or gains? This is a question of fact. If tax has not been paid outside New Zealand on income or a gain, there will be no double taxation requiring foreign tax credit relief. Different rules exist if a tax sparing article applies. Apply the Act - preliminary requirements – subpart LJ 14. Section LJ 2(1) provides that a person is entitled to a foreign tax credit for an amount of foreign income tax paid on a segment of foreign-sourced income: LJ 2 Tax credits for foreign income tax Amount of credit (1) A person described in section LJ 1(2)(a) has a tax credit for a tax year for an amount of foreign income tax paid on a segment of foreign-sourced income, determined as if the segment were the net income of the person for the tax year. The amount of the New Zealand tax payable is calculated under section LJ 5. 15. A person described in s LJ 1(2)(a) is a person who is resident in New Zealand and derives assessable income that is sourced from outside New Zealand. 16. Section LJ 1(2)(b) provides that a foreign tax credit will not be allowed for any unrecognised taxes listed in sch 27 (there are currently none listed). 17. Based on ss LJ 1(2) and LJ 2(1), to be eligible for a foreign tax credit a taxpayer must:  be tax resident in New Zealand, and  have derived foreign-sourced income, and  have that foreign-sourced income assessable under the Act, and  have paid foreign income tax on that foreign-sourced income. 6 18. Each requirement must be satisfied positively. Failure to satisfy any one of the requirements will mean that a taxpayer will not be eligible for foreign tax credit relief, as there will be no New Zealand tax liability against which a credit can be claimed. These requirements are domestic law requirements and should first be determined without reference to the DTA. 19. The first three preliminary requirements are considered below. The fourth requirement is considered separately at \[167\]. Are you tax resident in New Zealand? 20. The rules for determining tax residence status for individuals (including transitional residents) and companies are summarised below. Interpretation Statement IS 16/03: “Tax residence” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016) comprehensively explains these rules. Taxpayers should refer to this Interpretation Statement for further guidance. Individuals 21. Section YD 1 determines the residence of natural persons (individuals). An individual is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period (s YD 1(3). The person will then be treated as resident from the first of those 183 days (s YD 1(4)). A person is also resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere (s YD 1(2)). A person who is resident by virtue only of the 183-day rule will stop being a New Zealand resident if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period (s YD 1(5)). The person will then be treated as not resident from the first of those 325 days (s YD 1(6)). 22. However, the permanent place of abode test is the overriding residence rule for individuals. This means that a person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period will remain a New Zealand resident if they continue to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Equally, a person who is present in New Zealand for less than 183 days in a 12-month period is still a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. A person who is absent for more than 325 days in a 12-month period, but who has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at any time during that period, cannot cease to be resident any earlier than the day they lose their permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 23. There are also special residence rules for government servants and seasonal workers (s YD 1(7) and (11)). Transitional residents 24. Transitional residents are resident in New Zealand for tax purposes but are eligible for tax exemptions on certain income. 25. New migrants and returning New Zealanders may be transitional residents under s HR 8(2) if they meet the necessary requirements. If a person is a transitional resident they are temporarily entitled to tax exemptions (s CW 27) for all foreign- sourced income except for:  employment income in connection with employment or service performed while the person is a transitional resident; and  income from a supply of services. 26. IS 16/03 explains in more detail the requirements for transitional resident status and when this special status starts (on the date a person becomes a New Zealand tax resident under s YD 1 – either by acquiring a permanent place of abode or by 7 meeting the requirements of the 183-day rule) and ends (usually at the end of the 48th month after the month in which the person acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or satisfied the 183-day rule, (ignoring the back-dating rule in s YD 1(4)) whichever is earlier. Transitional resident status may also end on the day before the date where a person stops being a New Zealand resident or on the date on which they stop being a transitional resident because they elect not to be one under s HR 8(4) or (5). 27. Transitional residents will satisfy this preliminary requirement because they are tax resident in New Zealand. However, \[43\] below explains why transitional residents may ultimately be ineligible for foreign tax credit relief on their exempt income. Companies 28. “Company” is defined in s YA 1. The definition is broad and extends to any entity with a legal existence separate from that of its members. 29. Section YD 2 sets out the tax residence tests for companies: YD 2 Residence of companies Four bases for residence (1) A company is a New Zealand resident for the purposes of this Act if— (a) it is incorporated in New Zealand: (b) its head office is in New Zealand: (c) its centre of management is in New Zealand: (d) its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company in New Zealand, even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside New Zealand. International tax rules (2) Despite subsection (1), for the purpose of the international tax rules, a company is treated as remaining resident in New Zealand if it becomes a foreign company but is resident in New Zealand again within 183 days afterwards. ... 30. IS 16/03 considers the test for company tax residence in detail. Taxpayers should refer to that Interpretation Statement for further details. Conclusion 31. Whether an individual or a company is tax resident in New Zealand will be a question of fact. If they are not tax resident in New Zealand, there will be no foreign tax credit relief available in New Zealand. Is the income or gain sourced from outside New Zealand? Source rules 32. To be eligible for a foreign tax credit, a taxpayer must have derived income sourced from outside New Zealand. “Income sourced from outside New Zealand” is not defined in the Act. However, s YA 1 does define “foreign-sourced amount” (which is a comparable term also used in s LJ 1(1)): foreign-sourced amount means an amount of income that is not treated as having a source in New Zealand under sections YD 4 (Classes of income treated as having New Zealand source) and YZ 1 (Source rule for interest) 8 33. Section YA 1 defines “foreign-sourced amount” by what it is not. If it is not one of the classes of income treated as having a source in New Zealand 1 under ss YD 4 or YZ 1, it will be a foreign-sourced amount. 34. Section YD 4 lists the classes of income that are treated as having a source in New Zealand. The list includes income derived from a business wholly carried on in New Zealand, income derived from a contract made in New Zealand, income earned in New Zealand, and pensions payable in New Zealand, to name a few. Section YD 4(18) is the catch-all provision that includes income derived directly or indirectly from any other source in New Zealand. 35. Section YZ 1 supplements the rules in s YD 4(11), which relate to income from debt instruments. 36. Income not treated as sourced in New Zealand under ss YD 4 and YZ 1 will be sourced from outside New Zealand. For ease of reference, this Interpretation Statement refers to this income as “foreign-sourced income”. Section LJ 1(4) – an additional source rule for dividends 37. Section LJ 1(4) is an additional source rule for dividends. It ensures that a New Zealand resident can claim a foreign tax credit for foreign withholding tax paid on a dividend received from a non-resident company. Section LJ 1(4) treats the dividend as being derived in that foreign territory. Apportionment 38. Foreign-sourced income may also have a source in New Zealand. Section YD 5 permits certain classes of foreign-sourced income to be apportioned. Under s YD 5, if a business is partly carried on outside New Zealand, then the income derived outside New Zealand will be foreign-sourced income (to the extent it is apportioned to that source). Apportionment is also permitted under s YD 5 where income is derived under a contract made in New Zealand and performed in whole or in part by a person outside New Zealand (or alternatively, where a contract is made outside New Zealand and performed in whole or in part by a person in New Zealand). The apportionment is to be undertaken on an arm’s length basis. Conclusion 39. Income that is not deemed to have a source in New Zealand under ss YD 4, YD 5, YZ 1 or LJ 1(4), will be foreign-sourced income. If the income is not foreign- sourced income, foreign tax credit relief will be unavailable. Is the income or gain assessable in New Zealand? 40. To be eligible for a foreign tax credit, the foreign-sourced income or gain (on which foreign income tax is paid) must also be assessable income in New Zealand. If the foreign-sourced income or gain is not assessable income in New Zealand, there will be no double taxation to relieve. 41. Section BD 1(1) provides that an amount is income of a person if it is their income under Part C of the Act. This amount will be assessable income under s BD 1(5) if it is not exempt income, excluded income or non-residents’ foreign- sourced income. All relevant definitions are at s BD 1. 42. Taxpayers must work through Part C and the definitions in s BD 1 to determine whether the foreign-sourced income or gain is assessable income in New Zealand. 1 “New Zealand” is defined in s YA 1 and includes the continental shelf and the water and air space above any part of the continental shelf that is beyond New Zealand’s territorial sea, as defined in s 3 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977. 9 Transitional residents 43. A transitional resident will not be eligible for a foreign tax credit for any foreign- sourced income that is subject to the s CW 27 tax exemption. This is because the foreign-sourced income will not be assessable income in New Zealand. 44. However, not all of a transitional resident’s income is exempt. Section CW 27(a) and (b) exclude from the tax exemption foreign-sourced employment income in connection with employment or services performed while the person is a transitional resident, and foreign-sourced income from a supply of services. Such income will be assessable income of the transitional resident and therefore potentially eligible for foreign tax credit relief. This is illustrated in the example at \[47\]. Conclusion 45. If the income or gain is not assessable in New Zealand, there will be no foreign tax credit relief because there will be no New Zealand income tax liability against which a credit can be claimed. 46. A taxpayer must satisfy all of the above preliminary requirements to be eligible for a foreign tax credit. Example illustrating the application of the preliminary requirements for a transitional resident 47. The following example illustrates the application of the preliminary requirements for a transitional resident. Example 1 – preliminary requirements and transitional residents Lucy recently migrated to New Zealand and is a transitional resident under s HR 8(2). Lucy is therefore a New Zealand tax resident but is exempt from income tax on certain items of foreign- sourced income. Prior to migrating, Lucy had been tax resident in the United Kingdom for 10 years. During her first tax year as a transitional resident, Lucy derives investment income from the United Kingdom. Lucy wants to know if she is entitled to claim a foreign tax credit for the United Kingdom income tax that she has paid on that investment. Under s CW 27, Lucy’s investment income is exempt from income tax in New Zealand. The investment income therefore fails the third preliminary requirement because the income is not assessable to Lucy in New Zealand. This means Lucy is not eligible for a foreign tax credit, as there is no New Zealand income tax liability against which a credit can be claimed. During her first tax year as a transitional resident, Lucy returns to the United Kingdom and derives employment income while there. This income is taxed at source in the United Kingdom. Section CW 27(a) states that this income is not subject to the transitional resident exemption, so the income is also assessable to Lucy in New Zealand. Lucy will therefore suffer double taxation, although she may be entitled to a foreign tax credit under the New Zealand/United Kingdom DTA. Example 9 of this Interpretation Statement considers whether Lucy would be entitled to a foreign tax credit under the DTA. 10 Is there a DTA in force between New Zealand and the source state? 48. The next step in the flowchart is to determine whether there is a DTA in force between New Zealand and the source state. This will decide whether any potential foreign tax credit arises under the DTA or under domestic law. What is a DTA? 49. A DTA (also known as a double tax convention or tax treaty) is an international agreement entered into between the Government of New Zealand and the government of any state outside New Zealand (s BH 1(1)). 50. One of the main purposes of a DTA is to eliminate double taxation. Double taxation occurs when two or more states tax the same taxpayer on the same income or gains. Many states tax residents on their worldwide income, including income sourced in a foreign state. States also tax non-residents on income sourced in that state. This can result in the same income being taxable under the tax laws of both states, based on residence and source respectively. 51. A DTA may eliminate double taxation by allocating the right to tax in one of three ways. It could give New Zealand an exclusive right to tax the income, so that the source state must give up the right to tax that income. It could give the source state the exclusive right to tax the income, so that New Zealand must give up the right to tax that income. Thirdly, it could give the source state an unlimited or limited right to tax while preserving New Zealand’s right to tax. In the third scenario, New Zealand will provide a foreign tax credit up to any limit imposed on the source state. (The allocation articles are discussed in greater detail below from \[139\].) 52. Where double taxation arises, and it is not relieved by the application of an allocation article, a DTA will identify a method for relieving that double taxation. In New Zealand’s DTAs, this is usually by way of a foreign tax credit. 53. Many of New Zealand’s DTAs have one or more protocols that must be read alongside the DTA. A protocol is a treaty that clarifies, implements or modifies the provisions of the DTA. When reading a DTA, it is important to check for any protocols, as they may change the meaning of the DTA. 54. Most of New Zealand’s DTAs follow a similar format, based on the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital 2 (the Model Convention). The Model Convention is accompanied by the OECD Model Tax Convention Commentary (the Model Commentary), which provides commentary on the articles of the Model Convention 3 . 55. It is important to remember, however, that each DTA is negotiated separately and consequently no two DTAs are exactly the same. Care needs to be taken when applying a DTA to ensure that the actual words of the relevant article have been considered. Does New Zealand have a DTA with the source state? Has that DTA entered into force and taken effect? Has the DTA been replaced or terminated? 56. Inland Revenue’s website has a list of states that New Zealand has entered into DTAs with: www.ird.govt.nz/international/residency/dta/ . Inland Revenue’s Tax Policy website has more detailed DTA information, including the text of the DTAs 2 OECD, Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014, (OECD Publishing, Paris, 2014). 3 The relevance of the Model Convention and the Model Commentary for interpreting DTAs is considered at \[70\]. 11 and the related protocols: www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tax-treaties . This site also includes information such as:  when the DTA was signed;  the status of the DTA (ie, whether in force or not); and  when the DTA became effective. 57. The site also lists DTAs that have been signed but are not yet in force, and includes a list of states that New Zealand is currently negotiating DTAs or protocols with. 58. All of New Zealand’s DTAs contain an article that explains when the DTA will enter into force and when it has effect from (see art 30 of the Model Convention). A DTA typically enters into force once it has been incorporated into the domestic law of both states and each state has notified the other that this process has been completed. 59. Once a DTA has been signed, it needs to be incorporated into New Zealand law. This is done by an Order in Council. The Order in Council incorporates the text of the DTA and any protocols to the DTA into New Zealand’s domestic law. For example, the New Zealand/United Kingdom DTA is part of New Zealand’s domestic law by Order in Council: Double Taxation Relief (United Kingdom) Order 1984. 60. The DTA will also explain when it takes effect from. Once entered into force, a DTA usually takes effect from the next income year. For example, the New Zealand/United Kingdom DTA notes at art 27(1)(b) that the DTA shall have effect “in New Zealand: for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following the date on which the Convention enters into force.” Some DTAs may come into effect at different times for different taxes. It is therefore important to ensure not just that the DTA is in force, but that it has also taken effect. 61. Finally, taxpayers need to ensure that the DTA has not been replaced or terminated. 62. If there is no DTA between New Zealand and the source state, a taxpayer may still be eligible for foreign tax credit relief under subpart LJ, provided the foreign tax paid is of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under s BB 1 (s YA 2(5)). IS 14/02 contains further guidance. How to interpret a DTA The Vienna Convention 63. A DTA is both an international treaty and part of New Zealand’s domestic law. This unique dual nature means that it is interpreted differently from domestic legislation. 64. Because it is an international treaty, a DTA is subject to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 4 , to which New Zealand is a signatory. Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention describe how a treaty shall be interpreted. Article 31(1) sets out the general rule of interpretation. It requires a holistic and integrated approach 5 that considers the ordinary meaning of the text in its context and in light of the object and purpose of the treaty. The ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty is necessarily the starting point, but it is also 4 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1155 UNTS 331 (opened for signature 23 May 1969, ratified by New Zealand on 4 August 1971) entered into force on 27 January 1980. 5 See CT v Lamesa Holdings BV 97 ATC 4752 (FCA), McDermott Industries Pty Ltd v FCT 2005 ATC 4398 (FCAFC) and R v Crown Forest Industries Ltd 95 DTC 5389 (SCC). 12 mandatory to consider the context, object and purpose of the treaty 6 . It is from the combined effect of these elements that the legally relevant interpretation must be taken. 65. Article 31(2) and (3) describe the context that can be taken into account for the purposes of the general rule. 66. Despite the interpretation reached under the general rule, art 31(4) provides that a special meaning can be given to a term if it is established that the parties to the treaty so intended. 67. Article 32 relates to supplementary means of interpretation. Recourse to supplementary means of interpretation is restricted. It can only be had to confirm the meaning reached under art 31 or to determine the meaning when the interpretation under art 31 is ambiguous, manifestly absurd or unreasonable. 68. The courts have interpreted New Zealand’s DTAs in a manner consistent with these international obligations, adopting a broad and purposive approach. McCarthy P, in CIR v United Dominions Trust Ltd \[1973\] 2 NZLR 555 (CA) at 558, held that when interpreting a DTA the starting point is “not to adopt a narrow interpretation but to interpret having regard to the broad intentions of the framers as they emerge from the text.” 69. The Commissioner considers that a DTA must be interpreted in a holistic and integrated manner. A DTA must not be interpreted solely by reference to the ordinary meaning of the words used or, at the other extreme, solely by reference to the purpose of the DTA. What is required is that the terms are given their ordinary meaning taking into account their context and the object and purpose of the DTA. Relevance of the Model Commentary 70. In CIR v JFP Energy Inc (1990) 12 NZTC 7,176 (CA), Richardson J stated that appropriate regard should be given to the Model Commentary. While the Model Commentary is not binding, the Commissioner considers it extremely influential and an important tool for interpreting DTAs. 71. The Commissioner considers the Model Commentary can form part of the legal context of a DTA under art 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, provided the DTA article is the same or similar to the Model Convention and the Model Commentary was in existence at the time the DTA was signed. The Model Commentary may still be relevant if it was written after the DTA was signed, provided the changes to the Model Commentary are for clarification only. Similarly, the Model Convention can be a relevant supplementary means of interpretation under art 32 of the Vienna Convention. 7 Article 3 – definitions Defined terms 72. When interpreting a DTA, it is important to consider the general definitions article (typically art 3). Article 3(1) lists definitions that apply for the purposes of the DTA, unless the context requires otherwise. The list of defined terms will vary between DTAs. The list is not exhaustive and definitions can also be found elsewhere in a DTA. For example, art 4 (the Resident article) defines “resident of a Contracting State”. 6 See TD Securities (USA) LLC v R 2010 TCC 186, 2010 DTC 1137 (Tax Court of Canada), Crown Forest, Coblentz v R (1996) 96 DTC 6,531 (Fed CA), Weiser v HMRC \[2012\] UKFTT 501 (TC), Bayfine UK v Revenue and Customs Commissioners \[2011\] EWCA Civ 304, \[2011\] STC 717, CIR v JFP Energy Inc (1990) 12 NZTC 7,176 (CA). 7 See Thiel v FCT 90 ATC 4717 (HCA) and Crown Forest. 13 Undefined terms 73. If a DTA does not define a term, that term is to be defined under the domestic law of that state, unless the context requires otherwise. Article 3(2) of the Model Convention provides: 2. As regards the application of the Convention at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. 74. Article 3(2) confirms that the domestic law meaning to be used is the meaning at the time the DTA is applied, not the meaning that existed at the time the DTA was signed. The Model Commentary also explains that when trying to find a domestic law definition, a tax law definition will take precedence over a non-tax law definition. Furthermore, a tax law definition from a law that imposes the relevant DTA tax will take precedence over any other definitions, including other tax law definitions. 8 75. Article 3(2) applies “unless the context requires otherwise”. The Model Commentary explains how “context” should be determined 9 : 12. However, paragraph 2 specifies that this applies only if the context does not require an alternative interpretation. The context is determined in particular by the intention of the Contracting States when signing the Convention as well as the meaning given to the term in question in the legislation of the other Contracting State (an implicit reference to the principle of reciprocity on which the Convention is based). The wording of the Article therefore allows the competent authorities some leeway. 76. The context might otherwise require an interpretation that is different from the domestic law meaning where, for example, the application of a domestic law meaning would render part of the treaty inoperable or if the domestic law would give the taxpayer unjustified treaty benefits or would lead to double taxation or non-taxation. 10 Apply the DTA - Is the tax paid in the source state a tax covered by the DTA? Introduction 77. If a DTA is in force and has taken effect between New Zealand and the source state, the next step is to work out whether the tax paid in the source state is a tax covered by the DTA. The “Taxes covered” article of a DTA is typically art 2. 78. Depending on how the DTA has been drafted, a tax is covered by a DTA if it is:  expressly listed in art 2 as one of the taxes covered; or  a tax on income or capital as defined in art 2(1) and (2) of the DTA; or  a subsequently enacted tax that is “identical or substantially similar” to one of the taxes expressly covered (art 2(4)). 79. If a tax is covered by a DTA, the DTA will determine whether a foreign tax credit is available (the amount of the credit will be calculated under subpart LJ). However, if a tax is not covered by a DTA, relief may still be available under the domestic law foreign tax credit provisions. 8 Model Commentary, \[13.1\] at 84. 9 Model Commentary, \[12\] at 83. 10 E Reimer and A Rust (eds), Klaus Vogel on Double Taxation Conventions (4 th ed, Kluwer Law International, The Netherlands, 2015) at 213. 14 Taxes covered under art 2(1), (2) and (3) 80. In most cases, it will be easy to determine whether a tax is covered by a DTA because art 2 of the DTA will expressly list those taxes covered. For example, art 2(1) of the New Zealand/Australia DTA 11 expressly lists the taxes covered by the DTA: 1. The taxes to which this Convention shall apply are: a) in the case of Australia: (i) the income tax, including the resource rent tax in respect of offshore projects relating to exploration for or exploitation of petroleum resources; and (ii) the fringe benefits tax imposed under the federal law of Australia (hereinafter referred to as “Australian tax”); b) in the case of New Zealand: the income tax, including the fringe benefit tax (hereinafter referred to as “New Zealand tax”). 81. Most of New Zealand’s DTAs adopt this prescriptive approach to defining the taxes covered by the DTA. However, some DTAs follow the Model Convention structure. Article 2(1)-(3) of the Model Convention state: 1. This Convention shall apply to taxes on income and on capital imposed on behalf of a Contracting State or of its political subdivisions or local authorities, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied. 2. There shall be regarded as taxes on income and on capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital, or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property, taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital appreciation. 3. The existing taxes to which the Convention shall apply are in particular: a) (in State A):........... b) (in State B):........... 82. Under the Model Convention structure, the list of taxes in art 2(3) is not considered to be an exhaustive list. Instead, the taxes listed in art 2(3) are illustrative of the types of taxes on income and capital described in arts 2(1) and 2(2). In these circumstances, a tax may be covered by a DTA even if it is not specifically listed in art 2(3), provided it is a tax on income or capital as defined by arts 2(1) and 2(2). This was the outcome in the Irish case Kinsella v The Revenue Commissioners \[2007\] IEHC 250. The Irish High Court held that Irish capital gains tax (introduced after the DTA had been entered into) was covered by art 2(2) of the Ireland/Italy DTA. Article 2(2) of the Ireland/Italy DTA did not follow the Model Convention article exactly. It applied the DTA to “all taxes imposed on total income or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the alienation of moveable or immovable property.” 83. The “Taxes covered” article can be drafted in a number of different ways, so it is important to check the exact wording used. For example, art 2(1) of the Model Convention states that the DTA “shall apply to taxes on income and on capital imposed on behalf of a Contracting State or of its political subdivisions or local authorities...”. However, art 2(1) of the New Zealand/United States DTA 12 omits the reference to political subdivisions or local authorities. This is because the 11 Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 2010. 12 Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983. 15 United States has reserved its position on this part of art 2(1) of the Model Convention 13 . “Identical or substantially similar” taxes under art 2(4) Introduction 84. A tax is also covered by a DTA if it is imposed after the DTA is signed and it is identical or substantially similar to one of the taxes covered. It may be imposed in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. Article 2(4) of the Model Convention provides: 4. The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws. 85. The Model Convention and the Model Commentary do not provide any guidance on how to apply the test of “substantially similar”. The Commissioner’s view on how to apply this test is therefore set out below. Ordinary meaning 86. Article 3 of the Model Convention lists general definitions for the purpose of the DTA. Article 3 does not define “substantially similar”. Article 3(2) notes that where a term is not defined in the DTA, it should be given the meaning it has at that time under the domestic law of that state, unless the context otherwise requires (see from \[73\] to \[76\] above). 87. As “substantially similar” is not defined under New Zealand domestic law, the ordinary meaning of the term should be considered. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) defines “substantially” to mean: adv. 1 to a great or significant extent. 2 for the most part; essentially. 88. “Similar” is defined as: adj. 1 of the same kind in appearance, character, or quantity, without being identical: a soft cheese similar to brie. 89. Combining these definitions, the ordinary meaning of “substantially similar” suggests that the relevant tax need not be identical, as long as it is, for the most part, the same kind of tax as a tax covered by art 2 of the relevant DTA. 90. The definition of the phrase “substantially the same” was considered by the Employment Court in National Distribution Union Inc v General Distributors Ltd \[2007\] ERNZ 120 (EmpC). While the context was different, the court noted that “substantially the same” must mean more than “substantially similar”. It was a higher and more precise standard. This suggests that “substantially similar” is a lesser standard than “substantially the same”. Case law on meaning of “substantially similar” 91. The meaning of “substantially similar” in a DTA context has not been considered by the courts in New Zealand. However, it has been considered in other jurisdictions. The main cases are discussed below. 92. The issue before the Federal Court of Australia in Virgin Holdings SA v FC of T \[2008\] FCA 1503, 2008 ATC 20-051 was whether the Australian Government 13 “Reservations” are recorded in the Model Commentary by article and indicate that a state disagrees with the text (or part of the text) of an article. “Observations” are also recorded in the Model Commentary and indicate where a state disagrees with an aspect of the Model Commentary (but not the article itself). See \[31\] and \[32\], Introduction, OECD Model Commentary, at 15. 16 could tax a capital gain made by a Swiss resident company (Virgin) on the sale of shares in Australia. 93. Under the Australia/Switzerland DTA (entered into in 1980, before Australia had a capital gains tax), Australia was prevented from taxing Virgin’s business profits. The Australian Government argued that the DTA did not apply to Australian capital gains tax, meaning Australia could tax the capital gains made by Virgin on the share sale. 94. In addition to the argument that the “Australian income tax” incorporated capital gains tax (discussed below at \[116\]), the taxpayer argued, in the alternative, that the capital gains tax was “substantially similar” to Australian income tax. 95. Edmonds J held that the term “Australian income tax” extended to the capital gains from the sale of shares. He noted that if he was wrong on this point, the capital gains tax would still be “substantially similar” to Australian income tax. He noted at \[55\] – \[56\]: 55. Where a tax on capital gains is effected, as it has been in this country, by the inclusion of the capital gains, or some figure computed therefrom, in the tax base upon which income tax is imposed on an annual basis, I have great difficulty in comprehending why the tax on the capital gain is not substantially similar, if not identical, to the income tax on the tax base not including the capital gain or the figure computed therefrom. In saying this, I am mindful that one should not be blinded by the mechanisms used to impose the tax in characterising the nature of the tax for a specific purpose: see South Australia v Commonwealth 174 CLR at 261 per Dawson J extracted in \[46\] above. But that does not mean that in deciding whether a tax is substantially similar to another tax the mechanisms of imposition are irrelevant. 56. Second, if the tax with respect to which the tax on capital gains is being compared for similarity, also taxes capital gains, albeit depending on circumstances (s 25A) and time (s 26AAA) of acquisition, the more readily will a conclusion of substantial similarity be reached. This harks back to Dixon J’s observation in Resch 66 CLR that the distinction between profits of a capital nature and profits in the nature of income in the strict sense is not one which the 1930 Act maintained; nor, according to the majority joint judgment in South Australia v Commonwealth 174 CLR, does the ITAA 36. 96. In deciding that Australian capital gains tax is “substantially similar” to Australian income tax, Edmonds J considered it was significant that the income tax taxed the same tax base as the capital gains tax. 97. Edmonds J also observed that, prior to the introduction of the Australian capital gains tax, the Australian income tax taxed capital gains in certain situations. He noted that a finding of “substantially similar” is more likely to be reached where the new tax and the tax covered by the DTA both tax capital gains. He also considered that the mechanism used to impose the tax is relevant. 98. The same issue came before the Irish High Court in Kinsella. In this case, the taxpayer sold shares in an Irish company to a third party while tax resident in Italy. The taxpayer argued that, under the Ireland/Italy DTA, she was tax resident in Italy and the sale of shares was subject to Italian tax only. The Revenue Commissioners argued that the DTA did not apply to Irish capital gains tax (the DTA pre-dated the introduction of Irish capital gains tax), so the sale of shares was subject to Irish capital gains tax. 99. Kelly J held that the DTA did apply to Irish capital gains tax as it was a covered tax under art 2(2). However, he acknowledged that if he was wrong in that, the capital gains tax would fall within art 2(4) as a “substantially similar tax”: As I have already pointed out CGT is a tax on gains or profits rather than a tax on capital wealth. Although introduced in 1975 it is now dealt with by the 1997 Act. That Act contains all of the provisions related to other direct taxes such as corporation tax and income tax. The rules for computing CGT are included in that legislation. True it is that the capital gains are taxed in a different way from other forms of income but the tax legislation regards the two as being very closely related. Section 4 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 which is now contained in S. 12 of the 1997 Act provides that income tax is to be charged in respect of all property, profits or gains respectively described in the schedules contained in the sections which are 17 enumerated. Thus, although it is calculated in a different way from income tax, CGT is substantially similar. 100. Kelly J also specifically endorsed Vogel’s approach to this exercise (discussed in more detail below at \[107\]): My view appears to be in keeping with that of Klaus Vogel in his book on Double Taxation Conventions (3rd edition 1998). He opines that new capital gains taxes will normally be considered as substantially similar to income tax. He says: “What is necessary is a comprehensive comparison of the tax laws’ constituent elements. In such a comparison, the new tax under review, rather than being compared merely with a solitary older one (to which it will always be similar in some respects and different in others), should be considered with reference to all types of taxes historically developed within the State in question – and of States with related legal systems – in order to determine which of such traditional taxes comes closest to the new tax law....Whether a tax is “substantially similar” to another can, consequently, not be decided otherwise than against the background of the entire tax system...” Later he says: “Taxation of capital gains is normally dealt with in income tax laws, though in some instances separate legislation is devoted to that subject (see the National Reports of LX1BCDF 1129FF \[1976\]. Consequently, any new capital gains tax will, for Treaty purposes normally have to be considered as being at least similar to income taxes; the Danish Landskattereten (Danish Tax Court) 26 ET114 \[1986\]: DTC Denmark/France, differs, however.” I have briefly carried out the exercise which he suggests, namely to consider all types of taxes historically developed within the State and I have reached a conclusion similar to his namely, that for the purposes of this Convention, CGT falls within the wording of Article 2.4. 101. In Case 8/2014 \[2014\] AATA 961, 2014 ATC 1-070, the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) considered whether Irish pay-related social insurance (PRSI) was identical or substantially similar to the Irish income tax for the purposes of art 2 of the Australia/Ireland DTA. 102. The taxpayer was an Australian tax resident who had been employed in Ireland. Income tax and PRSI had been deducted from his salary. PRSI is a compulsory contribution to the Social Insurance Fund used to pay social welfare benefits and pensions. The taxpayer argued that because he would not be entitled to receive any of the PRSI benefits, PRSI was substantially similar to Irish income tax and therefore he should be entitled to a foreign income tax offset (the Australian tax credit equivalent). 103. The AAT held that the PRSI was not an identical or substantially similar tax. The AAT referred to the Model Commentary and Vogel and concluded that social security charges, such as the PRSI, where there is a direct connection between the levy and the individual benefits, are not intended to fall within the ambit of taxes covered by a DTA. It was not relevant that the taxpayer did not actually receive any benefits. The AAT held that the characterisation of the PRSI could not be different for the taxpayer because of his particular circumstances. 104. In comparing the PRSI with the existing taxes covered by the DTA, how the PRSI was reflected in tax legislation was relevant. The PRSI was not imposed by the main income tax assessment legislation in Ireland and was not referred to as a “tax” in the Social Welfare Development Act 2005 (Ireland). It was calculated on a different basis from income tax and arose because of a contributor’s employment status. It was not paid into the general revenue, but into the Social Insurance Fund. 105. The AAT also endorsed the decisions in Virgin and Kinsella by confirming that the mechanisms of imposition used are relevant but not determinative, as are the methods of calculation. 18 International tax commentary 106. As “substantially similar” is a term used in an international treaty, it is useful to look to international tax law experts for guidance. 107. In the recently published 4 th edition of Klaus Vogel on Double Taxation Conventions, the text identifies “two potential and equally valid approaches” to undertaking this comparison – the “micro-approach” and “macro-approach” 14 . Under a micro-approach, a new tax is compared to a single tax or even a component of that tax. The approach requires a comprehensive comparison of the respective taxes’ constituent elements. Under a macro-approach, the new tax is compared to a combination of several taxes. This approach requires an overall assessment of the place of the new tax in the tax system as a whole. The Commissioner considers that the two approaches reflect aspects of the earlier approach outlined in the 3 rd edition 15 of Vogel set out at \[100\]. Test of “substantially similar” 108. Under art 2(4), a tax is covered by a DTA if it is imposed after the DTA is signed and it is identical or substantially similar to the taxes covered by the DTA. The case law and commentary have identified a number of factors that should be considered when determining whether a tax is substantially similar to a tax specifically covered by a DTA. Based on these factors, the Commissioner has formulated the following test. 109. When approaching this exercise, the Commissioner considers that the starting point should be to compare the new tax with a single covered tax (or component of that tax). If the taxes are “substantially similar”, taking into account the essential elements of that tax, the tax will be covered under art 2(4). If the tax is not “substantially similar” under this approach, the macro-approach should also be considered. The new tax is then compared to a combination of covered taxes. Under this approach, the question of whether a tax is substantially similar has to be considered against the background of the entire tax system. 110. The Commissioner considers that, when undertaking the comparison, it may be useful to consider the following:  The formal arrangement of the tax should first be considered (Vogel).  The essential elements of the taxes should be comprehensively compared (Vogel).  The new tax should be compared with all types of taxes historically developed within the overseas jurisdiction and jurisdictions with related legal systems to determine which traditional taxes come closest to the new law (Vogel).  If the new tax taxes the same tax base as the DTA tax, it is likely to be “substantially similar” (Virgin).  If the new tax taxes the same items of income/gains as the DTA tax (albeit in different circumstances – ie, a capital gains tax compared to an income tax that also taxes some capital gains), the new tax is likely to be “substantially similar” (Virgin).  Even if the new tax is calculated in a different way from the DTA tax, it may still be “substantially similar” (Kinsella). 14 E Reimer and A Rust (eds), Klaus Vogel on Double Taxation Conventions (4 th ed, Kluwer Law International, The Netherlands, 2015) at 167. 15 Klaus Vogel, Klaus Vogel on Double Taxation Conventions, (3 rd ed, Kluwer Law International, The Netherlands, 1997). 19  How the tax is imposed is relevant, but not determinative (Virgin).  How the tax is reflected in the legislation is relevant. For example, does the legislation regard the two taxes as being closely related? (Kinsella).  The name of the tax, the rate and who it is imposed on is of little significance (Vogel).  Taxes or charges paid where a direct connection exists between the levy and the individual benefits to be received are not intended to be covered by a DTA (Case 8/2014, Vogel, Model Convention). Capital gains taxes 111. While the previous section discussed the creditability of capital gains taxes in the context of art 2(4) of the Model Convention, this section discusses the creditability of capital gains taxes more broadly. A capital gains tax may be covered by a DTA in one of three ways:  It may be one of the taxes covered by the DTA (either a specifically listed tax, or a tax that satisfies the definitions in art 2(1) and (2)).  It may be integrated into a specifically covered tax (for example, the inclusion of capital gains in the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1997).  It may be enacted subsequent to the signing of the DTA and be considered an identical or substantially similar tax to one of the taxes specifically covered by a DTA. Capital gains taxes covered by DTA 112. In some cases, a DTA may specifically cover taxes on capital gains. For example, art 2(1) of the New Zealand/United Kingdom DTA 16 states that the DTA covers the United Kingdom capital gains tax: (1) The taxes which are the subject of this Convention are: (a) in the United Kingdom: (i) the income tax; (ii) the corporation tax; (iii) the capital gains tax; and (iv) the petroleum revenue tax; (hereinafter referred to as “United Kingdom tax”); (b) in New Zealand: (i) the income tax; and (ii) the excess retention tax; (hereinafter referred to as “New Zealand tax”). 113. A capital gains tax may also be included under art 2(1) or (2). In Kinsella, the Irish High Court held that Irish capital gains tax fell within the terms of art 2(2) of the Ireland/Italy DTA. 114. In the Commissioner’s view, if a capital gains tax is specifically covered by a DTA, then, depending on how the taxing right is allocated, New Zealand will give a foreign tax credit for capital gains tax paid, provided the same income is also taxable in New Zealand. This might be the case, for example, where a gain on a foreign property disposal is subject to capital gains tax in the foreign jurisdiction and is also treated as taxable income in New Zealand under s CB 6. 16 Double Taxation Relief (United Kingdom) Order 1984. 20 Capital gains taxes integrated into an income tax 115. The position is the same for capital gains taxes that are integrated into an income tax. For example, art 2(1)(a)(i) of the New Zealand/Australia DTA lists Australian income tax as a tax covered by the DTA. Australian capital gains tax is not a separate tax, but a component of Australian income tax. Because the DTA covers Australian income tax, New Zealand would (if required) allow a credit for Australian income tax imposed on capital gains, provided those same gains are also taxable in New Zealand. 116. The Commissioner’s view is consistent with the conclusion reached by the Federal Court of Australia in Virgin Holdings SA and Undershaft No 1 Ltd v FC of T; Undershaft No 2 BV v FC of T 2009 ATC 20-091. In Virgin, Edmonds J considered the structure of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and did not accept that there was a separate Australian capital gains tax. He held that capital gains fell into, and formed part of, income subject to income tax under the Act. 117. It is therefore important to determine whether a tax (although not specifically listed as a covered tax) is included within the ambit of a specifically listed DTA tax. Capital gains taxes as “substantially similar” taxes 118. Vogel also argues that if a country introduces a capital gains tax, it would most likely come within the DTA’s scope as a result of art 2(4). Consequently, any new capital gains tax would normally have to be considered as being at least similar to income tax 17 : Taxation of capital gains is normally dealt with in income tax laws, though in some instances separate legislation is devoted to that subject (see National Reports of LX1BCDF 1129FF \[1976\]. Consequently, any new capital gains tax will, for Treaty purposes normally have to be considered as being at least similar to income taxes; the Danish Landskattereten (Danish Tax Court) 26 ET114 \[1986\]: DTC Denmark/France, differs, however. 119. While any such comparison will depend on the actual taxes covered by a DTA, if an income tax (as traditionally understood) is covered by a DTA, the Commissioner considers that any subsequently enacted capital gains tax that taxes realised capital gains, rather than increases in wealth, would likely be considered “substantially similar” to that income tax. Does a DTA tax also need to satisfy the domestic law test in s YA 2(5)? 120. A tax covered by a DTA does not also need to satisfy the s YA 2(5) test by being “of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under s BB 1”. The s YA 2(5) test applies only to foreign taxes that are not covered by a DTA. Does the test of “substantially similar” (art 2(4)) need to be interpreted consistently with the s YA 2(5) test of “substantially the same nature”? 121. As mentioned above, a tax that is covered by a DTA does not need to satisfy the s YA 2(5) test. However, it is worth noting that the two tests - “a tax of substantially the same nature” and “substantially similar” - are different tests. The s YA 2(5) test compares the foreign tax paid with New Zealand income tax to determine whether the foreign tax is “of substantially the same nature” as New Zealand income tax. The art 2(4) test compares the foreign tax paid to the taxes covered under the DTA to determine whether the foreign tax is “substantially similar” to the DTA taxes. The tests are different and the Commissioner’s view is that there is no reason why the tests should be interpreted consistently. 17 Klaus Vogel, Klaus Vogel on Double Taxation Conventions, (3 rd ed, Kluwer Law International, The Netherlands, 1997) at 157. 21 Apply the DTA - are you resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the DTA? Introduction 122. The “Persons covered” article of a DTA (typically art 1) explains that the DTA applies to persons who are “residents of one or both of the Contracting States”. Article 4(1) of the Model Convention defines “resident of a Contracting State”: 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or capital situated therein. 123. This means that, for a DTA to apply, a person needs to be a resident of a contracting state under the domestic laws of that state. As the flowchart has already determined domestic law residence (under preliminary requirements), this condition will have been satisfied. 124. However, an issue may arise if a person is a tax resident under the domestic laws of both New Zealand and the source state. This is known as dual residence. Dual residence issues are resolved by the DTA, typically under art 4. Article 4 contains a series of tie-breaker tests that are applied to allocate resident status to one of the two states for the purposes of the DTA. The tie-breaker tests for individuals and non-individuals (ie, companies) are summarised below. Taxpayers should refer to IS 16/03 for more information. Dual resident tie-breaker tests 125. Article 4 of the Model Convention sets out the tie-breaker test for individuals and for persons other than individuals (ie, companies). Tie-breaker tests - Individuals 126. Article 4(2) contains the tie-breaker tests for individuals. The tie-breaker tests are applied in order until residence can be determined under one of them. The main tie-breaker tests are outlined below. It is important to note that the tie- breaker tests may vary between DTAs. The order in which the tie-breaker tests apply may also vary. Taxpayers must ensure that they apply the correct tie- breaker tests in the order that they appear in the relevant DTA. Permanent home test 127. The first test gives preference to the state in which the person “has a permanent home available to \[them\]”. There are three elements to the test: there must be a home, it must be permanent, and it must be available for use (art 4(2)(a)). 128. If a person has a permanent home available in one state, they will be resident in that state, unless the person can establish that they also have a permanent home available in the other state. 129. Where a person has a permanent home available in both states, the next test will generally be the personal and economic relations test. Where a person does not have a permanent home available to them in either state, the next test for consideration will usually be the habitual abode test. Personal and economic relations (centre of vital interests) test 130. The next test gives preference to the state “with which \[the person’s\] personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests)”. 131. If a person’s economic and personal relations are evenly balanced between New Zealand and another state (even if personal relations are stronger with one 22 state and economic relations with the other), the person will have no centre of vital interests, as the factors are regarded as being of equal weight. In this situation, the habitual abode test will need to be considered. Habitual abode test 132. A person will have a habitual abode in a state if they live there habitually or normally. A person may habitually live in more than one state; the enquiry is not about assessing the state in which the person’s abode is more habitual, but about whether they have a habitual abode in New Zealand and/or the other state. Nationality and mutual agreement 133. When a person has a habitual abode in both states or in neither of them, residence is generally determined on the basis of nationality or citizenship. In cases where nationality is the test, the concept of nationality (for individuals) is generally defined as a person who is a New Zealand citizen. A New Zealand citizen is someone who has citizenship here under the Citizenship Act 1977. 134. If residence cannot be resolved under the tie-breaker tests, it will need to be resolved by mutual agreement between the competent authorities of the two states. Tie-breaker test - Companies 135. Article 4(3) of the Model Convention contains the residence tie-breaker test for dual-resident non-individuals. It allocates residence, for DTA purposes, to the state in which the person’s “place of effective management” is situated. 136. However, New Zealand’s DTAs contain a number of different rules for allocating company residence for DTA purposes. Under these rules, residence may be allocated according to the company’s “place of effective management”, its “day- to-day management”, the “centre of its administrative or practical management” or the location of its “head office”. Conclusion 137. If a New Zealand resident is deemed to be a non-resident under the tie-breaker rules in the DTA (for the purposes of the DTA), there will be no basis for the DTA to allocate taxing rights to New Zealand (as the income is not sourced in New Zealand 18 ). It follows that there will be no foreign tax credit available, as the person will not have a New Zealand tax liability for that segment of foreign- sourced income against which a foreign tax credit can be claimed. 138. A New Zealand tax resident who is deemed to be a non-resident under the DTA will only have that status for the purposes of the DTA. They will remain a New Zealand tax resident under the Act and for other tax purposes, for example, in relation to any New Zealand-sourced income. Apply the DTA - allocation articles – how does the relevant DTA article allocate the taxing rights for your income or gain? Introduction 139. Once residence status (for the purposes of the DTA) has been established, the next step is to determine which allocation article applies to the foreign-sourced income. The application of the relevant allocation article will decide which state or states have the right to tax that foreign-sourced income. 18 See from para \[32\] above, and subpart LJ, which requires the income to be sourced from outside New Zealand. 23 Which allocation article applies? 140. It is important to correctly identify which allocation article applies to the foreign- sourced income. Articles 6 to 21 of the Model Convention contain the allocation articles for income. Article 22 is the allocation article for capital. 141. Income not covered under any of the specific allocation articles is usually dealt with under art 21 (Other income) of the Model Convention. Article 21 also covers income that would normally be covered by another allocation article, but that article does not apply because the conditions for application are not met (for example, the income arises in a third state). 142. A DTA also contains specific priority rules that apply where the income satisfies more than one allocation article. For example, art 7 (Business profits) only applies to the extent that the business profits are not subject to any other allocation article (see art 7(4)). So, if a person’s business profits include interest income, that interest income must be dealt with under art 11 (Interest) not art 7. How does the allocation article allocate the right to tax? 143. Once the correct allocation article has been identified, it can be applied to the foreign-sourced income. There are three potential outcomes:  New Zealand has the exclusive right to tax.  The source state has either an unlimited or a limited right to tax.  New Zealand has no right to tax. These outcomes are discussed below. New Zealand has the exclusive right to tax 144. Some allocation articles will prevent the source state from taxing the foreign- sourced income, giving New Zealand (as the state of residence) exclusive taxing rights. For example, art 19 of the New Zealand/United Kingdom DTA gives New Zealand (as the state of residence) the exclusive right to tax pension income: Article 19 Pension and annuities (1) Pensions (including pensions paid under the social security legislation of a Contracting State), and similar remuneration in consideration of past employment or services, paid to a resident of a Contracting State, and any annuity paid to a resident of a Contracting State, shall be taxable only in that State. \[Emphasis added\] 145. The phrase “shall be taxable only in that State” allocates an exclusive taxing right to the state of residence. This can be compared with the phrase “may be taxed”, which allocates a shared right to tax (see \[147\] below). 146. If this type of allocation article applies, New Zealand (as the state of residence) will have the exclusive right to tax the foreign-sourced income and the source state will agree not to tax that income. Because of this exclusive right to tax, New Zealand does not have to provide a foreign tax credit for any foreign tax that may be incorrectly paid or withheld in the source state. 19 19 For example, see QB 14/12: “Income tax – foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pensions” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 11 (December 2014): 11. 24 Source state has an unlimited or limited right to tax Unlimited right to tax in source state 147. Under this type of allocation article, both states have a shared right to tax the foreign-sourced income. The source state’s taxing rights are not limited in any way. New Zealand’s taxing rights (as the state of residence) are also unaffected, but under art 23 it will have to provide a foreign tax credit for the tax imposed by the source state (subject to the calculation provisions in subpart LJ – see from \[165\] below). An example of this type of allocation article is art 6 (Income from immovable property) of the New Zealand/Spain DTA 20 . Use of the words “may be taxed” in art 6(1) means that the taxing rights are shared: Article 6 Income from immovable property 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. Limited right to tax in source state 148. Under this type of allocation article, both states have a shared right to tax the foreign-sourced income, but the source state’s taxing right is limited. This type of allocation article is often applied to dividend income, interest income and royalty income. New Zealand’s taxing rights (as the state of residence) are unaffected, but it will have to provide a foreign tax credit under art 23 for the tax imposed by the source state (subject to subpart LJ). Article 12 of the New Zealand/Australia DTA contains an example of this type of allocation rule: Article 12 Royalties 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. ... 149. Use of the words “may be taxed” in art 12(1) mean that the taxing rights are shared. However, art 12(2) limits Australia’s taxing rights (as the source state) to no more than 5% of the gross amount of the royalties. New Zealand also has the right to tax the royalty income. However, it will be required to provide relief by way of a foreign tax credit under art 23 for the amount of tax imposed by Australia (subject to subpart LJ). 150. New Zealand will not provide a foreign tax credit for any amounts incorrectly imposed by a foreign state. The taxpayer will only receive a foreign tax credit for the amount of foreign tax that was entitled to be paid or withheld under the DTA, which in this case is 5%. 21 20 Double Taxation Relief (Spain) Order 2006. 21 See QB 14/12: “Income tax – foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pensions” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 11 (December 2014): 11. 25 Example illustrating a limited right to tax New Zealand has no right to tax 151. Article 20 of the Model Convention is different from the other allocation articles under a DTA. It simply exempts the relevant income from tax in New Zealand: Article 20 Students Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first- mentioned State solely for the purpose of his education or training receives for the purpose of his maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. 152. Where all of the conditions of this article are met, the DTA exempts from tax all foreign-sourced payments received by the student in New Zealand for his/her maintenance, education or training. However, a payment received by way of a Example 2 – limited right to tax Scenario 1 In the 2015 income year, Toby derived NZD$100 of royalty income from Australia. Toby is a foreign resident under Australian tax law and resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Act and the New Zealand/Australia DTA. As Toby is defined as a “foreign resident” under Australian tax law, the royalty income is subject to withholding tax of 30%, or NZD$30. New Zealand is also entitled to tax that income at Toby’s marginal tax rate of 30% as he is resident here. If there was no DTA between New Zealand and Australia, Toby would have to try and obtain a foreign tax credit under the domestic law foreign tax credit provisions for the tax withheld in Australia. However, New Zealand and Australia have entered into a DTA. Under art 12(2) of the New Zealand/Australia DTA, Australia’s right to tax royalty income is limited to 5% of the gross amount of the royalty, or NZD$5, which is what the Australian payer of the royalty withholds. New Zealand is also entitled to tax the royalty income, but under art 23 of the DTA it will need to provide a foreign tax credit for the Australian tax that has been withheld. In this scenario, the total notional New Zealand income tax liability for that segment of foreign-sourced income is NZD$30 (as calculated under s LJ 5(2)) and a credit of NZD$5 would be allowed to reduce that liability by reference to the Australian tax paid, giving an end result of NZD$25 for that royalty income. Scenario 2 The facts are the same as in scenario 1, however in this scenario the Australian payer of the royalties is unaware of the New Zealand/Australia DTA. The Australian payer withholds NZD$30, rather than the NZD$5 permitted under the DTA. Toby tries to claim a foreign tax credit in New Zealand for the NZD$30 incorrectly withheld by the Australian payer. New Zealand will not provide Toby with a foreign tax credit for the NZD$30 incorrectly withheld by the Australian payer. Under the DTA, the Australian payer should only have withheld NZD$5. New Zealand will therefore only give a credit for this amount. In this scenario, Toby has paid the $30 incorrectly withheld plus NZD$30 of New Zealand income tax, less the NZD$5 credit permitted under the DTA. Toby must go back to the Australian payer or the Australian Tax Office and seek a refund of the incorrectly withheld amount. This will ensure Toby is in the same position as in scenario 1. 26 scholarship or bursary for attendance at an educational institution will likely be exempt income under s CW 36 in any event. The student will remain subject to New Zealand tax on all other income. 153. This article also applies where a New Zealand student is studying overseas and satisfies the conditions of this article. Any payments for the purpose of the student’s maintenance, education or training received by the New Zealand student will be exempt from tax in that foreign jurisdiction. Apply the DTA - elimination of double taxation (art 23) 154. Where double taxation arises, and it is not relieved by the application of an allocation article 22 , a DTA will identify a method for relieving that double taxation. 155. New Zealand’s DTAs all include an elimination of double taxation article (typically art 23) that explains when New Zealand (and the other contracting state) will give a foreign tax credit. The details of how to calculate the foreign tax credit are contained in subpart LJ of the Act. 156. New Zealand’s DTAs do not follow the structure of art 23 of the Model Convention (see para \[10\] of the Appendix to this Interpretation Statement). New Zealand takes the following approach, as illustrated by art 22(2)(a) of the New Zealand/United Kingdom DTA: (a) Subject to the provisions of the law of New Zealand from time to time in force relating to the allowance as a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in any country other than New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), United Kingdom tax computed by reference to income from sources in the United Kingdom and paid under the law of the United Kingdom and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in the United Kingdom (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid), shall be allowed as a credit against the New Zealand tax computed by reference to the same income and payable in respect of that income. 157. This article is important because it explains how the DTA and the domestic law will work together to relieve double taxation. In the context of the New Zealand/United Kingdom DTA, it has the following effect:  A foreign tax credit is allowed against New Zealand tax for United Kingdom tax paid on the same income.  The allowance of the foreign tax credit is subject to New Zealand’s domestic laws (that is, as to the timing and the amount of the credit). However, New Zealand’s domestic legislation must be interpreted so as to uphold the general principle that a foreign tax credit should be available to eliminate double taxation.  Any foreign tax credit allowed under art 22 must be for United Kingdom tax that is paid not only under the law of the United Kingdom but also in accordance with the DTA. For example, if New Zealand has the exclusive right to tax that income and the United Kingdom withholds an amount on that income in error, United Kingdom tax has not been paid in accordance with the DTA. Therefore, art 22 will not give rise to any foreign tax credit entitlements. (See, for example, QB 14/12: “Income tax – foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pensions” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 11 (December 2014): 11.) 158. Where a DTA determines that New Zealand should provide a foreign tax credit, subpart LJ (as modified by the DTA where relevant) will determine how that foreign tax credit should be calculated. 22 For example, where an allocation article gives New Zealand an exclusive right to tax, meaning the other contracting state must not tax that income. 27 Apply the Act and the DTA - how to calculate a foreign tax credit Introduction 159. If New Zealand is required by the DTA to provide a foreign tax credit, that credit will be calculated under subpart LJ of the Act. However, the credit will not be calculated solely by reference to domestic law. The DTA must also be considered. This is because s BH 1 provides that the DTA is to have overriding effect. Where there is any inconsistency between the DTA and domestic law, the domestic law must be read subject to the DTA. The overriding effect of the DTA is discussed below from \[161\]. 160. Subpart LJ explains how to calculate a foreign tax credit where “foreign income tax” has been paid . It does this in two steps. First, it requires the foreign-sourced income to be divided into segments (s LJ 4). It then allows a foreign tax credit for foreign income tax paid on each segment of that foreign-sourced income (s LJ 2(1)) up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that same segment (as calculated under s LJ 5). The overriding effect of a DTA 161. Section BH 1 provides that a DTA “has effect in relation to income tax”, despite anything in the Act. The heading to s BH 1(4) explains that the DTA has an overriding effect. Richardson J in CIR v E R Squibb & Sons (New Zealand) Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,146 (CA) explained the overriding effect at 9,154: “...wherever and to the extent that there is any difference between the domestic legislation and the double tax agreement provision, the agreement has overriding effect.” 162. This means that the DTA has an overriding effect as to income tax imposed under the Act, including the income part of the Act (part C) and the foreign tax credit part of the Act (subpart LJ). Therefore, the income and foreign tax credit parts of the Act must always be read together with the relevant articles of a DTA. Where there is any inconsistency between the two, the domestic law must be read subject to the DTA. 163. However, when it comes to calculating the amount of the foreign tax credit and the timing of that credit, the DTA does not provide any guidance. These issues are determined solely under domestic law. A credit may arise under a DTA, but it will be calculated under subpart LJ. Subpart LJ provides that the amount of the foreign tax credit will not be able to exceed the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that segment of foreign-sourced income. As the DTA provides no guidance on how to calculate a foreign tax credit, there can be no inconsistency between the DTA and domestic law. 164. Likewise, the timing of the allowance of the foreign tax credit arising under the DTA will be subject to the rules in s 78B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. (See para \[184\] below.) Subpart LJ – “foreign income tax” 165. As discussed at \[17\] above, to be entitled to a foreign tax credit, a taxpayer must:  be tax resident in New Zealand;  have derived foreign-sourced income;  have that foreign-sourced income assessable under the Act; and  have paid foreign income tax on that foreign-sourced income. 166. The first three bullet points have already been considered at \[14\] to \[46\]. The fourth bullet point is considered below. 28 Meaning of “foreign income tax” 167. Section LJ 2(1) requires that a taxpayer must have paid foreign income tax to be entitled to a foreign tax credit 23 . “Foreign income tax” is defined in s LJ 3 for the purposes of the foreign tax credit rules (subpart LJ). 168. Where a DTA applies, s BH 1(4) gives the DTA an overriding effect on the foreign tax credit rules. This means that the definition of “foreign income tax” in s LJ 3 (which is only used for the purpose of the foreign tax credit rules) must be read together with the DTA. Where there is any inconsistency between the two, the term “foreign income tax” in s LJ 3 must be read subject to the relevant articles in the DTA. 169. When a DTA applies, the definition in s LJ 3 must be interpreted as referring to those taxes that are covered by art 2 of the DTA and are paid in accordance with the DTA. Proof of payment of foreign tax 170. The Commissioner will also require proof that the foreign income tax has been paid. Because of timing mismatches between jurisdictions, it may not always be possible for taxpayers to obtain a notice of assessment in time for filing their New Zealand tax return. A statement of account or a tax deduction certificate from a foreign revenue authority confirming that foreign tax has been paid will satisfy this proof requirement in the absence of a notice of assessment. Foreign income and foreign tax to be converted to New Zealand dollars 171. Foreign income and foreign tax must be converted to New Zealand dollars. Taxpayers must convert the amounts using the close of trading spot exchange rate (s YF 1(2)) or an alternative method approved by the Commissioner. Dividing foreign-sourced income into segments 172. Once the preliminary requirements have been satisfied, the next step in the calculation process is to divide the foreign-sourced income into segments (s LJ 2(1)). 173. Section LJ 4 defines “segment of foreign-sourced income”: For the purposes of this Part, a person has a segment of foreign-sourced income equal to an amount of assessable income derived from 1 foreign country that comes from 1 source or is of 1 nature. 174. To divide the foreign-sourced income into segments, the income must first be split up by country. After this, the foreign-sourced income is further split up by source or nature. Calculating the credit – s LJ 5 175. Once the foreign-sourced income has been segmented under s LJ 4, the New Zealand income tax payable on that segment must be calculated. This is required because under s LJ 2(2) the amount of the foreign tax credit must not be more than the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that segment (as calculated under s LJ 5(2) and modified, if necessary, under s LJ 5(4B)). A separate calculation is required for each segment of foreign-sourced income. The first step is to calculate the taxpayer’s notional New Zealand income tax liability 23 Different rules exist if a tax sparing article applies. 29 under s LJ 5(5). This is done by multiplying the taxpayer’s net income (minus losses 24 ) by the appropriate tax rate. 176. The second step is to insert this information into the equation in s LJ 5(2). Under s LJ 5(2), the segment of foreign-sourced income (less any deductions) is divided by the taxpayer’s total net income for the year and then multiplied by their notional New Zealand income tax liability (as calculated under s LJ 5(5)). The result of this equation is the taxpayer’s notional New Zealand income tax liability for that segment of foreign-sourced income. 177. The foreign tax credit for that segment cannot, therefore, be more than the notional New Zealand income tax liability for that segment. 24 Losses are defined in s LJ 5(6)(b) for the purpose of s LJ 5(5) and refer to the taxpayer’s own losses. Group company losses which a taxpayer company may use under the loss offset or subvention provisions are not brought into this calculation. 30 Example showing how to calculate a foreign tax credit under s LJ 5 Adjustment under s LJ 5(4), (4B) and (4C) 178. Section LJ 5(4), (4B) and (4C) will adjust the amount of a taxpayer’s foreign tax credit if the combined total of New Zealand tax payable under s LJ 5(2) for each segment of foreign-sourced income exceeds their notional New Zealand income tax liability. Example 3 – how to calculate a foreign tax credit under s LJ 5 Jo is a New Zealand tax resident. She owns a rental property in the Canadian Rockies, which she rents out. For the 2017 income year, Jo receives $20,000 of rental income and has deductions of $5,000. Jo has paid Canadian income tax of $3,750. Jo’s net income for the 2017 income year is $50,000 (including the rental income). Under art 6(1) of the New Zealand/Canada DTA (Double Tax Agreements (Canada) Order 2015), Canada has an unlimited right to tax the rental income and New Zealand is obliged to provide a foreign tax credit under art 21. Step 1: Calculate Jo’s notional New Zealand income tax liability – s LJ 5(5) Jo needs to calculate her notional New Zealand income tax liability: (net income – losses) x tax rate $14,000 x .105 = $1,470 $34,000 x .175 = $5,950 $2,000 x .30 = $600 Total: $8,020 Jo therefore has a notional New Zealand income tax liability of $8,020. Step 2: Calculate Jo’s notional New Zealand income tax liability on the segment of foreign- sourced income - s LJ 5(2) Jo now needs to calculate her notional New Zealand income tax liability on the segment of foreign- sourced income (the Canadian rental income): ((segment – deductions) ÷ net income) x notional liability (($20,000 - $5,000) ÷ $50,000) x $8,020 = $2,406 $2,406 is Jo’s notional New Zealand income tax liability for the Canadian rental income. This means that the total amount of the foreign tax credit available under subpart LJ for this segment of foreign-sourced income cannot exceed $2,406 (s LJ 2(2)). Jo has paid $3,750 of Canadian income tax. New Zealand will only grant Jo a foreign tax credit for $2,406, as that is the New Zealand income tax payable on that segment of foreign-sourced income. \*All amounts have been converted to New Zealand dollars. 31 179. These rules ensure that in calculating the notional income tax liability for a segment of foreign-sourced income, expenses and losses that are not attributable to a particular segment are spread across all sources of income, both domestic and foreign-sourced. Example illustrating how to make an adjustment under s LJ 5(4), (4B) and (4C) Example 4 – how to make an adjustment under s LJ 5(4), (4B) and (4C) New Co has foreign interest income of $1,000, foreign royalty income of $800, New Zealand sales of $1,000 and $1,500 of deductible expenses attributable to those sales. Step 1: Calculate New Co’s notional New Zealand income tax liability – s LJ 5(5) New Co needs to calculate its notional New Zealand income tax liability: (net income – losses) x tax rate (($1,000 + $800 + $1,000 - $1,500) - $0) x 0.28 $1,300 x 0.28 = $364 Step 2: Calculate New Co’s notional New Zealand income tax liability on the different segments of foreign-sourced income - s LJ 5(2) New Co now needs to separately calculate the notional New Zealand income tax liability on the segments of foreign interest and royalty income. ((interest – deductions) ÷ net income) x notional liability (($1,000 - $0) ÷ $1,300) x $364 = $280 $280 is the notional New Zealand income tax liability for the foreign interest income. ((royalty – deductions) ÷ net income) x notional liability (($800 - $0) ÷ $1,300) x $364 = $224 $224 is the notional New Zealand income tax liability for the foreign royalty income. The total amount of New Zealand tax for all segments of foreign-sourced income is $504 (being $280 + $224). An adjustment needs to be made under s LJ 5(4B) because the total amount of New Zealand tax for all segments of foreign-sourced income ($504) is more than New Co’s notional New Zealand income tax liability ($364). Step 3: Adjustment under s LJ 5(4B) Under s LJ 5(4B), each amount of New Zealand tax calculated under s LJ 5(2) is multiplied by New Co’s notional income tax liability and divided by NZ tax. NZ tax is defined in s LJ 5(4C) to mean the total of all calculations made under s LJ 5(2), including a calculation on New Zealand sourced income. This means: NZ tax = foreign interest and royalty calculations + NZ income calculation NZ tax = $280 + $224 + $0\* NZ tax = $504 (\*In this instance, the calculation on the New Zealand sourced income is -$140 but it is reduced to zero as it cannot be less than zero). So for the foreign interest, the amount is $280 x $364 ÷ $504. This gives a figure of $202.22. This means that under s LJ 5(2) the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that foreign-sourced income is $202.22. New Zealand will therefore only grant a foreign tax credit for any foreign tax paid on that segment up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that segment. Similarly, for the foreign royalty income, the amount is $224 x $364 ÷ $504, being $161.78. New Zealand will only grant a foreign tax credit on the royalty income up to an amount of $161.78. \*All amounts have been converted to New Zealand dollars. 32 Foreign tax refund – s LJ 7 180. If a taxpayer receives a refund of foreign income tax, they must make an adjustment under s LJ 7. If the refund is received before the taxpayer has self- assessed, the amount of the foreign tax credit will be reduced by the lesser of the amount of the refund or the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the foreign- sourced income calculated under s LJ 5 (s LJ 7(2)). 181. If the refund is received after the taxpayer has self-assessed (and used the foreign tax credit), they must pay to the Commissioner the lesser of the amount of the refund or the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the foreign-sourced income calculated under s LJ 5 (s LJ 7(3)). In these circumstances, the date for payment is 30 days after the later of:  the date the refund is received, or  the date of the notice of assessment in which the credit was used (s LJ 7(4)). 182. Section LJ 7 only applies to refunds of “foreign income tax”. For example, this is where a DTA allocates taxing rights to the other state, but subsequent adjustments are made to the calculation of the foreign income tax, resulting in a refund to the taxpayer. This can be distinguished from the situation where foreign tax has been incorrectly withheld or deducted. Any refund of incorrectly withheld or deducted foreign tax will not be a refund of “foreign income tax”. In these circumstances s LJ 7 does not apply. (See \[26\] and \[27\] of QB 14/12: “Income tax – foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pensions” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 11 (December 2014): 11.) Foreign tax credits are non-refundable 183. A foreign tax credit is defined in s YA 1 as a non-refundable credit. This means it must be used to offset an income tax liability or it will be extinguished (s LA 5(2)). It cannot be carried back or forward and used to offset a previous or future year’s income tax liabilities. Time limit for claiming a foreign tax credit 184. Under s 78B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), the time limit for claiming a foreign tax credit is “four years after the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer has the foreign tax credit”. The Commissioner considers that this means, four years from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer is liable to pay New Zealand income tax on the foreign-sourced income. There are three arguments that support this interpretation:  Section 78B links to the foreign tax credit provisions in the Act. Subpart LJ of the Act and s LJ 2(1) in particular, make it clear that a taxpayer “has a tax credit for a tax year”. Therefore, to be entitled to a foreign tax credit a taxpayer must have foreign-sourced income (which is assessable income in New Zealand) and have paid foreign income tax on that income. If these requirements are met then the taxpayer will have a foreign tax credit for that tax year. Under s 78B, the time for applying for that credit starts from the tax year in which the taxpayer is eligible to claim (or “has”) a foreign tax credit under subpart LJ. This is the tax year in which the taxpayer is liable to pay New Zealand income tax on the foreign-sourced income.  The predecessor section to s 78B was s LC 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004. This section started the four-year time period from the end of the tax year in which the income tax liability arose. It was not intended that s 78B would change the previous policy of s LJ 3. 33  This view is also consistent with s 93C of the TAA. Section 93C requires the Commissioner to amend an assessment where a person is entitled to a foreign tax credit under s LK 1 of the Act (foreign tax credits for CFC income) and where the amount of the credit cannot be determined before the person must file a return. The time period in this case runs from the end of the income year in which the person was entitled to the credit. 185. The Commissioner may extend the four-year period for claiming a foreign tax credit by up to two years (s 78B of the TAA). 186. The time limit for claiming foreign tax credits under s 78B applies to foreign tax credits arising under domestic law and foreign tax credits arising under a DTA. Timing of foreign tax credits Does foreign tax have to be paid in the same year in which the income is derived? 187. Foreign tax does not have to be paid in the same year in which the income is derived for New Zealand tax purposes. 188. In the Commissioner’s view, s LJ 2 does not require the foreign tax (for which a credit is available) to have been paid in the year in which the income being taxed is derived for New Zealand tax purposes. The reasons supporting this view are:  The ordinary meanings of ss LJ 1, LJ 2 and LJ 3 do not indicate that the foreign income tax needs to be paid in the same tax period as the foreign tax credit is claimed.  The segmentation approach under s LJ 5 only requires the foreign income to be allocated to a tax year and not the foreign income tax paid.  It is possible that a direct correlation may not exist between most foreign tax periods and the relevant tax year in New Zealand, so Parliament must not have intended a strict correlation between the relevant foreign tax period and the tax year in which the foreign tax credit is claimed. How to adjust for timing differences 189. If New Zealand income tax is paid in year one and foreign tax on that same income is paid in year two, the Commissioner will re-open an assessment for year one to give credit for the foreign tax paid on that income. The focus is on matching the foreign tax credit to the New Zealand income year of derivation. This might occur where New Zealand and the foreign state have different income years or where the income is treated as derived in a later year in the foreign state. 190. It is not possible to claim a foreign tax credit in year two, because s LJ 5 restricts any foreign tax credit to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on each segment of foreign-sourced income that is allocated to the income year (ie, year two). As the income has already been returned in year one (and New Zealand tax paid), there will be no income in year two against which to claim a credit. 191. Applications to re-open an assessment must be made to the Commissioner in writing. Applications are made under s 113 of the TAA and must contain proof that the foreign tax has been paid (see para \[170\] above). Further details can be found in Standard Practice Statement SPS 16/01: “Requests to amend assessments” in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 4 (May 2016):12. 34 Example illustrating how to adjust for timing differences Further examples 192. The examples set out below are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Examples 6 to 8 consider whether a taxpayer may be able to claim a foreign tax credit for certain foreign taxes. Examples 9 and 10 consider more complex foreign tax credit issues. These examples have been included because they are current issues that the Commissioner has been asked to consider. 193. Where not otherwise stated, foreign amounts have been converted to New Zealand dollars. Example 6 – Australian Temporary Budget Repair Levy – integrated into a tax covered under art 2 194. Kai is a New Zealand tax resident. He owns two commercial properties in Sydney. During the 2016 New Zealand tax year, he derives rental income from those properties that results in taxable income of AUS$200,000. This is Kai’s only income for the 2016 tax year. Example 5 – foreign tax credits and timing differences Sven is a New Zealand tax resident who owns a commercial rental property in Australia. The rent is paid annually on 12th March directly into Sven’s New Zealand bank account. As Sven is a New Zealand tax resident he is taxed in New Zealand on his worldwide income, including his Australian rental income. Sven files his New Zealand IR3 tax return on 12 June 2016 (before the 7 July deadline for filing). He declares his Australian rental income and pays New Zealand income tax on that income under s CC 1 of the Act. At this time, Sven has not filed his Australian tax return and has not paid any Australian income tax on the rental income. He therefore cannot claim a foreign tax credit for Australian income tax because he has not yet paid this tax, as is required under s LJ 2(1). In October, Sven prepares his Australian tax return. The Australian tax year runs from 1 July to 30 June and returns are due on 31 October. Sven understands that he must also pay tax in Australia on the rental income. Sven files his Australian tax return and pays Australian income tax on the rental income on 31 October 2016. Sven has now paid tax twice on this rental income. Under art 6 of the New Zealand/Australia DTA both states (Australia and New Zealand) have a shared right to tax the rental income. However, under art 23 of the DTA, New Zealand (as the state of residence), must provide a foreign tax credit for the tax imposed by and paid in Australia on the rental income (subject to the calculation provisions in subpart LJ). Sven understands that he is entitled to claim a foreign tax credit for the Australian tax paid on the rental income. He understands that he must match this foreign tax credit with the income in the year the income was derived. Sven therefore applies to the Commissioner in writing under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to amend his 2016 return to claim a foreign tax credit for the foreign tax paid in Australia. Sven must make his application within the time limits prescribed by s 78B of the TAA and he must provide proof that he has paid Australian income tax on the rental income. 35 195. In addition to Australian income tax, Kai’s taxable income is subject to the Australian Temporary Budget Repair Levy (TBRL) at a rate of 2% on taxable income above AUS$180,000: Taxable income: AUS$200,000 Australian income tax: AUS$72,000 Australian Temporary Budget Repair Levy: AUS$400 196. Kai understands that he can claim a foreign tax credit under the New Zealand/Australia DTA for Australian income tax paid. Australian income tax is specifically covered by the DTA under art 2(1)(a)(i). Article 6 (Income from real property) allocates an unlimited right to tax the rental income to Australia (as the state of source). New Zealand may also tax the income, but will have to provide a foreign tax credit under art 23 (Elimination of double taxation) for foreign tax paid. 197. Kai wants to know whether his foreign tax credit for Australian income tax would include credit for the TBRL. 198. As the list of taxes covered in art 2 of the New Zealand/Australia DTA is an exhaustive list, the TBRL will only be creditable if it is integrated into one of the taxes covered or if it is an identical or substantially similar tax under art 2(2). 199. The TBRL was introduced as part of the 2014-2015 Federal Budget of Australia. It was enacted as a short-term measure to try and reduce the Australian Federal budget deficit. The TBRL is imposed at a rate of 2% on individual taxpayers with a taxable income of more than AUS$180,000 per year 25 . It applies to residents and non-residents from 1 July 2014 until 30 June 2017. The TBRL is applied after a taxpayer’s basic income tax liability has been calculated (taxable income – tax offsets) because it cannot be reduced by non-refundable tax offsets. 200. The TBRL is reflected in s 4-10(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Australia’s main tax Act). Section 4-10(3) contains the rules for calculating Australian income tax. Note 2 states: Section 4-11 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 (which is about the temporary budget repair levy) may increase the amount of income tax worked out under this section. 201. Section 4-11 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 sets out the rules for calculating the TBRL (as relevant): 4-11 Temporary budget repair levy Temporary budget repair levy (1) You must pay extra income tax (temporary budget repair levy) for a financial year if: (a) you are an individual; and (b) your taxable income for the corresponding income year exceeds $180,000; and (c) the financial year is a temporary budget repair levy year. Note: This section will also affect the income tax payable by some trustees who are taxed as if certain trust income were income of individuals. See sections 98 and 99 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Amount of temporary budget repair levy (2) Your temporary budget repair levy is worked out by reference to your taxable income for the corresponding income year using the rate or rates that apply to you. 25 Individuals with a taxable income of less than AUS$180,000 will not pay the levy, except where their income is subject to some other tax rate based on the top personal marginal tax rate or based on a calculation comprising the top personal tax rate. 36 Note: See Part IV of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986. ... 202. The relevant legislation is clear that the TBRL is not a separate tax, but an increase in the rate of income tax, or extra income tax. The effect of applying the TBRL is that a taxpayer’s Australian income tax liability will increase. On this basis, the Commissioner considers that the TBRL is included in the Australian income tax and is not a separate tax. It will therefore be creditable under the DTA as Australian income tax. 203. The TBRL is similar to the Australian Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy introduced for the 2011-2012 income year to help rebuild infrastructure damaged as a result of the 2010-2011 Queensland floods. Like the TBRL, the levy was simply an increase in the rate of Australian income tax and would be creditable under the DTA as Australian income tax. 204. New Zealand will therefore provide Kai with a foreign tax credit for Australian TBRL. The credit will be calculated under subpart LJ and the foreign tax credit will be limited to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that foreign- sourced income. Example 7 – Australian income tax on capital gains – covered by a DTA 205. Anna is a New Zealand tax resident who owns an investment property on the Gold Coast. In the 2017 income year Anna sells the property for a profit and makes a capital gain. She is taxed on that capital gain in Australia. Anna is also required to account for the capital gain in New Zealand under s CB 6A, as she purchased and sold the property within two years. Anna wants to know if she can claim a foreign tax credit for the tax paid in Australia. 206. Article 2(1)(i) of the New Zealand/Australia DTA explains that Australian income tax is covered by the DTA. 207. Australian capital gains tax is not a separate tax, but a component of Australian income tax. Because the DTA covers Australian income tax (art 2(1)(i)), New Zealand would (if required by the DTA) allow a credit for Australian income tax imposed on capital gains. 208. Article 13(1) of the New Zealand/Australia DTA concerns gains derived by a resident of a contracting state from the alienation of real property. It gives the source state (Australia) an unlimited right to tax that income. New Zealand may also tax that income, but must also provide a foreign tax credit under art 23. 209. New Zealand will therefore provide Anna with a foreign tax credit for Australian income tax (which includes the taxation of capital gains). The credit will be calculated under subpart LJ and the foreign tax credit will be limited to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that foreign-sourced income. Example 8 – Brazilian Income Tax – No DTA in force 210. During the 2016 New Zealand tax year, Elsa derives interest income from investments in Brazil. Brazilian income tax (Imposto de Renda Retido na Fonte (IRRF)) is withheld from the interest income at source. 211. As Elsa is tax resident in New Zealand, she must also pay New Zealand income tax on the Brazilian-sourced interest income. Elsa wants to know if she can claim a foreign tax credit in her 2016 income tax return for the Brazilian income tax paid. 212. There is currently no DTA between New Zealand and Brazil. This means that Elsa cannot claim a foreign tax credit under a DTA. However, Elsa may be entitled to 37 claim a foreign tax credit under the domestic law foreign tax credit rules. The rules will allow a foreign tax credit for foreign income tax paid if the foreign income tax is of “substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under s BB 1”. (See IS 14/02 for details on how to apply this test.) 213. Brazilian IRRF is compulsory, enforceable by law and paid to the Federal Government of Brazil. It is imposed on taxable income and calculated as a proportion of a taxpayer’s income. It is not a penalty, service charge or licence fee, and there is no connection between the payment of the tax and any specific benefit. 214. The Commissioner therefore considers that Brazilian IRRF would satisfy the s YA 2(5) test. Specifically, Brazilian IRRF would satisfy s YA 2(5)(b) – as it is imposed as a collection mechanism for Brazilian income tax and is of substantially the same nature as New Zealand NRWT. 215. Elsa’s foreign tax credit is calculated under subpart LJ. The amount of the credit will be limited to the amount of New Zealand income tax also payable on that foreign-sourced income. Example 9 – United Kingdom employment income incurred when a transitional resident This example follows on from example 1 at para \[47\] of this Interpretation Statement 216. Lucy recently migrated to New Zealand and is a transitional resident under s HR 8(2). Lucy is therefore a New Zealand tax resident but is exempt from income tax on certain items of foreign-sourced income. Prior to migrating, Lucy had been tax resident in the United Kingdom for 10 years. 217. During her first year as a transitional resident, Lucy returns to the United Kingdom and derives employment income while there. United Kingdom income tax and national insurance (NI) contributions are deducted from this income by Lucy’s United Kingdom employer (the employer is resident in the United Kingdom and the employment income was borne by a permanent establishment or fixed base in the United Kingdom). Under s CW 27(a) employment income is not subject to the transitional resident exemption, so the income is also assessable to Lucy in New Zealand. Lucy wants to know if she can claim a foreign tax credit for the United Kingdom income tax and NI contributions. 218. NI contributions are not a tax covered by art 2 of the New Zealand/ United Kingdom DTA. This means Lucy will need to look to the domestic law foreign tax credit rules to determine if she is eligible for a foreign tax credit. One of the requirements of eligibility is that the foreign tax paid must satisfy the test in s YA 2(5). This means it must be a “tax of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under s BB 1”. The Commissioner considered the creditability of NI contributions in IS 14/02. The Commissioner determined that United Kingdom NI Contributions did not satisfy the test in s YA 2(5) (see paras \[223\] to \[225\] of IS 14/02). This means that Lucy is not entitled to a foreign tax credit for NI contributions. 219. However, under art 2(1)(a) of the New Zealand/United Kingdom DTA, United Kingdom income tax is a tax covered by the DTA. (It is assumed for the purposes of this example, that under art 4 of the DTA, Lucy tie-breaks to New Zealand and is therefore deemed to be resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the DTA.) 220. Employment income is considered under art 16 of the DTA: 38 Article 16 – Dependent personal services (1) Subject to the provisions of Articles 17, 19 and 20, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: (a) The recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any consecutive period of 12 months; and (b) The remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and (c) The remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. (3) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic by an enterprise of a Contracting State may be taxed in that State. 221. Under this article, the residence state (New Zealand) has the exclusive right to tax the employment income, unless the employment is exercised in the other state (United Kingdom). If the employment is exercised in the United Kingdom, then the income may be taxed there. 222. In this case, Lucy’s employment is exercised in the United Kingdom. The Model Commentary notes that “\[e\]mployment is exercised in the place where the employee is physically present when performing the activities for which the employment income is paid”. Lucy was physically present in the United Kingdom when performing her employment duties. 223. Article 16 states that where the employment is exercised in the other contracting state, then it may be taxed there. As noted at para \[147\] above, use of the words “may be taxed” indicates that taxing rights to that income are to be shared. This means New Zealand, as the state of residence must provide a foreign tax credit for the tax imposed in the United Kingdom, subject to the calculation provisions in s LJ 5. 224. Article 16 is subject to arts 17 (Directors’ fees), 19 (Pensions and annuities), and 20 (Government service). As Lucy’s employment income cannot be characterised as directors’ fees, a pension or income from government service, these articles do not apply. 225. Paragraph 2 of art 16 must also be considered. This paragraph limits the taxing rights of the United Kingdom (as the state where the employment is exercised), where the employment is short-term in nature. It essentially prevents the United Kingdom from taxing the employment income and gives New Zealand back the sole right to tax the income, where all three conditions are met:  Lucy is present in the United Kingdom for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any consecutive period of 12 months; and  The income is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the United Kingdom; and  The income is not borne by a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the United Kingdom. 226. In Lucy’s case these three conditions are not met. Lucy had previously lived in the United Kingdom for 10 years before moving to New Zealand, so she had been present in the United Kingdom for a period exceeding 183 days in the consecutive period of 12 months. Lucy’s employer was resident in the United Kingdom and 39 the employment income was borne by a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer had, as the employer was already resident in the United Kingdom. Failure to satisfy one of these conditions means that the paragraph does not apply. In this case, all three conditions are not met. This means that the outcome under art 16(1) prevails and the United Kingdom has an unlimited right to tax the employment income, with New Zealand providing a foreign tax credit for the tax paid in the United Kingdom, subject to the calculating provisions in s LJ 5. Example 10 – New Zealand/United States DTA and the application of art 1(3) 227. The New Zealand/United States DTA is different from other DTAs that New Zealand has entered into. This is because the United States taxes individuals on the basis of citizenship, rather than residency. 228. This position is reflected in the Reservation to art 1 of the Model Convention, which notes: 28. The United States reserves the right, with certain exceptions, to tax its citizens and residents, including certain former citizens and long-term residents, without regard to the convention. 229. The United States taxes its citizens (wherever they reside) and resident aliens on their worldwide income. This means that United States citizens residing in New Zealand will be taxable here on the basis of residency, and taxable in the United States on the basis of citizenship. (Citizenship is determined under United States domestic law and is not a DTA concept.) In these circumstances, the DTA applies differently to relieve double taxation, as the following example illustrates. 230. Olaf is a New Zealand tax resident and a self-employed business consultant. He is also a United States citizen. During the 2016 tax year, Olaf worked as an independent contractor in the United States for three months. He provided consultancy services to Widget Co (and its clients) in the United States. Olaf was paid for his services, and United States Federal income tax was withheld from this payment. 231. As Olaf is a New Zealand tax resident he is taxed in New Zealand on his worldwide income. Additionally, Olaf is a United States citizen and is therefore taxable in the United States on his worldwide income. Olaf wants to know if he is entitled to any foreign tax credit relief. 232. In these circumstances, the New Zealand/United States DTA applies. Article 7 (business profits) applies to “business profits of an enterprise”. Article 3(1)(m) of the DTA explains that “enterprise” applies to the “carrying on of any business”, and art 3(1)(n) notes that the term “business” includes “the performance of professional services and other activities of an independent character”. Therefore, art 7 applies to Olaf’s professional services income. 233. Article 7 (business profits) is the appropriate article because art 14 (independent personal services) of the New Zealand/United States DTA was revoked from 12 November 2010. The revocation is consistent with the Model Convention, which has also deleted this article. The Model Commentary on arts 5 and 14 states that income derived from professional services or other activities of an independent character should be considered under art 7, as business profits. 234. Article 7(1) of the New Zealand/United States DTA provides: 1. The business profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the business profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 40 235. Under art 7, Olaf’s business profits are taxable only in New Zealand, unless he carries on business in the United States through a permanent establishment. Article 5 (permanent establishment), defines “permanent establishment”: 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 236. Olaf and his business are based in New Zealand. He provided advice in the United States on a short-term basis. He worked at various times at the office of Widget Co and at their clients’ offices. He therefore does not have a “fixed place of business” in the United States through which his business is wholly or partly carried on and so does not have a “permanent establishment”. Therefore, under art 7, Olaf should only be subject to tax in New Zealand on the income earned in the United States. 237. However, as mentioned above, the New Zealand/United States DTA operates differently to other DTAs. In these circumstances reference must be made to art 1(3) of the DTA, known as the “savings clause”. Article 1(3) states: 3. Except to the extent provided in paragraph 4, this Convention shall not affect the taxation by a Contracting State of its residents (as determined under Article 4 (Residence)) and its citizens. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a former citizen or former long-term resident of a Contracting State may, for the period of ten years following the loss of such status, be taxed in accordance with the laws of that Contracting State. 238. The effect of art 1(3) is that the United States maintains its right to tax its United States citizens, regardless of the DTA. So, while New Zealand has been allocated the exclusive right to tax Olaf’s personal services income under art 7, the United States also continues to tax that income under art 1(3). 239. However, there is an exception to the application of art 1(3), set out in art 1(4), which helps to resolve this double taxation outcome: 4. The provisions of paragraph 3 shall not effect (sic): (a) the benefits conferred in a Contracting State under the Convention in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises), paragraph 1(b) of Article 18 (Pensions and Annuities), and Articles 22 (Relief from Double Taxation), 23 (Non- Discrimination), and 24 (Mutual Agreement Procedure); and (b) the benefits conferred in a Contracting State under the Convention in accordance with Articles 19 (Government Service), 20 (Students), and 26 (Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers), upon individuals who are neither citizens of, nor have immigrant status in, that State. 240. Under art 1(4)(a), art 22 (relief from double taxation) is listed as an exception to the rule in art 1(3). Put another way, the “savings clause” in art 1(3) is not to affect the application of art 22. Article 22(1) provides: 1. Subject to paragraph 4, and in accordance with the provisions and subject to the limitations of the law of the United States (as it may be amended from time to time without changing the general principle hereof), in the case of the United States double taxation shall be avoided as follows: (a) the United States shall allow to a resident or citizen of the United States or a United States company as a credit against United States tax the income tax paid to New Zealand by or on behalf of such resident, citizen or company; and (b) the United States shall also allow to a United States company owning at least 10 percent of the voting stock of a company (other than a United States company) which is a resident of New Zealand and from which the United States company receives dividends, as a credit against United States tax, the income tax paid to New Zealand by or on behalf of the distributing company with respect to the profits out of which the dividends are paid. For the purposes of this paragraph, the taxes referred to in paragraphs 3(a) and 4 of Article 2 (Taxes Covered) shall be considered income taxes. 41 241. Under art 22(1) the United States agrees to provide Olaf with a foreign tax credit for the New Zealand income tax imposed on the income earned in the United States. That credit will be calculated under the domestic law of the United States. (As Olaf is a United States citizen, the United States will also want to tax Olaf on his worldwide income, including income earned in New Zealand. Olaf will need to determine which article or articles apply to his New Zealand income and how those articles will relieve double taxation.) 242. The United States Internal Revenue Code contains the foreign tax credit calculation provisions. Section 904 IRC 26 USC restricts the amount of the foreign tax credit to the amount of United States tax payable on that income from sources outside the United States. This section could potentially deny Olaf a credit, as his income has a United States source. The problem is resolved by referring back to the DTA. Article 22(4)(c) of the New Zealand/United States DTA applies to deem the income to have a New Zealand source, therefore allowing the credit under United States domestic law: 4. For the purpose of allowing relief from double taxation pursuant to this Article, income shall be deemed to arise as follows: ... (c) For purposes of paragraph 3, income beneficially owned by a resident of New Zealand who is a citizen of the United States or a United States company shall be deemed to arise in New Zealand to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this paragraph. 243. Olaf must apply to the United States Inland Revenue Service for a foreign tax credit. He cannot seek a foreign tax credit from New Zealand, because under the New Zealand/United States DTA, New Zealand has been allocated the sole right to tax this income.

Section BD 1 provides: BD 1 Income, exempt income, excluded income, non-residents' foreign-sourced income, and assessable income Amounts of income (1) An amount is income of a person if it is their income under a provision in Part C (Income). Exempt income (2) An amount of income of a person is exempt income if it is their exempt income under a provision in subpart CW (Exempt income) or CZ (Terminating provisions). Excluded income (3) An amount of income of a person is excluded income if— (a) it is their excluded income under a provision in subpart CX (Excluded income) or CZ; and (b) it is not their non-residents' foreign-sourced income. Non-residents' foreign-sourced income (4) An amount of income of a person is non-residents' foreign-sourced income if— (a) the amount is a foreign-sourced amount; and (b) the person is a non-resident when it is derived; and (c) the amount is not income of a trustee to which section HC 25(2) (Foreign-sourced amounts: non-resident trustees) applies. Assessable income (5) An amount of income of a person is assessable income in the calculation of their annual gross income if it is not income of any of the following kinds: (a) their exempt income: (b) their excluded income: (c) their non-residents' foreign-sourced income. 2. Section BH 1(4) provides: BH 1 Double tax agreements ... Overriding effect (4) Despite anything in this Act, except subsection (5) or (5B), or in any other Inland Revenue Act or the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993, a double tax agreement has effect in relation to— (a) income tax: (b) any other tax imposed by this Act: (c) the exchange of information that relates to a tax, as defined in paragraphs (a)(i) to (v) of the definition of tax in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Section LJ 5 provides: LJ 5 Calculation of New Zealand tax What this section does (1) This section provides the rules that a person must use to calculate the amount of New Zealand tax for an income year in relation to each segment of foreign-sourced income of the person that is allocated to the income year. 44 Calculation for single segment (2) If the person has a notional income tax liability of more than zero, the amount of New Zealand tax for the income year relating to the allocated segment is calculated using the following formula, the result of which can not be less than zero: ((segment – person’s deductions) ÷ person’s net income) x notional liability. Definition of items in formula (3) In the formula in subsection (2),— (a) segment is the amount of the segment of foreign-sourced income for the income year: (b) person’s deductions is the amount of the person’s deduction for the tax year corresponding to the income year that is attributable to the segment of foreign- sourced income: (c) person’s net income is the person’s net income for the tax year corresponding to the income year under section BC 4(1) to (3) ( Net income and net loss): (d) notional liability is the person’s notional income tax liability for the income year under subsection (5). When subsection (4B) applies (4) Subsection (4B) applies for the income year when the total amount of New Zealand tax for all segments of foreign-sourced income of the person calculated under subsection (2) is more than the notional income tax liability. Modification to results of formula for single segment (4B) Each amount of New Zealand tax calculated under subsection (2) in relation to each segment of foreign-sourced income is adjusted by multiplying the amount by the following ratio: person’s notional income tax liability ÷ NZ tax. Definition of item in formula (4C) In the formula in subsection (4B), NZ tax is the amount given by adding together the result of the calculation under subsection (2), for each segment of assessable income from all sources, including assessable income sourced in New Zealand. Person’s notional income tax liability (5) For the purposes of this section, a person’s notional income tax liability for a tax year is calculated using the formula— (person’s net income − losses) × tax rate. Definition of items in formula (6) In the formula in subsection (5),— (a) person’s net income is the person’s net income for the tax year: (b) losses— (i) is the amount of the loss balance carried forward to the tax year that the person must subtract from their net income under section IA 4(1)(a) (Using loss balances carried forward to tax year): (ii) must be no more than the amount of the person’s net income: (c) tax rate is the basic rate of income tax set out in schedule 1, part A (Basic tax rates: income tax, ESCT, RSCT, RWT, and attributed fringe benefits). 4. Section YD 1 provides: YD 1 Residence of natural persons What this section does (1) This section contains the rules for determining when a person who is not a company is a New Zealand resident for the purposes of this Act. Permanent place of abode in New Zealand (2) Despite anything else in this section, a person is a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere. 45 183 days in New Zealand (3) A person is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period. Person treated as resident from first of 183 days (4) If subsection (3) applies, the person is treated as resident from the first of the 183 days until the person is treated under subsection (5) as ceasing to be a New Zealand resident. Ending residence: 325 days outside New Zealand (5) A person treated as a New Zealand resident only under subsection (3) stops being a New Zealand resident if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period. Person treated as non-resident from first of 325 days (6) The person is treated as not resident from the first of the 325 days until they are treated again as resident under this section. Government servants (7) Despite subsection (5), a person who is personally absent from New Zealand in the service, in any capacity, of the New Zealand Government is treated as a New Zealand resident during the absence. Presence for part-days (8) For the purposes of this section, a person personally present in New Zealand for part of a day is treated as— (a) present in New Zealand for the whole day; and (b) not absent from New Zealand for any part of the day. \[subss (9) and (10) have been repealed\] Treatment of non-resident seasonal workers (11) Despite subsection (3), a non-resident seasonal worker is treated for the duration of their employment under the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) instructions as a non- resident. 5. Section YD 4 provides: YD 4 Classes of income treated as having New Zealand source What this section does (1) This section lists the types of income that are treated as having a source in New Zealand for the purposes of this Act.

The two main methods used to determine when an amount of income has been derived are the cash basis and the accrual basis. No general rule of law requires that any particular profession must account for income using one method or the other. However, the correct method is not a matter of choice or practice. Identifying the correct method is a question of fact, having regard to the nature of the business or income-earning activity of any given professional. 2. The courts consider a variety of factors when determining which method is appropriate for a particular business or profession. Not all factors will be relevant in every case and the factors will likely be given different weight. The courts consider these factors:  the type of activity carried on by the taxpayer that gave rise to the income;  the characteristics of the type of income at issue;  the legal and regulatory environment in which the taxpayer operates;  the scale of the business or income-earning activity; and  the level of sophistication or complexity of the business. 3. In each case, these factors must be weighed against one another to decide which method is appropriate. 4. The courts have held that a cash basis may be appropriate in the following circumstances:  an ordinary individual who does not carry on a trade, profession, or business;  a business or income earning activity involving a professional person marketing nothing but their own services and receiving nothing but professional fees;  a business in which expenditure contributes to income in a subsidiary or minor degree; and  a business in which the risk of non-collectable trade debts is unusually high. 5. In most other situations where income is earned from professional services, the accrual basis will be appropriate. 6. When a person accounts for income on a cash basis, that person’s income is derived when it is received. When a person accounts for income on an accrual basis, that person’s income is derived when it is earned. The time at which income is earned may be evident from the contract. The cases show that determining when professional fees are earned can be broken down into the following questions: 3 Classified Public  First, has the taxpayer performed the services required under the contract and discharged their obligations?  Second, is the taxpayer entitled under the contract to demand payment for the services provided? 7. If there is no contract or the terms of a contract do not determine when income is derived, then standard accounting principles and commercial practice may assist in determining when income from professional fees is derived. In particular, it will be necessary to determine whether:  the income-earning process is complete;  the amount of income can be reasonably calculated; and  what has taken place satisfies the general understanding among practical business people of what constitutes a derivation of income. 8. In some situations, it may be necessary to change from a cash basis to an accrual basis or from an accrual basis to a cash basis. In these situations, s EG 2 provides rules for transitioning from one method to the other. The effect of applying s EG 2 is that all income is accounted for when a person moves from a cash basis to an accrual basis. When a person moves from an accrual basis to a cash basis, s EG 2 also prevents income from being double counted. Introduction 9. This Interpretation Statement withdraws and replaces three items about when fees from professional services are derived:  “When to Return Directors’ Fees” Public Information Bulletin Vol 37 (November 1966): 6 (PIB 37);  “Derivation of Income from Services for Income Tax Purposes” Public Information Bulletin Vol 159 (February 1987): 1 (PIB 159); and  “Derivation of Income from Services for Income Tax Purposes” Public Information Bulletin Vol 172 (March 1988): 1 (PIB 172). 10. PIB 159 and PIB 172 considered the rules for changing between accounting bases in the Income Tax Act 1976. This Interpretation Statement also withdraws and replaces “Whether Doctor Companies can Return Income Using the Cash Basis’ Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 6 (June 1997): 19 (TIB item on doctor companies). 11. This Interpretation Statement explains when a person derives income from professional services. The term “professional services” is used to describe someone who earns income from providing services to a third party through the exercise of personal skill and knowledge. Examples of professional services identified in the Public Information Bulletin items were accountants, architects, chiropractors, consultants, contractors, engineers, solicitors, surveyors, and veterinarians. The items also address barristers sole, medical practitioners and directors in more detail. Analysis 12. This Interpretation Statement provides guidance on when income from professional services should be returned for tax purposes. This requires determining when an amount of income has been “derived” for the purposes of the Act. To determine when a person will be treated as deriving income from 4 Classified Public professional services for tax purposes it is necessary to consider the following questions:  When is the cash basis or the accrual basis appropriate?  When is income derived under the cash basis?  When is income derived under the accrual basis? 13. This Interpretation Statement then applies the general principles to medical practitioners, barristers sole, and directors (updating the Public Information Bulletin items on these professions). This Interpretation Statement also applies the general principles to professionals who operate through companies (updating the TIB item on doctor companies). 14. Finally, this Interpretation Statement addresses the consequences of changing between the cash basis and the accrual basis. When is income from professional services derived? 15. To determine when income from professional services is derived, it is first necessary to consider the legislative requirements. Derivation of income under the Act 16. Every amount of income must be allocated to an income year: s BD 3(1). The general rule is that an amount of income is allocated to the income year in which the amount is “derived”: s BD 3(2). Income that has not previously been derived by a person will be treated as derived when it is credited in their account or dealt with in their interest or on their behalf: s BD 3(4). 17. If a provision in Parts C or E to I of the Act apply, then the income is allocated in accordance with that provision. Depending on the facts of each case, a provision in any of Parts C or E to I may determine when income is derived. This Interpretation Statement provides a general explanation of when income from professional fees is derived. This Interpretation Statement assumes that no provision in Parts C or E to I applies, unless expressly stated. Therefore, it is necessary to determine when an amount of income has been “derived” according to general principles. 18. To determine when an amount of income has been derived, s BD 3(3) states that regard must be had to case law, which:  requires some people to recognise income on an accrual basis; and  requires some people to recognise income on a cash basis; and  more generally, defines the concept of derivation. 19. The concepts of “cash basis” and “accrual basis” are explained at para 24. 20. The word “derived” is not defined in the Act. In summary, the courts consider that “derived” means “flowing, springing, or emanating from, and is synonymous with the English tax expression ‘arising or accruing’”: per Richardson J in Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,226 (CA) at \[14\]. The word “derived” means more than received; it connotes the source or origin, rather than the fund or place, from which the income was taken: CIR v NV Phillips’ Gloielampenfabriken \[1955\] NZLR 868 (SC & CA). 21. There are two closely related aspects of the concept of derivation. The first is the source of the income. The source of the income is, for example, the contract or the circumstances from which the income arises. The second aspect is the time 5 Classified Public at which the income is derived. It is this second aspect with which this Interpretation Statement is concerned. Case law on derivation generally 22. The courts are reluctant to formulate a universal test for determining when an amount of income has been derived. Previous cases are helpful signposts, but the time at which income is derived will depend on the facts: Hawkes Bay. The aim is to identify the method that provides a substantially correct reflex of income: Commissioner of Taxes (South Australia) v The Executor, Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Ltd \[1938\] 63 CLR 108 (Carden’s case). Absolute precision is not required: CIR v Farmers Trading Co Ltd (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200 (CA). However, it is necessary to determine which method will produce the more accurate picture of a person’s income: Farmers Trading; Horizon Homes Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,064. 23. Derivation of income is governed by the principles followed in business and commerce: Carden’s case. However, business and commercial concepts and principles are persuasive, but not determinative. While accounting standards are not determinative for income tax purposes, they will normally be the first point of inquiry. Accounting standards tolerate a range of “reasonable” treatments. However, for the purposes of the Act, only one method will be appropriate: the method that provides a substantially correct reflex of income: Farmers Trading. When is the cash basis or the accrual basis appropriate? 24. As expressly noted in s BD 3(3), there are two main methods of determining when an amount of income has been derived: the cash basis and the accrual basis (the term “method” is used to refer to both bases). The cash basis method of accounting for income is sometimes referred to as the receipts basis. Similarly, the accrual basis is sometimes referred to as the earnings basis. For ease of reference and in accordance with s BD 3(3), this Interpretation Statement will use the terms “cash basis” and “accrual basis”. 25. To determine when a person has derived income, it is necessary to identify the appropriate method of income recognition for the particular taxpayer. Under the cash basis, income is recognised only when it is received. Under the accrual basis, an amount of income is derived when it is earned, regardless of when it is actually received. When an amount of income is earned will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. 26. There appear to be no cases that state that, as a matter of general principle, a person in any particular profession must account on a cash basis: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Dunn 89 ATC 4141 (FCA). The same is true for the accruals basis. Instead, as noted above, the courts will consider which method provides a substantially correct reflex of income: Carden’s case. This Interpretation Statement discusses the various factors that indicate whether the cash basis or the accrual basis is appropriate. 27. The courts may consider a variety of factors when determining which method is appropriate for a particular business or profession. Not all factors will be relevant in every case. Also, in each case, the factors considered may be accorded differing weights. The factors the courts have considered can be grouped as follows:  the type of activity carried on by the taxpayer that gave rise to the income;  the characteristics of the type of income at issue;  the legal and regulatory environment in which the taxpayer operates; 6 Classified Public  the scale of the business or income-earning activity; and  the level of sophistication or complexity of the business. 28. In each case, these factors must be weighed against one another to decide which method is appropriate. This Interpretation Statement explains each of these factors in more detail from para 29. Type of activity carried on by the taxpayer 29. The courts will consider the manner in which the taxpayer carries out their business that gave rise to the income. For example, the taxpayer’s regular method of contracting and doing business may indicate whether a cash or accrual basis is appropriate: CIR v National Bank of New Zealand (1976) 2 NZTC 61,150 (CA). 30. The accrual basis will be more appropriate for most businesses, including professions: Carden’s case. It is generally accepted that a trader or trading entity should account for income on an accrual basis: Whitworth Park Coal Co. Ltd (in liq) v CIR \[1961\] AC 31; Fincon (Construction) Ltd v CIR \[1970\] NZLR 462 (CA); CIR v Farmers Trading; CIR v Morrison (1928-1933) 17 TC 325; Carden’s case. However, the courts have noted that there may be exceptions to this principle: National Bank; Morrison; Carden’s case. 31. The courts have held that a cash basis may be appropriate in the following circumstances:  an ordinary individual who does not carry on a trade, profession, or business: Whitworth Park; Case F156 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,343;  a business or income earning activity involving a professional person marketing nothing but their own services and receiving nothing but professional fees: Morrison; Carden’s case; FCT v Firstenberg 76 ATC 4141;  a business in which expenditure contributes to income in a subsidiary or minor degree: Carden’s case; and  a business in which the risk of non-collectable trade debts is unusually high: National Bank per Cooke J. Characteristics of the type of income at issue 32. The courts will also consider the characteristics of the type of income at issue, if it is relevant. For example, the courts have indicated that a cash basis may be appropriate when the:  level of expectation of payment inherent in the type of income is typically low: Carden’s case; Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314 (HCA); Barratt & Ors v FCT (1992) 92 ATC 4,275.  receipts are governed or affected by legislation such that there are restrictions on when fees can be recovered: Australian Gas Light; Firstenberg.  income represents a reward for professional skill and personal work: Carden’s case; Morrison. Legal and regulatory environment in which the taxpayer operates 33. For taxpayers in a profession, the legal and regulatory environment in which the taxpayer operates may be relevant. For example, the nature of the taxpayer’s business may be shaped by the typical contractual obligations they enter into, or 7 Classified Public constraints imposed on the taxpayer by their regular method of contracting and doing business. For example, in Firstenberg, McInerney J said at 4149: Whether the remuneration is to be paid in advance of the performance of the service or from time to time during the performance of the service or only on the completion of the performance of those services is a matter which may be regulated by express or implied agreement between the professional man and the client. 34. In other situations, laws or regulations may affect when income is derived. In Australian Gas Light the taxpayer’s business was heavily regulated and the circumstances of the taxpayer were described as being “exceptional”. In this case the time of derivation was dictated by the statute governing the taxpayer’s business. Scale of the business or income earning activity 35. The scale of the business is relevant to determining the appropriate accounting method for a professional: Henderson v FCT 70 ATC 4016; Firstenberg; Dunn; Barratt. At one end of the spectrum is the substantial business operation carried on by a large accounting partnership, such as in Henderson. In that case, the accrual basis was the appropriate method for an accounting practice with 19 partners and 295 employees. At the other end of the spectrum, is the solicitor in Firstenberg who practised on his own account and employed one secretary. In that case, the cash basis was held to be appropriate. 36. Indicators of the scale of a business include the:  number of employees and the nature of the work they undertake (that is, whether the employees contribute in only a subsidiary or minor way to the earning of income): Henderson; Firstenberg; Dunn; Barratt;  general size of the business (in Henderson the firm was conducted in various centres, was the largest firm in Western Australia, and one of the largest firms in Australia); and  total amount of fees earned and disbursements made: Henderson. 37. Where the number of employees is very low or nil, the business is small in size and the total amount of fees earned and disbursements made is low, those factors would indicate that a cash basis might be more appropriate. Otherwise, the accrual basis will be appropriate. 38. In considering the scale of a business, it is necessary to look at the whole of the arrangements. For example, in Barratt, the taxpayers were members of a partnership that undertook a pathology practice. Services such as the collection and testing of pathological samples and various nursing, secretarial and courier services were provided to the partnership through a service company that also purchased equipment and was the employer of staff. The shareholders and directors of the service company were the spouses of the partners. The court held that the accruals basis was appropriate. The court based its decision on the following:  while the partners rendered professional services directly, most of the work from which income was derived was done by nurses and qualified technicians;  large and expensive plant was used; and  a large number of staff were employed involving significant expenditure. 8 Classified Public Level of sophistication or complexity of the business or income-earning activity 39. The level of sophistication or complexity of the taxpayer’s business or accounts may indicate which method is appropriate. In terms of the complexity of the business, an accrual basis may be more appropriate for a business that involves fixed or circulating capital: Carden’s case; Firstenberg. Another example might be the level of a taxpayer’s trade debts: Whitworth Park; Case F156. The need to account for trade debts often indicates that an accrual basis will be appropriate. However, a cash basis may be appropriate for a business in which the risk of non- collectable trade debts is unusually high (as suggested in an obiter comment by Cooke J in National Bank) or where there is little certainty about the payment of fees (as suggested by Dixon J in Carden’s case in relation to a medical practice). 40. The level of sophistication or complexity of the taxpayer’s accounts may also indicate which accounting method is appropriate: Dunn. However, as previously noted, the taxpayer’s accounting treatment is not determinative. Nevertheless, the Australian courts have suggested that an accrual basis may be appropriate for a professional when:  the taxpayer accounts for work in progress and carries the value of that work into a balance sheet at the end of the year: Dunn;  it is necessary to distinguish between income on capital account or income on revenue account: Firstenberg; and  it is necessary to ascertain the “capital account” or the “loan account” of the taxpayer: Firstenberg. Summary 41. In summary, the cash basis will be appropriate for very small-scale professions. Some other indications that a cash basis may be appropriate include:  the income received represents a reward for professional skill and personal work;  expenditure contributes to income in a minor way;  the level of expectation of payment inherent in the type of income is typically low;  there are no employees;  if there are employees, they are few and they contribute in only a subsidiary or minor way to the earning of income (an example might be an administrative assistant); and  sophisticated or complex financial accounts are not required. 42. It is necessary to weigh up all the factors in any particular case to determine whether the cash basis is appropriate. The ultimate question is whether the cash basis provides a substantially correct reflex of income. 43. The accrual basis will be appropriate in all other circumstances. When is income derived under the cash basis? 44. If a person accounts for income on a cash basis, that person’s income is derived when it is received. As stated by Dixon J in Carden’s case at 155, “the object is to discover what gains have during the period of account come home to the taxpayer in a realized or immediately realizable form”. 9 Classified Public 45. Income that has not previously been derived by a person will be treated as derived when it is credited in their account, or in some other way, dealt with in their interest or on their behalf: s BD 3(4). Expenditure 46. This Interpretation Statement is concerned with when income is recognised for tax purposes. However, it is important to note that determining when expenditure is recognised for tax purposes is governed by subpart DA. Section DA 1 does not distinguish between the cash basis and the accrual basis for recognition of expenditure. The test is whether the expenditure has been incurred. The courts have defined the term “incurred” to mean “definitively committed to”: FCT v James Flood (1953) 88 CLR 492; CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Ltd (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351 (PC). As a result, a person accounting on a cash basis may recognise expenditure before it is actually paid. When is income derived under the accrual basis? 47. Richardson J (who delivered the judgment for the Court of Appeal) explained the accrual basis in Farmers Trading. Richardson J said that the essence of the accrual concept is that both revenue and costs are:  accrued (that is, recognised as they are earned or incurred, not as money is received or paid);  matched with one another so far as their relationship can be established or justifiably assumed; and  dealt with in the profit and loss account of the period to which they relate. 48. Under the accrual basis income is returned at the point at which revenue is “earned”, independently of the date payment is made or becomes due: Hawke’s Bay. 49. There appear to be no New Zealand cases that consider when a professional earns income. However, this issue has been considered in Australia. In addition, the courts in both Australia and New Zealand have considered when income is “earned” more generally. 50. The courts have used various terms to attempt to define the time when income is earned. In Australia, when determining when income from professional services has been derived, the courts have tended to identify the point at which a “recoverable debt” arises (Henderson, Firstenberg, Barratt). In New Zealand, the courts have referred to a time when there is an “entitlement to bill” (Hawkes Bay, PIB 159). Ultimately, however, regardless of the terminology that is used, the cases show that a taxpayer’s earning process is complete when the activity that gives rise to a debt is complete, and no further steps are required to be taken by the taxpayer before being entitled to payment: Australian Gas Light; Hawke’s Bay; Egmont Cooperative Dairies Ltd (In Liq) v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,536. That is, no contingencies or conditions precedent affect the taxpayer’s right to demand payment: Australian Gas Light; Egmont. 51. Therefore, the cases show that determining when professional fees are earned can be broken down into the following questions:  First, has the taxpayer performed the services required under the contract and discharged their obligations?  Second, is the taxpayer entitled under the contract to demand payment for the services provided? 10 Classified Public 52. If there is no contract or the terms of a contract do not determine when income is derived, then standard accounting principles and commercial practice may assist in determining when income from professional fees is derived. In particular, it will be necessary to determine whether:  the income earning process is complete;  the amount of income can be reasonably calculated; and  what has taken place satisfies the general understanding among practical business people of when income is derived. 53. These tests are discussed in more detail below. Terms of the contract 54. Generally, the terms of the contract between the professional and the client (where an express contract exists) will determine when an amount of income is derived: HW Coyle Ltd v CIR (1980) 4 NZTC 61,558; Horizon Homes Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,064. 55. In Hawkes Bay, the Court of Appeal held (at 15,232) that the terms of the contract were a “complete answer” to the question of when the taxpayer derived income. Under the contract in that case, the consumers used electricity and contractually accepted responsibility to pay for it. The consumers’ liability to pay arose when they consumed electricity. For its part, the company supplied and sold that electricity and was contractually entitled to read the meter at any time or estimate the usage and render a bill on balance date. While this was not a case about professional services income, the principles can also be applied to professional services situations. 56. Where a contract expressly provides for payment, a taxpayer can be regarded as having only derived income to which they are contractually entitled: Horizon, Hawkes Bay. This means that where the contract provides for progress payments, those amounts will be derived only when they are due under the contract. If no payments are due under the contract until completion, the taxpayer cannot derive income to which they are not yet contractually entitled: Horizon. 57. The point at which a professional is entitled to demand payment for their services may be apparent in the terms of an express agreement. If there is no express agreement, the right to demand payment may arise periodically (progress billings) or when the work is completed, depending on the facts. Where the contract expressly provides for the time at which the person is entitled to payment of the amount, that time will generally indicate when the income will be derived. Where there is no express agreement, standard accounting principles and business and commercial practice will be relevant to determining the time of derivation of an amount of income. 58. The legal and regulatory environment may also affect the time that income is derived under the contract: Australian Gas Light Co; Firstenberg. For example, in Australian Gas Light, the taxpayer’s business was heavily regulated. The taxpayer was prohibited from demanding payment before the end of the billing periods imposed by statute. The taxpayer only accounted for amounts relating to gas consumed up to 30 June where the relevant meter had been read and an account based on that reading had been issued. The Federal Commissioner of Taxation argued that amounts relating to the gas consumed up to 30 June, but not yet billed, were amounts of assessable income (that is, an accrual basis). The court held that until the taxpayer was entitled under statute to read meters and render bills for gas consumed, the amounts had not been derived. 11 Classified Public Standard accounting principles and commercial practice 59. Although expressed in various ways, the courts in New Zealand and Australia have consistently looked to generally accepted accounting principles and commercial practice in determining when income is derived. However, such concepts and principles are only persuasive and are not determinative: Horizon; Dunn; Barratt; BHP Billiton Petroleum (Bass Strait) Pty Ltd v FCT (2002) ATC 5169. 60. In Farmers Trading Richardson J noted that generally accepted accounting principles are not a “canonical set of rules”. Instead, they tolerate a variety of reasonable treatments. While accounting standards will be relevant (and often highly persuasive) only one correct time of derivation will be correct for tax purposes. 61. It is important to note that the cases take account of the standard accounting principles that applied at the time of each decision. Standard accounting principles may change and may be different depending on the standards applied by a particular taxpayer (for example, some taxpayers are subject to the International Financial Reporting Standards). Summary 62. Income from professional services is derived when it is earned. Income from professional services is earned according to the terms of the contract. The cases show that the earning process is complete when the activity that gives rise to a debt is complete and no further steps are required to be taken before being entitled to payment. Essentially, income is earned (and therefore “derived”) when the taxpayer:  has performed the services required under the contract and discharged their obligations; and  is entitled under the contract to demand payment for the services provided. 63. If there is no contract, or the terms of a contract do not determine when income is derived, then standard accounting principles and commercial practice may assist in determining when income from professional fees is derived. In particular, it will be necessary to determine whether:  the income-earning process is complete;  the amount of income can be reasonably calculated; and  what has taken place satisfies the general understanding among practical business people of when income is derived. 64. Many professionals keep a record of their time as unbilled work in progress (“WIP”). The total of unbilled WIP will not usually represent income of a taxpayer. Instead, the principles stated above will need to be applied to determine the extent to which unbilled WIP can be regarded as income derived. Prepayments 65. In some circumstances, professionals may be paid amounts prior to having performed any services, for example, by way of an advance, or to be held on trust until the services are performed. Where a professional receives payment in advance of services being provided, the income will not be derived until the professional discharges the obligations for which they have received payment (Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1965) 114 CLR 314 (HCoA)). The obligations that must be discharged will depend on the 12 Classified Public terms of the relevant contract. This principle applies to taxpayers who account on either a cash basis or an accruals basis. How do the general principles apply to medical practitioners, barristers sole, and directors? 66. PIB 159 set out general principles of derivation for professionals. The implication from PIB 159 was that professionals, other than medical practitioners and barristers sole, must account for income on an accrual basis. In addition, PIB 37 stated that directors generally account for income on a cash basis. PIB 37 went on to say that a director may account for income on an accrual basis if it had been their practice to do so. 67. However, as discussed, no general rule of law requires any particular profession to account for income using one method or the other. In addition, the correct method is not a matter of choice or practice. Instead, it is a question of fact having regard to the nature of the business or income earning activity of any given professional and the factors outlined in \[ 27\]. Medical practitioners 68. Having regard to the factors outlined in this Interpretation Statement, a medical practitioner’s practice may vary in scale. Such practices range from single doctors practising on their own, to groups of doctors practising together and sharing administration costs, to large corporate groups with many employees. In addition, the level of sophistication and complexity among medical practitioners’ practices varies widely. Finally, medical practitioners typically contract for their services and there appear to be no legal restrictions on the recovery of fees. 69. Because medical practices vary widely in scale, complexity and sophistication, no particular method will apply to all medical practitioners. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the principles as outlined above should be applied to each medical practitioner’s circumstances to determine the correct reflex of their income. 70. Having regard to the general nature of a medical practice, a medical practitioner who practices as a sole practitioner on a small scale, with no employees (other than, for example, an administrative assistant or secretary who does not bring in fee income) can account on the cash basis. This may also be the case where, while the medical practitioner practises with a group of other medical practitioners in shared premises, they still account for their income on an individual, or sole practitioner, basis. Other medical practitioners who operate through a larger structure should, in most cases, account for income on an accrual basis. This is because the accrual basis is generally appropriate for most businesses, including professions. Barristers sole 71. A barrister sole’s practice is usually small in scale. That is, they are sole practitioners, who often operate in chambers with other barristers sole to share administration costs. A barrister may also operate through an incorporated law firm. However, the Lawyers Conduct and Client Care Rules state that the barrister must be the sole director and voting shareholder. Therefore, a barrister’s practice will generally be small in scale. 72. The income a barrister sole earns is predominantly (if not exclusively) fees from personal services or legal aid payments. In addition, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding a barrister’s practice places significant limits on 13 Classified Public recovery of fees. Given that payment is sometimes uncertain, these limits mean it is not always prudent to account for fees before they are received. 73. Having regard to the general nature of a barrister sole’s practice, and to provide a true reflex of their income, it is expected that the cash basis would generally be appropriate. This is because most barristers sole are analogous to the sole- practice taxpayers in Carden’s case and Firstenberg. 74. Some barristers may operate a more sophisticated practice on a larger scale than other barristers. Therefore, it is conceivable that the accrual basis may, in some situations, provide a correct reflex of a barrister’s income. However, barristers cannot operate through partnerships or companies (unless they are the sole director and voting shareholder), so there are limits on how large in scale a practice can be. A barrister who operates through an incorporated law firm, should also generally account for income on a cash basis. This is because they are still required to operate within the same professional restrictions (ie, they must still operate on their own), whether they are incorporated or not. Directors 75. The scale of a director’s operations may vary. The general principles as outlined in this Interpretation Statement should be applied to the particular circumstances of each director. A director generally provides their services personally. The fees directors earn are received in return for providing specialist knowledge and skill. Most directors would hold one or a small number of directorships. This indicates that the cash basis will generally be the appropriate method. 76. However, some directors may be involved in larger scale operations. Alternatively, some directors might operate through a company as a consultant. These directors might be appointed to multiple boards by virtue of their special expertise. In these situations, the accrual basis likely provides the correct reflex of income. How do the general principles apply to professionals who operate through companies? 77. Many professionals operate through companies. The TIB item on doctor companies stated at 19 that all “doctor companies” must return income on an accrual basis. This is because “the predominant requirement before the cash basis can be used is for the taxpayer’s income to be earned as a result of his or her personal exertions”. 78. The Commissioner considers that there is no general rule of law that prohibits a company run by a professional in sole practice from accounting for its income on a cash basis. This is provided the professional is the only person providing the services and the scale and sophistication of the business otherwise indicated that the cash basis is appropriate. The derivation of income from personal exertion is one indication that a cash basis is appropriate. Although a company does not provide services personally, the cash basis may still be appropriate for one person providing services through a company where the small scale of the operation would otherwise indicate that the cash basis is appropriate. As discussed in this Interpretation Statement, other factors may, on balance, indicate a cash basis is appropriate. 79. The cash basis is still potentially appropriate for barristers in an incorporated law firm. This is because restrictions are imposed on barristers sole, whether they are incorporated or not. This could reasonably be extended to other professionals who operate their sole practice through a company on a small scale and with a low level of complexity. For example, a sole director who operates through a 14 Classified Public company is able to account on a cash basis, provided there are no circumstances that indicate that an accrual basis would provide a more correct reflex of income. This is a modification of the view taken in the TIB item on doctor companies, which stated that a doctor company must always account on an accrual basis. What are the consequences of a change in method? 80. In some situations, it may be necessary to change from a cash basis to an accrual basis or from an accrual basis to a cash basis. In these situations, s EG 2 provides rules for transitioning from one method to the other. The effect of applying s EG 2 is that all income is accounted for when a person moves from a cash basis to an accrual basis. When a person moves from an accrual basis to a cash basis, s EG 2 also prevents income from being double counted. 81. When a person moves from a cash basis to an accrual basis, s EG 2(2) requires that amounts owed to the person on the last day of the income year before the year of change is returned as income in the year of change. In addition, an amount owed by the person on the last day of the income year before the year of change is allowed as a deduction in the year of change. 82. When a person moves from an accrual basis to a cash basis, s EG 2(3) provides that the total of all amounts owing by the person in the year of change (that have been allowed as a deduction in earlier income years) is income of the person in the year of change. In addition, the total of all amounts owing to the person in the year of change (that have been treated as income of the person in earlier income years) is allowed as a deduction in the year of change. 83. The amount arising from these adjustment calculations in ss EG 2(2) and (3) is either income under s CH 4 or a deduction under s DB 52. Meaning of the phrases “amounts owed” and “amounts owing” 84. PIB 172 states that the phrase “amounts owing to”, used in a predecessor section to s EG 2, contemplates that a debt has already been established, rather than the “entitlement to bill” concept which is the basis of PIB 159. 85. The precise meaning of the term “owe” (and its derivatives, “owed”, “owes”, and “owing”) will often depend on the context in which the term is used. The words “owed” or “owing” can mean “yet to be paid” or they can mean “due”. It is possible for an amount to be owing but not yet due (for example, when the time for payment of a debt has not yet passed): Bank of New Zealand v Baker \[1926\] NZLR 462; Perrott v Newtown King Ltd \[1933\] NZLR 1131. 86. For the purposes of s EG 2, the Commissioner considers that an amount that is “owed” or “owing” is an amount that a person is obligated to pay immediately or in the future to a person who has a right to have it paid to them. An amount “owed” or “owing” to a taxpayer can include amounts for which a person is entitled to demand payment (but for which payment has not yet been demanded, for example, with an invoice). This is consistent with the purpose of s EG 2 to ensure that all income is accounted for, and there is no double counting of income when a person moves from one method to the other. This can also be said to be consistent with the time income is “earned” as discussed above. This position is changed from that stated in PIB 172. 15 Classified Public References Related rulings/statements ‘Derivation of Income from Services for Income Tax Purposes’ Public Information Bulletin Vol 159 (February 1987):1; ‘Derivation of Income from Services for Income Tax Purposes’ Public Information Bulletin Vol 172 (March 1988): 1 ‘When to return directors’ fees’ Public Information Bulletin Vol 37 (November 1966): 6; ‘Whether doctor companies can return income using the cash basis’ TIB Vol 9, No 6, June 1997: 19 Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, ss BD 3, EG 2 Subject references Barristers sole Derivation Directors Income Income Tax Medical practitioners Professional fees Case references Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314 (HCA) Bank of New Zealand v Baker \[1926\] NZLR 462 Barratt v FCT (1992) 92 ATC 4,275 BHP Billiton Petroleum (Bass Strait) Pty Ltd v FCT 2002 ATC 5169 CIR v Morrison (1928-1933) 17 TC 325 Case F156 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,343 CIR v Farmers Trading Co Ltd (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200 (CA) CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Ltd (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351 (PC) CIR v Morrison (1928–1933) 17 TC 325 CIR v National Bank of New Zealand (1976) 2 NZTC 61,150 CIR v NV Phillips’ Gloielampenfabriken \[1955\] NZLR 868 (SC & CA) Commissioner of Taxes (South Australia) v The Executor, Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Ltd \[1938\] 63 CLR 108 Egmont Cooperative Dairies Ltd (in liq) v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,536 FCT v Firstenberg 76 ATC 4141 FCT v James Flood (1953) 88 CLR 492 Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Dunn 89 ATC 4141 (FCA) FCT v Australian Gas Light Co 83 ATC 4800 Fincon (Construction) Ltd v CIR \[1970\] NZLR 462 (CA) Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,226 (CA) Henderson v FCT 70 ATC 4016 Horizon Homes Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,064 (HC) HW Coyle Ltd v CIR (1980) 4 NZTC 61,558 Perrott v Newtown King Ltd \[1933\] NZLR 1131 Whitworth Park Coal Co Ltd (In liq) v C of IR \[1961\] AC 31 16 Classified Public Appendix – Legislation Income Tax Act 2007 1.

This interpretation statement contains guidelines that the Commissioner considers relevant in determining whether feasibility expenditure is deductible under the general deductibility provisions in s DA 1. The statement applies where, having regard to the nature of the taxpayer’s business, feasibility expenditure of the type in question is incurred as an ordinary incident of business and is recurrent in nature. Other feasibility expenditure (for example, expenditure associated with a one-off capital expansion or acquisition) is not covered by the statement. Ordinary deductibility principles should be applied to these situations to determine whether the general permission and capital limitation apply. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 2. There are a number of specific deductibility provisions in the Act that may be applicable to some types of feasibility expenditure in some circumstances. These provisions may allow deductions for expenditure that may not otherwise be deductible under the general permission. Some examples are, ss DB 6 and DB 7 (interest), ss DB 18 and DB 20B (lease costs), s DB 19 (resource consents), s DB 33 (scientific research), s DB 34 (research or development), ss DB 36 and DB 37 (patent expenses), s DB 40B (unsuccessful software development), s DB 46 (pollution control) and s DB 62 (legal expenses). This statement does not consider the operation of these provisions. 3. Some types of expenditure also have their own deductibility regimes. For example, Part D, Subpart O (farming); Part D, Subpart P (forestry); Part D, Subpart S (film industry); Part D, Subpart T (petroleum mining); and Part D, Subpart U (mineral mining). This statement does not consider the operation of those regimes. 4. This statement also does not consider the timing of any deduction to which a taxpayer might be entitled or Part E, Subpart E (depreciation). Summary 5. This interpretation statement updates and replaces “IS 08/02: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 6 (July 2008): 12 (the 2008 statement). Amendments to the 2008 statement were necessary to take account of the Supreme Court decision Trustpower Ltd v CIR \[2016\] NZSC 91, (2016) 27 NZTC 20-061. 6. In many situations, it is likely that feasibility expenditure will be non-deductible, either because it is:  incurred preliminary to or preparatory to the commencement of a business or income-earning activity; or  it is capital in nature. Deductibility: General principles 7. For a deduction to be claimed, it will be necessary for the feasibility expenditure to be incurred by the taxpayer:  in the derivation of assessable income (either from the ultimate exploitation of the product of the expenditure in a business or income-earning activity or by sale of the product of the expenditure); and  as an ordinary incident of a particular business or income-earning activity. 8. The deductibility of feasibility expenditure is subject to the application of the general principles under s DA 1(1), the general deductibility provision in the Act. So, for feasibility expenditure to be deductible under either paragraph of s DA 1(1) a sufficient relationship or nexus must exist between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. Any expenditure incurred before a taxpayer has commenced business or commenced a new business or income- earning process will not fulfil this statutory nexus because the expenditure will have been incurred too soon. Therefore, feasibility expenditure incurred preliminary to or preparatory to the establishment of a business or income-earning activity will not be deductible. 3 UNCLASSIFIED 9. The decision whether a business or an income-earning activity is being carried on is always one of fact and degree. Its resolution depends on a consideration of the nature of the activities carried on and the taxpayer’s intention in engaging in those activities (as set down in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA)). A determination of the point at which a taxpayer makes a firm commitment to go into a business or an income-earning activity is critical for establishing the earliest time at which that business or income-earning activity may have commenced. Commitment alone, however, is insufficient. The profit-making structure must also have been established and current operations must have begun to conclude that the business or income-earning process has commenced. 10. The correct characterisation of the nature of the relevant business is vital to resolving whether a sufficient nexus exists between the expenditure and a taxpayer’s business. The activities must be characteristic of that kind of business and the expenditure must be incurred as part of the ordinary business operations. 11. The profit-making structure must also be in place for a business to have commenced. However, the extent of the profit-making structure required depends on the nature of the particular business. 12. The element of commitment is also critical. To conclude that a business or an income-earning activity has commenced, it must be shown that a decision has been made to enter into that business or activity. If expenditure relates to activities undertaken to decide whether to enter into a particular business or income-earning activity, that expenditure will lack the required nexus and will be non-deductible. 13. For feasibility expenditure incurred after a business or an income-earning activity has commenced to be deductible, it must have the requisite nexus with the business or income-earning activity. This means the feasibility expenditure must be incurred as part of the ordinary current operations of that business or income- earning activity. Capital limitation 14. When feasibility expenditure is deductible under s DA 1(1), it is still necessary to consider whether the expenditure is denied as a deduction under s DA 2(1) as being expenditure of a capital nature. 15. Whether particular feasibility expenditure is capital or revenue in nature must be determined on the facts of any particular case. It is critical to identify the particular nature of the taxpayer’s business. When feasibility expenditure of the type in question forms part of the normal business operations and is not adding to the business structure or undertaken with a view to obtaining an enduring benefit, case law indicates the feasibility expenditure will more likely be treated as being on revenue account and deductible. It is not clear that the Supreme Court in Trustpower would have been as willing to find that preliminary expenditure could be deductible if the expenditure in question related to a one-off capital expansion for example. Consequently, the focus of this statement is feasibility expenditure that is (or will be) recurrent in nature and that is incurred as an ordinary incident of the taxpayer’s business. 16. Where the taxpayer’s ultimate goal is intended to result in the acquisition or development of a capital asset (or other enduring benefit), it is necessary to consider the relationship between the expenditure and the capital asset (or benefit). Where the asset that may ultimately be acquired or developed will be part of the taxpayer’s profit-making structure and not part of the income-earning process, generally, any expenditure will be on capital account. However, some 4 UNCLASSIFIED expenditure on the early stages of feasibility work may be deductible. Based on the Supreme Court decision in Trustpower, the Commissioner’s view is that feasibility expenditure of a type incurred on a recurrent basis as a normal incident of the taxpayer’s business is likely to be deductible in two, related, situations. 17. The first situation where expenditure may be deductible is where it is not directed towards a specific capital project (or the acquisition of a potential capital asset (or other enduring benefit) as applicable). This will usually, but not always, be where initial feasibility work is being undertaken before a specific capital project or projects (or capital asset or assets or enduring benefit or benefits) is identified. It is a question of fact and degree when expenditure will be sufficiently connected to a capital project, asset or other enduring benefit. However, in the Commissioner’s view, the project, asset or benefit need only be identified in general terms; the exact details do not need to be known. However, where expenditure is referable to a specific capital project, asset or benefit, it is still possible that the expenditure may be revenue in nature. 18. The second situation where expenditure may be deductible is where, even though a specific project (or asset or benefit) has been identified, the expenditure is so preliminary as not to be directed towards materially advancing that specific project (or capital asset or enduring benefit). This can be contrasted with expenditure that is aimed at making tangible progress on a capital project (asset or benefit). 19. Whether or not the expenditure ultimately results in a capital asset or enduring benefit is irrelevant to the question of deductibility (ie, deductibility does not turn on the success or failure of the project). When the creation of an asset fails to eventuate, the expenditure incurred cannot be re-characterised as revenue in nature – the expenditure must be considered at the time it is incurred. Introduction 20. This statement updates and replaces the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement: “IS 08/02: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 6 (July 2008): 12. In particular, the statement has been amended to reflect the Supreme Court decision in Trustpower. 21. The statement is in two parts. The first part considers the application of s DA 1(1) (the general permission) to feasibility expenditure. The second part considers the application of s DA 2(1) (the capital limitation). Analysis What is feasibility expenditure? 22. Feasibility expenditure is neither a defined term for the purposes of the Act nor a term of art. However, it is generally used to describe expenditure incurred by a taxpayer for determining the practicability of a new proposal. A typical feasibility exercise would involve determining whether a particular course of action should be taken or certain capital assets acquired or developed. Depending on the circumstances, feasibility expenditure may include the cost of carrying out surveys or studies (eg, engineering surveys, environmental studies and geological and geophysical studies), conducting comparative industry and market research, engaging professionals (eg, lawyers, consultants and financial analysts), producing samples or prototypes, and travel costs. These costs may be incurred “externally” if a third party is contracted to provide the services to the taxpayer or “in house” if 5 UNCLASSIFIED the taxpayer’s employees are paid to undertake the work. Feasibility expenses may arise at the outset of a new business venture or in the course of an existing business. In the latter case, they may be closely related to existing operations or may relate to proposals to expand the existing business or commence a new business. 23. There are no specific income tax provisions relating to feasibility expenditure – the general deductibility provisions must be applied. Section DA 1(1) is the general deductibility provision in the Act and, relevantly, provides that a deduction is allowed to the extent to which any expenditure or loss is incurred in deriving assessable income or incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. For feasibility expenditure to be deductible, therefore, it must first fall within one of these two bases of deductibility. In addition, simply satisfying s DA 1(1) may not be sufficient to ensure deductibility. A deduction may still be prohibited under a specific provision of the Act; for example, under s DA 2(1), which prohibits a deduction for expenditure of a capital nature. Deductibility under s DA 1(1) General principles 24. The two leading New Zealand cases relevant to the interpretation of the general deductibility provision are the Court of Appeal decisions in CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA) and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA). The following general principles can be taken from the cases:  Expenditure will be deductible only when it has the necessary relationship both with the taxpayer concerned and with the gaining or producing of the taxpayer’s assessable income or with the carrying on of a business for that purpose (Banks at 61,240; Buckley & Young at 61,274).  A statutory nexus must exist between the particular expenditure and the assessable income of the taxpayer claiming the deduction (Banks at 61,240).  The heart of the inquiry is the identification of the relationship between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expenditure and the income- earning process. That in turn requires determining the payment’s true character. It then becomes a matter of degree, and so a question of fact, to determine whether a sufficient relationship exists between the expenditure and what it provided or sought to provide on the one hand, and the income- earning process on the other, for the expenditure to fall within the words of the section (Banks at 61,242; Buckley & Young at 61,274).  Whether the expenditure is incurred in gaining or producing assessable income has to be judged as at the time the taxpayer became definitively committed to the expenditure for which the deduction is sought (Banks at 61,241).  The phrase “to the extent that” expressly contemplates apportionment (Banks at 61,240; Buckley & Young at 61,274).  The amount of expenditure is not material. It is not a question of what a reasonable and prudent taxpayer would have expended. It is what the taxpayer has in fact paid (Buckley & Young at 61,282). Application to feasibility expenditure 25. The primary test for deductibility of expenditure under either paragraph of s DA 1(1) is that a sufficient nexus must exist between the expenditure and the 6 UNCLASSIFIED taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. Feasibility expenditure is often incurred at the early stages of a new venture. This means the deductibility of such expenditure is often inextricably linked to the issue of whether and/or when a taxpayer has commenced business or commenced a new business or, in other than business cases, established an income-earning process. 26. Expenditure incurred before the establishment of a business or an income-earning process will not fulfil the statutory nexus required in terms of s DA 1(1) and will not be deductible. This is because the expenditure will have been incurred too soon. If a taxpayer has incurred feasibility expenditure before a business has commenced or a new business to which the feasibility expenditure relates has commenced or an income-earning process is established, a deduction will be denied. “In business” 27. The leading New Zealand case on what constitutes being in business is Grieve. The Court of Appeal found that determining whether a taxpayer is in business involves a two-fold inquiry as to the nature of the activities carried on and the intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. Richardson J (at 61,691) identified several factors relevant to determining whether a taxpayer is carrying on a business, namely the:  nature of the activity;  period over which the taxpayer engages in that activity;  scale of operations and the volume of transactions;  commitment of time, money and effort;  pattern of the activity; and  financial results. 28. Richardson J went on to note that it may also be helpful to consider whether the operations involved are of the same kind and are carried on in the same way, as those that are characteristic of ordinary trade in the line of business in which the venture is conducted. However, in the end, it is the character and circumstances of the particular venture that are crucial. Commencement of business or income-earning activity 29. Although relevant to the issue of preliminary expenditure, the focus in Grieve was essentially on whether a business was being carried on, rather than on the issue of when it could be said that a business had commenced. The latter issue has been more specifically considered in other New Zealand and overseas cases, generally seen as commencing with the English case Birmingham & District Cattle By- Products Co Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioner (1919) 12 TC 92 (KB). 30. In Birmingham, Rowlatt J concluded that the taxpayer had not commenced business until the date it started to receive raw material and produce finished products. Until then, all its actions were merely preparatory to the commencement of business; it was in the process of “getting ready”. 31. Birmingham was cited by Barker J in the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision Duff v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,131 (CA), at 61,144, as being authority for the proposition that a business does not commence until the plant is ready and the owner is ready to commence dealings in the articles from which the owner is to derive profit; preparatory activities do not constitute the running of a business. 7 UNCLASSIFIED 32. Birmingham was also confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Calkin v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,781 (CA), where Richardson J noted the difficulty in distinguishing between transactions that are preparatory to the commencement of business and those that occur once the business has begun and concluded (at 61,786): Clearly it is not sufficient that the taxpayer has made a commitment to engage in business: he must first establish a profitmaking structure and begin ordinary current business operations. 33. Calkin was applied in the High Court decision Stevens & Stevens v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,001. In Stevens & Stevens, Gallen J also noted that it is not always easy to establish when a business commences and stated (at 6,006): Preliminary investigations will clearly not be enough, nor will the expenditure of capital requirements in order to enable the business to be carried on, see Birmingham and District Cattle By-Products Company Limited v Commrs of IR. The business must involve trading. 34. Gallen J considered the Canadian case Minister of National Revenue v MP Drilling Ltd \[1976\] CTC 58 (FCA) (discussed from paragraph 88) where it was held that a business had commenced when the permanent structure, the market and the products all existed and the efforts of the respondent were directed to bringing them together with a resultant profit to it. 35. Deciding when a taxpayer ceases incurring expenditure that is preliminary or preparatory to the commencement of a business or an income-earning activity, and commences incurring expenditure made during the course or conduct of a business or an income-earning activity is often difficult to determine. Preliminary investigations are not enough and neither is expenditure on capital requirements to enable the business or activity to be carried on. The income-earning process must have begun and the expenditure must be incurred as part of that process (ie, as part of the ordinary business or income-earning activities). Cases: New Zealand 36. Very little New Zealand case law considers whether a business has commenced in the context of a claim for the deduction of feasibility expenditure. However, a few decisions are relevant to some extent in this context. These cases consider the issue of the deductibility of pre-commencement expenditure. The general principles exhibited in these cases are equally applicable in the context of feasibility expenditure. 37. In Case L74 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,431 the taxpayers were in partnership as property developers. They bought, renovated and sold properties. They decided to investigate buying land in the Cook Islands, building a motel and operating it. They travelled there and found that their proposed venture was not possible. When they sought to deduct the costs of travel, the Commissioner disallowed the claim on the basis that it was expenditure preparatory to the commencement of a new business. 38. Judge Barber agreed. The Taxation Review Authority (TRA) concluded the expenditure was both preparatory to the commencement of a new business as moteliers and related to the capital structure of such a new business. 39. MP Drilling (noted in Stevens & Stevens and discussed from paragraph 88) was also briefly considered in Case M68 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,384. That decision concerned a taxpayer incorporated in 1985 as an exporter, a marketing agent and an agricultural consultant. From 1985 to 1988, the taxpayer’s managing director and principal shareholder was heavily involved in establishing a business for exporting certain agricultural products and services to developing countries. The taxpayer 8 UNCLASSIFIED declared no income for the years ending 31 March 1986 to 31 March 1988 and sought deductions for expenditure incurred during that period. The largest components of the expenditure were travel costs and the manager’s salary. 40. Judge Bathgate held that for the years ending 31 March 1986 and 31 March 1987 the taxpayer had not commenced business. In the TRA’s opinion, the activities undertaken in that period were exploratory, preliminary to the undertaking of an income-earning process, and were to establish connections and build goodwill. This was the establishment of the company’s business structure, before the commencement of business. The TRA stated (at 2,391): Feasibility study, costs of inquiry, research and investigation, market testing and introduction expenses at the start, to build or establish a goodwill and until establishment and the undertaking of an income earning process, are generally in the nature of establishment expenses, designed to create and secure a lasting advantage, more remote from income earning, and are usually not deductible under either limb of s 104. They are capital in nature or character. 41. However, Judge Bathgate considered that the taxpayer’s business had commenced in and from the 1988 income year. In that year, the taxpayer had established an overseas office and, notwithstanding that trading had not commenced and no profit had been generated, Judge Bathgate was satisfied that the income-earning process had commenced. He stated (at 2,394): There was then in my opinion a close and discernible nexus between the expenditure and the income earning process, which by then had started, albeit only just started, so that the expenditure was then of revenue rather than of capital. The preliminary and preparatory work of the objector had largely ceased, an income earnings structure was then in existence, its goodwill was established and growing, and the business was carried on as had been initially intended, but had been delayed until the preliminaries had been completed and a decision made as to how and where the business would operate from. The advantages sought by the expenditure were those looked for in the nature of a trading operation, in the way of gaining or producing assessable income, rather than advantages of a preliminary and preparatory nature, of the once and for all type in establishing a structure, of the preceding years. Current business operations had begun. 42. Although this decision may at first glance seem inconsistent with cases such as Stevens & Stevens and MP Drilling, in reaching his decision, Judge Bathgate noted (at 2,395) that he had not overlooked the cases referred to by counsel for the taxpayer, including MP Drilling. In the TRA’s opinion, the distinction between those cases and the taxpayer’s case was one of fact and degree. The TRA also emphasised (at 2,394) that a business may have commenced before a taxpayer was actually trading or earning assessable income. 43. In Case S39 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,264 two friends incorporated the taxpayer company with the objective of developing a major media company. The majority shareholder was the company’s managing director. He looked for media production opportunities for the company. Although he worked on many proposals with a view to making a profit, some of which were developed into projects, none had come to fruition during the period in question. The taxpayer company claimed various items of expenditure, the major item being management fees paid to the managing director’s company for services provided by the managing director to the taxpayer. The Commissioner argued that the taxpayer’s activities were preliminary and investigatory, so any expenditure was not deductible because business had not commenced and the expenditure was capital in nature. 44. Judge Barber found for the taxpayer and concluded that the type of work undertaken by the managing director for the taxpayer was not work that was preliminary to and investigatory of commencing business, but work that was preliminary to and investigatory of business projects. This was part of the business 9 UNCLASSIFIED of media and entertainment production. Even though the work may have been entrepreneurial, speculative and prone not to result in completion or profit, it was work of the normal media and entertainment production type. The taxpayer was established to investigate and carry out or sell profitable production opportunities in the media area. The work was part of the taxpayer’s business or income-earning process. 45. Counsel for the Commissioner argued that a project must get past development proposals and feasibility studies and achieve something. Judge Barber acknowledged that it is unusual for a business not to achieve income-earning transactions. However, Judge Barber stated (at 7,272): It seems to me that development proposals and feasibility studies are very much part of a media production project and were part of the income earning process of the objector even though a project needs to progress much further for fees or profit to be obtained. I do not accept Mr Willox’s submission that because there were no income earning transactions, a business had never been commenced by the objector. 46. Therefore, Case S39 supports the deductibility of feasibility expenditure in limited circumstances. In that case the TRA concluded that the investigatory work undertaken by the majority shareholder on behalf of the objector was part of the normal business operations of the objector as a media production company. The feasibility expenditure was held to relate to the business of the company (ie, the investigations were part of the company’s income-earning process, not the profit- making structure) and were calculated to result in income to the taxpayer. 47. However, the important distinction between Case S39 and the other cases discussed above is that in Case S39 the feasibility studies and investigatory work were part of the company’s ordinary business operations. The business of a media production company required that the company investigate production opportunities. In other words, the feasibility expenditure incurred was incurred as part of the business activity of identifying profitable projects. This can be contrasted with feasibility expenditure incurred to determine whether to go into business, which is incurred before the commencement of business and lacks sufficient nexus to satisfy the deductibility provision. The situations where feasibility expenditure will be an ordinary incident of the business or income- earning process, such as was the case in Case S39, are limited. The deductibility or otherwise of any such expenditure must be determined on the application of the statutory language to the facts in any particular case. 48. Although there are few New Zealand cases in the area of pre-commencement expenditure, those that do exist illustrate the application of the general principles discussed earlier in this statement. No special rules apply to feasibility expenditure. The cases emphasise that the deductibility of feasibility expenditure will depend on the particular facts of the case. A sufficient nexus must exist between the expenditure and the business or income-earning activity. When the expenditure is incurred before any decision is made to enter into the business or income-earning activity, the expenditure will have been incurred too soon and will be non- deductible (Case M68). When a business already exists, feasibility expenditure incurred in relation to a new business will still need to satisfy these tests (Case L74). When feasibility expenditure is incurred as part of the ordinary income- earning process of a business, it may satisfy the requirements of s DA 1(1)(b) for deductibility (Case S39). 49. The position was summarised by the Supreme Court in Trustpower in the context of that case as follows: Section DA 1 denies deductibility to feasibility expenditure for a new, or an entirely separate, business venture which is not underway at the time the expenditure is 10 UNCLASSIFIED incurred. If activities are undertaken to decide whether or not to enter a business (as against, as in this case, in the course of a taxpayer’s existing business), the expenditure will lack the required nexus to a business and s DA 1 will not be satisfied. In determining whether a business has commenced, the commitment (or otherwise) of the taxpayer to that business – or, as \[the 2008 statement\] puts it, whether “a decision has been made to enter into that business or activity” – is highly material. 50. As the New Zealand case law in this area is somewhat limited, it is useful to also consider case law from other jurisdictions. Cases: Australia 51. A leading Australian case in the context of feasibility expenditure is Softwood Pulp and Paper Co Ltd v FCT 76 ATC 4,438 (SC Victoria). In that case, the taxpayer company was incorporated in 1961 to establish a new paper production industry in South Australia. This would involve building a new mill complex to process particular kinds of paper and other products. The company was owned by Australian promoters and a Canadian company that had experience in the same paper industry. The company incurred significant expenditure in relation to the proposed mill development. However, in February 1962, the Canadian company withdrew. No other promoter could be found, so the project was abandoned. The taxpayer sought a deduction for its expenditure. These expenses included overseas and local travel costs, legal and accounting expenses, the acquisition and testing of raw materials, and professional fees for the carrying out of feasibility studies by expert consultants. 52. The Supreme Court of Victoria rejected the taxpayer’s claim. Menhennitt J considered the case, first, from the perspective of whether the taxpayer company was carrying on a business and, secondly, assuming it was carrying on a business, whether the expenditure was of a capital or revenue nature. On the first point, he concluded that everything the company had done was merely preparatory to the commencement of business. The key factor for the Court was that at no stage had the company definitely decided to proceed with the mill. Menhennitt J, referring to Birmingham in support of his conclusion, stated (at 4,451): The critical point is that the company had not reached a stage remotely near the carrying on of a business. Even assuming that at some stage prior to the mill turning, the company could be said to be carrying on a business, in this case the company had not even approached the stage of making a decision about carrying on a business. All that had happened had been that certain investigations had been made to decide whether or not the business was feasible, and whether or not it was economically viable on a competitive basis, but nothing had been done which could be said to be carrying on a business or anything associated with or incidental to the actual carrying on of a business. Everything which was done was concerned with making a decision whether or not steps should be taken to set up a business, but no decision on even that matter had been reached. \[Emphasis added\] 53. The Australian full Federal Court decision in FCT v Ampol Exploration Ltd 86 ATC 4,859 (FCA) is usually cited in support of the deductibility of feasibility expenditure. In that case, the taxpayer carried on business as an oil exploration company, the “exploration arm” of the Ampol group of companies. In 1979, the taxpayer entered into several agreements with the Chinese Government to participate in geographical (seismic) surveys of offshore China to discover possible oil and gas fields. Participation involved no more than the possibility of the Chinese Government granting the right to bid to undertake further seismic and exploration work. 11 UNCLASSIFIED 54. An existing company within the group was used as a joint venture vehicle by the taxpayer and another company in the group. The taxpayer assigned its interest under the agreements with the Chinese Government to the joint venture company. The consideration for the assignment was to be a sum agreed on or the taxpayer’s costs in connection with the surveys plus a percentage. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for its survey expenditure and the costs of consultants who interpreted the data obtained. The Commissioner disallowed the claim and the taxpayer appealed. A majority (two to one) of the full Federal Court found for the taxpayer. 55. Lockhart J first considered whether the expenditure came within s 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth), the equivalent of s DA 1(1). His Honour stated that for expenditure to fall within the first limb, the outgoings must be connected with the operations that gain or produce the assessable income. In relation to the second limb, a nexus must exist between the expenditure and the carrying on of the relevant business. 56. Lockhart J noted that despite the uniqueness of the situation, namely that the companies engaged in the activities had no interest from which an income- producing asset could arise, the taxpayer’s role in the Chinese venture was perceived by those who controlled its affairs as a commercially sound method of carrying on its exploration business and as part of its ordinary business activities. They were seeking a profit opportunity. In addition, the circumstances that brought the deed of assignment into existence and the provisions of the deed were also held to be relevant matters for the purpose of characterising the true nature of the expenditure for the purposes of the second limb. 57. Lockhart J found, on the basis of the facts in that case, that the expenditure was necessarily incurred in the carrying on of the taxpayer’s business. He stated (at 4,870): The characterisation of the expenditure, and therefore of the outgoing which it represents, is to be discerned from the business activities of the taxpayer generally and its role as the prospecting arm of the Ampol group in the Chinese project in particular. The understanding between the boards of Ampol and the taxpayer, ... , that a benefit, in the form at least of some payment to the taxpayer in the nature of reward or profit, would accrue to it, requires that the question of deductibility should be approached in a practical fashion. The whole of the relevant expenditure was incurred in the course of carrying on of the taxpayer’s business of petroleum exploration. \[Emphasis added\] 58. Lockhart J was also satisfied that the total expenditure was deductible under the first limb of s 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). The trial judge had drawn a distinction between outgoings incurred before the execution of the deed of assignment and those incurred after, on the basis that it was not until the deed was executed that the payment to be made to the taxpayer was determined. Lockhart J disagreed, stating (at 4,870): In my opinion the expenditure incurred before the deed was both incidental and relevant to gaining or producing the taxpayer’s assessable income in the form of a fee, using that word in the broad sense of a payment or remuneration for the taxpayer’s role in the exploration enterprise off the Chinese coast. The deduction is not denied because the particular form of payment was not finally determined in a legally binding form until 3 April 1980. It was at all relevant times the intent of Ampol and the taxpayer that a just reward of a business character would be paid to the taxpayer. Only the particular method to be selected to achieve this objective remained to be determined. Viewed from a practical and business point of view the deed of assignment was the method finally selected to express the object of both Ampol and the taxpayer; first, to enable Ampol to derive a fair share of any benefits which might be produced in the future from the oil production enterprise, if one emerged at all, and, second, to ensure recoupment of the taxpayer’s costs if the oil fields were found to be 12 UNCLASSIFIED commercially feasible together with a payment geared to a percentage of those costs, and the major share in the benefits of any such enterprise. The total expenditure was thus connected with the gaining of the payment from Ampolex Queensland. \[Emphasis added\] 59. Lockhart J’s decision emphasises that a sufficient nexus must exist between the feasibility expenditure and the relevant business or income-earning activity, and that this will be a question of fact in any particular case. In Ampol the activities were unique in that they provided only a right to bid for participation in the next stage of seismic surveys and exploration. There was no interest from which an income-producing asset could arise. The clear implication from the judgment is that the expenditure might well have been held to be non-deductible, except that in the particular facts of the case the activities were carried out by the taxpayer for the gaining of assessable income (in this case in the form of a fee to be paid to the taxpayer under the deed of assignment). 60. Although concluding that the expenditure was deductible in this particular case, Lockhart J did sound a cautionary note with regard to other fact situations (at 4,870): It provides no warrant for a more general proposition that outgoings of companies engaged in petroleum exploration are necessarily deductible under the second limb of subsec. 51(1) if the expenditure is related to that activity. This is a question of fact in each case. Exploration or prospecting activities (e.g. geological, geophysical or geochemical surveys and appraisal digging) are the kind of activities in which a prospecting company engages if petroleum is to be found. It is, as the title of the activity suggests, of an exploratory nature. Petroleum may or may not be found; but unless expenses of this kind are incurred it will not be found. Once a proven field has been established other expenses, for example, development drilling or activities in the course of working or establishing a petroleum field will be incurred and they savour more of a capital nature since the work is done to bring into being a proven capital asset which will be the source of income-producing activity. 61. At first glance, this statement seems somewhat contradictory, as one would expect that expenditure incurred in relation to petroleum exploration by a company engaged in that activity would be deductible. However, Lockhart J’s caution is explicable on general principles. 62. It is considered that Lockhart J was merely emphasising that simply because expenses are incurred in relation to an activity does not mean those expenses are necessarily deductible. It is a question of fact in each case. In terms of general principles, it must still be established that a sufficient nexus exists between the expenditure and a business or an income-earning activity. When a company is carrying on prospecting activities as a business, then exploration expenses will generally be deductible when they are necessarily incurred in the course of that business. However, it is equally possible that a company could be engaging in prospecting activities that do not constitute an income-earning activity or a business, in which case no relevant nexus exists and the expenditure will not be deductible. This was the case in Esso Australia Resources Ltd v FCT 98 ATC 4,768 (discussed from paragraph 74). 63. Another decision of the Federal Court that emphasises the need for a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity is Griffin Coal Mining Co Ltd v FCT 90 ATC 4,870 (FCA). In that case, the majority of the Court held that no nexus existed between smelter feasibility expenditure and the taxpayer’s existing business of coal mining and sale. 64. The taxpayer carried on the business of coal mining and supplied coal to the State Energy Commission of Western Australia (SECWA). During 1981 to 1983 the 13 UNCLASSIFIED taxpayer was involved in various disputes with SECWA, and the taxpayer decided to diversify its mining activities to lessen its financial dependence on SECWA. The taxpayer expressed interest in becoming involved in the construction of an aluminium smelter to which it would be prepared to supply coal at little or no profit, or even at a loss, provided it was given an equity interest in the project. However, in May 1984 it was decided that SECWA would supply the smelter’s electricity. As a consequence, it was no longer clear that the taxpayer would necessarily supply coal to the new smelter. Nevertheless, the taxpayer continued its involvement in the smelter project. 65. In August 1984, the taxpayer and two other companies formed a consortium and conducted a feasibility study to determine the construction and operating costs and to assess the environmental consequences of building an aluminium smelter. The taxpayer also undertook its own feasibility study of the project. In addition, the taxpayer engaged various consultants to advise on matters such as industrial relations, finance, environmental issues and the negotiation of a joint venture agreement. Ultimately, the development did not proceed because the two other consortium participants withdrew in June 1985. 66. The Commissioner disallowed the taxpayer a deduction for the smelter feasibility study costs. 67. The majority held that the smelter feasibility costs were not deductible under s 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). They were incurred by the taxpayer as part of the cost of forming a new source of income. They were not merely of a preliminary nature made under the umbrella of the conduct of the existing business. At least from May 1984, there was no longer any link between the decision to be involved in the smelter venture and the supply of coal by the taxpayer. Participation in the project was seen as a worthwhile activity in its own right and a new separate activity of the company. The feasibility studies were not simply assessments of whether a project could be undertaken; they flowed into the selection of a site, settlement of environmental questions, and negotiation of contracts and firm commitments. The taxpayer had moved well beyond an incident occurring in the course of the business of coal extraction and sale. 68. The majority held that the smelter feasibility expenditure was not incurred as an ordinary incident of Griffin Coal’s business. No nexus existed between Griffin Coal’s existing business and the smelter feasibility expenditure. The latter was incurred in creating a new business structure, so was not deductible under either limb of s 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). 69. Other cases in this area highlight that identifying the nature or type of business or activity under consideration is fundamental to establishing when that business or activity commenced. In addition, they also confirm that a positive decision must be made to enter into that business, as was emphasised in Softwood (discussed from paragraph 51). 70. In Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd v FCT 91 ATC 4,438 (FCA), the taxpayer was a company that carried on business in several divisions. In August 1981, the taxpayer contracted with the Queensland Institute of Technology to fund the establishment of a research and development centre for the production of monoclonal antibodies and related products suitable for commercial development. In return for funding the centre, the institute undertook to produce a range of highly specific monoclonal antibodies for commercial exploitation by the taxpayer. The centre was set up and research on a full-time basis commenced in early 1982. In November 1982, the taxpayer leased separate premises for its monoclonal antibodies division (Mabco) to set up development and production facilities. Sales 14 UNCLASSIFIED of the first monoclonal products took place in December 1982. The taxpayer claimed deductions for its contributions to the centre and expenditure incurred by Mabco on manufacturing, administration, and research and development for the 1981/82 to 1984/85 income years. 71. Hill J, applying Softwood, rejected the taxpayer’s deductions for expenditure incurred up to November 1982. His Honour stated that critical to the resolution of the case was the characterisation of the business activity that was said to have commenced. The taxpayer claimed that the business carried on by it was to be characterised as one of researching and developing monoclonal antibody products for manufacture and sale. However, the taxpayer conceded that if the business were characterised as one of manufacturing and selling monoclonal antibody products, then that business did not commence until around November 1982. Referring to Softwood, Hill J noted that critical to that decision was the finding that the taxpayer had not yet committed itself to the project or made a final definitive decision to do so. In relation to the case before him, his Honour concluded that the element of commitment was absent; the taxpayer was engaging in activities of a provisional kind only. The activity was that of funding a research project and could not be characterised as a business or even as an activity of gaining or producing assessable income. 72. With regard to the expenditure incurred after November 1982, the taxpayer claimed that its business included not only the manufacture and marketing of its heart worm product, but also research into, and the development of, other products. The Commissioner claimed that the expenditure was of a capital nature. This aspect of the decision is discussed from paragraph 164. 73. FCT v Brand 95 ATC 4,633 (FCA) concerned whether the voluntary prepayment of seven years’ licence fees for a prawn farming project was an allowable deduction. The case turned on whether the prepayment was incurred in gaining or producing assessable income or whether it was incurred “too soon”. The Court concluded that the prepayment was an allowable deduction. Tamberlin J made several relevant comments in relation to the element of commitment to the income-producing or business activity. His Honour referred to several decisions that placed an emphasis on the element of commitment, including Goodman Fielder Wattie. His Honour then stated (at 4,649): The purpose of research expenditure or payment for a feasibility study is firstly to investigate whether a proposed or possible line of business activity is viable and secondly to decide whether to make a commitment to the activity. The third stage is the entry into such a commitment. It does not follow from a favourable research or feasibility study, for example, that any commitment or outgoing will be made with a view to producing assessable income. In that sense such studies may be discrete from the relevant business activity and may be “too soon” before the business activity commences to justify classification as an activity expected to produce assessable income. This stands in marked contrast to the present case. 74. The full Federal Court also considered these issues in Esso. The taxpayer in that case carried on the business of exploring for, producing and selling oil and gas. Since the 1960s, the taxpayer had explored for oil and gas offshore. From the early 1970s, the taxpayer, under the direction of its ultimate parent company, also explored for coal, synfuels (primarily oil shale) and certain other minerals. On occasion, the taxpayer undertook exploration and production activities as a joint venturer. 75. From 1979 to 1984, the taxpayer claimed a deduction under s 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) for expenditure in investigating the acquisition of interests in potential joint ventures for exploration. The costs incurred were general costs that were preliminary to any decision to acquire a particular 15 UNCLASSIFIED tenement, or interest therein, from which mining production could take place. The Commissioner denied the deductions, and the taxpayer appealed to the Federal Court. Sundberg J held that the expenditure was not deductible. His Honour decided that the taxpayer, although it carried on exploration activities in the relevant years, was not in the business of exploring for coal and oil shale because it had not engaged in exploration for reward (not having conducted the exploration for the purpose of selling or earning fees from its exploration information) nor was it committed to commercial production. 76. It was central to the taxpayer’s contentions, before the trial judge and on appeal, that its business included exploration for coal, synfuels and minerals. The taxpayer claimed that the nature, extent and scope of its activities and the quantum and recurrence of expenditure involved in them, including the acquisition of interests in potential mining prospects and ventures, were such that the taxpayer clearly satisfied the test of “carrying on a business”. The taxpayer contended that the fact it had not at the relevant time earned assessable income from its new mining activities, commenced mining production in respect of any particular project or committed itself to commence mining production in respect of any particular location did not mean it was not carrying on a mining business. 77. The Commissioner submitted that the evidence showed that the taxpayer had committed itself to no more than a strategy of assessing the feasibility of potential mining ventures as a possible source of income from mining or production of those mineral resources. The taxpayer had not made the transition from merely considering whether to conduct a mining business to actually conducting such a business. 78. The full Federal Court stated that the primary question was whether the expenditure was necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Only if this question were answered in the affirmative was it necessary to consider whether the expenditure was of a capital nature. 79. When considering whether expenditure was preparatory to an activity that might at some time in the future constitute the carrying on of a new or expanded business, the Court stated (at 4,780) that “establishing the proper characterisation of the particular business said to have been carried on is critical to resolving whether there is a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business”. 80. The Court accepted that it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the taxpayer was not in the business of exploration, as it “did not engage in exploration for reward” (at 4,780). Having accepted this, the Court stated that the critical issue was then whether Sundberg J erred in his approach to the requirement of the element of commitment as a criterion for deductibility under the second limb of s 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). It was on the basis of that approach that Sundberg J concluded that the appellant had not made the transition from assessing and seeking opportunities to actually carrying on a mining business. 81. The Court approved Sundberg J’s approach and stated that the element of commitment was an important criterion for determining deductibility as it established the requisite nexus between expenditure claimed to be deductible and the business said to be carried on. In the Court’s opinion, the criterion affords a practical and principled basis for ascertaining whether the nexus between the expenditure and the derivation of assessable income is too remote or too tenuous. 82. The full Federal Court accepted that the trial judge had not erred in concluding that the taxpayer had not committed itself to commercial production with the 16 UNCLASSIFIED consequence that the element of commitment to the relevant income-producing activity in respect of which the expenditure was claimed to have been incurred was missing. Summary: Australian cases 83. The Australian cases in this area are consistent with the limited New Zealand cases discussed above. In this regard, the Australian decisions deal with a wider variety of factual situations and provide a more detailed analysis. The usefulness of examining Australian cases in relation to a claim for a deduction under s DA 1(1) has been established in this country for many years. See, for example, Banks and Buckley & Young. The Australian decisions are concerned with the interpretation of similar wording, and nothing in the New Zealand or Australian decisions indicates that a different approach should be adopted in New Zealand. 84. In the area of feasibility expenditure, the Australian cases also indicate that the question of deductibility under the equivalent of s DA 1(1) depends on the facts of any particular case. There are no special rules in relation to feasibility expenditure, and the principles applicable in relation to the general deductibility provision must be applied. 85. A sufficient nexus must exist between the expenditure and the business or income- earning activity for the expenditure to be deductible. Therefore, the business or income-earning activity must have commenced. When the expenditure relates to a new activity for an existing business, business operations must be found to have commenced in relation to that new activity (Griffin). The cases emphasise that there must have been a commitment made to proceed with a particular activity in order for it to be said that the income-earning activity or business has commenced (Softwood and Goodman Fielder Wattie). It is critical to establish the true character of the business or income-earning activity in order to determine whether that business or income-earning activity has commenced (Ampol, Goodman Fielder Wattie and Esso). 86. When no commitment has been made to any business or income-earning activity, feasibility expenditure will not be deductible, because the business has not commenced, so there is an insufficient nexus between the expenditure and any relevant business or income-earning activity. 87. When the business or income-earning activity has commenced, there must still be a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and that business or income-earning activity in order for the expenditure to be deductible. Therefore, any feasibility expenditure must arise as an ordinary incident of the business or income-earning activity. In other words, the feasibility activities must be carried out as part of the ordinary current operations of the particular business or income-earning activity. Cases: Canada 88. The Canadian case Minister of National Revenue v MP Drilling Ltd, referred to in Stevens & Stevens and Case M68, concerned a taxpayer company incorporated in September 1963 to carry on the business of marketing liquefied petroleum gases in the Pacific Rim. The facts showed that the successful marketing of these products involved arranging the supply with the producing oil companies, creating extraction plants, gathering gas and transporting it to seaboard by pipeline, obtaining permits for export, constructing storage facilities and negotiating firm contracts with overseas buyers. In 1966, it was decided that the plan to market gas was not feasible, and the taxpayer company moved into operational drilling. The expenses incurred from 1963 to 1966 were largely for expert analysis and feasibility studies 17 UNCLASSIFIED plus travel costs in visiting potential overseas buyers. The Minister of National Revenue argued that these expenses were not deductible because they were payments on capital account for the purpose of creating or acquiring a business structure and preparatory to a business. 89. The Federal Court of Appeal rejected the Minister of National Revenue’s arguments. It considered that the business structure per se came into existence in late September 1963, when the company commenced its business operations by continuing the marketing negotiations, supply negotiations and technical studies through its consultants, until June 1964, when it opened its own office and employed its own staff, including a full-time general manager. The permanent structure, the market and the products all existed, and the efforts of the company were directed to bringing them together with a resultant profit to it. 90. However, it is important to note that in reaching this conclusion the Court considered it “not without significance” (at 62) that the Minister of National Revenue had not attempted to distinguish different types of expense. Although some of the expenditure was clearly incurred in the course of the income-earning process (eg, expenses incurred during the supply and sale contract negotiations), other expenses would not so readily fit within that category. As no particular expenses were drawn to the Court’s attention, however, the Court concluded that all the expenditure was revenue in nature. 91. The Canadian approach to the question of when a business or an income-earning activity has commenced is similar to that taken in New Zealand and Australia. Indeed, MP Drilling has been cited in several New Zealand decisions. Summary 92. For feasibility expenditure to be deductible under either paragraph of s DA 1(1), a sufficient relationship or nexus must exist between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. In relation to para (a) this requires that the expenditure be incurred in deriving assessable income. In relation to para (b), the expenditure must be incurred in the course of carrying on the particular business. The expenditure must be incurred as part of the ordinary business operations (Banks and Buckley & Young). Any expenditure incurred before the establishment of a business or an income-earning activity will not fulfil this statutory nexus, because the expenditure will have been incurred too soon (Birmingham and Calkin). Therefore, feasibility expenditure incurred preliminary to or preparatory to the establishment of a business or an income-earning activity will not be deductible. 93. The decision as to whether a business or an income-earning activity is being carried on is always one of fact and degree. Its resolution depends on a consideration of the nature of the activities carried on and the intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. A determination of the point at which a taxpayer makes a firm commitment to go into a business or an income-earning activity is critical for establishing the earliest time at which a business may have commenced. Commitment alone, however, is not sufficient. Therefore, there are three elements to the determination that a business has commenced:  A taxpayer’s activities must be sufficiently intense to have the characteristics of the activities of that kind of business.  The necessary profit-making structure must have been established.  The taxpayer must have passed the stage of merely “sounding out” whether to go into the business and have made a definite decision to do so. 18 UNCLASSIFIED 94. The correct characterisation of the nature of the relevant business is, therefore, vital to resolving whether a sufficient nexus exists between the expenditure and a taxpayer’s business. Without a determination of the true nature of a business, it is impossible to determine whether the activities are characteristic of that kind of business, and that, therefore, the expenditure was incurred as part of the ordinary business operations (Goodman Fielder Wattie, Ampol, Esso and Case M68). 95. The profit-making structure must also be in place for a business to have commenced. However, the extent of the profit-making structure required depends on the nature of the particular business. On the one hand, cases such as Birmingham and Softwood indicate that when the business involves manufacturing or production from a particular site, everything done before the establishment of the necessary plant is preparatory to business. On the other hand, cases such as MP Drilling and Stevens & Stevens, which dealt with the marketing of a product, indicate that when the business structure and the product exist it is enough to be negotiating supply contracts, arranging orders and so on. Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 337 comments on this distinction (at 359): The business structure or entity or organisation may assume any of an almost infinite variety of shapes and it may be difficult to comprehend under one description all the forms in which it may be manifested. In a trade or pursuit where little or no plant is required, it may be represented by no more than the intangible elements constituting what is commonly called goodwill, that is, widespread or general reputation, habitual patronage by clients or customers and an organised method of serving their needs. At the other extreme it may consist of a great aggregate of buildings, machinery and plant all assembled and systematised as the material means by which an organised body of men produce and distribute commodities or perform services. 96. Also critical is the element of commitment. The cases indicate that in determining whether an activity constitutes the carrying on of a business or an income-earning activity or whether it is preliminary to the carrying on or recommencement of a business or an income-earning activity, it is the element of commitment that establishes the requisite nexus between the expenditure claimed to be deductible and the business or income-earning activity said to be carried on for the purpose of gaining or producing income. If expenditure relates to activities undertaken to decide whether to enter into a particular business or income-earning activity, that expenditure will lack the required nexus, so will be non-deductible (Softwood, Goodman Fielder Wattie, Brand and Esso). 97. When feasibility expenditure is incurred after a business or an income-earning activity has commenced, for that expenditure to be deductible it must have the requisite nexus with the business or income-earning activity (ie be incurred as an ordinary incident of the business or income-earning activity). This requires, therefore, that the particular activities must be undertaken as part of the income- earning process (ie be carried out with the intention of obtaining some reward from sale or exploitation) (Ampol, Esso and Case S39). 98. In summary, therefore, the following matters are relevant when determining whether feasibility expenditure is deductible under s DA 1(1):  A sufficient nexus must exist between the feasibility expenditure and the business or income-earning activity.  If the feasibility expenditure is incurred as preliminary or preparatory expenditure before the commencement of a business or an income-earning activity, there will not be a sufficient nexus and that expenditure will not be deductible.  The decision as to whether a business or an income-earning activity has commenced is one of fact and degree. Four factors are relevant: 19 UNCLASSIFIED o It is critical to determine the true nature of the business. o A commitment must have been made to enter into that business. o The required profit-making structure for the particular business must be in place. o The ordinary current operations of the business must have begun.  If the business or income-earning activity has commenced then, to be deductible, the feasibility expenditure must have the requisite nexus with the business or income-earning activity. This means the feasibility expenditure must be incurred as part of the ordinary current operations of that business or income-earning activity (ie, the feasibility-related activities must be carried out with the intention of obtaining income from those activities). Example 1 99. Several individuals who are employed by the marketing division of a nationwide retail company are considering establishing their own retail marketing consultancy business. To determine the feasibility of the business, they have purchased market industry information. They have also incurred travel and entertainment costs by travelling around the country and meeting potential clients to ascertain the level of interest in the provision of consultancy advice. The individuals have also investigated the possibility of leasing office space and have incurred legal fees in that regard. Legal fees have also been incurred in seeking advice on the implications of the employees leaving their present employer. 100. The costs incurred to date are not deductible. The individuals have committed themselves to no more than a strategy of assessing the feasibility of a potential marketing consultancy business as a possible source of income. The individuals have not proceeded to commit themselves to any particular venture. The costs are preliminary and preparatory to the establishment of an income-producing structure. A decision to proceed with the business has not been made, the profit-making structure is not in place and normal business operations have not commenced. Example 2 101. The directors of an established logging and saw-milling company are considering whether the company should start producing gardening tools, which it could supply, initially to its existing clients, but in time to a wider group. The board is unsure about the financial viability of such a course, so engages consultants to provide financial projections and information about the likely demand for such products. Several of the directors also travel around the country meeting clients to discuss the proposed venture. 102. The consultants’ report indicates insufficient regular demand for the gardening tools to warrant the company producing such products in the short term. Given this, the board abandons the idea. 103. The consultants’ fees and the directors’ travel costs are not deductible. These costs are preliminary and preparatory to the establishment of a new income-earning activity. They do not relate to the existing logging and saw-milling business and are not part of the current operations of that business. The fact that the company resolved not to proceed with the production of the gardening tools does not affect the character of the expenditure. 20 UNCLASSIFIED Example 3 104. Two friends who are working for a large engineering company are considering setting up an engineering business of their own. They incur expenditure in the first six months of 2016 investigating possible ways to operate a business, including obtaining advice from an accountant and a solicitor and sounding out potential clients. In July 2016, they agree they will establish the business and, having secured several clients and set up an office, they resign from their current positions. They begin to actively work on establishing their processes and databases, and in September 2016 they commence work for their first clients. 105. The expenditure incurred before July 2016 is not deductible. It was preliminary and preparatory to the establishment of an income-producing activity. A firm decision to proceed with the business had not been made, the profit-making structure was not in place and normal business operations had not commenced. 106. The expenditure incurred from July 2016 is deductible, subject to the capital limitation (which is discussed from paragraph 107). The decision to commit to the business has been made, the profit-making structure is in place and current operations have begun. Therefore, the business has commenced. This is the case regardless of the fact that work for a particular client does not commence until September 2016. Prohibition of deduction under s DA 2(1) 107. If, on the facts and circumstances of any particular case, it is determined that feasibility expenditure is deductible under either s DA 1(1)(a) or s DA 1(1)(b), it is then necessary to determine whether the deduction is prohibited by s DA 2(1) as being expenditure of a capital nature. General principles 108. In Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 337, Dixon J described the distinction between expenditure on capital account and expenditure on revenue account as corresponding (at 359): with the distinction between the business entity, structure, or organisation set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss. 109. Dixon J identified three matters to be considered (at 363): (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which the advantage is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure further use or enjoyment. 110. In Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634, Dixon J again summarised the distinction between expenditure on capital account and expenditure on revenue account (at 647): The contrast between the two forms of expenditure corresponds to the distinction between the acquisition of the means of production and the use of them; between establishing or extending a business organisation and carrying on the business; between the implements employed in work and the regular performance of the work in which they are employed; between an enterprise itself and the sustained effort of those engaged in it. 21 UNCLASSIFIED 111. His Honour indicated that determining whether expenditure was capital or revenue (at 648): depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process. 112. Similarly, in Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines \[1964\] AC 948 (PC), Viscount Radcliffe stated (at 960): Again courts have stressed the importance of observing a demarcation between the cost of creating, acquiring or enlarging the permanent (which does not mean perpetual) structure of which the income is to be the produce or fruit and the cost of earning that income itself or performing the income earning operations. Probably this is as illuminating a line of distinction as the law by itself is likely to achieve ... 113. The principles from these cases were adopted by the Privy Council in BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1965\] 3 All ER 209 (PC). The BP Australia formulation was also adopted in New Zealand in cases such as CIR v LD Nathan & Co Ltd \[1972\] NZLR 209 (CA), Buckley & Young, CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233 (CA), Christchurch Press Co Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206 (HC), CIR v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991 (PC), Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001 (CA), and Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981 (CA). In Wattie, the Privy Council noted that the approach adopted in Hallstroms has been recognised as exemplifying the “governing approach” in New Zealand. 114. The courts have formulated various indicia for helping to determine whether expenditure is capital or revenue. These factors can be useful where the classification of expenditure as capital or revenue is not clear. The following factors are relevant in this regard:  The need or occasion that calls for the expenditure.  Whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature.  Whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset.  Whether the expenditure creates an advantage that is of enduring benefit to the business.  Whether the expenditure is on the profit-making structure or on the profit- making process.  Whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital.  The treatment of the expenditure according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting. 115. Many of these factors overlap and some will carry more weight in given circumstances. Therefore, while they are helpful as a starting point, it is necessary to make a final judgement of whether the expenditure is of a capital or revenue nature by analysing the facts as a whole, weighing which factors carry the most weight in light of those facts. 116. It is also important to note that while the courts have formulated these factors to help in determining the capital or revenue question, all the cases referred to above have recognised that, although past cases can be useful in assisting with the resolution of a new case, there are dangers involved in this approach. When the distinction between capital and revenue expenditure is not clear-cut, the factors should be weighed in the context of the whole set of circumstances in that particular case. 22 UNCLASSIFIED Application to feasibility expenditure Cases: New Zealand 117. The leading case on the deductibility of feasibility expenditure in New Zealand is the Supreme Court decision Trustpower. Trustpower is an electricity retailer. It generates about half the electricity it sells and buys the rest from other generators. In the years in question, Trustpower maintained a “development pipeline” of over 200 possible new generation projects, most of which would not be carried through to completion. During the 2006, 2007 and 2008 tax years, Trustpower incurred expenditure applying for and obtaining resource consents in relation to four proposed electricity generation projects. The Commissioner allowed deductions for some preliminary expenditure incurred in investigating the feasibility of the projects. However, the Commissioner denied a deduction for expenditure incurred in obtaining the resource consents. The issue was whether this expenditure on the resource consents was on revenue or capital account. The expenditure was described as feasibility expenditure on the basis that it was incurred to assist Trustpower to determine whether to complete the four generation projects. 118. Trustpower argued that expenditure on a capital project is on revenue account until the taxpayer commits to the completion of the project (the commitment approach). Trustpower also argued that the 2008 statement supported this argument. 119. In the High Court (Trustpower Ltd v CIR \[2013\] NZHC 2,970) the dispute centred on whether the resource consents were stand-alone assets. Justice Andrews concluded that they were not; rather the consents were “part and parcel” of the projects they related to. Her Honour, therefore, concluded that the expenditure on the consents should be treated the same as other expenditure on the generation projects (which the Commissioner had accepted was deductible). Justice Andrews went on to conclude that, even if the resource consents were stand-alone assets, they would be revenue assets and the expenditure incurred in obtaining them would be deductible. This was based on a weighing up of the factors from BP Australia. 120. The Court of Appeal (CIR v Trustpower Ltd \[2015\] NZCA 253) overturned the High Court decision and found that the expenditure was on capital account. The Court took the view that it was irrelevant whether the resource consents were stand- alone assets. The Court also found that it was irrelevant that Trustpower had not committed to proceeding with the four projects. The expenditure was incurred for the purpose of enabling Trustpower to extend or expand its electricity generation business. The Court found that there was a sufficient connection between the expenditure and capital. This was the case even though the final decision to apply for the resource consents had not been made and that decision was contingent on the outcome of the preliminary work. Although not in dispute, the Court of Appeal appeared to take the view that none of the expenditure on projects in the development pipeline would have been deductible as it all related to possible future capital projects (at \[88\]). 121. Following the Court of Appeal decision Professor John Prebble QC and Hamish McIntosh published an article 1 discussing the 2008 statement and the decisions of the High Court and Court of Appeal. Prebble and McIntosh took the view that any expenditure incurred to test the feasibility of acquiring or constructing possible capital assets is not deductible. They, therefore, agreed with the Court of Appeal that none of Trustpower’s expenditure on projects in the development pipeline was 1 Prebble and McIntosh “Deducting Expenditure to Assess the Feasibility of Constructing Capital Assets: Opinions from Inland Revenue, the High Court and the Court of Appeal” 6 VUWLRP 24/2016. 23 UNCLASSIFIED deductible. As will be seen below, the Supreme Court referred to the article in its judgment. 122. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal decision that the expenditure was on capital account. The Court rejected the commitment approach argued by Trustpower (noting that this approach was not necessarily consistent with the 2008 statement as Trustpower had argued). Instead the Supreme Court found that most expenditure addressed to a capital project will be on capital account: \[13\] On this basis, the salient features of the case are as follows: ... (e) We do not accept that the capital/revenue issue is controlled by the commitment approach. ... (f) On a purist view of the capital/revenue distinction, any expenditure (feasibility in nature or otherwise) addressed to a capital project (as the generating projects in this case are) is necessarily on capital account. On this approach – which has been espoused by Professor John Prebble QC and Hamish McIntosh – the feasibility expenditure in issue was necessarily not deductible. (g) The approach which we adopt is broadly similar to that proposed by Professor Prebble and Mr McIntosh but, for reasons which we explain, allows for some flexibility, for instance, in respect of initial stages of feasibility work. (h) As is apparent, we consider that some feasibility expenditure referable to proposed capital projects might sometimes be deducted. We do not, however, see such deductibility as extending to external costs incurred in respects which do, or were intended to, materially advance the capital project in question. \[Emphasis added and footnotes omitted.\] 123. The Supreme Court, therefore, stated that the general rule is that expenditure referable to a proposed capital project will be capital. In this regard, the Court broadly agreed with the approach taken by Prebble and McIntosh. However, the Court also differed from the Prebble and McIntosh approach – choosing to adopt a somewhat wider, more flexible, approach to deductibility. In this regard, the Court went on to acknowledge that some feasibility expenditure referable to proposed capital projects might be deductible. However, it considered that this would not extend to costs that are intended to (or do) materially advance the capital projects in question. The Court declined to construct a test for determining when feasibility expenditure will cease to be deductible (at \[47\]). It also accepted that, in marginal cases, the application of the capital/revenue distinction many involve indeterminate questions (at \[69\]); this was seen as being implicit in the underlying rule. However, the Court did give some, limited, guidance as to when feasibility expenditure would be deductible (at \[47\]): However, for reasons which we will explain, we consider that preliminary expenditure on feasibility studies may sometimes be deductible. At \[63\]: To the extent that the judgments of Noel ACJ and Davies J proceed on the basis that expenditure on a capital project is on capital account only if an asset is created, we disagree. On the other hand, we can envisage situations in which a judgment call may have to be made in relation to feasibility assessments which are so preliminary in nature that they cannot sensibly be seen as “directed to the acquisition of an asset of an enduring character”, to use the language of Davies J. \[Emphasis added\] And at \[71\] and \[72\]: The expenditure on obtaining resource consents in this case was directly related to specific projects that would be on capital account if they came to fruition. The projects could not proceed without resource consents. Obtaining the consents thus represented tangible 24 UNCLASSIFIED progress towards their completion. The expenditure is thus on capital account and not deductible. We are not required to determine the status of the expenditure which preceded the decisions to apply for resource consent. It may be that the Commissioner could have denied deductibility in relation to at least some of that expenditure. We are, however, also of the view that expenditure associated with early stage feasibility assessments may be deductible. Such assessments can be seen as a normal incident of business. Treating the associated costs as deductible is consistent with the passages of the judgments of Noel ACJ and Davies J which we have set out. It is also consistent with the use of the expression “to the extent” in the capital limitation \[in s DA 2\], which, as noted, suggests that questions of degree may be involved. Expenditure which is not directed towards a specific project or which is so preliminary as not to be directed towards the advancement of such a project is likely to be seen as being on revenue account. \[Emphasis added and footnotes omitted\] 124. In summary, the Supreme Court made it clear that expenditure that relates to a possible capital asset is non-deductible, regardless of whether a capital asset ultimately results and regardless of whether the taxpayer had committed to completing the project. This is consistent with the English cases ECC Quarries Ltd v Watkis (Inspector of Taxes) \[1977\] 1 WLR 1386; \[1975\] 3 All ER 843 (Ch) and Sargent (Inspector of Taxes) v Eayrs \[1973\] 1 WLR 236; \[1973\] 1 All ER 277 (Ch) cited by the Supreme Court). Nor did it matter that Trustpower did not own all of the land required to complete the projects. 125. However, the Court found that early stage feasibility expenditure may, nevertheless, sometimes be deductible. This was variously described in different parts of the judgment:  Expenditure in relation to feasibility assessments “which are so preliminary in nature that they cannot sensibly be seen as directed to the acquisition of an asset of an enduring character” may be deductible (at \[63\]);  Expenditure associated with early stage feasibility assessments can be seen as a normal incident of business and may be deductible (at \[72\]);  Expenditure that “is not directed towards a specific project” is likely to be deductible (at \[72\]); and  Expenditure “which is so preliminary as not to be directed towards the advancement” of a specific project is likely to be deductible (at \[72\]). The Court also referred to what it saw as capital expenditure:  Expenditure which does, or was intended to, “materially advance” a capital project is not deductible (at \[13(h)\]); and  Expenditure on something that represents (or is intended to represent) “tangible progress towards” completion of a capital project will not be deductible (at \[71\]). 126. This raises an issue as to the distinction between expenditure that is preliminary and does not advance a specific project (which is likely to be deductible) and expenditure that materially advances (or results in tangible progress on) a specific project (which will not be deductible). On one level, any expenditure on a project is likely to be expended with the intention of “advancing” the project – otherwise, there would seem to be little point incurring the expenditure. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, “advancement” can only sensibly be read as referring to material advancement (in the sense that it is “not immaterial”). 127. It is not entirely clear whether the Supreme Court was intending “advancement of a specific project” and “tangible progress towards completion” of a capital project to 25 UNCLASSIFIED be different ways of expressing the same concept. However, in the Commissioner’s view the two phrases are generally synonymous in this context. Where there is “material advancement” of a project there will most likely also have been “tangible progress” on the project and vice versa. However, if a situation arises where the two do not overlap, it is not necessary to find both tangible progress and material advancement. An amount will be capital as long as the expenditure was intended to achieve either material advancement or tangible progress. 128. The Supreme Court also found that, in some circumstances, expenditure associated with early stage feasibility assessments could be seen as a normal incident of business (at \[72\]). The Court was considering this in the context of Trustpower’s fact situation. The nature of Trustpower’s business was such that it was regularly exploring new generation possibilities. In this regard, incurring feasibility expenditure was a normal incident of its business. It is not clear that the Supreme Court would have been as willing to find that preliminary expenditure could be deductible if the expenditure in question related to a one-off capital expansion for example. Consequently, the focus of this statement is feasibility expenditure that is (or will be) incurred on a recurrent basis by a taxpayer as an ordinary incident of its business. It is possible that feasibility expenditure that is not incurred on a recurrent basis could be deductible in some circumstances. However, this statement does not consider these situations. 129. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, expenditure is likely to be deductible in accordance with the Supreme Court decision if it is of a type incurred on a recurrent basis as a normal incident of the taxpayer’s business and it satisfies one of the following:  the expenditure is not directed towards a specific capital project; or  if the expenditure is directed towards a specific capital project, the expenditure is so preliminary as not to be directed towards materially advancing a specific capital project – or, put another way, the expenditure is not directed towards making tangible progress on a specific capital project. 130. It is noted that the Supreme Court often referred to feasibility expenditure in relation to a capital “project” rather than an enduring “asset” or other enduring benefit (which is the more common terminology in capital/revenue cases). This is likely due to the facts of the case, which related to electricity generation projects that involved a number of potential capital assets. The relevant definition of “project” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary 12 th ed (Oxford University Press, 2011) is “an enterprise carefully planned to achieve a particular aim”. A “capital project” in the sense used by the Supreme Court seems to be an enterprise carefully planned to achieve a particular aim that includes (or is intended to include) one or more capital assets or other enduring benefits. Despite its reference to “projects” rather than “assets”, in the Commissioner’s view, the Supreme Court was not suggesting that different capital/revenue tests apply. The fact that the Supreme Court cited and quoted (with seeming approval) case law such as Griffin Coal Mining which referred to “acquisition of an asset of an enduring character” supports this. Consequently, in the Commissioner’s view the same capital/revenue tests apply whether the taxpayer is acquiring or developing a single capital asset (or other enduring benefit) or undertaking a wider capital project that involves multiple capital assets (and/or other enduring benefits). 131. In the context of feasibility expenditure, the capital items being sought will most often be of a tangible nature – for example land, buildings and infrastructure assets. However, they could also be assets or enduring benefits that are intangible in nature – for example, depending on the context, agency contracts, supply contracts and resource consents. 26 UNCLASSIFIED 132. Whether feasibility expenditure is deductible will depend on the particular facts and must, like all capital/revenue decisions, be considered on a case by case basis. Consistent with the Supreme Court’s comments, this will often involve a judgement being made on the specific facts of a taxpayer’s case. Ultimately, the question comes down to whether the expenditure is directed to the acquisition of a capital asset or other enduring benefit. 133. It is noted that at \[13(h)\] the Supreme Court referred to “external costs” in a way which could be taken to suggest that the deductibility of external and internal costs may differ: As is apparent, we consider that some feasibility expenditure referable to proposed capital projects might sometimes be deducted. We do not, however, see such deductibility as extending to external costs incurred in respects which do, or were intended to, materially advance the capital project in question. \[Emphasis added\] 134. It is not clear why the Supreme Court referred specifically to external costs. It may be because the costs at issue in the case were largely external costs. It may also have been because the Court thought that external costs were more likely to be incurred on expenditure that would materially advance a capital project. In some circumstances this may be the case. However, in the Commissioner’s view the deductibility or otherwise of particular expenditure will be the same regardless of whether the costs are incurred internally or externally (see Christchurch Press). For example, the costs of carrying out an environmental study will be treated the same (for deductibility purposes) whether the study was carried out by an employee or commissioned from a third party. 135. The Supreme Court in Trustpower referred to the High Court decision in Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,017 (HC). In that case, the taxpayer company, Milburn NZ Ltd (Milburn) made and sold cement, concrete and lime and quarried aggregates for its concrete business. Fraser Shingle Ltd (Fraser) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Milburn. Milburn implemented its business plan by investigating, acquiring and developing concrete businesses. Securing supplies of aggregate for its concrete plants was recognised as being important. During an expansion period, Milburn investigated 48 different sites for aggregate. The sites were generally existing quarries. At issue was Milburn’s expenditure on two sites and Fraser’s expenditure on an aggregate prospect. All the expenditure on the three sites was for obtaining the consents or licences necessary to develop the three sites into quarries for aggregate and lime for the taxpayers’ cement and concrete businesses. Milburn capitalised all expenses once the necessary consents were obtained. 136. The taxpayer companies claimed the expenditure was of a revenue nature or, alternatively, if it was capital it was part of the “cost of minerals” and deductible under s 74(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. The Commissioner considered that the expenditure by Milburn at one site (Bombay Hills) was capital in nature because it was substantial and was expenditure on establishing an asset that was a significant and important addition to Milburn’s operating structure. Another site (Alpha Creek) involved the direct replacement of an existing strategic asset. Fraser’s expenditure was similar in that it was incurred in investigating a resource alternative to an important existing one that was likely to be circumscribed in the future. 137. Wild J held that the expenditure was of a capital nature, regarding it as part of the cost of creating the permanent structure that produced the taxpayers’ taxable income, rather than as part of the cost of earning that income. The expenditure to obtain the consents and licences was a necessary part of developing the three sites 27 UNCLASSIFIED into quarries for the production of aggregate and lime for use in the taxpayers’ cement and concrete businesses. His Honour concluded that the consents and licences were enduring rather than transient in nature and were not recurrent in nature. 138. Wild J based his view on the following factors (at 17,023): \[a\] The nature of the business of Milburn and Fraser. \[b\] The importance of Bombay and Alpha Creek to Milburn’s business, and the Ngaruroro gravels to Fraser’s business. \[c\] The amount of the expenditure. \[d\] Its sustained nature i.e. the length of time over which the expenditure was incurred. \[e\] The nature of the expenditure: all on obtaining of consent necessary before production could begin. \[f\] \[c\]-\[e\] when contrasted with the amount, duration and nature of expenditure on Milburn’s 48 other prospects. 139. Wild J then reached the following conclusion (at 17,023): These six factors, certainly in combination, indicate to me that the taxpayers, having investigated or evaluated the three sites, had made business decisions to expend money in developing the sites for commercial production. The first step, or one of the first steps, to that end was to apply for the necessary consents. \[Emphasis added\] 140. The comparison drawn by the High Court provides support for the argument that in the capital or revenue context in relation to an existing business, a distinction may be drawn between amounts expended on initial investigations to determine possible prospects and amounts expended once a decision to proceed with one or more particular prospects has been made. Once a decision has been made to expend money acquiring or developing a particular capital asset, it seems that expenditure is considered to be incurred on the business structure rather than the income- earning process. It is also noteworthy that Wild J compared the three sites in question with the other 48 prospects that were investigated. Although Wild J did not specifically find that expenditure on the other 48 sites was deductible (the issue not being in dispute) the fact his Honour drew the comparison tends to suggest that he thought the expenditure on the 48 sites was not directed to the development of capital assets. 141. Wild J firmly rejected the taxpayers’ argument that the classification of the expenditure depended on whether the various consents applied for were obtained or refused. Milburn’s chief executive officer had earlier given evidence for the taxpayers detailing the need for an acceptable resource consent before the taxpayers would be confident of recovering an economic resource. 142. Wild J rejected the taxpayers’ argument (at 17,023): I am unable to accept the taxpayers’ viewpoint, as advanced in evidence by Mr Williams, because it rather seeks to classify the expenditure dependant \[sic\] on the outcome of the various applications for consent. There is no logical nexus, and categorisation dependant \[sic\] upon outcome has been firmly rejected in New Zealand, Australia and England. 143. Since the outcome of the consent applications did not affect the categorisation of the expenditure, the obtaining of resource consents for only two of the three sites was not relevant. Wild J held that the expenditure on all three sites was capital in nature. The resource consent refusal for one site meant Fraser’s project in that area did not continue. However, the abandonment of the project did not affect the 28 UNCLASSIFIED capital nature of the expenditure incurred from the time the taxpayer had made a decision to expend money developing the site. 144. Wild J also discussed the character of the advantage sought, in which lasting qualities, recurrence, and the need or occasion that calls for the expenditure were also considered. His Honour held (at 17,025) “the expenditure was substantially to obtain the consents and licences necessary to develop the three sites into quarries for aggregate and lime for the taxpayers’ cement and concrete businesses”. Wild J rejected the taxpayers’ argument (at 17,025): The other perspective, which I do not think is the correct one, is that the expenditure was nevertheless of a revenue nature, in an effort to find out whether an economic resource existed. 145. In relation to whether the payments were once and for all and intended to create an enduring asset, Wild J again rejected the taxpayers’ argument that expenditure on seeking consents and licences was incurred in an effort to find out whether an economic resource existed. Wild J stated (at 17,026): The third test is whether the payments were once and for all and intended to create an enduring asset. From their perspective, the taxpayers argued that expenditure on seeking consents and licences needed to be incurred from time to time, and possibly more than once in relation to a particular site. For example, Alpha Creek was an instance where successive mining licence applications had been made. They argued that the expenditure was all part of their trying to ascertain whether there was an economic resource capable of development. I hold firmly against that argument. I consider the correct view is that the resource consent obtained for Bombay did not need to be reapplied for, the water rights obtained did not need to be reapplied for in the short to medium term, and nor did the mining licence for Alpha Creek. Whether viewed as an integral part of the quarries to which they related (the view I prefer), or as assets in their own right, the consents and licences were enduring rather than transient in nature. \[Emphasis added\] 146. In rejecting the taxpayers’ argument, Wild J focused on the enduring nature of the consents and licences for which the taxpayers incurred expenditure. In contrast, the taxpayers’ contention was more broadly focused on the expenditure enabling them to determine, through the granting (or not) of a resource consent on appropriate terms, whether an economic resource capable of development existed. 147. It would seem that Wild J’s rejection of the taxpayers’ argument, that the expenditure was incurred to ascertain the existence of an economic resource, was also based on his earlier findings. Wild J listed six factors (set out in paragraph 138 above) that indicated to him that the taxpayers “had made business decisions to expend money in developing the sites for commercial production” (at 17,023). The first step, or one of the first steps, towards developing the sites was to apply for the necessary consents. Since the decision to spend money on development had been made before applying for the consents, expenditure incurred from that point was capital in nature, and it was irrelevant to that characterisation whether the consents were ultimately granted in a manner that enabled the resources to be developed economically. 148. In Case N55 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,434 the taxpayer was the holding company of a group of manufacturing companies. The manufacturing activities were handled by the subsidiaries. The taxpayer supplied the subsidiaries with accounting, management and clerical services for which it charged management fees. During the relevant income years, the taxpayer undertook the development of a four- wheel drive vehicle on the basis that had the venture proceeded a subsidiary would manufacture the vehicle. The project was eventually abandoned. The taxpayer sought to deduct the development expenditure. It argued that the expenses were recurrent in nature and not once and for all and were part of its ongoing product 29 UNCLASSIFIED development activities. No enduring benefit was brought into existence. The expenditure was not preliminary before commencement of a business because only product diversification was being sought, not a new business. 149. In relation to the capital–revenue distinction, Judge Barber concluded that the expenditure was capital. The TRA found that the expenditure was of a once and for all nature, incurred with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the business. The expenditure was not an ordinary expenditure in the regular conduct of the business and was related to the business structure, rather than the business process. Acknowledging that product development–type expenditure may be ongoing in some businesses, the TRA found that in this case it was related to the capital base for a new manufacturing process. Of note are Judge Barber’s obiter comments in relation to product development expenditure (at 3,440): In some situations there must be a fine line between deductible production or marketing expenditure and non-deductible capital product development expenditure. For instance, expenditure on altering or upgrading the packaging of an existing product would seem to be a fairly normal expense of manufacturing, distributing, and marketing the product rather than an outlay towards the capital structure for manufacturing, distributing, and marketing the product. I observe that labels such as “product development expenditure” may be misleading and the test is always the character of the particular expenditure. 150. The issue in Case P3 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,017 was whether certain expenditure by a manufacturer of safety helmets qualified for an export market development expenditure tax credit. This came down to whether the expenditure was revenue in nature (not capital). The expenditure essentially comprised the salary cost of the taxpayer’s design engineer who modified existing helmet designs and built samples to secure overseas orders. The Commissioner argued that the deduction available for export development expenditure did not extend to include research and sample raw material costs. In his view, the deduction did not extend to the cost of developing a product that may be of enduring benefit to the taxpayer. 151. Judge Barber referred to his earlier decision in Case N55 and the passages from that decision indicating that in some situations product development expenditure could be revenue in nature. In Case P3 Judge Barber concluded that the expenditure was a reasonable and normal trading or revenue expenditure. The TRA found that altering helmets was an ordinary incident of the taxpayer’s business. It was an ongoing, recurrent business activity for the taxpayer. This situation could be contrasted with the development of a one-off prototype undertaken by the taxpayer in Case N55. 152. The New Zealand authorities in this area indicate that to be expenditure of a revenue nature, the feasibility expenditure must be incurred as part of the ordinary current operations of the business. In much the same way as the enquiry under s DA 1(1), the expenditure must be incurred as an ordinary incident of the income- earning process in order to avoid the capital prohibition in s DA 2(1). This will involve a careful consideration of the nature of the taxpayer’s business. In some cases, expenditure will be deductible because it is part of the taxpayer’s ordinary business operations and, in the context of the taxpayer’s business, does not give rise to a capital asset or enduring benefit (as Judge Barber found was the case in Case P3). 153. However, where the taxpayer’s goal is intended to result in the acquisition or development of a capital asset (as was the case in Trustpower and Milburn), generally, any expenditure referable to that asset will be on capital account. Despite this, in Trustpower it was acknowledged that some expenditure on the initial stages of feasibility work may be deductible. In the Commissioner’s view 30 UNCLASSIFIED expenditure incurred as a recurrent part of the normal operations of the taxpayer’s business is likely to be deductible in the following circumstances:  The expenditure is not directed towards a specific capital project (or the acquisition of a potential capital asset (or other enduring benefit) as applicable).  Even where it is directed towards a specific capital project (or the acquisition of a potential capital asset (or other enduring benefit)) the expenditure is so preliminary as not to be directed to materially advancing the project (or acquisition). This can be contrasted with expenditure that is aimed at making tangible progress on a capital project. 154. Whether or not the expenditure ultimately results in a capital asset is irrelevant to the question of deductibility. That is, deductibility does not turn on the success or failure of the project. Cases: Australia 155. The Supreme Court in Trustpower cited and quoted from the minority judgment in Griffin Coal Mining (Davies J being the only judge who considered whether the taxpayer’s expenditure was capital or revenue). The facts of the case are set out above in paragraphs 63–65). 156. Davies J, in dissent, concluded that the general permission was satisfied and, more relevantly, that the capital limitation did not apply (at 4,877): In my opinion, the expenditure at this early stage was relevant and incidental to Griffin’s existing business and was not of a capital nature. It is clear that no capital was contributed to the venture. The time for the contribution of capital to the venture had not arrived. The expenditure was not directed to the acquisition of an asset of an enduring character. In relation to the aluminium project, no asset was acquired. The expenditure was not on items such as roads and drainage works necessary in the event of the opening up of the new mines, or on the taking away of the overburden, or on the construction of buildings and the acquisition of plant and equipment. The subject expenditure was expenditure by a coal mining company made out of current revenue directed to ascertaining whether the development of an enhanced market for the coal was feasible, as well as attaining the intangible ends I have mentioned. \[Emphasis added\] 157. The Supreme Court did not express a view as to whether Davies J was correct in his conclusion that the expenditure in question was not on capital account. However, it did cite the above quotation in support of its conclusion that there are situations where feasibility assessments are so preliminary in nature that they cannot sensibly be seen as “directed to the acquisition of an asset of an enduring character” (Trustpower, at \[63\] and \[72\]). 158. In Softwood Pulp and Paper (see paragraphs 51 and 52), Menhennitt J, having reached the view that the expenditure under consideration was preliminary to the commencement of business, so was non-deductible on that basis, went on to conclude that even if he were wrong in that regard, the expenditure was of a capital nature. His Honour cited with approval the comments of Dixon J in Sun Newspapers (set out in paragraphs 108 and 109). 159. His Honour concluded that the expenditure went beyond simply investigating the possibility of undertaking a new business activity and extended into the establishing of the profit-making structure, that is, options acquired over land and arrangements made for the supply of water, electricity, timber and so on. In these circumstances, even if the expenditure had satisfied either of the first two limbs of 31 UNCLASSIFIED s 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth), the expenditure would have been held to be capital. 160. The facts in Softwood can be contrasted with those in FCT v Ampol Exploration Ltd 86 ATC 4,859 (FCA). In Ampol, the expenditure was held to relate to the company’s ordinary business activities. The expenditure could not lead to the establishment of an asset and was not incurred for the purpose of creating or enlarging the business structure. 161. In Ampol, Lockhart J, in the majority, concluded that the expenditure was deductible under both limbs of the equivalent of s DA 1(1) before going on to consider the “more difficult question” of whether the expenditure was of a capital nature. Lockhart J concluded that the payments in question were of a revenue nature, being part of the outgoings of the taxpayer in the course of carrying on its ordinary business activities. It was not expenditure incurred for the purpose of creating or enlarging a business structure or profit-yielding or income-producing asset. 162. Burchett J agreed with Lockhart J that the expenditure was of a revenue nature. His Honour concluded that the relevant business of the taxpayer was the discovery and exploitation of oil, to which the seismic survey expenses were incidental. Their purpose was not to enlarge the framework within which that activity was carried on, rather they formed part of the activity. 163. The important factor in the majority’s decision in Ampol is that the exploration activities, for which the expenditure was incurred, were part of the company’s ordinary current operations. They were not adding to the business structure or undertaken with a view to obtaining an enduring asset. The activities were part of the company’s income-earning process (ie the process by which the company earned its rewards). On this basis, therefore, the expenditure was of a revenue nature. 164. The decision in Goodman Fielder Wattie highlights that determining the true nature of the relevant business, identified in the discussion on deductibility of expenditure under s DA 1(1), is also critical in the capital or revenue context. 165. In Goodman Fielder Wattie, Hill J concluded that the expenditure incurred before November 1982 was incurred before the commencement of the business (discussed in paragraphs 69 and 71). With regard to the expenditure incurred after November 1982, the taxpayer claimed that it was carrying on a business that included not only the manufacture and marketing of its heartworm product, but also research into and the development of other products. The Commissioner claimed that the expenditure was of a capital nature. 166. Hill J considered the decisions in Sun Newspapers, Ampol and Hallstroms and stated (at 4,449–4,450): The judgment in the Sun Newspapers case makes it clear that it is necessary to consider carefully the nature of the business which is carried on, so as to be able to distinguish between recurrent expenditure, that is to say “expenditure which is made to meet a continuous demand” (per Rowlatt J in Ounsworth v Vickers Ltd \[1915\] 3 KB 267 at 273) and that expenditure which is made once and for all. A pharmaceutical company, the business of which includes continuing research and development as part of the continuous or constant demand for expenditure in its business, does not each time that expenditure is incurred make an outlay of capital or of a capital nature. Its business, when properly analysed, includes its research and development, at least in the ordinary case. No doubt, there are matters of degree involved, and in a particular case the research and development may be concentrated on a product so far removed from the day to day products of the 32 UNCLASSIFIED taxpayer, that the expenditure cannot be properly seen as part of its working expenditure. Counsel for the applicant relied heavily upon the decision of the Full Court of this court in FC of T v Ampol Exploration Ltd 86 ATC 4859; (1986) 13 FCR 545. In that case, it was held that the taxpayer, the exploration arm of the Ampol Group, was carrying on a business of exploring for petroleum and the expenditure it incurred in its China venture was held to have been necessarily incurred in the carrying on of that business and as not being of a capital nature. ... By analogy it was said that where a company such as the applicant here is engaged in an activity where research and development forms part of its activity, part of the constant demand upon the enterprise, then expenditure on research and development is on revenue account. Research and development expenditure does differ somewhat from the exploration expenditure involved in the Ampol case. In general terms, one difference that is of significance is that the expenditure in Ampol was not expenditure directed towards the obtaining of rights of an enduring kind. On the peculiar facts of that case, the expenditure was directed merely at obtaining the right to negotiate, that not being a right of a proprietary kind. Research and development may, in a particular case, be directed towards obtaining patentable rights which can be seen as of an enduring kind and may, for that reason, be of a capital nature. It was not suggested here by counsel for the Commissioner that the applicant’s expenditure was directed towards the obtaining of patent rights nor was this even put to any witness. 167. His Honour noted that the cases make it clear that whether property rights are ultimately obtained is not determinative. Acknowledging Dixon J’s statements in Hallstroms as to what is required, his Honour concluded (at 4,450): There is, in my opinion, much to be said for the view that the whole of the expenditure in issue in the present case, except perhaps so much of it as concerned the salary of Dr Watson, in the time he was involved in the patent dispute, was expenditure on revenue account rather than on capital account. A company engaged in an enterprise involving new technology such as the applicant, where the nature of its activity requires as part of its business ongoing research into product development incurs expenditure which is recurrent, expenditure which is part of the regular cost of its trading operations. That expenditure is, to adopt the words of Dixon J in Sun Newspapers, part of the process by which the organisation (being an organisation where research is part of its business activity) operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlays. 168. Therefore, as in Ampol, in Goodman Fielder Wattie the expenditure was held to be recurrent expenditure that was incurred as part of the company’s ordinary business activities. The expenditure was not directed towards obtaining any rights of an enduring kind. 169. The decisions in Australia in relation to the application of the equivalent to s DA 2(1) emphasise the need to identify the nature of the particular business or income-earning activity and to identify whether the expenditure is incurred as part of the income-earning process of that business or activity or to create or expand the business structure. The decisions in Ampol and Goodman Fielder Wattie highlight that when the expenditure relates to the income-earning process (ie, it is incurred as an ordinary incident of the business), the expenditure is more likely to be of a revenue nature. However, when the expenditure relates to the obtaining of an advantage of an enduring benefit (eg, a capital asset or another accretion to the business or profit-making structure), the expenditure will generally be of a capital nature. Cases: Canada 170. As the Supreme Court in Trustpower noted, there is Canadian authority that suggests expenditure on a capital project that does not result in a capital asset is deductible (see, for example, Bowater Power Co Ltd v Minister of National Revenue 33 UNCLASSIFIED \[1971\] FC 421, \[1971\] CTC 818 (FC), Gartry v R 94 DTC 1947 (TCC) and Wacky Wheatley’s TV & Stereo Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1987\] 2 CTC 2,311 (TCC)). The Supreme Court rejected this proposition (Trustpower at \[51\]). 171. In Bowater t he taxpayer company carried on the business of generating and selling electrical power and energy. During its 1959 and 1960 taxation years, the taxpayer claimed a deduction for expenditure for survey costs and engineering studies relating to developing additional power and the location of physical plant for its power station. It claimed the deduction on the basis that such expenditure was an ordinary operating expense incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from its business. The manager of the taxpayer gave evidence that the company was continually looking into the feasibility of installing thermal power. It was also continually looking at its existing facilities to see how to increase capacity and considering new sources of generation to meet increasing customer demand. 172. The costs claimed related to two specific feasibility studies undertaken for the taxpayer. The first involved a report on the feasibility of building a new power station on a lake adjacent to the company’s existing supplies of water for its current hydro-power stations. The report covered the availability of construction materials at the site, the geography and geology of the area, the hydrology and water flows. The report concluded that it was not economically feasible to undertake the project because of the high cost per horsepower produced. The second report identified how the company could better utilise one of its existing watersheds, particularly as regards its hydro potential. The report concluded that it was economically feasible to proceed with the recommendations and the taxpayer went so far as to arrange finance. However, the project did not proceed. This was because a provincial government project to develop a hydro-powerstation in the area started and the government offered to sell power from that plant to the taxpayer at a cheaper rate than the rate at which the taxpayer could produce power if it improved its own site. 173. The Federal Court found for the taxpayer. Judge Noel referred to BP Australia and Hallstroms and concluded that the matter must be viewed from a practical and business point of view. His Honour considered that having regard to the facts and the circumstances of the work conducted by the taxpayer the expenditures were part of the company’s current operations. His Honour accepted evidence that the business of the taxpayer was developing and marketing electricity and that this required a continuous evaluation and appraisal of both its power resources and its method of operation. Judge Noel concluded that the expenditures were made to effect an increase in the volume and efficiency of the taxpayer’s business, so were for the purpose of gaining income. 174. Judge Noel concluded that the costs of the feasibility studies were on revenue account, so were deductible. He stated (at 837–838): I do not ... feel that merely because the expenditure was made for the purpose of determining whether to bring into existence a capital asset, it should always be considered as a capital expenditure and, therefore, not deductible. In distinguishing between a capital payment and a payment on current account, regard must always be had to the business and commercial realities of the matter. While the hydroelectric development, once it becomes a business or commercial \[reality\] is a capital asset of the business giving rise to it, whatever reasonable means were taken to find out whether it should be created or not may still result from the current operations of the business as part of the every day concern of its officers in conducting the operations of the company in a business-like way. I can, indeed, see no difference in principle between all of these cases. 175. The Supreme Court in Trustpower cited the above quotation with approval. In particular, the Supreme Court found that the quotation supported its conclusion 34 UNCLASSIFIED that early stage feasibility assessments may be deductible as a normal incident of business (at \[61\], \[63\] and \[72\]). Summary 176. Whether particular feasibility expenditure is capital or revenue in nature must be determined on the facts of any particular case. 177. It is critical to identify the particular nature of the taxpayer’s business. When feasibility expenditure of the type in question forms part of the normal business operations and is not adding to the business structure or undertaken with a view to obtaining an enduring benefit, the cases indicate the feasibility expenditure will more likely be treated as being on revenue account and deductible. Ampol and Goodman Fielder Wattie are two cases where the courts found that the nature of the taxpayer’s business meant that the expenditure was on revenue account because the expenditure was not directed to obtaining an enduring benefit. 178. Where the taxpayer’s ultimate goal is intended to result in the acquisition or development of a capital asset (or other enduring benefit), it is necessary to consider the relationship between the expenditure and the capital asset (or benefit). Where the asset that may ultimately be acquired or developed will be part of the taxpayer’s profit-making structure and not part of the income-earning process, generally, any expenditure will be on capital account. However, some expenditure on the early stages of feasibility work may be deductible. Based on the Supreme Court decision in Trustpower, the Commissioner’s view is that feasibility expenditure of a type that is (or will be) incurred on a recurrent basis as a normal incident of the taxpayer’s business is likely to be deductible in two, related, situations. Although the Supreme Court discussed these situations by reference to capital “projects”, in the Commissioner’s view the same capital/revenue tests apply whether the taxpayer is acquiring or developing a single capital asset (or other enduring benefit) or undertaking a wider capital project that involves multiple capital assets (and/or other enduring benefits). 179. The first situation where early stage expenditure may be deductible is where it is not directed towards a specific capital project (or the acquisition of a potential capital asset (or other enduring benefit) as applicable). This will usually, but not always, be where initial feasibility work is being undertaken before a specific capital project or projects (or capital asset or assets or enduring benefit or benefits) is identified. It is a question of fact and degree when expenditure will be sufficiently connected to a capital project, asset or other enduring benefit. However, in the Commissioner’s view, the project, asset or benefit need only be identified in general terms; the exact details do not need to be known. For example, for a taxpayer whose business involves leasing out space in commercial buildings, it would be sufficiently specific to have identified a project that relates to the construction of a new commercial building to be leased out. The fact that it may not have been decided exactly how many floors the building is going to be or even where the building is going to be built, will not mean that the project is not “specific”. However, where expenditure is referable to a capital project, asset or benefit, it is still possible that the expenditure may be revenue. 180. The second situation where expenditure may be deductible is where the expenditure is so preliminary as not to be directed towards materially advancing a specific project (or capital asset or enduring benefit). This can be contrasted with expenditure that is aimed at making tangible progress on a capital project. Expenditure that the Court in Softwood found was too connected to the establishment of a profit-making structure to be deductible included acquiring options over land and making arrangements for the supply of water, electricity and 35 UNCLASSIFIED timber. Similarly, in Trustpower and Milburn, expenditure on resource consents was too connected to the profit-making structure. It will be a matter of fact and degree when expenditure will be seen as materially advancing a capital project. 181. Whether or not the expenditure ultimately results in a capital asset is irrelevant to the question of deductibility (ie, deductibility does not turn on the success or failure of the project). When the creation of an asset fails to eventuate, the expenditure incurred cannot be re-characterised as revenue in nature. As Wild J stated in Milburn (at 17,025), “\[t\]he correct approach is to look at the expenditure at the time it was incurred”. 182. Where expenditure on capital account leads to the acquisition of more than one asset, the expenditure should be spread across the assets acquired. The apportionment of the expenditure should be made on a basis that is appropriate in the circumstances. Example 4 183. A company owns and operates a specialised property business throughout New Zealand. The company investigates potential sites all over the country, identifies property developments considered to be economically feasible and sells this information to potential developers. The investigation of potential sites usually involves an employee visiting the area, requesting information from the local authority about the property, obtaining a valuation and, in some cases, instructing architects to provide preliminary drawings to show how the property might best be developed. When it is perceived that there may be difficulties in obtaining planning consent or meeting resource management requirements in relation to the particular type of development, the company often instructs specialist planning consultants to provide preliminary advice. Information obtained is compiled into a report on the potential site, and this report is offered to interested parties for a fee. 184. The costs incurred to date are deductible. They are incurred as part of the company’s normal and recurrent business operations. The costs incurred are an ordinary incident of carrying on the business of providing feasibility reports on potential property developments for reward. From a practical and business point of view, the expenditure is calculated to create a product (information) that can be sold. In addition, the expenditure is not directed to obtaining an enduring advantage for the company. Example 5 185. A company undertakes continual investigations into potential quarry sites as part of its normal business operations. The initial investigations involve:  an employee travelling around the country to identify possible suitable locations;  contacting land owners at those locations to determine whether they are amenable to selling or leasing their land to the company; and  engaging a geologist to write a preliminary report on the suitability of the site for quarrying. 186. The company considers the information and determines which sites it will spend money on to seek to develop. If a site proceeds to the next step, the company will enter into negotiations with the land owner to purchase or lease the land, commission more detailed technical and environmental impact reports, and apply 36 UNCLASSIFIED for appropriate resource consents to operate the quarry. Following this, a final decision is made to proceed with development of the quarry in question. 187. The point at which the company has a specific project will depend on the circumstances. If, for example, the company is just looking around to see what quarry options many be available and has no particular quarry specifications in mind, the costs of the employee travelling around the country to identify possible locations are likely to have been incurred prior to any specific project being identified. However, if, for example, the company wanted to develop a quarry to certain specifications and the employee was looking for a suitable location, then it is more likely that there is already a specific project in existence. In either case, it is likely that once suitable sites have been identified and discussions with landowners are taking place, this expenditure will be related to a specific project. 188. However, regardless of when it could be said that the expenditure was related to a specific project, the expenditure of the company in undertaking its initial investigations into potential quarry sites is deductible (ie, expenditure on the identification of potential sites, initial discussions with landowners and the preliminary geological reports). The expenditure is of a type incurred on a recurrent basis by the company in the normal course of its business. Further, the expenditure is not directed towards the material advancement of a specific capital project (or capital asset or other enduring benefit). 189. However, the subsequent expenditure on negotiations with landowners, detailed technical and environmental reports, and applying for resource consents will be on capital account. This is because the expenditure is aimed at materially advancing the relevant project (or, put another way, making tangible progress on the project). Example 6 190. A competitor company also regularly seeks out new quarry sites (including sites that it could develop itself and existing quarries that it could purchase). In the 2016 income year, it investigated 20 potential sites for development and undertook geological surveys to determine the best sites for development. 191. Preliminary engineering reports were commissioned on the top five sites to determine their quarrying potential. Based on the information outlined in the engineering reports, the company acquired the land and started developing two of the sites. The expenditure on the geological surveys and engineering reports is on revenue account. The expenditure is of a type incurred on a recurrent basis by the company in the normal course of its business. In addition, even though the expenditure could be seen as relating to a specific capital project (or projects) being the development of one or more quarries, it was not aimed at materially advancing those projects (or the acquisition of any asset). Put another way, there was no tangible progress on any capital project. 192. Further tests were then undertaken and reports were commissioned to determine the most appropriate extraction location and depth at each of the two sites. A large earthquake occurred at one of the sites and the company abandoned work on it as it was no longer suitable for extraction. 193. Work continued on the second site, although the company was aware that water table levels might affect the depth at which material could be extracted, including a remote possibility that the levels would be too high to make the site a viable commercial proposition. 37 UNCLASSIFIED 194. Expenditure incurred after the geological surveys and engineering reports (referred to in \[191\]) were obtained is on capital account. The expenditure after this time is referable to the development of a capital asset (and the expenditure was intended to result in material advancement/tangible progress on the project). This is the case despite one of the sites never being successfully completed (because of the earthquake damage) and despite the development of the second site being contingent on water levels not being too high. 195. Also in the 2016 income year, the company wished to purchase two existing quarries. It considered 20 quarries from which it hoped to find two to purchase. Ten of the quarries were in New Zealand and 10 were in Australia. Fifteen quarry owners were selling the quarries as stand-alone assets, while the remaining five were offering 100% of the shares in a subsidiary company that owned the quarries as its sole asset. 196. The company procured preliminary engineering reports on each of the sites to determine which would be suitable for its purposes. On the basis of the engineering reports non-binding bids were placed on three sites, and two quarries were ultimately purchased. 197. Expenditure on the engineering reports is deductible. This is the case regardless of whether the quarries were situated inside or outside New Zealand and whether the quarries were purchased as a stand-alone asset or by way of shares in an asset- owning company. However, expenditure incurred on putting together the three bids would be on capital account as it is incurred for the purpose of acquiring a specific capital asset and materially advances that aim. 198. The following year, the company investigated a single site in Hawkes Bay to determine whether it would be suitable for developing as a quarry. It undertook a geological survey and commissioned a preliminary engineering report to determine whether the site had potential for use as a quarry. The engineering report showed that the site was unsuitable for quarrying and the project was abandoned. 199. The expenditure incurred by the company was deductible. The expenditure related to a specific project (being the potential development of a quarry). However, the expenditure incurred was preliminary and did not materially advance the project. Example 7 200. Acme Electricity Generation Ltd generates electricity for sale to consumers. Currently, its electricity is predominantly generated by coal-fired power plants. However, it also has some small hydro stations and one wind farm. Acme routinely investigates new generation opportunities and intends to focus its future generation projects on sustainable sources. 201. Acme sends an employee to Norway on a general fact finding trip to learn about the generation methods that they use and the pros and cons of each of them. Expenditure on the fact finding trip is deductible as it is not linked to a specific capital project or asset. 202. One of the generation types that Acme learned about in Norway is “blue energy”, which uses seawater and fresh water to generate electricity. Acme identifies five potential places in New Zealand that it believes would be suitable for this type of generation plant. Acme then sends two employees to Norway to talk to the generation company involved. They get general information about “blue energy” including the water conditions that are required for successful generation, the land area required for a plant, the potential generation capacity and ballpark costs for 38 UNCLASSIFIED running a plant. This expenditure is also deductible. The expenditure relates to a specific project (a “blue energy” generation plant). However, the expenditure is preliminary and it does not result in any tangible progress of the project or any capital asset or other enduring benefit. 203. Based on the information that Acme gathered in Norway, it chooses one of the five potential sites that it believes has the best conditions for a viable “blue energy” plant. Acme sends the two employees back to Norway with site plans to get expert advice on the best design for the plant. While there they commission a Norwegian engineer to draw blueprints for the plant. This expenditure is not deductible as having the expert advice and plans for construction materially advances the capital project. Example 8 204. A national restaurant chain is continually looking for new sites on which to build restaurants. It is considering opening a new restaurant in Wellington. To help identify a suitable potential site, the company hires a contractor to survey traffic flows in different areas around Wellington. Following on from this, marketing studies and demographic analysis are undertaken and 15 potential sites are identified. Initial financial forecasting is also undertaken to determine the likely profitability of each site. This expenditure is deductible. The expenditure relates to a specific project (building a new restaurant). However, the expenditure is preliminary and it does not result in any material advancement or tangible progress of the project or any capital asset or other enduring benefit. 39 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix This diagram considers only the general permission and capital limitation. It does not consider any specific deductibility provisions that may apply to allow the taxpayer to deduct expenditure that would not otherwise be deductible under the general permission and/or capital limitation. 40 UNCLASSIFIED References Related rulings/statements “IS 08/02: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 6 (July 2008): 12.
