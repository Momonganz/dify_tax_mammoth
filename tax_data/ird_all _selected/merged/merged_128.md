Commissioner's strike out application largely successful

2010 case note - an assessment is a matter of substance and not form - Judicial review, strike out, Russell template and GST.

Case

FB Duvall Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The Commissioner was able to have most of the causes of actions in a judicial review by the taxpayer struck out. The taxpayer was required to re-draft its pleadings for the sole remaining cause of action.

### Impact of decision

This is largely dealing with historical matters and well settled law. It is a further contribution to case law that an assessment is a matter of substance and not form.

### Facts

FB Duvall Limited ("FBD") filed a number of amended Goods and Services Tax ("GST") returns seeking a refund of output tax paid. These were considered to be late objections (the filing pre-dated the disputes regime). The Commissioner declined to accept these returns and did not amend the existing GST assessments.

In addition FBD (and the other plaintiffs) argued the Commissioner had acted incorrectly in respect of some income tax assessments and GST in failing to issue new assessments once the Commissioner substituted section 99 Income Tax Act 1976 ("ITA") for a sham basis of assessment, even though the change did not alter the quantum of tax. FBD argued that in some way this also impacted on GST.

Subsequently FBD sought judicial review of the Commissioner's decision on five grounds:

1.  that the Commissioner acted unlawfully, unreasonably, and unfairly in refusing to issue amended assessments and refusing to accept late objections;
2.  that the Commissioner acted unlawfully, unreasonably, and unfairly in refusing to issue amended assessments once the sham basis of income tax assessment was abandoned;
3.  that the Commissioner acted unlawfully, unreasonably, and unfairly in refusing to amend the GST returns when the sham basis of income tax assessments was abandoned;
4.  that the Commissioner acted unlawfully, unreasonably, and unfairly in refusing to issue new assessments required by section 99(4); and
5.  for one party Managed Fashions Limited ("MFL") it was pleaded that the Commissioner acted unlawfully, unreasonably, and unfairly in refusing to set a new due date for payment of outstanding tax.

The Commissioner sought to strike out the claim in its entirety.

As the matter proceeded MFL had been liquidated meaning the fifth cause could not be maintained and therefore did not need to be struck out and the fourth cause was being worked through by the parties so it was stayed to allow this to occur.

### Decision

Justice Allan briefly addressed the rules for striking out the particular role of judicial review in tax cases, the Russell template and the procedural history of FBD in the courts. His Honour noted the success FBD had at the Court of Appeal with GST returns similar to those in question, on what the Commissioner contends was a technical point.

Addressing the first cause of action, his Honour noted the pleadings were "hampered by reason of the paucity of particulars and the complete lack of affidavit evidence ..." as well as the conflation of two distinct issues (the decision to decline the late objections and the precedential effect of the earlier procedural history).

He observed that the relative merits of the late objection were a proper consideration and also noted that the Taxation Review Authority had previously determined the objections in FBD's favour, which militated against the Commissioner's submission that the objections were weak. But he noted that in judicial review he could not order the Commissioner to allow the late objections.

Thus he concluded that:

*   \[55\] In summary, I find that Duvall has a tenable argument for review of the Commissioner's decision not to accept (as distinct from allow) its late objections (made by way of amended return), but the relief available to Duvall must be confined to an order directing the Commissioner to reconsider the late objections.  
      
    \[56\] Duvall is not entitled to maintain, by way of judicial review, a claim in respect of the correctness of the assessment itself. To that extent the first cause of action is struck out, with leave to amend in order to incorporate that portion of the first cause of action that survives. The first cause of action is struck out in respect of the remaining plaintiffs in its entirety, but without prejudice to their entitlement to file fresh, properly constituted proceedings that are confined to the procedural issues which have survived in respect of Duvall.

In respect to the second cause of action, His Honour stated that:

*   \[62\] It is settled law that an assessment is a decision by the Commissioner, quantifying the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer for the period in question: _CIR v Canterbury Frozen Meat Co Ltd_ \[1994\] 2 NZLR 681 at 690. It must be definitive as to the taxpayer's liability at the time it is made, and subject to challenge only through the objection process. It is the substance rather than the form of the decision that matters: _JD and CE Henson Partnership v CIR_ \[2009\] 24 NZTC 23,802. The Commissioner is required to give notice of an assessment to a taxpayer pursuant to section 111 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. But no particular form of notice is prescribed, and indeed, assessments may be found in more than one document. In other words, documents may be combined to form an assessment: _Henson_ at \[24\].

Based upon this he concluded that a letter by the Commissioner could easily be sufficient to give effect to the withdrawal of the sham assessments and to revive the earlier in time assessments. His Honour noted that FBD's insistence on a Notice of Assessment seemed aimed at reviving rights that had expired (at paragraph \[67\]) and struck out this cause of action.

The third cause of action was swiftly dealt with and struck out because:

*   \[69\] Here, the plaintiffs allege that the Commissioner has acted unlawfully, unfairly or unreasonably by failing to amend his assessments of GST in respect of the plaintiffs, in consequence of the withdrawal of the Track C assessments. Track C formed part of the Commissioner's reconstruction activities in consequence of the application of section 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976, which related only to income tax. The Goods and Services Act 1985 has its own tax avoidance provision: section 85. In other words, Track C and its subsequent withdrawal are irrelevant for GST purposes.

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") held that the disputant and the vendor in a secondhand property transaction were associated persons under s 2A(1)(a)(i) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act"). In the alternative, the TRA found the disputant had entered into a tax avoidance arrangement that was void as against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") under s 76.

### Facts

The proceeding concerned assessments made by the Commissioner reversing goods and services tax ("GST") input deductions claimed by Disputant Ltd ("Disputant") arising from the purchase of property from X Land Holdings ("X") for the GST periods ending 31 January 2007, 30 September 2007 and 31 January 2008.

In February 2006, Disputant and X entered into an agreement for the purchase and sale of property for $4,557,000.00 (including GST). By agreement, Disputant was to pay a $50,000.00 deposit to X with the balance for the land paid by nine instalment payments of $500,000.00 and a final payment of $7,000.00.

The Commissioner declined the GST inputs sought by Disputant under s 46 of the GST Act pending an investigation. Disputant issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") in respect of the Commissioner's decision to withhold the GST inputs and the Commissioner issued a Notice of Response in response. Upon completion of the disputes process the Commissioner made assessments for unpaid GST totalling $505,555.60 with shortfall penalties of $250,000.00.

The assessments were made on the basis that Disputant and X were associated persons under s 2A(1)(a)(iii) of the GST Act and alternatively, that the input credits claimed by Disputant were part of a tax avoidance arrangement that is void as against the Commissioner under s 76 of the GST Act.

### Decision overview

The TRA decided in the Commissioner's favour finding that Disputant and X are associated persons under s 2A(1)(a)(i) of the GST Act by the binding High Court case of _Concepts 124_. In addition, the TRA upheld the Commissioner's alternative argument that the transaction constituted a tax avoidance arrangement under s 76 of the GST Act and was void as against the Commissioner.

However, the TRA did not find that Disputant and X are associated persons under s 2A(1)(a)(iii) of the GST Act - namely that Disputant and X were not associated by "any other means of control whatsoever".

In respect of the arguments raised by Disputant, the TRA:

1.  found that the Commissioner did not unlawfully withhold the GST refunds sought by Disputant and that the decision to withhold the GST input credits was in accordance with s 46 of the GST Act;
2.  upheld the Commissioner's position that the NOPA in respect of the GST return ending 31 January 2007 was received outside of the statutory time limit and that Disputant's explanation for the delay in issuing a late NOPA was without merit;
3.  did not find that the Commissioner's assessments were invalidated for the various administrative arguments detailed by Disputant, including that the assessments were made without proper delegated authority, were in breach of s 6 of the TAA or New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, or that the Commissioner had a vendetta against Mr R.

These findings are discussed in detail below.

### Discussion

#### _Associated persons - ss 2A(1)(a)(i) and/or 2A(1)(a)(iii) of the GST Act_

The Commissioner's principal argument was that Disputant and X were associated persons under s 2A(1)(a)(iii) of the GST Act. The TRA considered Disputant's argument that "association" under s 2A(1)(a)(iii) refers to legal control and that since each party had different legal ownership they were not associated under subsection (1)(a)(iii). The Commissioner submitted that even though X was legally controlled by shareholders based in the United States, the evidence showed that major decisions relating to the property were made by Mr R, and on that basis it was appropriate to find that Mr R had factual control of X. The Commissioner took a similar approach with Disputant, contending that while it appeared the Crown had legal control of Disputant, the Crown was unlikely to have any knowledge of Disputant and could not be said to have had any real control over Disputant.

The TRA did not uphold the Commissioner's argument and found that "control by other means" in s 2A(1)(a)(iii) does not include "factual control" but includes the other forms of legal control discussed in _Concepts 124_.

The TRA then considered the Commissioner's argument made on the final day of oral submissions that Disputant and X are associated under s 2A(1)(a)(i) of the GST Act due to a 100% commonality of voting interests between Disputant and X. This argument was made following the High Court's decision in _Concepts 124_ where Clifford J did not distinguish between shares held directly or in a trust capacity when considering whether two companies are associated by commonality of voting interests. Clifford J held that as a matter of basic company law, a share is held by the person registered as its holder for the time being in the company's share register and that company law requires companies to ignore trust interests. The TRA held that _Concepts 124_ was binding upon it and on that basis the TRA found that Disputant and X were associated notwithstanding the fact that Mr R argued the shares of Disputant were held on trust for the benefit of another company.

#### _Tax avoidance arrangement - s 76, GST Act_

The Commissioner's alternative argument was that the input tax credits claimed by Disputant were part of a tax avoidance arrangement that is void as against the Commissioner under s 76 of the GST Act. As a preliminary issue, the TRA accepted that the analysis undertaken in invoking s 76 of the GST Act would meet the requirements of the "four-step" analysis outlined in her Policy Statement on s 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976 ("ITA 1976"). However, the TRA agreed that the Policy Statement is applicable to s 99 of the ITA 1976 and the Privy Council's findings in _O'Neil v the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2001) 20 NZTC 17,051 and had no direct relevance in this proceeding.

The TRA was satisfied Disputant had entered into an arrangement. The TRA went on to consider whether there was any tax avoidance as defined in s 76(8)(c) of the GST Act. The TRA was satisfied that the increase in entitlement to a GST refund resulting from the arrangement satisfied the definition of "tax avoidance" in s 76(8)(c).

When considering whether tax avoidance was the purpose of the transaction, the TRA found that the various arguments made by Mr R were not substantiated and were inconsistent. The TRA held that the test to determine whether the purpose of a transaction is avoidance is objective and that "viewed objectively, \[Disputant\] has not given a cogent explanation to support a non-tax purpose of the arrangement … Put another way, 'but for' the arrangement no input tax credits would have been available to \[Disputant\]" (at \[117\]).

The TRA then considered whether the use of ss 2A(1)(a) and 3A(3) of the GST Act were within the contemplation of Parliament. The TRA observed that Parliament does recognise that claims for large input tax credits are made by registered purchasers stemming from the purchase of secondhand goods from non-registered vendors. Further, the TRA noted in some cases, the secondhand goods were being sold to an associated person principally to gain the input tax credit and to address this concern, Parliament had enacted ss 2A(1)(a) and 3A(3) of the GST Act to limit the credit available in relation to supplies of secondhand goods between associated parties.

The TRA agreed with the Commissioner that Parliament would not have contemplated that an input tax credit would be available on the sale of the property where the parties have gone to such efforts to minimise their formal association, and where a high degree of contrivance, pretence and artificiality is evident in the transaction. In support of this finding, the TRA's reasons included the ownership of both Disputant and X involved a complicated company structure, the fact that the transaction was not settled in accordance with the documentation and the fact that the day before the transaction occurred, Disputant and X swapped directors and Disputant had not provided any reason for why that step was taken. In the TRA's view, the only inference to be drawn was that it was done to lessen the association between the two companies.

Finally, the TRA agreed with the Commissioner that the purpose of tax avoidance was not merely incidental. Rather, the TRA was of the view on the evidence that the arrangement was entered into for the sole purpose of gaining access to input tax credits on the transfer of the property from X to Disputant.

#### _Unlawful withholding of GST credits - s 46, GST Act_

Mr R on behalf of Disputant submitted that the Commissioner's decision to withhold GST refunds due to Disputant contravened s 46 of the GST Act for a number of reasons.

In response to Disputant's argument that a s 46 notice is required to be issued by the Commissioner if she is not satisfied with a return whether there is a refund or not, the TRA held that s 46 is clearly intended to apply where a refund is sought and not otherwise.

Disputant argued that requirements under s 46 of the GST Act place a time limit on the Commissioner's ability to exercise her discretion under that section. The TRA agreed with the Commissioner and held that a decision by the Commissioner to withhold payment of a refund under s 46 is not a disputable decision.

Disputant argued that the Commissioner has chosen an arbitrary figure and because that figure was surpassed, the refund was automatically refused (and a s 46 letter issued). In these circumstances, Disputant argued that it was not a situation where the Commissioner (for the purposes of s 46(2)) had not been satisfied with the return. The TRA accepted evidence of the Commissioner's officer that there was no process in place for the automatic generation of s 46 notices.

Disputant argued that the Commissioner could have paid the refund and carried out any investigations subsequently. The TRA agreed with the Commissioner that Disputant's approach was at odds with the Supreme Court's view in _Contract Pacific Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2010\] NZSC 136. Accordingly, the TRA found that once notice is given by the Commissioner to investigate a particular GST return, the Commissioner is not required to pay any refund until the point in time stipulated in s 46(1)(b) of the GST Act.

#### _Assessments invalid for administrative reasons_

Disputant raised a number of administrative arguments as to why the assessments made by the Commissioner were invalid. The TRA considered each and made the following findings:

1.  Mr R's allegations of vendetta were not upheld. The TRA considered that Mr R's submission of Judge Willy's comments in _Case U11_ (1999) 19 NZTC 9,100that "the feuding must stop" had no relevance to this proceeding. Further, the TRA considered that the TRA was not the appropriate forum to raise allegations of vendetta. The TRA held that if Disputant wished to pursue such allegations, the appropriate procedure is by way of judicial review in the High Court.
2.  The Commissioner's decisions were made with delegated authority, notwithstanding that the authorised delegation holder did not conduct the entire investigation and associated consultation. The TRA relied upon the comments of Collins J in _Accountants First Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZHC 2446 at \[63\]in coming to that view.
3.  The TRA did not find that the Commissioner's actions were in breach of either s 6 of the TAA or the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.

Commissioner successful in donations GST case
=============================================

This proceeding was a tax challenge in relation to reassessments made for six GST periods to include payments that the disputant, CD Trust, has treated as not being subject to GST.

### Summary

This proceeding was a tax challenge in relation to reassessments made for six GST periods (from the tax year ended 31 March 2012 to the tax year ended 31 March 2015) to include payments that the disputant, CD Trust, has treated as not being subject to GST. The Taxation Review Authority (“**the Authority**”) found for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“**the Commissioner**”) and upheld the reassessments (during the preparation for the hearing the Commissioner’s investigator identified that there were errors in the calculations underlying the assessments and recalculated what the correct amount of the assessments should be. The Taxation Review Authority varied the assessments accordingly pursuant to s 138P of the TAA.)

### Impact

This decision was an orthodox application of the law on GST.

The decision highlights that nomenclature used by a party is not decisive. It did not matter how the disputant’s chose to characterise the payments they were receiving for X sport court hire and coaching fees if the true nature of the payments were such that they were taxable supplies which should have been included in their GST returns.

### Facts

The disputant was an incorporated society for the disputed period but later became a registered charity. Mr Smith was the main trustee and essentially controlled the disputant. Mr Smith leased a property (“**the ABX Centre**”) he owned to the disputant. The disputant subleased office space and returned the output tax on this in its returns. Mr Smith returned output on the rents he received from the disputant. In all periods the disputant’s GST inputs were greater than its outputs and therefore received a refund.

In 2014 it appeared to the Commissioner that the disputant was utilising parts of the building it leased office space in to hire out X sport courts and charge fees for X sport coaching without returning GST output.

The Commissioner amended the disputant’s GST returns to account for this income which resulted in the denial of all the GST refunds and tax owing to the Commissioner.

### Issues

Judge Sinclair applied the law of GST to the facts of this case by analysing the following issues:

1.  Whether the disputant can challenge the Commissioner’s decision under s 108A(3) of the TAA to reopen the time-bar in s 108(1)(a) of the TAA?
2.  Whether the payments received by the disputant were donations and therefore not subject to GST?
3.  In the alternative, whether the payments were for exempt supplies under s 14(1)(b) of the GST Act 1985?
4.  If the disputant is found to have made taxable supplies, whether it is liable for shortfall penalties under s 141A of the TAA?

### Decision

The Authority dismissed the time bar issue on the basis that pursuant to s 138E(1)(i)(v) of the TAA the decision to lift the time bar for a GST return reassessment under s 108A of the TAA is not a disputable decision that can be challenged to the Authority.

The Authority held that payments received by the disputant for X sport court hire and coaching fees were not donated because these payments were not “unconditional gifts”. The disputant was not a non-profit body because the disputant’s trust deed did not prohibit it from making any distribution to its members. The use of the courts and receipt of coaching services were conditional on fees to be paid.

The Authority held that payments received by the disputant for X sport court hire and coaching fees were not exempt supplies which required a supply of donated goods and services to be made by a non-profit body. The disputant was not a non-profit body. The supply of X sport court hire and provision of X sport coaching services were not donated. A lease agreement showed that the disputant was renting the X sport courts from Mr Smith. The Authority concluded that the disputant was only in the position to pay their rent to Mr Smith by hiring out the X sport courts. The disputant’s bank statements reflected reasonably regular payments being made directly to Mr Smith who conducted some X sport coaching at the ABX Centre. The disputant was not able to discharge their onus of establishing that Mr Smith (and any other X sport coaches) had donated their services to the disputant.

The Authority held that the disputant did not take reasonable care in taking a tax position when it filed its GST returns. The disputant did not establish it relied on professional advice when filing their returns. The Authority accepted that Mr Smith (who prepared and managed the affairs of the disputant) was an experienced businessman who was personally GST registered meaning he had an understanding of the GST legislation. The Authority held that a reasonable person in his position would have known that the supply of X sport court hire and coaching services were taxable supplies and required GST output tax to be included in the disputant’s GST returns.

Commissioner successful in establishing that a section 167(1) trust survives liquidation
========================================================================================

2013 case note – CIR successful in establishing that a statutory trust will not be extinguished on liquidation.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Jennings Roadfreight Limited (in liq) \[2013\] NZCA 455

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This case was an appeal from the High Court which held that the statutory trust pursuant to section 167(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the Act") is extinguished upon a company being liquidated. The majority of the Court of Appeal overturned the decision of the High Court and concluded after consideration of the legislative scheme and history and applicable case law that an established section 167(1) trust will not be extinguished upon liquidation.

### Impact of decision

Where PAYE deductions are held in trust under section 167(1) of the Act, the trust remains in existence upon liquidation and is not terminated by section 167(2). Accordingly, the deductions are held in trust in favour of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") and are required to be paid to the Commissioner despite liquidation occurring. However, where monies/deductions are not held on trust, the Commissioner will be subject to the priorities under schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993 as a preferential creditor.

### Facts

This was an appeal by the Commissioner against the decision of High Court Associate Judge Doogue. The High Court held that the Commissioner was not entitled to retain amounts paid to her by the Bank of New Zealand ("BNZ") pursuant to a deduction notice.

In the High Court, the Commissioner argued that the amounts deducted represented unpaid PAYE deductions and therefore were subject to a statutory trust in her favour under section 167(1) of the Act. The High Court held that the statutory trust under section 167(1) of the Act must come to an end on liquidation and this is made clear by section 167(2) of the Act (_Jennings Roadfreight Ltd (in liq) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2012\] NZHC 1441).

As at 15 March 2011, Jennings Roadfreight Limited ("Jennings") owed the Commissioner $49,889.90 in PAYE for the month of February 2011. On the same day the Commissioner issued a notice pursuant to section 157 of the Act requiring BNZ to deduct funds from the respondent's bank account. The notice was issued in respect of goods and services tax (GST), not PAYE.

BNZ made various deductions from Jennings' bank account in accordance with the section 157 notice. The deductions totalled $26,777.80. The Commissioner accepted that she was only entitled to retain the $14,076.38 credit available in Jenning's bank account at the time the company went into liquidation and must account to the liquidators for the balance.

### Decision

The majority (Wild and White JJ) held that the purpose of section 167(1) of the Act is to create a statutory trust, ensuring that any money in the trust remains outside the employer's estate on liquidation. The majority went on to specify that the trust fund would be a fluctuating credit balance of the employer's bank account. Further to this, the majority added that Jennings' liquidation did not extinguish the trust.

Wild and White JJ considered that the language of section 167(1) only made sense if the money is still held in the statutory trust created by section 167(1). Accordingly, Wild and White JJ considered Parliament's intent a critical point and specifically said that "Parliament would not have created the trust and provided for the exclusion of the trust money from the employer's estate upon liquidation if it had intended otherwise" (at \[22\]).

#### Section 167

The majority considered the application of sections 167(1) and (2) of the Act, finding that section 167(1) deals with the situation where the employer has dealt properly with the PAYE deduction(s), while section 167(2) deals with the situation where the employer has "failed" to deal properly with the "amount of the tax … deducted … in the manner required by section 167(1)".

An employer will have failed to meet the requirements of section 167(1) if it no longer holds the PAYE it has deducted but not yet paid it to the Commissioner, in other words, if the employer has misapplied the monies held in trust for the Crown. Section 167(2) applies to PAYE deducted and neither paid by the employer to the Commissioner, nor held by the employer in its bank accounts available for payment to the Commissioner.

In respect of Jennings, the majority determined that section 167(1) of the Act applied to the $14,076.38 in Jennings' bank account when it was put into liquidation. The effect of section 167(1) being that the $14,076.38 was held in trust for the Commissioner and "shall remain apart, and form no part of the estate in … liquidation".

The majority considered that section 167(2) applied to the $35,813.52 difference between the $49,889.90 Jennings had deducted and the $14,076.38 Jennings held in its bank account at the time of liquidation. The effect of section 167(2) being that the Commissioner's claim for that $35,813.52 ranked under the schedule 7 priorities of the Companies Act 1993.

The majority went on to consider the legislative scheme, history and case law on sections 167(1) and (2) and concluded that these supported their interpretation of the sections. The majority therefore allowed the Commissioner's appeal.

Ellen-France J dissented and referred to North P in _Westmoreland (Re Westmoreland Box Company Ltd (in liq), Crawshaw v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1968\] NZLR 834 (CA) at 842.) in support of her view that the $14,076.38 credited to the Commissioner by BNZ was not trust property.

Rule 2.50 of the District Court Rules 2009, section 17 and Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner was successful in having the disputant's claim struck out. The disputants may seek leave from the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") to file an amended claim disputing the correctness of the Commissioner's assessments.

### Impact of decision

This case reaffirms that everyone is subject to the laws of Parliament and Revenue Acts. Where there is a dispute over the amount of tax to pay, the disputant and the Commissioner are to engage in the disputes process. To challenge an assessment, the disputant should identify why and how the Commissioner's calculation of the tax owed should be corrected.

### Facts

The disputant provides shearing services to farmers. However, from January 2005 the disputant stopped making PAYE tax deductions from wages payable to its employees and did not account to the Commissioner for those deductions.

The Commissioner commenced an investigation in early 2007. During an interview with the director of the disputant, the director expressed his view that the preamble to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 means that no tax is required to be paid by the disputant.

In November 2007, the Commissioner issued pursuant to section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a request for disclosure of information and production of books and documents for inspection. The director of the disputant advised the Commissioner that the shareholders had passed a resolution transferring the shares to a trust. As the trust was constituted under a Māori Authority it could not provide the documents requested. The disputant said that to do so would be in breach of the regulations of the Māori Authority and Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993.

In January 2008, the Commissioner received a notice informing him that a hearing at Te Tii Waitangi Marae was set down for February 2008 to determine whether the disputant had to provide the information requested. The Commissioner responded advising that they would not be attending as the Commissioner did not recognise the Māori Court referred to.

The Commissioner issued a notice of proposed adjustment on 12 March 2009 proposing to amend the disputant's monthly employer schedules for the periods January 2005 to June 2007, to include payments to shearers and shed hands. PAYE was to be calculated on the payments to the shearers and shed hands.

A shortfall penalty for evasion was proposed.

The disputant responded with a notice of response and claimed that the information it provided was in breach of the Māori Authority's regulations. The disputant repeated its argument that it does not have to pay tax or provide any information to the Commissioner.

Despite attempts, no conference was held. The parties exchanged Statement of Positions that essentially repeated earlier arguments. The matter was referred to Inland Revenue's Adjudication Unit who concluded that the disputant was liable for tax deductions to be made under the PAYE rules from the wages paid to the shearers and shed hands. Notices of amended assessments for the income years in dispute were issued.

The disputant filed its notice of claim with the TRA. The Commissioner applied to have the claim struck out.

### Decision

The TRA rejected the disputant's argument that it is under the authority of the Māori Authority and therefore is exempt from taxes. It held that the Revenue Acts apply to the disputant.

As the disputant is a taxpayer and obliged to pay taxes under the provisions of the Revenue Acts, the disputant must also comply with any section 17 notices issued by the Commissioner. The TRA held that the Commissioner cannot be estopped from performing his statutory functions. If the Commissioner had no power to obtain confidential information, the whole taxation system and its rationale would break down as the burden of taxation would fall only on diligent and honest taxpayers.

The TRA accepted that the Commissioner had followed the disputes procedure and engaged with the disputant to discuss the tax in dispute. The Commissioner had also acted in good faith throughout this dispute. However, the TRA recognised that the disputant mistakenly continued to argue that it was not liable to pay tax.

The TRA recognised that the disputant could dispute the correctness of the Commissioner's assessments on the basis that the shearers were independent contractors and not employees. To do this, the disputant would have to set out why and how the Commissioner's calculation of tax owed by the disputant is to be corrected.  As the disputant's pleadings were confusing and misguided, the TRA allowed the disputant one month to apply to the TRA to amend its pleadings. Leave was also allowed for the disputant to argue that the shortfall penalty for evasion is not appropriate. The TRA considered it is arguable that the disputant was sincere in its views about Māori sovereignty affecting its PAYE responsibilities.

The disputant's claim was struck out. The disputant has one month to apply to the TRA, if it chooses, to pursue the issue of whether the shearers or shed hands were employees or independent contractors. The disputant may also apply to argue that a lower level of shortfall penalty should be imposed.

Commissioner successful in tax avoidance case
=============================================

The first proceeding was in relation to Mr Brown personally. The second proceeding was in relation to DLC as trustee of the DLC Family Trust.

Case

\[2019\] NZTRA 5

Legal terms

Tax avoidance, Arrangement, Trust, Income, Rental income, Interest expenses, Reconstruction, Trustee income, Beneficiary income, Income under ordinary concepts, Time bar

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004 (ITA), ss BG 1, CA 1, DA 1, DB 6, GB 1, HH 3, HH 4 and OB 1  
Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), ss 59(3), 89C(k), 108, 141B, 141D and 149A

### Summary

This matter relates to two proceedings heard at the same time.

The first proceeding was in relation to Mr Brown personally (“the Mr Brown proceedings”). Mr Brown challenged income tax assessments for the 2001 and 2003 to 2008 income tax years in which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) rejected Mr Brown’s proposed adjustments removing income of $857,848 attributed to Mr Brown on the basis there was a tax avoidance arrangement.

The second proceeding was in relation to DLC as trustee of the DLC Family Trust (“the DLCFT proceedings”). DLC challenged income tax assessments for the 2014 and 2015 income tax arrears in which the Commissioner rejected DLC’s proposed adjustment seeking to have interest deductions of $256,680 attributed to DLC in each year on the basis that these interest deductions arose from a tax avoidance arrangement. In both proceedings the Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) found that there was a tax avoidance arrangement and upheld the Commissioner’s assessments.

### Impact

This decision was an orthodox application of the law on tax avoidance as set out in the Supreme Court’s decision in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289. The decision highlights the fiction or the “artifice or contrivance” involved in arrangements of the type undertaken by the disputants in this matter. This case also reinforces that the onus is on the taxpayer in tax challenges to put before the court documentary evidence proving the assessments are wrong and by how much.

### Facts

The arrangements at issue involved the sale of properties from one of Mr Brown’s family trusts (“KSFT”), to another of his family trusts (“XPT”), to another of his family trusts (“BFCT”) and finally to the contemporaneous family trust which is the subject of the second proceedings, the DLCFT. Each sale created a debt in the subsequent trust to an associated entity. This debt provided Mr Brown with an interest expense which offset rental income Mr Brown derived from his 1/3rd interest in the properties which he continued to retain. This meant that throughout the relevant period (2001, 2003 to 2008) Mr Brown was in a loss position.

DLC as trustee of the DLCFT filed conservative tax returns paying the tax owing in 2014 and 2015 but proposed adjustments to those assessments by including interest deductions which would have the effect of significantly reducing its taxable income.

### Issues

Judge Sinclair applied the law of tax avoidance to the facts of this case by analysing the following issues in relation to the Mr Brown proceedings:

1.  Was there a tax avoidance arrangement involving BFCT to offset rental income by way of an interest expense?
2.  Was the Commissioner able to reconstruct income under the tax avoidance arrangement to Mr Brown?
3.  Has Mr Brown met the onus of proving that the amount of income reconstructed by the Commissioner onto him was incorrect, and by how much it was incorrect?
4.  Does the operation of the time bar prevent the Commissioner from reassessing Mr Brown?

In respect of the DLCFT proceedings the legal issue was:

6.  Did the interest deductions proposed by DLC in the 2014 and 2015 tax years form part of a tax avoidance arrangement, and are therefore void against the Commissioner under s BG 1 of the ITA?

### Decision

The Authority confirmed that both the disputants were compliant with the black letter law. This was accepted by the Commissioner, see \[2019\] NZTRA 5 at \[55\], with respect to the interest deductibility provisions, Income Tax Act 2004, ss DA 1 and DB 6, and the financial arrangement rules.

The Authority held that in both arrangements the interest deductibility provisions and the financial arrangement rules were not used in a way which was within Parliament’s contemplation. The Authority concluded that the arrangements lacked a commercial reality and were essentially designed to allow Mr Brown to obtain tax benefits. Both arrangements were therefore held to be void against the Commissioner under s BG 1. See \[2019\] NZTRA 5 at paragraphs \[56\] to \[87\].

The Authority held that the Commissioner’s reconstruction was correct for both disputants. Mr Brown failed to put before the Authority documentary evidence explaining why amounts he used and that he classified as inter trust loans, investments or reimbursements for expenses paid on behalf of the beneficiaries of his family trust (his children) but were in fact personal expenditures should not be reconstructed onto him as income. The Authority concluded that Mr Brown did not meet his onus of providing the assessments were incorrect and by how much. See \[2019\] NZTRA 5 at paragraphs \[97\] to \[118\].

The Authority held that because the arrangement involving BFCT was a tax avoidance arrangement, BTC1 as trustee of the BFCT did not comply with all its tax obligations and consequently BFCT was a non-qualifying trust. This affected the rate of tax payable upon distribution of amounts reconstructed to Mr Brown as income in relation to BFCT. See \[2019\] NZTRA 5 at paragraphs \[119\] to \[123\].

The Authority held that the Commissioner was not time barred from amending the disputant’s assessments on the basis that his returns were wilfully misleading and omitted to mention income from BFCT. See \[2019\] NZTRA 5 at paragraphs \[124\] to \[144\].

Commissioner to reconsider whether to accept late objection
===========================================================

2010 case note - investors in partnerships that financed production of film 'Utu' - refund, objection, late objection.

Case

Dunphy and others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1976

### Summary

The applicants argued that being on the Second Ernst & Young (EY) "in" List in 1996 was a request for a refund and should have been considered by the Commissioner as an application to accept a late objection, the grounds of the objection being the Rudd Watt & Stone letter in 1986. The Commissioner was directed to reconsider whether to accept the late objections.

### Impact of decision

This judgment turns on its specific facts; particularly the EY "in" List. The taxpayers were investors in the same film investment (Utu) which the Privy Council held in _Peterson v CIR_ to not be tax avoidance and the dispute procedure is per the old objection process.

### Facts

The three applicants (originally there were eight) were investors in partnerships that financed production of the film Utu. The business affairs of the partnerships were managed by a management committee that operated through Ernst & Young (EY).

The Commissioner audited the partnerships and took the view that certain deductions could not be claimed; broadly because of sham and tax avoidance. Each partner received a letter to that effect.

The management committee instructed Mr Geoff Harley of Rudd Watt & Stone (RWS) who wrote to the Commissioner on 22 December 1986 that he had been instructed to object to the assessments of the partnerships and the partners respectively. This letter is referred to as the "RWS Objection".

The Commissioner responded that the RWS Objection could not be accepted as an objection and a written notice of objection would be required. No individual assessments had been made at the time.

It was informally agreed that the Hay group (other investors in the partnerships that financed production of the film Utu) would have their objections determined first, effectively as a test case.

As time passed and individual partners engaged directly with the Commissioner, the Commissioner questioned the authority of Mr Harley to act for the partners. Mr Harley prepared a list on 23 September 1992 in which the applicants, with others, were identified as having "continuing objections". This is known as the "First EY 'in' List".

In 1996 following an inquiry from Mr Jenkin QC, lead counsel for the Commissioner, an updated list, which included the applicants, was sent to the Commissioner on 20 March 1996 - the "Second EY 'in' List".

Following the discontinuance of the Hay proceedings, Mr Richard Peterson independently stated a case for the Taxation Review Authority and continued appealing to the Privy Council which, by majority, found that the arrangement was not tax avoidance; _Peterson v CIR_ \[2006\] 3 NZLR 433.

During the progression of the _Peterson_ case through the Courts, there was no communication between the applicants and the Commissioner. However, following the Privy Council's decision, the three applicants and others approached the Commissioner seeking refunds, either inquiring whether they had live objections or claiming that they did.

Following correspondence and discussions, the Commissioner by his delegate wrote to Mr Harley on 29 September 2008. It was this which was judicially reviewed by the applicants.

Subsequent to the proceedings, a senior tax counsel (STC) in the Department considered whether the Commissioner should accept late objections under section 30(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (ITA76) for the three applicants and two other applicants. The STC concluded a late objection would not be accepted from any of the three applicants but, subject to some qualifications, concluded a late objection should be accepted from the two other applicants, who subsequently withdrew from the hearing. Several other applicants had previously withdrawn from the proceeding.

### Decision

The Court granted leave for the applicants to amend their pleadings after the hearing bar on one allegation; the Commissioner was also granted leave to file an amended defence. Essentially, the applicants were granted leave to amend their pleadings from one of having extant objections and/or the Commissioner being on notice to one of having late objections considered under section 30(2) of the ITA76.

The Court found that the effect of the Commissioner's decision on 29 September 2008 was to decline a request for a refund and, at least by implication, ignore the possibility that there might be a late objection capable of acceptance under section 30(2). These gave rise to a "statutory power of decision" within section 3 of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 and the decision was justiciable.

The Court went on to consider the applicability of the Privy Council's decision of _Peterson_ to these applicants; they not being parties to that proceeding. The Commissioner noted that the Privy Council's decision was decided on concessions made by the Commissioner, including the concession that the full costs deducted were economic costs. For different taxpayers, the Commissioner said that he may take a different position in relation to investments in Utu. The Court noted it had considerable difficulty with this:

1.  The applicants were members in the same Utu partnerships as Mr Peterson and the ratio of the Privy Council's decision was that the "arrangement" was not tax avoidance.
2.  If a matter concerning the partnerships came before the Court, it would be bound by the Privy Council's decision.
3.  Any concessions made by the Commissioner to the Privy Council were made during the final phase of the _Peterson_ litigation and it is difficult to believe that the Commissioner's concessions would have been other than fully informed.
4.  The Commissioner has applied _Peterson_ to other partners (because the Commissioner agreed they had extant objections) and it would grossly unfair to exclude these applicants from the benefits of the Privy Council's decision.
5.  Even though the non-recourse loan gave rise to a secret profit at the investors' expense, they nevertheless incurred a contractual liability to repay the loan out of profits generated by the film.
6.  _Ben Nevis_, _Glenharrow_ and _Accent Management_ \[sic\] involved different facts. Accordingly, the Court was satisfied in the context of late objections that the Commissioner should have proceeded on the basis that the Privy Council's decision applied to the applicants.

It was common ground that the Commissioner did not consider whether he should allow late objections under section 30(2) of the ITA76. The Court found that the issue of refunds was clearly before the Commissioner. There could be no refund in terms of section 409 in the absence of a timely objection (section 30(1)) or a late objection (section 30(2)). Although a late objection was not expressly mentioned in any of the correspondence to the Commissioner, it was inherent in the case the applicants were putting to the Commissioner. The failure of the applicants to directly raise the issue of late objections did not destroy their argument.

The Court found the Commissioner misdirected himself by failing to consider whether a late objection should be accepted. The Court went on to find that there was an objection capable of qualifying as a late objection.

The applicants' case was that being on the Second EY "in" List (20 March 1996) coupled with the RWS Objection (22 December 1986) constituted their objection.

The Court found that:

*   \[79\] The only sensible interpretation is that the investors referred to in the list \[the Second EY 'in' List\] of "Continuing objections" were confirming their objections. ... They were now _restating_ their objection in writing at a time where the objection was capable of responding to their assessments. The only problem was that they were outside the one month timeframe.

The RWS Objection (in 1986) provided the grounds for the objection in 1996 (the Second EY "in" List) and if Inland Revenue officials involved at the time had "properly turned their minds to the matter" this should have been understood by them.

Thus, the Court found there was written notice of objection stating the grounds of objection, albeit it was out of time.

The Court accepted that the Second EY "in" List constituted a written application for a refund under section 409 of the ITA76. Accordingly, it was within the eight year timeframe.

The Court further commented that the apparent merits of the objections are strong (ie the Privy Council's decision binds) and despite the evidence from the Commissioner that he is unable to calculate the correct assessments and interest now due to the lack of information, the Court preferred the evidence of the applicants that this was overstated.

The Court concluded that this was one of those "rare cases ... where acceptance of the applicants' claims was the only reasoned response that the Commissioner could have properly made".

The Court further considered that the STC's consideration of whether to accept late objections did not cure the defects in the Commissioner's decision to not accept the late objections and directed the Commissioner to reconsider the applicants' positions in terms of the amended statement of claim.

Commissioner unsuccessful against appeal of his strike-out application
======================================================================

2011 case note - Court of Appeal allowed the appellant's appeal and the order striking out the application for judicial review by the High Court set aside.

Case

John David Hardie v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal by Mr Hardie and the order striking out the application for judicial review by the High Court was set aside.

### Impact of decision

The Court confirmed that a default assessment must not be arbitrary, disregard the law or known facts and must be a genuine attempt to ascertain the taxable income. The implications of the judgment to the Commissioner's guidelines for making default assessments are being considered.

### Facts

Mr Hardie failed to file his income tax returns for the years ended 31 March 1999 to 2005 and goods and services tax (GST) returns for the monthly periods ended 31 March 2003 to 30 April 2006. The Commissioner made default assessments. Mr Hardie did not, and had not, filed returns or issued Notices of Proposed Adjustments. The Commissioner obtained a judgment by default in the District Court in respect of Mr Hardie's tax liability. Mr Hardie was not successful in his appeals of this judgment.

Mr Hardie filed a judicial review application claiming that the default assessments were grossly excessive. He asserted that his failure to file returns is excusable because until recently he did not know on what basis the assessments had been made.

The Commissioner was successful in having Mr Hardie's judicial review application struck out. Mr Hardie appealed against that decision.

### Decision

#### _GST default assessments_

For the GST default assessments, the first default assessment was likely to have been based on Mr Hardie's last filed GST return. The previous returns filed by Mr Hardie showed that there were input credits and zero-rated supplies that resulted in him receiving GST refunds. The Court observed that the Commissioner appeared to have ignored those refunds when issuing the default assessments, all of which resulted in GST being payable.

With regard to the subsequent GST default assessments, 10% was added. There was no evidence in the strike-out application but it was pleaded by Mr Hardie that the evidence in the District Court was that 10% was added to each monthly default assessment to encourage taxpayers to file their returns.

#### _Income tax default assessments_

The evidence was that the income tax assessments were based on details taken from GST returns filed by Mr Hardie, with an allowance of 20% for any expenses. The resulting net income had a tax rate of 33% applied to it.

Mr Hardie sought to persuade the Court by reference to the GST returns he did file and his PAYE records that 20% was not a reasonable estimate. The Court found that "All that can properly be said is that there is no evidence that the Commissioner considered Mr Hardie's actual deductible expenses …".

#### _Judicial review of tax assessments_

The Court confirmed that "an assessment may be set aside in judicial review notwithstanding that it might have been challenged under the Tax Administration Act, where it is not an assessment of the sort the legislature had in mind". When the Commissioner exercises his judgment in making an assessment he is not entitled to act arbitrarily or in disregard of the law or facts known to the Commissioner. There must be a genuine attempt to ascertain the taxable income of a taxpayer.

The Court noted it had confirmed in _Westpac v CIR_ \[2009\] NZCA 24 that judicial review is available, exceptionally, when there has been no genuine assessment.

#### _Were the default assessments genuine exercises of judgment?_

Turning to the facts of this case, the Court said it is clearly arguable that these assessments were not genuine exercises of judgment of the Commissioner for four reasons:

1.  It is likely that the Commissioner did not credit Mr Hardie with input credits or zero-rated transactions when making the first assessments. The Commissioner put to the Court that it would be an unreasonable result if Mr Hardie received an overall GST refund in a default assessment. However, the Court said it saw no reason why in those circumstances the Commissioner must issue a default assessment at all.
2.  It appeared that the Commissioner added 10% to each succeeding monthly default assessment, not as a genuine estimate of Mr Hardie's liability but to encourage him to file his returns.
3.  It was arguable that relying on monthly compounding increases in the GST assessments was not the Commissioner's genuine judgement as to Mr Hardie's actual income tax liability.
4.  It was also arguable that the allowance of 20% for expenses did not take into account the evidence, albeit limited, that the Commissioner had about Mr Hardie's expenses.

Mr Hardie sought to excuse his "longstanding and serial defaults" by asserting that he could not issue a Notice of Proposed Adjustment because he did not know on what basis the default assessments had been issued. The Court responded that there was no authority that the Commissioner must deliver reasons for an assessment, nor are reasons a prerequisite to use of the statutory dispute process. It is axiomatic that Mr Hardie "cannot excuse his non-compliance by pointing to his own failings, still less found an application for judicial review upon them".

Finally, the Court observed that it is not to be taken as having precluded a finding that the Mr Hardie's application for judicial review is an abuse of process, should the Commissioner elect to pursue that allegation.

### Result

The appeal was allowed. The order striking out the application for judicial review was set aside.

As this was an appeal by Mr Hardie against the High Court striking out Mr Hardie's judicial review application, the Court did not express a view on whether relief would be granted. The Court of Appeal said it will be for the High Court to decide whether the assessments are indeed susceptible to being set aside, and if so whether relief should be granted or denied to Mr Hardie in the exercise of the Court's remedial discretion.

Commissioner wins liquidation rehearing
=======================================

The Court found that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue had established the grounds for making an order of liquidation and accordingly placed Chesterfields Preschools Limited into liquidation.

Case

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chesterfields Preschools Limited & Therese Anne Sisson \[2019\] NZHC 272

Legal terms

Liquidation

Legislative References

S 241 Companies Act 1993

### Summary

This was a liquidation rehearing. The Court found that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) had established the grounds for making an order of liquidation and accordingly placed Chesterfields Preschools Limited (“CPL”) into liquidation.

### Facts

The Commissioner commenced this liquidation proceeding against CPL in 2015. The Commissioner relied upon the statutory presumption of CPL's insolvency arising through CPL not having satisfied the requirements of a statutory demand. On 6 October 2015 the High Court, following a defended hearing, made an order putting CPL into liquidation (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chesterfields Preschools Ltd_ \[2015\] NZHC 2440, (2015) 27 NZTC 22-029).

Ms Sisson was subsequently joined as a second defendant in this proceeding to enable her to pursue an appeal. Her appeal was partially successful (_Sisson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2017\] NZCA 326, (2017) 28 NZTC 23-023). The Court of Appeal found the High Court had not made a determination as to the precise level of CPL's tax liability and accordingly sent the matter back to the High Court so that CPL could test the accuracy and methodology of the Commissioner's calculation.

In the meantime, interim liquidators were appointed to CPL by this Court on 15 December 2017 (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chesterfields Preschools Ltd_ \[2017\] NZHC 3172, (2017) 28 NZTC 23-046).

### Decision

_Is the Commissioner a creditor of CPL?_

Ms Sisson denied that CPL owes any debt to the Commissioner, her evidence (focused on core tax) was CPL owed $6,898.22 (without consideration of penalties and interest).

However, the Court noted that the Commissioner is a judgment creditor (in relation to costs judgments) in the sum of $32,105 (together with accruing interest).

Accordingly, the Court held that the Commissioner is a creditor of CPL.

_Is CPL unable to pay its debts?_

The statutory demand issued by the Commissioner was not complied with by CPL. There arose the rebuttable presumption that CPL is unable to pay its debts.

It was accordingly for CPL (or Ms Sisson) to establish in this proceeding that CPL is able to pay its debts.

_CPL's tax debt to the Commissioner_

The Court found that the logical starting point for consideration of CPL's debt were the detailed tables prepared by the Commissioner's officers in relation to each tax type on a strictly chronological basis. Ms Sisson also complied her own table extracted her starting figures and dates from the Commissioner's schedules.

The Commissioner's tables showed that the tax debt of CPL was $1,088,461.15.

The Court was satisfied on the evidence with the Commissioner's calculation and methodology of CPL's debt.

_Other indebtedness claimed by the Commissioner_

The Court was satisfied that CPL owed $307,389.01 in prospective or contingent debt (made up of unpaid GST and the associated UOMI (use-of-money interest) on the sale of a property and on insurance proceeds).

The Court also stated that the $280,000 the Commissioner had lent to the interim liquidators of CPL was to be taken into account as an established debt of CPL.

_Resulting debt figures_

For the purposes of assessing CPL's solvency or insolvency the Court recognised the established debt figure of $1,400,566.15 and that the Court could take into account the figure of $307,389.01 for contingent or prospective debts.

_Solvency_

The Commissioner relied upon the presumption of insolvency under s 287 of the Companies Act 1993 as CPL had failed to comply with the statutory demand.

The Court noted that it is established that the s 241(4)(a) test of ability to pay debts involves primarily a ";cashflow” test of solvency to be contrasted with the ";balance sheet” test of solvency. Ms Sisson pleaded that CPL is balance sheet solvent.

The Court found that asset realisation in due course might achieve funds of $1,109,314.77 for CPL. However, this fell short of the established debt of CPL to the Commissioner, being $1,400,566.15. It was still further short of the figure including contingent and perspective indebtedness of $1,707,955.16, which includes $307,389.01 which the Court may take into account in assessing CPL's insolvency.

The Court held the CPL clearly is not balance sheet solvent. Even were there to be made available to CPL further time to realise its two remaining assets, the realisations would not enable CPL to clear its indebtedness. This is not a case where there has been a temporary lack of liquidity. The lack of liquidity has been longstanding and cannot be resolved through realisation of assets. Ms Sisson was unable to rebut the presumption the CPL is unable to pay its debts

_The Court's discretion_

The Court could not determine any basis upon which the Court might now appropriately refuse to make an order liquidating this company which for a long period has not been trading and is substantially insolvent. Accordingly, it ordered the liquidation of CPL.

### Summary

This matter concerned Cullen Group Limited's ("CGL") challenge to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") assessment that CGL avoided $59.5 million of non-resident withholding tax ("NRWT"). CGL had paid $8 million in approved issuer levy ("AIL"), leaving a shortfall of $51.5 million. CGL argued that the arrangement involved the restructuring of Mr Eric Watson's affairs in order to achieve certainty about his change of tax residency from New Zealand to the United Kingdom and to plan for application of the United Kingdom's laws governing remittance of foreign-sourced income. In finding for the Commissioner, the Court did not consider the arrangement was within the contemplation and purpose of Parliament in enacting the AIL regime. It had a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of altering the incidence of tax and was a tax avoidance arrangement which was void against the Commissioner.

### Impact

This decision reaffirms the law on tax avoidance as set out in the Supreme Court's decision in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289("_Ben Nevis"_).It further reconciles the minority and majority decisions in _Ben Nevis_ regarding the interplay between the use of specific tax provisions and, for the general anti-avoidance rule in s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA"), Parliament's contemplation of how those provisions should be used.

### Facts

Mr Watson moved from New Zealand to the United Kingdom in 2002.  He was concerned to ensure his "permanent place of abode" for tax purposes changed from New Zealand to the United Kingdom.   

On 13 November 2002, Mr Watson restructured his ownership of Cullen Investments Ltd ("CIL"). The key steps were:

*   Mr Watson sold his shares in CIL to CGL, at a rounded value of $193m, being $291m less his previous shareholder advances of $98m.  The purchase price of $291m was accepted as at market value.

*   CGL's purchase of the shares was funded by a vendor loan from Mr Watson of $193m (Loan A).  Mr Watson also lent CGL $98m (Loan B) which CGL on-lent to CIL so that CIL could repay Mr Watson's shareholder advances.

*   Mr Watson assigned Loans A and B to two conduit companies in the Cayman Islands, Modena Holdings Ltd (Modena) and Mayfair Equity Ltd (Mayfair) with back to back loans of $193m (Modena Loan) and $98m (Mayfair Loan) to Modena and Mayfair.

The effect of all of this was that CGL owned CIL, CGL owed $193m to Modena and $98m to Mayfair, Modena owed $193m to Mr Watson and Mayfair owed $98m to Mr Watson.  Effectively, instead of owning shares in CIL, Mr Watson held loans for the same value to CGL through Modena and Mayfair; he had exchanged equity for debt.

The terms of Loans A and B from Mr Watson to the CGL (which he assigned to Modena and Mayfair) included:

*   Modena and Mayfair could only request repayment a loan, or part thereof, from CGL if Mr Watson had demanded repayment of the corresponding Modena or Mayfair loan. Modena or Mayfair's demand to CGL was to be contemporaneous with, and not exceed the amount specified, in Mr Watson's demand to Modena or Mayfair.
*   Interest was payable at 16% per annum. The Court accepted this reflected an arms' length arrangement.
*   CGL could not assign or transfer its rights or obligations under the loans.  Mr Watson, as lender could assign his rights but any other lender, including Modena and Mayfair, could only assign them back to Mr Watson or with his agreement.
*   CGL was to register each loan with the Commissioner as a registered security for AIL purposes and make payment of AIL to the Commissioner.

Modena and Mayfair entered into a memorandum of understanding with CIL in December 2002 under which their directors delegated to CIL employees the power to effect transfers of funds from Modena's and Mayfair's BNZ accounts to Mr Watson's BNZ accounts.  Further, when CIL sought the consent of third party financiers, CIL stated "\[t\]he change is an internal reorganisation and has no practical effect on the control of Cullen and its group companies".

When the arrangement was unwound, Mr Watson demanded repayment from Modena (then owing $587.5m) and Mayfair (then owning $140.9m) and Modena and Mayfair assigned Loans A ($587.5m) and Loan B ($140.9m) to Mr Watson. Mr Watson made demand on CGL for repayment of Loans A and B. CGL entered a deed setting off the loans in return for issuing non-voting redeemable preference shares, redeemable at the holder's option and with no dividend payable.  Mr Watson transferred the preference shares to Novatrust Ltd, a professional trustee company in Jersey, as trustee for the Summit Trust, funded by loan agreements with Mr Watson for $728.4m ($587.5m + $140.9m) with the shares in CGL used as security. 

CGL applied for approved issuer status and registered Loans A and B as registered securities.   From March 2003 to November 2008, CGL paid AIL of 2% on the $397m interest it paid, or credited in account, to Modena and Mayfair, amounting to just over $8m.  
In 2010, the Commissioner assessed CGL for NRWT at 15% on the $397m interest, amounting to around $59.5m. Offsetting the $8m of AIL already paid, the resulting tax liability was around $51.5m and CGL challenged the NRWT assessments in the High Court. 

### Decision

As a preliminary point, the High Court ruled that evidence from CGL's experts responding to positions of the Commissioner earlier in the dispute process (rather than the Commissioner's expert briefs exchanged in the challenge) and proposed evidence about the legal effect of a Double Tax Agreement (DTA) on the New Zealand withholding tax rate, being legal submissions, were inadmissible.

The Court noted that the general approach to construing specific tax provisions and the general anti-avoidance provision in New Zealand tax law is now well-settled.  The leading authority is _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 389.  Relevant to this case, and bearing in mind that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer, the three requirements for tax avoidance are:

*   The arrangement uses, and falls within, specific tax provisions.
*   Viewed in light of the arrangement as a whole, the taxpayer has used the specific provisions in a way which cannot have been within the contemplation and purpose of Parliament when it enacted the provision.
*   The arrangement has a purpose or effect, that is more than merely incidental, of altering the incidence of tax. 

The Court set out the arrangement at paragraph \[39\] and the parties agreed that the arrangement fell within the specific provisions of the ITA and the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 ("SCD") in relation to NRWT and AIL. The Court set out the law on NRWT, AIL and s OD 7 of the ITA 1994 (the relevant associated person section at the time of the arrangement).  The Court queried whether CGL and Modena or Mayfair may be associated under the "control by any other means" subsection, which potentially encompasses control in terms of economic substance, but accepted that the Commissioner was bound by her pleadings that CGL was not, legally, an associated person of Modena or Mayfair.

The Court then considered whether the specific tax provisions were used in a way which cannot have been within Parliament's contemplation.  This case raised directly the question of the difference between a purposive interpretation of specific tax provisions and Parliament's contemplation of how those provisions should be used.  For there to be tax avoidance, the arrangement must fall within the meaning of the provisions, construed in light of their purpose, but outside the way in which Parliament contemplated they be used.  

Judicial understanding of Parliament's purpose in enacting the legislation informs but does not substitute for judicial interpretation of the words Parliament enacted.  The "parliamentary contemplation" stage of the s BG 1 tax avoidance inquiry is wider than simply a purposive interpretation of the text of specific provisions.  It is important that it is the "use" of specific provisions and this is an "intensely factual" exercise, focusing on how the arrangement has used, or deployed, the specific provisions. Viewed objectively, in a commercially and economically realistic way, is that use consistent with Parliament's purpose or contemplation?  Artificial and contrived structuring of an arrangement is a "classic indicator" that the use is not consistent with Parliament's contemplation.

The Court found that there was no doubt the arrangement here involved highly complex and contrived ownership structures that would not be found in arms' length relationships.   Neither the lender nor the borrower was independent here.  Mr Watson exchanged equity in CIL for debt owed by CGL back to him ultimately.  The level of control that Mr Watson had was usually an incident of ownership of equity, not debt.  The ownership and debt relationships were structured in such a way as to allow Mr Watson, through CGL, to pay AIL at 2% rather than NRWT at 15%. 

After traversing the background of the AIL regime, introduced in the 1991 Budget Night amendments, the Court agreed with the Court of Appeal, High Court and TRA in _Vinelight Nominees Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ that the objective of the AIL regime is to encourage investment in New Zealand by reducing the cost of New Zealand residents borrowing from non-residents. The Court accepted the expert evidence that no new funds were introduced into New Zealand by the arrangement and, objectively, viewed in light of the arrangement as a whole, CGL used the specific provisions in a way that cannot have been within the contemplation and purpose of Parliament when it enacted the provisions. 

The Court concluded that payment of AIL was a key element of Loans A and B and altering the incidence of $51.5m of tax was not merely incidental. Here, the Commissioner was entitled to make her assessment on the basis that CGL was liable to pay NRWT and did not need to exercise her reconstruction discretion under s GB 1 of the ITA. 

The Court also found that the NRWT rate should not be 10% (the NRWT rate under the New Zealand / UK DTA) nor were the assessments timebarred. 

Accordingly, the Court dismissed CGL's challenge and upheld the NRWT assessments for $51,496,127.38 plus use of money interest and penalties.

Commissioner’s application to strike out a judicial review application granted
==============================================================================

Mr Mawhinney, as trustee of the Sixty-Six Auckland Trust applied for a judicial review of decisions by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Taxation Review Authority.

Case

Peter William Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue and Taxation Review Authority \[2018\] NZHC 2604

Legislative References

High Court Rules 2016, r 15.1(1) (strike out); Tax Administration Act 1994 Parts 4A (disputes procedure), 6 (assessments) and 8A (challenge procedure)

### Summary

Mr Mawhinney (“the Applicant”), as trustee of the Sixty-Six Auckland Trust (“the Trust”) applied for a judicial review of decisions by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) and the Taxation Review Authority (“the TRA”).

The Trust challenged:

1.  The Commissioner’s decision not to complete the disputes process pursuant to the Trust’s notice of proposed adjustment (“NOPA”);
2.  The Commissioner’s decision to invoke s 89C(eb) in respect of the 2008 reassessment; and
3.  The TRA’s decision to strike out its challenge in relation to the 2008 reassessment.

The Commissioner applied to strike out the application for judicial review on the basis the Court had no jurisdiction to hear most of the complaint, and even if there was jurisdiction, the statement of claim did not disclose an arguable cause of action and was an abuse of process.

The Court found for the Commissioner and struck out the proceeding for lack of jurisdiction. The Court also noted that if it was wrong in that conclusion, the statement of claim disclosed no arguable cause of action and struck it out on that basis.

### Impact

The Court confirmed that the disputes and challenge processes cannot be engaged concurrently. If a taxpayer utilises its challenge rights, its right to continue with a dispute comes to an end. If a taxpayer discontinues its challenge before the Court, it cannot go back and “have a second bite of the cherry” by attempting to restart or continue the disputes process with the Commissioner.

### Facts

This case revolves around GST returns filed by the Trust. For the period ended 31 July 2008, the Trust claimed a GST refund of $144,706.72 on the basis it had purchased a property for approximately $1.3 million. Then, for the period ended 31 March 2009, the Trust returned GST output tax of $144,444.44 on the basis it had sold the property for approximately $1.3 million.

The Commissioner formed the view the Trust was not carrying on any taxable activity. Accordingly, on 30 March 2011 the Commissioner reassessed the July 2008 refund to nil (“the 2008 Reassessment”) and the March 2009 refund to nil (“the 2009 Reassessment”). The Commissioner did not first issue a NOPA pursuant to s 89C(eb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA 1994”).

On 4 May 2011, the Commissioner cancelled the Trust’s GST registration with effect from the taxable period ending 31 September 2010. This too reflected the Commissioner’s view the Trust was not carrying on any taxable activity.

On 29 July 2011 the Trust issued a NOPA in relation to the 2008 reassessment initiating the disputes procedure under Part 4A of the TAA. Instead of progressing the disputes procedure, on 3 August 2011 the Trust issued challenge proceedings in the TRA in relation to the 2008 reassessment.

On 26 September 2011 the Commissioner rejected the trust’s NOPA in full by issuing a notice of response (“NOR”).

On 24 November 2011 the Commissioner wrote to the Trust requesting clarification of whether the Trust wanted to go through the disputes procedure or the challenge procedure. The Trust advised the Commissioner it wished to pursue the challenge in the TRA and requested for the disputes procedures to “be put in abeyance in the meantime”.

On 20 January 2012, the Trust registered for GST again effective from 20 January 2012.

On 26 June 2013 the Commissioner applied to strike out the challenge proceedings. Before the strike out application was heard, the Trust discontinued the challenge proceedings on 30 September 2013. On the same day the Applicant wrote to the Commissioner on behalf of the Trust asking to progress the dispute.

On 18 October 2013 the Commissioner declined this request on the basis that by discontinuing the TRA challenge proceedings the Trust had accepted the Commissioner’s assessment.

The Commissioner heard nothing from the Applicant for almost two years until on 3 August 2015 the Applicant wrote to the Commissioner, again on behalf of the Trust, advising that it had been four years since the Trust’s NOPA was issued and requested the excess GST be refunded.

On 19 September 2016 the Commissioner advised the Applicant she did not consider there to be any live dispute or excess GST refund available.

In August 2017 the Trust filed a notice of claim in the TRA in relation to the 2008 reassessment and the cancellation of the Trust’s GST registration with effect from 30 September 2015.

On 29 January 2018 the TRA struck out the application in relation to the 2008 reassessment pursuant to s 138H of the TAA on the basis it had not been commenced within the statutory response period, and therefore did not comply with the requirements of s 138B.

In February 2018 the Trust commenced judicial review proceedings.

### Decision

_Jurisdiction_

In assessing whether there was jurisdiction the Court applied the test from the Supreme Court in _Tannadyce Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153 where it held that because of s 109 of the TAA judicial review will only be available in limited circumstances where:

1.  It is not practically possible for a taxpayer to challenge an assessment under Part 8A. This will be rare.
2.  If the issue concerns some suggested flaw in the statutory process that needs to be addressed outside the statutory regime.

The Court found this proceeding did not fall within either of the two narrow categories.

First, the Court rejected the Trust’s argument that the Commissioner had misinterpreted s 89C(eb) of the TAA, this could not be challenged (because the decision to exercise s 89C(3b) was not an assessment (TAA s 3) or a disputable decision (TAA s138E(1)(E)(iv))) meaning judicial review was the only available remedy to the Trust.

While the Commissioner’s decision to issue the NOPA under s 89C(eb) cannot be challenged, the resulting reassessment can, and was, challenged in 2011. When the Trust discontinued its challenge in 2013, its disputes and challenge rights were exhausted. The Trust “does not get another shot” at exercising its disputes and challenge rights once these rights were exhausted. Second, there was no flaw in the statutory process which needed to be addressed outside the statutory regime. The Trust sought relief that was within the statutory procedures.

_Arguable causes of action_

The Court considered the Trust’s statement of claim did not disclose any arguable causes of action. The Court rejected the Trust’s grounds for judicial review and held overall that the Commissioner did not err in holding that the disputes procedures in relation to the 2008 reassessment concluded when the challenge rights were properly exercised.

The Trust received incorrect advice that the disputes and challenge processes were to be initiated at the same time. The Trust was not able by law to commence challenge proceedings until the Commissioner issued its NOR on 26 September 2011.

The Court did not accept that the disputes process was intended to only be suspended when the Trust asked the disputes process to “be put in abeyance” following its application to utilise the challenge procedures. The Court considered that the legislation was not designed to allow the two processes to run in tandem meaning the Trust could not swap between the disputes and challenge processes at will.

The Court did not accept that agreement in writing between the Trust and the Commissioner was required for the disputes process to cease. Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) of the TAA clearly permits the submission of a dispute to the court or TRA without completion of the disputes process. That provision is, however, is in addition to the power of the taxpayer to opt out of the disputes process under the former s 138B(3). A taxpayer using the former s 138B(3) did not require the agreement of the Commissioner to do so and the Trust did not in fact seek agreement before initiating the challenge process.

The Court rejected the Trust’s arguments as to why it discontinued the challenge process as immaterial to the issues at hand.

The Court rejected the Trust’s arguments that the Commissioner wrongly omitted to complete the disputes process. The Court confirmed that by discontinuing the challenge process in the TRA, the dispute process was effectively at an end. The Court considered that despite there being no specific provision providing that a notice of discontinuance automatically ends the disputes process, there was no other logical and reasonable outcome based on a purposive interpretation of the legislation. In the Court’s words “the Trust was not able to have a second bite of the cherry”.

Commissioner’s interim operational position for tax pooling transfers of use-of-money interest
==============================================================================================

CIR's interim operational position (Sep 2015) relating to tax pooling transfers of use-of-money interest.

### Background

On 3 July 2014 the Minister of Revenue announced the Government's intention to pass legislation to allow tax pooling transfer requests that tax pooling intermediaries file on behalf of their clients to meet deferred tax obligations arising from the resolution of a dispute or an increased amount of tax to also include any underlying use-of-money interest on that deferred tax or increased amount of tax.

It is proposed that retrospective legislation will be passed that will:

*   allow tax pooling intermediaries to request the Commissioner to transfer tax pooling funds to meet deferred tax obligations arising from the resolution of a dispute or arising from an increased amount of tax to also include any associated use-of-money interest with effect from 3 July 2014 and the 60 days prior to that date; and
*   provide operational transitional provisions that will allow tax pooling intermediaries to make transfer requests inclusive of use-of-money interest from 3 July 2014 to the date the proposed legislation is enacted.

As there will be a period of time between the retrospective application date of the proposed legislation and its enactment, it is recognised that there are a number of interim issues that potentially arise.

The following questions and answers set out the Commissioner's current view, and the operational approach that the Commissioner will be taking to address these issues. Inland Revenue will continue to apply the current law until it is amended. Where possible we will also act consistently with the proposed law, where doing so is not inconsistent with the current law.

However, it must be recognised that until the law is changed there will inherently be some uncertainty. For example, the detail of the proposed legislation may change. It is strongly recommended that tax pooling intermediaries and taxpayers seek advice from a tax professional.

The following FAQs are to provide guidance to taxpayers on Inland Revenue's interim operational approach.

#### 1\. How does the current law apply?

Currently, tax pooling funds can only be used to meet certain tax obligations. Where there is also a use-of-money interest liability relating to those tax obligations the current law does not allow for this interest amount to also be met by using tax pooling funds.

For example, an emended assessment for the 2009-10 tax year for the natural person with a tax agent results in an increased amount of $10,000 tax. If the taxpayer is unable to source the $10,000 from a tax pooling account at the original due date (7 April 2011) use-of-money interest will accrue from 8 April 2011.

The taxpayer can only source tax pooling funds with an effective date of 7 April 2012; therefore the taxpayer will accrue use-of-money interest of $891.43 ($10,000 x 8.89% between 8 April 2011 and 7 April 2012 (366 days)).

The law requires that the $10,000 from the tax pool is firstly applied to the use-of-money interest obligation ($891.43) as at 7 April 2012. This leaves $9,108.57 to apply against the increased amount of tax of $10,000 which then leaves $891.43 tax still owing on which further use-of-money interest accrues from 8 April 2012 until the amount is paid. Tax pooling funds cannot be used to pay the $891.43 or any further use-of-money interest which accrues on this amount.

#### 2\. How will this change under the proposed law?

The proposed legislation will allow taxpayers to use tax pooling funds to meet the increased amount of tax as well as the associated use-of-money interest obligations. In the above example if the taxpayer was able to source $10,891.43 from the tax pool with an effective date of 7 April 2012, the total tax and use-of-money interest would have been fully paid as at that date. There would be no remaining amount of tax owing and no further use-of-money interest would accrue.

#### 3\. Who will this amendment apply to?

The proposed amendment will apply to any taxpayer who is a member of a tax pooling intermediary's tax pool and meets the criteria to use tax pooling funds to meet a tax obligation.

#### 4\. When will these changes be introduced?

The changes are included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which was introduced into Parliament on 26 February 2015.

The bill is expected to enacted in late 2015.

#### 5\. When will these changes apply from?

The proposed amendment will apply from the date of the Minister's announcement (3 July 2014) to any tax pooling transfer requests received from that date.

The proposed amendment will also apply to any tax pooling transfer requests which were received within the 60 days prior to 3 July 2014 relating to an increased amount of tax or to an obligation for deferrable tax. In this situation where a transfer schedule for the tax obligation was filed a further transfer schedule was able to be filed for any use-of-money interest obligations relating to the increased amount of tax or to the obligation for deferrable tax.

Any tax pooling transfer for use-of-money interest relating to a previously filed transfer schedule for the underlying tax will need to be filed within the same statutory timeframe as applied to the transfer schedule for the underlying tax.

#### 6\. How will Inland Revenue manage tax pooling transfer requests relating to use-of-money interest?

Until the proposed legislation is enacted Inland Revenue cannot process tax pooling transfer requests that relate to use-of-money interest. All tax pooling transfer requests relating to the tax amount will still be processed as normal.

Inland Revenue has been in contact with all tax pooling intermediaries and has asked them to make separate requests for transfers of use-of-money from requests to transfer tax. Inland Revenue will hold all tax pooling transfer requests that relate to use-of-money interest until the legislation is amended.

#### 7\. How will holding tax pooling transfer requests relating to use-of-money interest impact taxpayers' tax accounts?

Until Inland Revenue is able to process tax pooling transfer requests for use-of-money interest the tax accounts of affected taxpayers will show outstanding amounts of tax, use-of-money interest and late payment penalties.

Inland Revenue will work with affected taxpayers to ensure that as far as practicable any impacts on these taxpayers is minimised. Impacts can include the issuing of statements of account seeking payment of the outstanding amount, the offsetting of other tax refunds, (for example GST refunds), and other automated policing and debt recovery actions.

As far as possible Inland Revenue will try to intervene to prevent or mitigate automated policing and recovery actions. Where this is not possible, Inland Revenue will take steps to deal with any impacts (for example suppressing the issue of statements of account for affected tax periods, reversing an offset refund and refunding the amount), taking into account the circumstances of the affected taxpayer.

#### 8\. Can taxpayers make payment now of use-of-money interest if their tax pooling intermediary has also made a request to transfer tax polling funds to meet their use-of-money interest obligations?

Yes.

Where a taxpayer's tax pooling intermediary has requested a tax pooling transfer relating to use-of-money interest, the taxpayer can make a payment directly to Inland Revenue to clear the residual amount owing.

Continuing with the example in Q1 above, if the taxpayer's tax pooling intermediary has filed a schedule for the $10,000 transfer effective on 7 April 2012 and a transfer schedule for the $891.43 also effective on 7 April 2012, Inland Revenue will process the $10,000 transfer and hold the $891.43 transfer.

The taxpayer decided to pay the account balance on 25 July 2014. The total amount owing was $891.43 as at 7 April 2012 plus use-of-money interest of $97.59 ($891.43 x 8.89% between 8 April 2012 and 7 May 2012 (30 days) = $6.51 and $891.43 x 8.40% between 8 May 2012 and 25 July 2014 (444 days) = $91.08).

The taxpayer pays $989.02 to clear their tax account.

The tax pooling intermediary's transfer schedule relating to the use-of-money interest will still be able to be processed when the proposed legislation is enacted. This will then result in the tax and use-of-money interest being fully satisfied as at 7 April 2012. The taxpayer will then receive a refund of any resulting excess tax they paid themselves ($898.02 in the example above). The taxpayer will also receive credit use-of-money interest on the $898.02.

The advantage of making payment of the use-of-money interest now and then seeking a refund after the tax pooling transfer relating to the use-of-money interest has been processed is that the taxpayer's account will not show an amount as overdue in the meantime, no late payment penalties will be applied, and offsets of refunds will not occur.

It also provides certainty for the taxpayer that they have paid their obligations as per the current law should the proposed legislative amendment not happen or it is enacted differently from what was announced.

#### 9\. What will happen if the proposed legislation is not passed or is passed differently from what has been announced?

If the proposed legislation is not enacted or is enacted differently from what was announced, Inland Revenue will provide further information on what this will mean for affected taxpayers. However, if there are amounts outstanding that cannot be met by the use of tax pooling funds the amounts will be payable, including any use-of-money interest and late payment penalties that have accrued.

#### 10\. Because qualifying tax pooling transfer requests have to be made by a tax pooling intermediary within a 60 day statutory timeframe, what happens if the amount of use-of-money interest changes before the legislation is enacted?

If an amount of use-of-money interest requested to be transferred is found to be incorrect after the proposed legislative amendments have been enacted, Inland Revenue will have the ability to make changes to the use-of-money interest transfer request before it is processed.

What changes are required and whether some of these will be possible will depend on the circumstances. The intent is to ensure that if there was an error made in calculating the use-of-money interest or the amount of use-of-money interest has changed as a result of something else occurring in the taxpayer’s tax account (for example a further amended assessment), the right amount is transferred at the relevant effective date(s).

While it is expected that a nil balance will result in the taxpayer's tax account in most instances, there may be other factors, including factors unrelated to tax pooling, which could impact the taxpayer's tax account which may result in a non-nil balance (for example if more tax pooling funds are required then these would have to be available in a tax pooling account to enable the use-of-money transfer schedule to be changed to increase the amount transferable).

#### 11\. Can a new or an amended tax pooling transfer schedule be filed for the use-of-money interest amount?

No.

The proposed amendment to allow tax pooling transfers of use-of-money interest at backdated effective dates will be subject to the same statutory timeframes as tax pooling transfers of tax. This means that if a tax pooling transfer request for use-of-money interest is not made within the statutory timeframe, it cannot be accepted at a later date.

Any tax pooling transfer schedules relating to use-of-money interest that are requested within the statutory timeframe will not need to be re-filed or amended by tax pooling intermediaries. Inland Revenue will work with the taxpayers and tax pooling intermediaries when use-of-money transfer schedules are able to be processed and make any necessary changes.

#### 12\. What if an amount of tax, use-of-money interest and/or penalties remain outstanding after the use-of-money transfer schedule has been processed?

If any amount remains owing after a use-of-money interest transfer schedule has had all possible changes made to use additional tax pooling funds (and has been processed) any remaining amount owing, including any use-of-money interest and/or late payment penalties, will need to be paid by other means.

#### 13\. Will Inland Revenue remit use-of-money interest and/or penalties for taxpayers who are affected by the proposed legislative amendment?

Taxpayers are responsible for ensuring they pay the correct amount of tax, including any use-of-money interest and late payment penalties. By relying on the proposed retrospective legislative change taxpayers carry a risk that the change will not occur or that the change will not be exactly as was announced. Additionally, other factors could arise that have an impact on the taxpayer’s account balance and adds to the risk that any tax pooling transfer for use-of-money interest may not fully clear the taxpayer’s tax account.

Taxpayer's should seek independent tax advice in making any decision to meet their use-of-money interest obligations through tax pooling by relying on the proposed retrospective legislation change. If the law does not pass all risk lies with taxpayers if they choose not to follow the current law.

Where a taxpayer whose tax pooling intermediary made a request to transfer use-of-money interest within the statutory timeframe and following the processing of that transfer schedule the taxpayer still has an amount of use-of-money interest liability and/or late payment penalties have been applied, Inland Revenue will consider any request for remissions of the use-of-money interest and/or penalties under section 183D of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Whether or not it is appropriate to grant any remission will be considered on a case by case basis taking into account all of the relevant individual circumstances of the taxpayer.

Commissioner’s interim operational position on calculating PAYE on non-resident seasonal workers’ holiday pay
=============================================================================================================

CIR's interim operational position on calculation of PAYE on non-resident seasonal workers' holiday pay – applies 1 Apr 2016 to 31 Mar 2018.

### Summary

A non-resident seasonal worker is subject to the “NSW” tax code, attracting a PAYE withholding rate of 10.5% on their New Zealand-sourced employment income, which is intended to be full and final.

As a result of the [Commissioner’s Operational Position on calculating PAYE on holiday pay](/operational-positions/commissioners-operational-position-on-calculating-paye-on-holiday-pay)
 (effective from 1 April 2016), a person’s holiday pay received as a lump sum at the end of their employment is subject to the extra pay withholding rates. A non-resident seasonal worker is not exempt from the extra pay rules. This means a non-resident seasonal worker could be taxed above the 10.5% rate on this lump sum if the total of that person’s annualised income and the holiday pay is $14,001 or more.

To tax non-resident seasonal workers consistently at the NSW tax rate, the Commissioner has decided to temporarily reduce the applicable rate for extra pays received by a non-resident seasonal worker to 10.5%.

### Background

A non-resident seasonal worker is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007:

> Means a non-resident person for whom immigration instructions, certified under section 22 of the Immigration Act 2009, allow them to be employed in New Zealand under—
> 
> 1.  the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) instructions; or
> 2.  the foreign crew of fishing vessels instructions.

These are workers who are in New Zealand on a temporary visa working under the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme, as well as non-resident members of fishing crews. Non-resident seasonal workers are generally in New Zealand for less than a year.

The PAYE rules, as they apply to non-resident seasonal workers, have the following features:

*   The NSW tax rate of 10.5% is intended to apply to all New Zealand-sourced employment income derived as a non-resident seasonal worker.
*   There is specific provision under section 33D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that removes the requirement for a non-resident seasonal worker to file a return at the end of the tax year and they will not receive an income statement from the Commissioner.
*   Tax tax deducted at the NSW tax rate is intended to be full and final (non-resident seasonal workers are not required to file a tax return).

A non-resident seasonal worker is entitled to holiday pay under the Holidays Act 2003 that is either included in the worker’s regular pay, or paid as a lump sum at the end of the worker’s employment.

Following the _Commissioner’s Operational Position on calculating PAYE on holiday pay_, lump sum holiday pay paid out at the end of a person’s employment is treated as an extra pay for income tax purposes and subject to the tax rates for extra pays. Non-resident seasonal workers are not exempt from the extra pay rules.

The applicable withholding rate is determined by adding the extra pay to the annualised value of the PAYE income payments received by the non-resident seasonal worker in the four week period prior to the receipt of the extra pay. If this total is $14,001 or more, the applicable rate would be higher than the 10.5% flat rate that is intended to apply to such taxpayers. This outcome is inconsistent with the intention of the NSW rules.

### Interim operational position

Given the special circumstances, the Commissioner has determined, pursuant to section RD 11(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007, that the NSW tax rate applies to a PAYE income payment that is an extra pay paid to a non-resident seasonal worker who has notified their employer that their tax code is “NSW”.

##### Example

Mike is in New Zealand for 6 months working as a fruit packer for a Recognised Seasonal Employer. He declares his tax code as “NSW”. At the end of Mike’s 6-month contract, he receives his final weekly pay of $610 and his holiday pay entitlement of $1268.80 (based on 8% of Mike’s gross earnings). If Mike’s employer had applied the extra pay rules normally, 17.5% of PAYE would have been deducted from the holiday pay. Instead, this interim operational position allows Mike’s employer to deduct PAYE from the holiday pay, as well as the final weekly pay, at a rate of 10.5%.

This interim operational position is applicable to such PAYE income payments made **between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2018**.

This operational position is put in place temporarily while the Commissioner works to clarify the PAYE legislation in relation to non-resident seasonal workers to give full effect to the intention of Parliament.

We realise that in some cases PAYE at a greater rate than 10.5% may have been deducted from holiday pay lump sums in that period (which was correct as set out in the Commissioner’s previous operational position - _Commissioner’s Operational Position on calculating PAYE on holiday pay_). However, where deductions were made consistent with the Commissioner’s previous operational position, despite the exercise of section RD 11(1) in this circumstance, the Commissioner is unable to refund any difference to non-resident seasonal workers.

Commissioner’s Operational Position - New section HC 27(6) – treatment of a beneficiary as a settlor in certain circumstances
=============================================================================================================================

This operational position addresses new section HC 27(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the position the CIR will take until the section comes into effect on 1 April 2020.

_The purpose of an Operational Position is to outline the legal position that the Commissioner considers is correct for an issue identified and the approach the Commissioner will be taking to applying that position in practice._

1.  The law around whether a beneficiary who leaves distributions in a trust is regarded as a settlor has been unclear, and Inland Revenue has expressed differing views on the issue.
2.  In December 2013 Inland Revenue wrote to NZICA (as it then was) and advised that merely leaving funds available at call in a trust current account did not result in a beneficiary becoming a settlor. The letter relevantly said:

> _Whether a beneficiary of a trust can be deemed a settlor under tax law comes down in the end to a factual enquiry. However, we have concluded that a beneficiary, who simply has money vested in interest or in possession, where such sums remain with the trustee, does not become a settlor under s HC 27(2) Income Tax Act 2007 on that basis. The existence of an amount that is “beneficiary income” in relation to a particular beneficiary, which is (for example) held by the trustee in a current account that contains amounts to be distributed to that beneficiary, does not make that beneficiary a settlor. The fact that the amount could be called for by the beneficiary, and would be provided by the trustee if they did, does not make the beneficiary a settlor on the basis of deciding not to do so._

> …

> _However, a beneficiary who has taken possession and enters into a contract to lend the money back to the trust may be deemed a settlor under s HC 27(2) if he or she:_

> 1.  _Contracts to be paid nil or below market-rate interest, or_
> 2.  _Contracts to receive interest but does not make demand for such interest or defers demand, or_
> 3.  _Does not demand repayment of capital._

3.  This view appears to have been circulated, but not formally published by Inland Revenue.
4.  In the course of preparing a public statement on this matter the issues were reconsidered and ultimately different views were reached, namely:
    *   simply leaving funds on call in a current account (without market interest being paid) would result in a beneficiary becoming a settlor, and
    *   if funds were loaned to a trust at less than market interest rates the beneficiary would also become a settlor.
5.  Given the differing views, and the variety of approaches being adopted by affected taxpayers, a legislative clarification was proposed and ultimately enacted by section 67 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. That section enacts an amendment to section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007. That amendment provides that when a beneficiary of a trust is owed an amount by the trust, the beneficiary does not become a settlor of the trust if —
    1.  the trustee pays to the beneficiary in the income year interest on the amount owing at a rate equal to or greater than the prescribed rate of interest:
    2.  the amount owing at the end of the income year is not more than $25,000.
6.  This amendment comes into force on 1 April 2020, and does not have retrospective effect.
7.  Given the lack of retrospective effect, and the differing communications by Inland Revenue, some taxpayers may be uncertain about which interpretation Inland Revenue will apply until 1 April 2020 (when the new law takes effect).

**Operational position**

8.  So as to provide greater certainty and to minimise compliance costs, the Commissioner has exercised her care and management power, to provide that up to and including 31 March 2020, Inland Revenue will continue to allow taxpayers to rely on the existing public position, as set out in paragraph [2](#02)
     of this Operational Position.

Commissioner’s operational position on calculating PAYE on holiday pay
======================================================================

CIR's 2016 operational position clarifies the appropriate tax treatment of holiday pay when calculating PAYE deductions.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Note |     |
| This item replaces an earlier version of the _Commissioner’s operational position on calculating PAYE on holiday pay_, published on 17 November 2015.  This does not change the Commissioner’s position as outlined in the earlier version, but provides more information and further explains the correct tax treatment of holiday pay under the Income Tax Act 2007. |     |

This item clarifies the appropriate tax treatment of holiday pay when calculating PAYE deductions, as there has been uncertainty in this area. This item also sets out the operational position adopted by the Commissioner in relation to this matter.

The Holidays Act 2003 provides for an employee’s entitlement to paid annual holidays.

Holiday pay can be paid based on an employee’s annual entitlement or 8% of their gross earnings. The Holidays Act 2003 treats holiday pay as salary and wages that are subject to tax deductions (i.e. PAYE). The Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) then determines the correct tax deductions.

For income tax purposes, holiday pay is a “PAYE income payment” which is classified and taxed as either “salary or wages” or “extra pay” – both of these terms are given specific meanings for income tax purposes, which do not necessarily align with the Holidays Act definitions or what would ordinarily be perceived as an “extra pay”. Further, the tax treatment of holiday pay is not dependent on the status of leave (e.g. accrued or entitled, paid in advance of the actual leave, during it or after it) under the Holidays Act or another enactment.

“Salary or wages” is defined in section RD 5 of the ITA as a payment of salary, wages or allowances made to a person in connection with their employment. However, any payment that is classified as an “extra pay” is excluded from the definition.

“Extra pay” is defined in section RD 7 of the ITA. It means a payment that:

*   Is made in connection with a person’s employment; and
*   Is not a payment regularly included in salary or wages payable to the person for a pay period; and
*   Is not overtime pay; and
*   Is made in 1 lump sum or in instalments.

Put simply, a payment that is not normally paid in a pay period will be an extra pay and would be taxed as such and not as salary or wages. Taxing the payment as an extra pay does not always mean that the person is receiving more pay – it merely means that the person is receiving an extra payment for that pay period.

### **The extra pay tax rules help to reduce overpayment of tax**

There is a misconception that taxing a payment as an extra pay means the employee is taxed at a higher rate. In fact, the deduction rates for an extra pay are aligned with the personal income tax brackets and tax rates, and therefore depend on the annual income of the employee.

The extra pay tax rules are intended to ensure that any payments made in addition to an employee’s usual salary or wages for a pay period are taxed at the appropriate tax rate so that the employee is not over or under taxed. As PAYE deductions are calculated based on a person’s annual income, a one-off extra payment, added to the person’s regular salary or wages for that pay period, would otherwise lead to too much tax being deducted, based on the assumption that the employee would receive that extra amount each pay period.

For example: If an employee gets paid $900 per week, PAYE is deducted each week based on an annual salary of $46,800. If the employee were paid four weeks of holiday pay as a lump sum, and the lump sum were simply treated as ordinary salary or wages in that week, then PAYE would be erroneously deducted on the basis of a weekly assumed income of $4,500 (i.e. an annual salary of $234,000). This would result in the over deduction of PAYE in this instance.

### **Is it “salary or wages” or “extra pay”?**

When deducting PAYE on holiday pay, we are concerned with when the holiday pay is paid to the employee, rather than how the holiday pay is calculated. To decide whether a payment of holiday pay is salary or wages or extra pay, regardless of the status of the leave (i.e. accrued but not entitled, accrued and entitled, or anticipated leave) or how the holiday pay has arisen (person takes leave or end of employment), the following general principles apply:

*   **Salary or wages:** Holiday pay that is linked to the work days within the pay period is treated as salary or wages (i.e. where holiday pay is paid in substitution of their normal pay in a pay period; or 8% of a person’s gross earnings is included in the person’s regular pay). This is how the majority of holiday pay is paid to an employee.  
      
    For example, a person who is paid weekly goes on leave for two weeks. That person continues to be paid weekly while they are away, but instead of their normal salary, they are paid 5 days of holiday pay in each pay period. These are salary or wages and not extra pays. The gross amount of holiday pay should be allocated appropriately to the number of days/weeks of leave taken and then the PAYE tables applied.  
     
*   **Extra pay:** A payment of holiday pay that is paid in addition to the regular pay for the pay period is treated as extra pay. These are payments that wouldn’t normally be paid in that pay period.  
      
    For example, when a person takes leave and they request that their holiday pay is paid in a lump sum before their leave starts (i.e. the holiday pay is paid in an earlier pay period and not in the pay period to which the leave relates). For that particular pay period, the person would receive their normal pay plus the lump sum holiday pay. The regular pay should have normal PAYE deducted as usual by applying the PAYE table and the additional lump sum should have PAYE deducted using the deduction method for extra pay.  
      
    The same applies when the remaining balance of a person’s leave entitlement (or 8% of gross earnings where there’s no leave entitlement) is paid as a lump sum in the person’s final pay at the end of their employment (i.e. the final pay consists of the person’s normal pay and an extra lump sum payment). The person’s normal pay should have normal PAYE deducted and the extra lump sum payment should have PAYE deducted using the deduction method for extra pay.

A different PAYE deduction method is required for an extra pay payment. [Find out more information on how to calculate the PAYE deduction from an extra pay](/Internet/IRD/payroll-employers/make-deductions/staff-benefits/bonuses/emp-ded-bonus-lump-sum.html)
.

### **Commissioner’s Operational position**

It is the Commissioner’s position that the above treatments will apply prospectively from **1 April 2016**. This is due to the uncertainty in the treatment of holiday pay in the past caused by some incorrect material on Inland Revenue’s website. This may have caused some employers to over or under deduct PAYE from an employee’s holiday pay.

Further, the Commissioner has decided to not apply resources to correcting the incorrect deductions made by an employer prior to 1 April 2016. This is because any incorrect deductions would have been small for each employee and should, in any event, be reflected in the employee’s overall annual tax liability.

However, those employees who have been adversely affected by an incorrect amount of PAYE being deducted from their holiday pay prior to 1 April 2016 can have their taxes corrected by requesting a personal tax summary from us, and any over deductions refunded, in the normal manner.

Inland Revenue is in the process of updating the content of its website, including the relevant calculators and the PAYE deduction tables, to reflect the above positions, with application from 1 April 2016. Employers should also ensure that the correct PAYE deductions are made from holiday pay from this date onwards.

For completeness, this operational position does not affect the Commissioner’s position on the treatment of “cashed up” annual leave, which should continue to be treated as an “extra pay”.

### **Submissions received on Government discussion document**

Submissions on alternative methods of calculating PAYE on holiday pay have been received as part of the consultation process for the Government discussion document _Making tax simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST_. The issue of whether there are other or better means of deducting tax on holiday pay will be considered as part of this wider Government policy work.

Commissioner’s operational position on foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pensions
============================================================================================================

CIR's operational position on QB 14/12: Income tax - foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pensions.

_The purpose of this item is to inform taxpayers of the operational position being adopted by the Commissioner in relation to this matter._

The Commissioner has released [QB 14/12 Income tax - foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pensions](/questions-we-ve-been-asked/2014/qb-1412-income-tax-foreign-tax-credits-for-amounts-withheld-from-united-kingdom-pensions)
.

This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) confirms Inland Revenue's long-standing view that, in relation to a United Kingdom pension received by a New Zealand tax resident, New Zealand has the sole taxing rights under the double tax agreement with the United Kingdom. This means that New Zealand tax residents cannot claim a foreign tax credit in New Zealand for any amounts withheld by their United Kingdom pension provider from their United Kingdom pension and that pension must be returned as income in New Zealand.

If you have previously claimed a tax credit for any tax withheld on your United Kingdom pension, we suggest you discuss the matter with your tax advisor, or us, and consider making a voluntary disclosure. If you are a tax resident of New Zealand and you receive (or about to receive) United Kingdom pension payments, to make sure you are not taxed further in the United Kingdom and to obtain a refund of amounts withheld in the United Kingdom in past years you should:

1.  Complete the "[Application for relief at source from United Kingdom income tax and claim to repayment of United Kingdom income tax form New Zealand - Individual](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cnr/nz_indiv.pdf)
    " which is on the HM Revenue & Customs (HRMC) website. You can either print the form directly from the website or save it to your computer as a PDF, then print it.
2.  Send us your completed form and we will process and send the form to HMRC. They will issue a directive to your pension provider to stop the deductions in their system. The form also enables you to claim back amounts incorrectly withheld in the United Kingdom. The address to send your completed form is:  
      
    Inland Revenue  
    PO Box 39010  
    Wellington Mail Centre  
    Lower Hutt 5045  
      
    You can also contact us by Secure mail with the following details:  
      
    **Subject:** Foreign Pension  
    **Account:** All other  
    **Category:** All other

For any general enquires of a general nature you can email [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c684e5d524f5d5f485553525d5012755248594e525d485553525d507c554e58125b534a48125246)
 (Do not send any taxpayer or customer information to this email address).

The HRMC "Form New Zealand - Individual" asks at Part B:

#### Question 2:

"On what date did you become resident in New Zealand?"

#### Question 3:

"From what date have you paid, or will you pay, tax in New Zealand on the income that you include in this claim? (This may differ from the date you have given in answer to question 2.)

If you do not have to pay tax in New Zealand on this income please give the reason (s) on a separate sheet."

All taxpayers (to which this form applies) must fill in Question 3 with the date you have paid or will pay tax in New Zealand on income included in this claim. For a transitional resident the pension is generally only taxable from the date when your transitional residency ends (or has ended) which is of course later than the date you become resident, so you need to enter that later date as the answer for this question. The later date will have no impact on the requirement on the United Kingdom to provide relief from taxation.

Additionally, you will need to give details of your transitional residency stating the reason you won't be paying tax on a separate sheet and attach it to the form. For example:

*   that you arrived in New Zealand on (day, month, year) (same date as question 2) and are eligible for a "temporary tax exemption on foreign income" for new migrants and returning New Zealanders (often referred to as transitional residency), and
*   that you are not required to pay tax on foreign income in New Zealand for 4 calendar years, (up to 49 months) for the dates from (day, month, year) (same date as question 2) to (day, month, year) (same date as question 3).

If you are in doubt please contact us at the above address before you send us any application for double taxation relief. Also, if as a result of incorrectly filling in the HMRC form you have been treated as electing out of the transitional residence rules you should contact us.

If you have claimed a foreign tax credit in prior tax returns, you should ensure going forward that you no longer claim any foreign tax credits from your United Kingdom pension income in your New Zealand tax return. Taxpayers making pre-audit voluntary disclosures will not be subject to shortfall penalties.

If you make a voluntary disclosure because you have claimed these tax credits in the past you will only be required to make a disclosure to amend your returns to remove the foreign tax credit in relation to the 2013 (1 April 2012 - 31 March 2013) and/or 2014 (1 April 2013 - 31 March 2014) tax years.

We are aware that the HMRC will provide refunds for periods earlier than the 2013 tax year if applicable (provided it is not in respect of tax periods greater than 6 years old). The concessionary treatment for voluntary disclosures outlined in this item only applies if the taxpayer has not received refunds from HMRC in respect of periods earlier than the 2013 tax year.

If an earlier refund has been or is going to be obtained by HMRC, the Commissioner will assess the taxpayer for those earlier periods, as opposed to simply the 2013 year onwards. Taxpayers who receive (or have received) earlier period refunds in this way must advise the Commissioner accordingly when they are received. Although this will result in reassessments for those earlier periods no penalties or use of money interest will be imposed in relation to those earlier periods.

The due date for payment of the increased liability for New Zealand tax will be deferred to allow you to receive the refund from the United Kingdom. This means that we will not be expecting any money from you until you have received the refund from the United Kingdom. No late payment penalties will be applied on your New Zealand tax liability provided you pay the increased amount of tax on or before the new due date (some use of money interest may apply for the 2013 tax year onwards).

Foreign exchange differences (and use of money interest if applicable) may result in you having to pay additional amounts to Inland Revenue to meet your tax liability which is over and above the refund received from HMRC.

In a limited number of cases, the pension may not have been taxed in either the United Kingdom or New Zealand. In those cases the concessionary approach outlined in this item does not apply and we suggest that taxpayers in that situation who wish to make a voluntary disclosure contact us to discuss further.

If interest is charged for the 2013 tax year onwards it is possible to apply in writing for a remission of any use of money interest imposed if you consider that any of the grounds in Standard Practice Statement _SPS 05/10 - Remission of penalties and interest_ are satisfied, for instance if you consider that you have relied on incorrect advice from Inland Revenue in taking your tax position.

If you have difficulty paying any of the New Zealand tax outstanding (over and above the refund from the United Kingdom) you should contact us. It may be possible to enter into an installment arrangement) or apply for relief from the outstanding tax if recovery would place you in hardship.

For further information see Standard Practice Statement _SPS 11/01 Installment arrangements for payment of tax_ or Standard Practice Statement _SPS 06/02 Writing off outstanding tax_.

Common fringe benefit tax mistakes
==================================

We see a range of common mistakes made when calculating fringe benefit tax (FBT). Some employers may not know what to include and exclude as fringe benefits. 

You should review the rules and rates occasionally to make sure you are doing all of the following:

*   calculating FBT correctly
*   applying any exemptions your business is eligible for
*   using the best rate to suit your circumstances
*   paying the right amount.

Show all

Working out the taxable value of a fringe benefit

Different formulas and calculations are needed to determine the taxable value of a benefit. How your FBT is calculated depends on the types of benefits you provide and whether any exemptions apply.

Some errors in working out the taxable value include:

*   using the incorrect value to calculate motor vehicle value (such as whether to use cost price or tax book value and when to use the GST inclusive value or exclusive value)
*   using the incorrect information to work out the days that vehicles are available for private use
*   incorrect applications of the employee's contribution.

For help working out cost price or tax book value and when to use the GST inclusive value or exclusive values you can refer to the Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409.

Motor vehicle FBT and exemptions

There are common misconceptions about when vehicles are exempt from FBT. Especially when the vehicle is a double cab ute. It is important to understand the criteria for a work-related vehicle to be exempt from FBT. 

Utes may be considered work-related as they are dual purpose vehicles, however this does not mean they are automatically exempt from FBT. 

Find out more about FBT on motor vehicles:

[Employer provided motor vehicles for private use](/employing-staff/deductions-from-other-payments/fringe-benefit-tax/types-of-fringe-benefits/employer-provided-motor-vehicles-for-private-use)

GST on fringe benefit tax

GST needs to be accounted for on any benefits provided to employees. This is calculated based on the GST content of the taxable benefit less any GST exempt items.

Some errors include:

*   incorrectly accounting for GST on benefits that are exempt such as loans to employees
*   GST being calculated incorrectly based on the GST content of the FBT value, instead of the taxable benefit value.

Impacts of employee contributions to fringe benefits

If an employee makes any payment in return for having a fringe benefit, the payment is deducted when working out the taxable value of the benefit. 

When the employee's contributions are over or understated it results in the fringe benefit being given an incorrect value.

Fringe benefits for shareholder-employees

If you provide fringe benefits to shareholder-employees these may be treated differently for FBT purposes. Ensure you check which FBT rules apply to the benefits you are making available to shareholder-employees.

May 2018 CRS - new account processes 1 Common Reporting Standard - process for obtaining valid self- certifications for all new accounts Executive summary In broad terms, the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) requires that reporting New Zealand financial institutions (reporting NZFIs) always obtain valid self-certifications for new accounts (ie, those accounts opened on or after 1 July 2017). A Reporting NZFI is able to rely on such self-certifications, unless they know or have reason to know that they are incorrect or unreliable. The OECD has updated its Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) 22 (Timing of self-certifications), regarding CRS new account on-boarding processes, and makes it clear that 1 : • A reporting NZFI must adopt a "day one" process for obtaining new account self-certifications (unless this is not possible – for example, when an insurance contract is transferred). • A reporting NZFI can use a "day two" process for validating self-certifications for new accounts if a "back office" process is adopted for such validation. However, this does not change the fact that correct 2 and valid self-certifications must always be obtained for all new accounts. • A reporting NZFI should ensure that they have obtained and validated such self-certifications in time to be able to meet their CRS due diligence and reporting obligations (i.e. within a 90 day period, and no later than the deadline for reporting in which the account was opened (i.e. 30 June of the relevant year) 3 . • A reporting NZFI should adopt "strong measures" if they adopt a "day two" process for validating a self- certification. If it has not been able to obtain and validate the self-certification within the abovementioned timeframes (i.e. within a 90 day period, and no later than 30 June of the relevant year), it must: – not complete its account opening procedures, and/or – freeze or close the account. If an account is frozen, it would then be able to be reactivated if a valid self- certification is subsequently obtained. (The OECD has confirmed that "freezing", in this context, means no deposits into the account and no withdrawals from the account.) As the general principle is that valid self-certifications must always be obtained for all new accounts, the OECD considers that these measures do not include merely adopting an indicia search (and reporting on the basis of whether or not there are any foreign indicia). Using an indicia search regarding new accounts that have not been validated in time would merely reduce new account due diligence to a similar standard as pre- existing account due diligence (c.f. page 211 of the CRS Commentary, which requires a higher standard for new account due diligence). • A reporting NZFI and/or account holder may be subject to penalties if correct and valid self-certifications are not obtained (or provided) for new accounts on a timely basis. For example, penalties may be imposed if a reporting NZFI fails to take reasonable steps to obtain a valid self-certification, 4 or if an account holder fails to provide such a self-certification (or provides incorrect or incomplete information). 5 However, a reporting NZFI that adopts the strong measures outlined above would not be subject to such a penalty (assuming that they have otherwise taken reasonable steps in complying with their CRS obligations). 1 See FAQ 22 (at the web link: www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/ CRS-related-FAQs.pdf) titled "Timing of self-certifications". FAQ 22 is reproduced in the Appendix to this guidance. 2 This means that (as a first step) all of the required fields in the self-certification must be completed. 3 June 2018 for the first CRS period. 4 See section 142H(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (for failure to obtain a self-certification) and section 142H(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (for failure to take reasonable care to meet CRS due diligence and reporting obligations). 5 See section 142I(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. CRS - new account processes 2 1. Background 1.1 For CRS purposes, reporting NZFIs are required to obtain valid self-certifications from account holders upon account opening for all new accounts (ie, accounts opened on or after 1 July 2017). This requirement also covers controlling persons (if the account holder is a passive non-financial entity (passive NFE). 1.2 There are two key elements here: • Obtaining a self-certification for such accounts, and • Validating (confirming the reasonableness of) the self-certification. 2. Requirement to always obtain a valid self-certification for a new account 2.1 The CRS commentary is clear that reporting NZFIs need to have strong measures and robust processes in place to ensure that valid self-certifications are always obtained for such new accounts (see paragraph 18 on page 211 of the CRS commentary). "Day one" account opening process 2.2 The OECD has confirmed in a frequently asked question (FAQ 22) on its CRS automatic exchange portal 6 that reporting NZFIs must generally obtain a complete self-certification on "day one" of the account opening process. 7 2.3 The OECD has also approved an update of FAQ 22 (Timing of self-certifications) see Appendix, which advises that: • the general rule is that self-certifications need to be both obtained and validated on "day one" of the account opening process, and • the limited circumstances when self-certifications can be obtained and validated as part of a "day two" process (viz. within 90 days, and no later than the deadline for CRS reporting for the period in which the account was opened). We elaborate on these circumstances below. 2.4 Reporting NZFIs are required to obtain, as part of this "day one" self-certification process, all of the required identity information such as the account holder's (and, if the account holder is a passive NFE, controlling person's): • name • address • date of birth • jurisdiction(s) of tax residence, and • foreign taxpayer identification number(s) (TINs), or equivalent. 2.5 Reporting NZFIs should not materially progress the account opening process until they have obtained a complete self-certification (including all of this information). For example, reporting NZFIs should not allow deposits into the account until they have obtained a complete self-certification. Confirming the "reasonableness" (validity) of a self-certification 2.6 Reporting NZFIs also need to confirm the "reasonableness" (or validity) of such completed self- certifications. There are two options that apply here: • "Day one" "reasonableness" process (default rule): the reporting NZFI may confirm the "reasonableness" (validity) of such self-certifications as part of a "day one" process (ie, confirming the validity of a self-certification before materially progressing the account opening process – e.g. before allowing deposits into the account), or • "Day two" "reasonableness" process (option): alternatively, the reporting NZFI can choose to adopt a "day two" process for confirming the "reasonableness" of this self-certification if it uses a "back office" process to carry out these procedures. 6 See FAQ 22 (at the web link: www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/ CRS-related-FAQs.pdf) titled "Timing of self-certifications". 7 The only exception to this "day one" rule is if it is not possible for the reporting NZFI to obtain a self-certification on "day one", which will be very rare (including, for example, the transferring of an insurance contract). In such exceptional circumstances, the reporting NZFI needs to both obtain and validate the self-certification as part of a "day two" process (viz. within 90 days and no later than the deadline for CRS reporting). CRS - new account processes 3 However, a Reporting NZFI should only adopt a "day two" "reasonableness" process if they have the functionality to freeze or close those accounts where they are unable to confirm the reasonableness of such self-certifications, within 90 days and no later than the deadline for reporting. This is because reporting NZFIs have obligations to take reasonable care when carrying out their CRS due diligence obligations. They also have specific obligations to always obtain valid self-certifications for new accounts. 2.7 The ability for a reporting NZFI to use this "day two" validation process is subject to a condition that the reporting NZFI must have obtained a valid self-certification within 90 days – and no later than the deadline for reporting (i.e. 30 June of the relevant year). 8 2.8 The OECD has confirmed that the 90 day period available to reporting NZFIs under the "day two" validation process is subject to the proviso that it does not result in the reporting of the new account at a later date than would otherwise be required under the "day one" process. 2.9 In other words, the OECD considers that the "day two" validation process does not change the overarching requirement that reporting NZFIs must always obtain a valid self-certification for new accounts (see page 211 of the CRS commentary) in the period when the account is opened. The "day two" validation process is an operational concession and the requirement that a NZFI must complete the validation within 90 days and no later than the deadline for reporting that account, means that a NZFI adopting this concession is placed in the same position or no more favourable position for reporting purpose as if they had applied a "day one" validation (the default rule). 3. Consequences if a valid self-certification is not obtained within 90 days of account opening of a new account 3.1 The OECD has also confirmed that, as a result of this requirement, reporting NZFIs need to have strong measures in place that provide for consequences if a valid self-certification is not obtained within 90 days of account opening (and by 30 June of the relevant year). 9 3.2 The OECD has confirmed that the following can be examples of sufficiently strong measures (after the 90 day period), involving the reporting NZFI: • not completing their account opening procedures, if they are unable to receive a valid self- certification • freeze the account, 10 until 11 they have received a valid self-certification, or • closing the account, if they do not receive a valid self-certification. Reporting NZFIs are required to take these strong measures because: • they have a legal obligation to always obtain valid self-certifications for new accounts and may be subject to penalties if they fail to do so 12 • they are subject to penalties for lack of reasonable care if they do not take reasonable steps 13 to comply with their CRS obligations (including not taking such "strong measures" to help ensure that they are able to obtain valid self-certifications for new accounts), and • reporting NZFIs are not able to rely on self-certifications that are incorrect or unreliable. Therefore, it is important that reporting NZFIs take these strong measures in these circumstances, so they are in a position to be able to comply with their legal obligations. 3.3 These strong measures may also be supplemented by penalties being imposed on reporting NZFIs that do not take appropriate and reasonable measures to obtain a valid self-certification and/or on account holders (or controlling persons) that fail to provide a correct and valid self-certification on a timely basis. A reporting NZFI that adopts the strong measures outlined above would not be subject to such a penalty (assuming that they have otherwise taken reasonable steps to comply with their CRS obligations). 8 30 June 2018 for the first CRS period. 9 30 June 2018 for the first CRS period 10 The OECD has confirmed that "freezing", in this context, means no deposits into the account and no withdrawals from the account. 11 A reporting NZFI that chooses to take the serious measure of "freezing" an account should also consider when it may be reasonable for them to "close" any such account that has been frozen. Inland Revenue will provide further guidance on this point – ie, about our expectations of the timing for when frozen accounts will need to be closed. 12 See section 142H(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 13 See section 142H(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. CRS - new account processes 4 3.4 Reporting NZFIs are also required to keep a record of any instances where they have failed to obtain valid self-certifications. 3.5 A Reporting NZFI may consider that, in light of the above requirements, it is easier for them to make the opening of the account contingent or conditional on receiving a valid self-certification (ie, the default rule of adopting a "day one" approach to confirming the reasonableness/validity of a self- certification, as opposed to adopting a "day two" approach). Furthermore, as noted above, a reporting NZFI should only adopt a "day two" "reasonableness/validation" process if they have the functionality to freeze or close accounts within 90 days and no later than the deadline for reporting. 3.6 Lastly, the OECD has confirmed that reporting for new accounts (where a valid self-certification has not been obtained) on the basis of an indicia search, or in accordance with the undocumented account procedures, are not sufficiently strong measures to ensure that valid self-certifications are always obtained for new accounts. Appendix The OECD has recently approved an update to FAQ Question 22 (in December 2017), which is published on their Automatic Exchange Portal, and states as follows: \[Update to FAQ 22\] – With respect to New Individual and Entity Accounts the Standard provides that the Reporting Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification upon account opening. In such cases, is it expected that Reporting Financial Institutions can only open the account once a valid self-certification is received? Answer: The Standard provides that a Reporting Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification upon account opening (Sections IV(A) and V(D)(2)). Where a self-certification is obtained at account opening but validation of the self-certification cannot be completed because it is a 'day two' process undertaken by a back-office function, the self-certification should be validated within a period of 90 days. There are a limited number of instances, where due to the specificities of a business sector it is not possible to obtain a self-certification on 'day one' of the account opening process, for example where an insurance contract has been assigned from one person to another or in the case where an investor acquires shares in an investment trust on the secondary market. In such circumstances, the self-certification should be both obtained and validated as quickly as feasible, and in any case within a period of 90 days. Given that obtaining a self-certification for New Accounts is a critical aspect of ensuring that the CRS is effective, it is expected that jurisdictions have strong measures in place to ensure that valid self-certifications are always obtained for New Accounts. What will constitute a "strong measure" in the above exceptional instances may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and should be evaluated in light of the actual results of the measure. The crucial test for determining what measure can qualify as "strong measures" is whether the measures have a strong enough impact on Account Holders and/or Financial Institutions to effectively ensure that self-certifications are obtained and validated in accordance with the rules set out in the CRS. In that light, for instance, measures that foresee the closure or freezing of the account after the expiry of 90 days or the application of very elevated penalties on Financial Institutions and/or Account Holders, all of which can constitute "strong measures". In all cases, Reporting Financial Institutions shall ensure that they have obtained and validated the self- certification in time to be able to meet their due diligence and reporting obligations with respect to the reporting period during which the account was opened.

The reader should refer to Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (in particular, sections 185N- 185R) for further detail about the nature of their due diligence and reporting obligations and various options that they have available to them when carrying out such obligations. 1 As approved by the OECD on 15 July 2014.

It is accessible on the New Zealand legislation website at http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2017/0003/latest/DLM6912415.html. 3 Specific modifications made by the Tax Administration Act 1994 are identified in the text with footnotes. However, modifications resulting generally from substituting text from Annex 5 of the CRS publication (in accordance with Item 2, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) were too numerous to call out in the text, and therefore are not specifically identified. Note that several typographical errors appearing in Annex 5 of the CRS publication have been rectified in this New Zealand-specific version of the CRS. Only one of these is significant (an incorrect paragraph reference) and this is identified by a footnote. The others are minor and are not specifically identified. Also note that the term “preexisting” (i.e. without a hyphen) as it appears in the CRS has been replaced by “pre-existing” (i.e. with a hyphen) in this New Zealand-specific version.

This is known as the “wider approach to reporting”. 5 IR CLARIFICATION: The CRS requirement to also report the place of birth is omitted in this New Zealand- specific version. This is because the exception set out in paragraph D of Section I of the CRS currently applies in New Zealand. 6 IR CLARIFICATION: See footnote 5. 7 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. 8 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. 9 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. 10 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. 11 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation.

However, a Reporting Financial Institution is required to use reasonable efforts to obtain the TIN(s) and date of birth with respect to Pre-existing Accounts by the end of the second calendar year following the year in which such Accounts were identified as Reportable Accounts. D. Notwithstanding subparagraph A(1), the TIN is not required to be reported if (i) a TIN is not issued by the relevant Reportable Jurisdiction or (ii) the domestic law of the relevant Reportable Jurisdiction does not require the collection of the TIN issued by such Reportable Jurisdiction. E. Notwithstanding subparagraph A(1), the place of birth is not required to be reported unless the Reporting Financial Institution is otherwise required 13 to obtain and report it under domestic law and it is available in the electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution. F. ... 14 Section II: General Due Diligence Requirements A. An account is treated as a Reportable Account beginning as of the date it is identified as such pursuant to the due diligence procedures in Sections II through VII and, unless otherwise provided, information with respect to a Reportable Account must be reported annually in the year 15 following 16 the year to which the information relates. B. A Reporting Financial Institution, which pursuant to the procedures described in Sections II through VII, identifies any account as a Foreign Account 17 that is not a Reportable Account at the time the due diligence is performed, may rely on the outcome of such procedures to comply with future reporting obligations. C. The balance or value of an account is determined as of the last day of the year 18 or other appropriate reporting period. D. Where a balance or value threshold is to be determined as of the last day of a year, 19 the relevant balance or value must be determined as of the last day of the reporting period that ends with or within that year. 20 E. Each Jurisdiction may allow Reporting Financial Institutions to use service providers to fulfil the 12 IR CLARIFICATION: Item 2, Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Tax Administration Act 1994, provides that Annex 5 of the CRS applies. Annex 5 inserts the words " or with respect to each Financial Account that is opened prior to becoming a Reportable Account" at this point in the text. However, item 3, Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that these words are to be disregarded. 13 IR CLARIFICATION: As noted in footnote 5, there is currently no New Zealand requirement for a Reporting Financial Institution to report the place of birth. 14 IR CLARIFICATION: Item 4, Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Tax Administration Act 1994, provides that paragraph F is to be disregarded. 15 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. 16 IR CLARIFICATION: This is subject to section 185N(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which provides that “immediate” reporting can be required in circumstances relating to the three month “grace period” that effectively applies for completing due diligence under item 6, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 17 IR CLARIFICATION: The term “Foreign Account” is not used (or defined) in the CRS. It is unique to Annex 5 of the OECD’s CRS publication. Item 2. Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Tax Administration Act 1994, provides that Annex 5 applies. The term “Foreign Account” is not explained in Annex 5, but from context means any account held or (if applicable) controlled by a non-resident. 18 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. 19 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. 20 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation.

Each Jurisdiction may allow Reporting Financial Institutions to apply the due diligence procedures for New Accounts to Pre-existing Accounts, and the due diligence procedures for High Value Accounts to Lower Value Accounts. Where a Jurisdiction allows New Account due diligence procedures to be used for Pre-existing Accounts, the rules otherwise applicable to Pre-existing Accounts continue to apply. 22 Section III: Due Diligence for Pre-existing Individual Accounts The following procedures apply with respect to Pre-existing Individual Accounts. A. Accounts Not Required to be Reviewed, Identified, or Reported. A Pre-existing Individual Account that is a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract is not required to be reviewed, identified or reported, provided the Reporting Financial Institution is effectively prevented by law from selling such Contract to residents of a Reportable Jurisdiction. B. Lower Value Accounts. The following procedures apply with respect to Lower Value Accounts. 1. Residence Address. If the Reporting Financial Institution has in its records a current residence address for the individual Account Holder based on Documentary Evidence, the Reporting Financial Institution may treat the individual Account Holder as being a resident for tax purposes of the jurisdiction in which the address is located for purposes of determining whether such individual Account Holder is a Reportable Person. 2. Electronic Record Search. If the Reporting Financial Institution does not rely on a current residence address for the individual Account Holder based on Documentary Evidence as set forth in subparagraph B(1), the Reporting Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution for any of the following indicia and apply subparagraphs B(3) through (6): a) identification of the Account Holder as a resident of a Foreign Jurisdiction 23 ; b) current mailing or residence address (including a post office box) in a Foreign Jurisdiction; c) one or more telephone numbers in a Foreign Jurisdiction and no telephone number in the jurisdiction of the Reporting Financial Institution; d) standing instructions (other than with respect to a Depository Account) to transfer funds to an account maintained in a Foreign Jurisdiction; e) currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with an address in a Foreign Jurisdiction; or f) a “hold mail” instruction or “in-care-of” address in a Foreign Jurisdiction if the Reporting Financial Institution does not have any other address on file for the Account Holder. 3. If none of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2) are discovered in the electronic search, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, or the account becomes a High Value Account. 4. If any of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2)(a) through (e) are discovered in the electronic search, or if there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated 21 IR CLARIFICATION: Pursuant to section 185O(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a Reporting Financial Institution is able to apply this option. 22 IR CLARIFICATION: Pursuant to section 185O(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a Reporting Financial Institution is able to apply these options. 23 IR CLARIFICATION: The term “Foreign Jurisdiction” is not used (or defined) in the CRS. It is unique to Annex 5 of the OECD’s CRS publication. Item 2, Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Tax Administration Act 1994, provides that Annex 5 applies. Paragraph 2 of the Introduction to Annex 5 of the CRS states that “A Foreign Jurisdiction would be defined as any Jurisdiction other than the Jurisdiction of the Reporting Financial Institution”. Therefore, it would cover any jurisdiction other than New Zealand. Page 5 of 23 IN CONFIDENCE with the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the Account Holder as a resident for tax purposes of each Foreign Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified, unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account. 5. If a “hold mail” instruction or “in-care-of” address is discovered in the electronic search and no other address and none of the other indicia listed in subparagraph B(2)(a) through (e) are identified for the Account Holder, the Reporting Financial Institution must, in the order most appropriate to the circumstances, apply the paper record search described in subparagraph C(2), or seek to obtain from the Account Holder a self-certification or Documentary Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of such Account Holder. If the paper search fails to establish an indicium and the attempt to obtain the self-certification or Documentary Evidence is not successful, the Reporting Financial Institution must report the account as an undocumented account. 6. Notwithstanding a finding of indicia under subparagraph B(2), a Reporting Financial Institution is not required to treat an Account Holder as a resident of a Foreign Jurisdiction if: a) the Account Holder information contains a current mailing or residence address in the Foreign Jurisdiction, one or more telephone numbers in the Foreign Jurisdiction (and no telephone number in the jurisdiction of the Reporting Financial Institution) or standing instructions (with respect to Financial Accounts other than Depository Accounts) to transfer funds to an account maintained in a Foreign Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: i) a self-certification from the Account Holder of the jurisdiction(s) of residence of such Account Holder that does not include such Foreign Jurisdiction; and ii) Documentary Evidence establishing the Account Holder’s residence for tax purposes other than such Foreign Jurisdiction. b) the Account Holder information contains a currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with an address in a Foreign Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: i) a self-certification from the Account Holder of the jurisdiction(s) of residence of such Account Holder that does not include such Foreign Jurisdiction; or ii) Documentary Evidence establishing the Account Holder’s residence for tax purposes other than Foreign Jurisdiction. C. Enhanced Review Procedures for High Value Accounts. The following enhanced review procedures apply with respect to High Value Accounts. 1. Electronic Record Search. With respect to High Value Accounts, the Reporting Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution for any of the indicia described in subparagraph B(2). 2. Paper Record Search. If the Reporting Financial Institution’s electronically searchable databases include fields for, and capture all of the information described in, subparagraph C(3), then a further paper record search is not required. If the electronic databases do not capture all of this information, then with respect to a High Value Account, the Reporting Financial Institution must also review the current customer master file and, to the extent not contained in the current customer master file, the following documents associated with the account and obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution within the last five years for any of the indicia described in subparagraph B(2): a) the most recent Documentary Evidence collected with respect to the account; b) the most recent account opening contract or documentation; c) the most recent documentation obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures or for other regulatory purposes; d) any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and e) any standing instructions (other than with respect to a Depository Account) to transfer funds Page 6 of 23 IN CONFIDENCE currently in effect. 3. Exception To The Extent Databases Contain Sufficient Information. A Reporting Financial Institution is not required to perform the paper record search described in subparagraph C(2) to the extent the Reporting Financial Institution’s electronically searchable information includes the following: a) the Account Holder’s residence status; b) the Account Holder’s residence address and mailing address currently on file with the Reporting Financial Institution; c) the Account Holder’s telephone number(s) currently on file, if any, with the Reporting Financial Institution; d) in the case of Financial Accounts other than Depository Accounts, whether there are standing instructions to transfer funds in the account to another account (including an account at another branch of the Reporting Financial Institution or another Financial Institution); e) whether there is a current “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” instruction for the Account Holder; and f) whether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account. 4. Relationship Manager Inquiry for Actual Knowledge. In addition to the electronic and paper record searches described above, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat as a Reportable Account any High Value Account assigned to a relationship manager (including any Financial Accounts aggregated with that High Value Account) if the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the Account Holder is a Reportable Person. 5. Effect of Finding Indicia. a) If none of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2) are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, and the account is not identified as held by a resident for tax purposes in a Foreign Jurisdiction in subparagraph C(4), then further action is not required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account. b) If any of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2)(a) through (e) are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, or if there is a subsequent change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the Account Holder as a resident for tax purposes of each Foreign Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account. c) If a “hold mail” instruction or “in-care-of” address is discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, and no other address and none of the other indicia listed in subparagraph B(2)(a) through (e) are identified for the Account Holder, the Reporting Financial Institution must obtain from such Account Holder a self-certification or Documentary Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder. If the Reporting Financial Institution cannot obtain such self-certification or Documentary Evidence, it must report the account as an undocumented account. 6. If a Pre-existing Individual Account is not a High Value Account as of 30 June 2017 24 , but becomes a High Value Account as of the last day of a subsequent year 25 , the Reporting Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph C with respect to such account within the calendar year following the year in which the account becomes a High Value Account. If based on this review such account is identified as a Reportable Account, the Reporting 24 IR CLARIFICATION: This date is inserted pursuant to Item 5, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 25 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. Page 7 of 23 IN CONFIDENCE Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to the year in which it is identified as a Reportable Account and subsequent years on an annual basis, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Reportable Person. 7. Once a Reporting Financial Institution applies the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph C to a High Value Account, the Reporting Financial Institution is not required to re-apply such procedures, other than the relationship manager inquiry described in subparagraph C(4), to the same High Value Account in any subsequent year unless the account is undocumented where the Reporting Financial Institution should re-apply them annually until such account ceases to be undocumented. 8. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a High Value Account that results in one or more indicia described in subparagraph B(2) being associated with the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account with respect to each Foreign Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account. 9. A Reporting Financial Institution must implement procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances of an account. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the Account Holder has a new mailing address in a Foreign Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution is required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and, if it elects to apply subparagraph B(6), is required to obtain the appropriate documentation from the Account Holder. D. Review of Pre-existing Individual Accounts must be completed, in the case of High Value Accounts, by 30 June 2018, and in the case of Lower Value Accounts, by 30 June 2019. 26 Section IV: Due Diligence for New Individual Accounts The following procedures apply with respect to New Individual Accounts. A. with respect to New Individual Accounts, upon account opening, a Reporting Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows the Reporting Financial Institution to determine the Account Holder’s residence(s) for tax purposes and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. B. If the self-certification establishes that the Account Holder is resident for tax purposes in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account and the self-certification must also include the Account Holder’s TIN with respect to such Reportable Jurisdiction (subject to paragraph D of Section I) and date of birth. 27 C. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a New Individual Account that causes the Reporting Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the original self-certification is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution cannot rely on the original self-certification and must obtain a valid self-certification that establishes the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder. Section V: Due Diligence for Pre-existing Entity Accounts The following procedures apply with respect to Pre-existing Entity Accounts. A. Entity Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified or Reported. Unless the Reporting Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Pre-existing Entity Accounts or, 26 IR CLARIFICATION: These dates are inserted pursuant to Item 6, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 27 IR CLARIFICATION: Sections 185N(3) and 185N(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 require that a Reporting Financial Institution also obtain such TIN(s) (subject to paragraph D of Section I) and date of birth information if the Account Holder is identified as being resident in a foreign jurisdiction other than a Reportable Jurisdiction and who would be a Reportable Person if the foreign jurisdiction were a Reportable Jurisdiction. Page 8 of 23 IN CONFIDENCE separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, a Pre-existing Entity Account with an aggregate account balance or value that does not exceed USD 250 000 as of 30 June 2017 28 , is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as a Reportable Account until the aggregate account balance or value exceeds USD 250 000 as of the last day of any subsequent year 29 . B. Entity Accounts Subject to Review. A Pre-existing Entity Account that has an aggregate account balance or value that exceeds USD 250 000 as of 30 June 2017 30 , and a Pre-existing Entity Account that does not exceed USD 250 000 as of 30 June 2017 31 but the aggregate account balance or value of which exceeds USD 250 000 as of the last day of any subsequent year 32 , must be reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph C 33 . C. Review Procedures for Identifying Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting may be Required. For Pre-existing Entity Accounts described in paragraph B, a Reporting Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures: 1. Determine the Residence of the Entity. a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine the Account Holder’s residence. For this purpose, information indicating the Account Holder’s residence includes a place of incorporation or organisation, or an address in a Foreign Jurisdiction. b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is a Reportable Person, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account unless it obtains a self- certification from the Account Holder, or reasonably determines based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Reportable Person. 2. Determine the Residence of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE. With respect to an Account Holder of a Pre-existing Entity Account (including an Entity that is a Reportable Person), the Reporting Financial Institution must identify whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons and determine the residence of such Controlling Persons. If any of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, then the account is treated as a Reportable Account. In making these determinations the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraphs C(2)(a) through (c) in the order most appropriate under the circumstances. a) Determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE. For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE, the Reporting Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification from the Account Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFE or a Financial Institution other than an Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) of Section VIII that is not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution. b) Determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder. For the purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. 28 IR CLARIFICATION: This date is inserted pursuant to Item 7, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 29 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. 30 IR CLARIFICATION: This date is inserted pursuant to Item 8, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 31 IR CLARIFICATION: This date is inserted pursuant to Item 8, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 32 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. 33 IR CLARIFICATION: Annex 5 of the CRS publication gives this paragraph reference as D. However, this is incorrect, and the reference should be to paragraph C. In Annex 5, the paragraphs were renumbered, but the consequential adjustment to this paragraph reference appears to have been overlooked. Page 9 of 23 IN CONFIDENCE c) Determining the residence of a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE. For the purposes of determining the residence of a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on: i) information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures in the case of a Pre-existing Entity Account held by one or more Passive NFEs with an aggregate account balance or value that does not exceed USD 1 000 000; or ii) a self-certification from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person of the jurisdiction(s) in which the Controlling Person is resident for tax purposes. If a self-certification is not provided, the Reporting Financial Institution will establish such residence(s) by applying the procedures described in paragraph C of Section III. D. Timing of Review and Additional Procedures Applicable to Pre-existing Entity Accounts. 1. Review of Pre-existing Entity Accounts with an aggregate account balance or value that exceeds USD 250 000 as of 30 June 2017 34 must be completed by 30 June 2019 35 . 2. Review of Pre-existing Entity Accounts with an aggregate account balance or value that does not exceed USD 250 000 as of 30 June 2017 36 , but exceeds USD 250 000 as of 31 March 37 of a subsequent year, must be completed within the year 38 following the year in which the aggregate account balance or value exceeds USD 250 000. 3. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Pre-existing Entity Account that causes the Reporting Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the self-certification or other documentation associated with an account is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution must re-determine the status of the account in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph C. Section VI: Due Diligence for New Entity Accounts The following procedures apply with respect to New Entity Accounts. A. Review Procedures for Identifying Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting may be Required. For New Entity Accounts, a Reporting Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures: 1. Determine the Residence of the Entity. a) Obtain a self-certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows the Reporting Financial Institution to determine the Account Holder’s residence(s) for tax purposes 39 and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information 34 IR CLARIFICATION: This date is inserted pursuant to Item 9, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 35 IR CLARIFICATION: This date is inserted pursuant to Item 9, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A Reporting financial institution has the option of disregarding this USD 250,000 threshold. Section 185N(9) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a Reporting Financial Institution that chooses not to apply the USD 250 000 threshold for such accounts is also required to complete the review of such accounts by 30 June 2019. 36 IR CLARIFICATION: This date is inserted pursuant to Item 10, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 37 IR CLARIFICATION: This date is inserted pursuant to Item 10, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 38 IR CLARIFICATION: For New Zealand purposes the relevant year is the 12-month period ending with 31 March, unless the context requires a different interpretation. 39 IR CLARIFICATION: If the self-certification indicates that the Account Holder is a Reportable Person the Reporting Financial Institution should collect the Account Holder’s foreign TIN(s) (subject to paragraph D of Section I). Sections 185N(3) and 185N(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that this requirement also extends to cover those Account Holders that are identified as resident in a jurisdiction other than a Reportable Jurisdiction and that would be Reportable Persons if the foreign jurisdiction were a Reportable Jurisdiction. Page 10 of 23 IN CONFIDENCE obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. If the Entity certifies that it has no residence for tax purposes, the Reporting Financial Institution may rely on the address of the principal office of the Entity to determine the residence of the Account Holder. b) If the self-certification indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a Reportable Account unless it reasonably determines based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Reportable Person with respect to such Reportable Jurisdiction. 2. Determine the Residence of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE. With respect to an Account Holder of a New Entity Account (including an Entity that is a Reportable Person), the Reporting Financial Institution must identify whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons and determine the residence of such Reportable Persons. If any of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, then the account must be treated as a Reportable Account. In making these determinations the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraphs A(2)(a) through (c) in the order most appropriate under the circumstances. a) Determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE. For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE, the Reporting Financial Institution must rely on a self-certification from the Account Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFE or a Financial Institution other than an Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) of Section VIII that is not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution. b) Determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder. For purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. c) Determining the residence of a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE. For purposes of determining the residence of a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE, a Reporting Financial Institution may rely on a self-certification 40 from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person. Section VII: Special Due Diligence Rules The following additional rules apply in implementing the due diligence procedures described above: A. Reliance on Self-Certifications and Documentary Evidence. A Reporting Financial Institution ma y not rely on a self-certification or Documentary Evidence if the Reporting Financial Institution knows or has reason to know that the self-certification or Documentary Evidence is incorrect or unreliable. B. Alternative Procedures for Financial Accounts Held by Individual Beneficiaries of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract. 1. A Reporting Financial Institution may presume that an individual beneficiary (other than the owner) of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract receiving a death benefit is not a Reportable Person and may treat such Financial Account as other than a Reportable Account unless the Reporting Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the beneficiary is a Reportable Person. A Reporting Financial Institution has reason to know that a beneficiary of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract is a Reportable Person if the information collected by the Reporting Financial Institution and associated with the beneficiary contains indicia of residence in a Foreign Jurisdiction as described in paragraph B of Section III. If a Reporting 40 IR CLARIFICATION: If the self-certification indicates that a Controlling Person is a Reportable Person the Reporting Financial Institution should collect the Controlling Person’s foreign TIN(s) (subject to paragraph D of Section I) and date of birth. Sections 185N(3) and 185N(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that this requirement also extends to cover those Controlling Persons that are identified as resident in a jurisdiction other than a Reportable Jurisdiction and that would be Reportable Persons if the foreign jurisdiction were a Reportable Jurisdiction. Page 11 of 23 IN CONFIDENCE Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the beneficiary is a Reportable Person, the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the procedures in paragraph B of Section III. 2. A Reporting Financial Institution may treat a Financial Account that is a member’s interest in a Group Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract as a Financial Account that is not a Reportable Account until the date on which an amount is payable to the employee/certificate holder or beneficiary, if the Financial Account that is a member’s interest in a Group Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract meets the following requirements: a) the Group Cash Value Insurance Contract or Group Annuity Contract is issued to an employer and covers twenty-five or more employee/certificate holders; b) the employee/certificate holders are entitled to receive any contract value related to their interests and to name beneficiaries for the benefit payable upon the employee’s death; and c) the aggregate amount payable to any employee/certificate holder or beneficiary does not exceed USD 1 000 000. The term “Group Cash Value Insurance Contract” means a Cash Value Insurance Contract that (i) provides coverage on individuals who are affiliated through an employer, trade association, labour union, or other association or group; and (ii) charges a premium for each member of the group (or member of a class within the group) that is determined without regard to the individual health characteristics other than age, gender, and smoking habits of the member (or class of members) of the group. The term “Group Annuity Contract” means an Annuity Contract under which the obligees are individuals who are affiliated through an employer, trade association, labour union, or other association or group. 41 C. Account Balance Aggregation and Currency Rules. 1. Aggregation of Individual Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an individual, a Reporting Financial Institution is required to aggregate all Financial Accounts maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting Financial Institution’s computerised systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or TIN, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this subparagraph. 2. Aggregation of Entity Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an Entity, a Reporting Financial Institution is required to take into account all Financial Accounts that are maintained by the Reporting Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting Financial Institution’s computerised systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or TIN, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this subparagraph. 3. Special Aggregation Rule Applicable to Relationship Managers. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by a person to determine whether a Financial Account is a High Value Account, a Reporting Financial Institution is also required, in the case of any Financial Accounts that a relationship manager knows, or has reason to know, are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or established (other than in a fiduciary capacity) by the same person, to aggregate all such accounts. 4. Amounts Read to Include Equivalent in Other Currencies. All dollar amounts are in US dollars. However, an entity has the option of treating all dollar amounts referred to in the CRS standard as 41 IR CLARIFICATION: Paragraph B(2) is inserted pursuant to item 11, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Page 14 of 23 IN CONFIDENCE controlled entities, and political subdivisions of a jurisdiction. a) An “integral part” of a jurisdiction means any person, organisation, agency, bureau, fund, instrumentality, or other body, however designated, that constitutes a governing authority of a jurisdiction. The net earnings of the governing authority must be credited to its own account or to other accounts of the jurisdiction, with no portion inuring to the benefit of any private person. An integral part does not include any individual who is a sovereign, official, or administrator acting in a private or personal capacity. b) A controlled entity means an Entity that is separate in form from the jurisdiction or that otherwise constitutes a separate juridical entity, provided that: i) the Entity is wholly owned and controlled by one or more Governmental Entities directly or through one or more controlled entities; ii) the Entity’s net earnings are credited to its own account or to the accounts of one or more Governmental Entities, with no portion of its income inuring to the benefit of any private person; and iii) the Entity’s assets vest in one or more Governmental Entities upon dissolution. c) Income does not inure to the benefit of private persons if such persons are the intended beneficiaries of a governmental programme, and the programme activities are performed for the general public with respect to the common welfare or relate to the administration of some phase of government.

Commonly owned groups
=====================

Generally, a commonly owned group (group) of businesses is one where each business has the same owners. It does not matter whether those owners have the same proportion of ownership in each business. 

A business may also be treated as being in the group if it is part of a larger group of businesses. For example: 

*   The group has a dominating shareholder or group of shareholders, and the businesses operate together as if they were one. 
*   The group of businesses involves a complex ownership structure where the overall control is centralised and businesses are in substance one enterprise. 

Eligibility for the COVID-19 support payment (CSP) 
---------------------------------------------------

Each business or organisation in the group was eligible for CSP if, as well as meeting the other eligibility criteria, they and the group as a whole have experienced a 40% drop in revenue due to one or more [COVID-19 circumstances](/api/glossary/item?id={C306A832-B894-487C-90F6-F46B93F1F835})
.  

If a member of the group was eligible for the CSP, they needed to calculate their number of full-time employees (FTEs) - up to 50 FTEs. 

The member could claim for the employees that regularly worked for them. In some groups, most or all employees of the group are employed by one member of the group but may regularly work for another member(s) of the group. In these cases, the member may count an employee of another member of the group as their own employee if that employee regularly works for them. 

For a CSP an employee could be considered to 'regularly work' for the member if, in a typical 4-weeks, the employee worked at least, either: 

*   2 calendar days for the member each week
*   5 calendar days for the member in a single week. 

The group member should count the number of calendar days that the employee worked for them.

*   2 shifts for the same member of the group in one day counts as only 1 day (for example, a split shift). 
*   If the duration of a shift spans multiple calendar days, only the 1st calendar day can be counted.

This calculation is for each group member. If an employee worked 2 shifts in 1 calendar day, and each shift is for a separate member, then each member could count that same calendar day towards this calculation. A member could count an employee that worked a partial day towards the calculation. 

There may also be other circumstances where an employee 'regularly works' for the member. For CSP purposes, a member could use any reasonable method to work out whether an employee regularly worked for them - based on the actual day-to-day working arrangements that the member had with their workers. The member needs to keep a record of the method they use. We may ask for this record as part of a review of the CSP. 

To work out whether an employee that 'regularly works' for the member is either a full-time equivalent worker or a part-time equivalent worker, the member may only count the hours the employee regularly worked for them (for example, if the employee regularly worked 20 or more hours per week for the member they will be a full-time equivalent worker of the member). 

If the employee worked an irregular number of hours from week to week, the member should use the average number of hours the employee worked for them each week to work out whether the employee is a 'full-time equivalent' worker. 

The maximum payment cap of 50 full-time employees (FTEs) still applied to each group member (the low revenue cap also applied). All other eligibility criteria still applied.

[Employees for the purposes of the COVID-19 Support Payment (CSP)](/covid-19/business-and-organisations/covid-19-support-payment/eligibility-for-the-csp/employees-for-the-purposes-of-the-csp)

Example: Commonly owned groups

Daniel and Jordan are the shareholders in 2 building companies, Mario’s Builders and Luigi’s Building Services. Daniel is a 60% shareholder in Mario’s Builders and Jordan is a 40% shareholder in Mario’s Builders. 

For Luigi’s Building Services, Daniel is a 20% shareholder and Jordan is an 80% shareholder. As the 2 companies have the same shareholders, they are a commonly owned group. 

Mario’s Builders and Luigi’s Building Services can apply separately for a CSP. Each company should include all of their employees in their application. The 40% drop in revenue must be a result of one or more of the COVID-19 circumstances and is required to be satisfied at both the applicant level and across the commonly owned group as a whole.

Communications and stakeholder management
=========================================

Effective communication lies at the heart of a successful programme and is one of the most important drivers of business change. It helps to reduce resistance and increase acceptance of new process, structures, ways of working and technology, which allows for a smoother transition to transformation.

Our business transformation communications team covered all customer and stakeholder groups.

The communications lead was responsible for effective communications to:

*   Government
*   internal customers
*   external customers
*   external stakeholders
*   partners, that include software developers
*   unions
*   media.

They were not responsible for the delivery of the communications to every audience.

Communicating effectively
-------------------------

### Within Inland Revenue

Communications about the transformation, both within the programme and across Inland Revenue, included:

*   building awareness and understanding of all phases of the programme through storytelling
*   creative videos
*   master classes
*   deep dives
*   intranet site
*   large-scale events
*   open homes and workshops
*   monthly programme updates through a leaders’ teleconference, newsletters and presentations.

### With our external customers and stakeholders

We communicated with customers and external stakeholders by using:

*   webinars
*   presentations
*   speeches
*   factsheets
*   newsletters
*   web content
*   cross-agency open homes and other supporting resources.

The team also worked closely with our Marketing team to support campaigns linked to each release. These campaigns targeted individuals, tax intermediaries and businesses.

### Supporting our leaders and change

The Business Transformation communications team provided content and essential support for many parts of Inland Revenue.

They supported the Transformation policy team with resources for public consultation on policy change, and they supported the Commissioner’s office, Minister’s office, and Inland Revenue’s financial reporting team with:

*   content for speeches
*   external presentations
*   industry events
*   annual reports
*   frequently asked questions
*   other supporting resources.

They also supported the media team with media queries, press releases and other resources as needed.

Driving the best outcomes
-------------------------

Our decision to build a dedicated communication team for the duration of the Business Transformation programme enabled a successful outcome.

It was very important that the Communications and Stakeholder Lead was part of programme leadership meetings – you cannot lead communications by hearing things second-hand.

### Having the right team

All members above the Communications Advisor role had proven experience in programme and change communications, which meant most of the communications team were external contractors. This is necessary for 2 reasons:

1.  It’s fundamental to have a team that can understand complex programme information and turn it into content each stakeholder group can relate to
2.  Communication change specialists do not wait to be told what information to share. They are embedded in the programme team and identify important points for communication to the wider organisation and stakeholders. This saved time and made our messaging more accurate.

Key advice for success
----------------------

Have a well-written business case to reference when explaining the programme purpose and vision. We used this approach throughout the programme and made the monthly report to our Minister our ‘1 source of the truth’, to ensure our messages were consistent.

Develop a simple story or visual showing the ‘what’ and ‘why’ so people and customers can understand its meaning.

Be customer-centric – it’s not how much you communicate which counts, it’s how it’s received. Here are some examples.

*   External stakeholder engagement is vital - setting up and providing the Business Transformation Account Management team with the right communications was fundamental to the positive way transformational change was received by our stakeholders.
*   Recognise the different communications needs of a wide range of audiences such as Māori and Pacific people and businesses, non-digital users and harder to reach stakeholders.
*   Be transparent - share every report once the Minister or Cabinet has approved it, so you’re prepared for media enquiries and Official Information Act requests.
*   Look at the change and communications from the customer’s view and communicate regularly with both your people and customers. Ours preferred small updates on what we knew about the change as our understanding grew, rather than waiting for the complete picture just ahead of go-live.
*   Use feedback from your people and customers to improve your communication approach and the design too, if possible.

Develop a robust communications and stakeholder strategy, but it does not need to be highly detailed. It will be a programme deliverable, but you will not use it once you have other tools in place.

You do not need complex Word communications documents to support every new activity or stage. It’s better and more practical to prepare short tactical plans which reflect the overarching strategy.

Be creative in your programme communications. Transformations take time, and in our case, took several years across multiple releases. You need to be able to deal with change fatigue and capture people’s attention, ready for the next big change.

Sharing some key resources
--------------------------

Here are examples of tactical plans we used during our transformation programme.

*   Customer Stakeholder Communications and Marketing Plan
*   A plan on a page, aligned to the programme lifecycle so your programme manager can see what is happening at a glance.
*   A communications schedule showing the timing of messages, by audience and channel.
*   A go-live communications plan and schedule covering the critical activities and messaging in the lead-up to cutover.
*   A communications matrix to support Early Life Support to ensure absolute clarity around who and what is required to respond quickly to issues after go-live.

Communications and stakeholder management
=========================================

The transformation had a dedicated communications team for the duration of the programme.

Each workstream – Core tax and social policy, Intelligence led, Workplace technology, Business integration and transition - had their own communications plans and communications resources, while the Communications and Stakeholder Management Lead was responsible for communications to all internal, customer and stakeholder groups, to ensure that messages were consistent, and timings were aligned.

One of our key communications principles was that we would tell our people first. We recruited individuals into the team who understood programme language and who could turn complex information into content each stakeholder group could relate to.

Communications were extensive and constantly tested and refined with feedback from our customers and our people. We used a number of mediums and channels to reach customers, including digital channels, webinars and social media, and learned and modified as we went along.

### START release communications

Comprehensive engagement and communications plans for each release were designed to reach those who were affected by the changes we were making. We repeated the same messages hundreds of times, as we expected that not everyone would understand them the first time, and that some people would be surprised by what the changes meant for them.

For our internal audience, we used many different interventions to counteract change fatigue and keep people’s attention on the change over several years. Creative videos, deep dives and masterclasses, campaigns using internal social media and region events for people leaders, all featured in our campaigns. The content might be complex, but you need as much creativity for programme communications as you do for a public relations campaign.

### Communications plans and schedule

A formal communications plan was created for every workstream and release however the informal communication plans on a page, schedules and tactical approaches proved more useful as working documents and to share with busy programme, change and stakeholder managers.

Stakeholder management
----------------------

Business transformation continued to review and adapt its approach to stakeholder management throughout the transformation in line with change impact assessments and feedback from our many and varied stakeholders.

A new stakeholder strategy and plan was created for each release. While many of the stakeholders were impacted by change throughout the transformation, in line with the product mix, we had to engage with new stakeholders right up to the final release and quickly build their understanding of why we were changing as well as what was about to change.

### Understanding our stakeholders better

When we migrated GST to new systems and processes in February 2017, we thought we had put sufficient effort into change management, marketing and communications. However, it became clear that we were nowhere near as effective as we thought we were. As a result, we changed our approach for subsequent releases, as well as bringing customers and stakeholders into the design process, in particular tax agents. Engagement with tax agents increased significantly from 2017 onwards.

### Account management

We set up an account management team to improve external customer and stakeholder management following the February 2017 release. From then on, this team became the front door for external stakeholders and customers for the remainder of the programme. The team enabled 2-way, open, honest discussion, communication and feedback, and provided early warning of issues that could impact our external customers before they became widespread or critical. We recruited people with industry knowledge and credibility in these roles, people with proven experience in programme delivery, who could balance conflicting priorities.

Engagement with stakeholder groups was tracked and feedback from the Account Management team was an input into the business readiness assessment ahead of go-live.

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/buisness-transformation/business-transformation-guide/account-management-graphic.png?modified=20220711012328) 

### Areas of Focus Groups

Further strengthening our management of external stakeholders as we prepared for Release 3 (Tax on Income, Payday filing became mandatory, changes to Working for Families Tax Credits and the introduction of Investment Income reporting), we set up networked teams whose focus was on managing the impacts of change on specific customer groups and our people who supported them.

These groups were business-led and included members of the programme team with an in-depth understanding of the change. The role of the group was to track readiness of our customers and our people ahead of the release, identify risk and issues and ensure mitigations were in place to overcome them.

Post go-live the Area of Focus groups played a critical role in the support model (Pou Whirinaki) reporting on how our customers and our people were coping with the new systems and processes and identifying issues which were then fed into the support process.

Company liquidator who misapplied GST refund ordered to pay compensation
========================================================================

High Court found that Mr Robertson had misapplied company funds and ordered him to repay the money to the Commissioner pursuant to s 301 of the Companies Act 1993.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Stuart Douglas Robertson \[2018\] NZHC 696

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993 ss 301, 310; Companies Act 1955 s 315; Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 s 46; Interest on Money Claims Act 2016 cl 1 of Schedule 1; Judicature Act 1908 s 87; Senior Courts Act 2016 s 182; Judicature (Prescribed Rate of Interest) Order 2011 cl 4.

### Summary

Mr Robertson was appointed liquidator of a company by resolution of the sole director and shareholder. The company was under audit by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) and a GST refund of $159,910.58 which had been claimed by the company was held back. When the Commissioner’s audit was completed it was clear that a net debt was owed by the company to the Commissioner. However when the audit was completed the system automatically lifted the halt on payments and the GST refund was paid out to Mr Robertson. Mr Robertson proceeded to disburse the funds. The ultimate recipients of the refund were: a trust with which Mr Robertson was associated; the former shareholder/director of the company; and Mr Robertson’s former business associates/employees. The High Court found that Mr Robertson had misapplied company funds and ordered Mr Robertson to repay the money to the Commissioner pursuant to s 301 of the Companies Act 1993 ("the CA").

### Impact

The decision is a useful authority in the application of s 301 of the CA where a liquidator has misapplied company funds.

### Facts

Mr Stuart Robertson was appointed liquidator of Hukatere Coastal Trustees Limited ("Hukatere") when on 14 April 2010 the company's director Roy Brown resolved Hukatere was unable to pay its debts as they fell due. Mr Robertson consented to the appointment.

Mr Robertson's first report as Hukatere's liquidator, dated 22 April 2010, explained the company acted as a bare trustee of an unnamed trust. From Mr Robertson's inspection of Hukatere's records, it appeared "the only remaining asset due to the trustee could be a GST refund being withheld by the Inland Revenue Department". He proposed to dispense with any creditors' meeting, as any funds recovered would not exceed the $44,000 owed to the secured creditor. He also identified Isolve Accounting (Mr Robertson's former accounting practice, now operated by his former employee Ms Phillimore) as a creditor for less than $800.

On 7 May 2010, the Commissioner lodged proof of debt for some $214,000 in unpaid GST, advising the company was the subject of investigation. At the same time, the Commissioner sought to replace Mr Robertson as liquidator.

Mr Robertson refused to resign and rejected the Commissioner's proof of debt, observing his expectation of an ultimate reimbursement due "to the trust". The Commissioner responded, insisting the proof of debt was admissible, being certain notwithstanding refunds may be offset against it.

On 25 June 2010 the Commissioner issued her statement of position. Following expiry of the response period and the consequent deemed acceptance of the Commissioner's position, the Commissioner advised Mr Robertson on 16 September 2010 that the audit had been completed. On 24 September and 19 October 2010 two cheques were disbursed to Mr Robertson totalling $159,910.58 ("the GST Refunds") which Mr Robertson banked into his trust account. The payments were made as a result of the IRD system automatically lifting the halt on payments when the audit was completed.

Mr Robertson issued his second report as Hukatere's liquidator on 12 November 2010 for the period to 14 October 2010 stating "\[t\]here have been no realisations, no distributions and no Liquidator remuneration during the period".

Mr Robertson asserted that in June 2010 there was some correspondence between Mr Brown, Ms Phillimore and Mr Robertson which purportedly advised Mr Robertson that Hukatere was no longer the trustee of the WBR Trust and had been discharged from its trustee obligations. Another letter purporting to be from Ms Phillimore to Mr Robertson dated 21 December 2010, stated Mr Robertson was holding funds for WBR Trust, and requested the funds be released to Ms Phillimore. The Commissioner questioned whether the correspondence was genuine and objected to its admissibility in evidence.

On 21 December 2010 $150,000 was paid from Mr Robertson's Trust account to Ms Phillimore's client funds account and was on the same day disbursed from that account. $30,000 was split in equal shares and paid to Ms Phillimore's practice account and to a trust which Mr Robertson was involved with. The remaining amount was paid as $100,000 to "E Krasniqi" (a former employee of Mr Robertson and for whose companies Mr Robertson may have acted as liquidator), $10,000 to "S Cannon" (Mr Brown's personal assistant) and $10,000 to Mr Brown.

Mr Robertson eventually resigned as a liquidator of Hukatere in January 2012 following a court application by the Commissioner to disqualify him from acting as a liquidator.

### Decision

_Admissibility of documents_

Jagose J upheld the Commissioner's objection to the admissibility of certain correspondence on grounds that the correspondence was inconsistent with Mr Robertson's repeated assertions stating Hukatere was a trustee of the WBR Trust. His Honour further noted that the Commissioner's objection to the incorporation of those documents in the common bundle begged evidence to be called from at least Mr Brown and it could be inferred from the fact Mr Brown was not called that his evidence would not have assisted Mr Robertson.

_Recovery under s 301_

Given Mr Robertson's acceptance that he had failed in his duties of care and skill as a liquidator, Jagose J had little difficulty finding Mr Robertson was caught by the provisions of s 301. His Honour rejected the argument that something more than mere negligence was required and disposed of the defendant's assertion that _Re Avon Chambers Ltd_ \[1978\] 2 NZLR 638, (1977) 1 BCR 149 applied, noting that Casey J in that case was concerned with the wording of the predecessor to s 301. Jagose J found that the Commissioner's loss was directly caused by Mr Robertson paying away the GST Refunds in circumstances in which he was responsible to retain them for set-off under s 310 of the CA. His Honour could see no factor giving rise to a lesser award for compensation.

_Affirmative defence of estoppel_

Mr Robertson was unsuccessful in claiming a defence of estoppel, asserting that the Commissioner had represented that the GST Refunds were the Commissioner's final position. Jagose J did not see how any of the Commissioner's actions amounted to such a representation.

_Alternative causes of action_

Although not necessary to consider the alternative causes of action, Jagose J noted that he would equally have found Mr Robertson liable to repay the GST Refunds to the Commissioner on the alternative grounds plead. Under the rule in _Ex parte James; In re Condon_ (1874) LR 9 Ch App 609, liquidators are "obliged to act in a manner consistent with the highest principles" and Mr Robertson had conceded his conduct in disbursing the GST Refunds without taking advice was not consistent with those principles. On the same basis the 'unconscionability' ground was established which disentitled Mr Robertson to a defence of change of position in respect of the cause of action claiming restitutionary relief from a mistaken payment.

Company Restructuring: "Demergers" and "Spin-Outs" - BHP, WMC and CSR (June 2003)
=================================================================================

QB (Jun 2003) clarifies tax consequences for NZ resident taxpayers who receive new shares as the result of a demerger or spin-out from a company restructuring.

The department has noted several recent occasions on which Australian-listed companies have restructured in such a way as to distribute shares in a subsidiary of the listed company. Such restructurings are commonly referred to as demergers or "spin-outs". We have been asked about the tax consequences for New Zealand resident taxpayers who receive new shares as the result of such a "spin-out".

### Background

We are aware of demergers or spin-outs in the last twelve months by BHP Billiton Limited, WMC Limited and CSR Limited.

Typically, the restructuring company ("head" company) reduces its own capital (but without reducing the number of shares it has on issue) and applies funds on behalf of the shareholders to acquire shares in a subsidiary company (the "spin-out" company), which are transferred or issued to the shareholder.

There will sometimes also be a "demerger" dividend declared at the time of the demerger, the proceeds also being applied to acquiring the spin-out shares.

After the demerger or spin-out the head company shareholders still hold the same number of shares in the head company and also hold shares in the spin-out company. Additional shareholders may also own some (typically less than 20%) of the spin-out company.

### Issues

There are several taxation issues to consider: the dividend consequences, the treatment of gains on disposal of the new shares, and their cost base. The discussion following is specific to the above-mentioned Australian demergers as circumstances can vary from country to country and company to company.

### Dividend consequences

A "capital reduction" of the type described above resulting in a "spin-out" or "demerger", is a dividend derived by New Zealand tax resident shareholders. It is derived on the date the capital reduction is effected. The dividend must be included in the shareholder's gross income for the period. Likewise any specific "demerger" dividend is also income and must be returned.

The term "dividend" is defined in section CF 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The definition is extensive: it applies to any company, and to any payment, distribution, or transaction, whether in money or money's worth, made to or with any person, with respect to their own or another person's capacity as a shareholder in that company.

While some transactions involving the cancellation of shares are treated as not constituting dividends, the Commissioner does not consider that those rules have any application in the transactions identified above or in other similarly structured demergers, as there is no cancellation of any shares. Nor would the transactions be treated as bonus issues for New Zealand tax purposes.

The value of the dividend is the New Zealand dollar equivalent of the amount credited to the shareholder. The market value of the shares subsequently acquired on the date of distribution is not relevant for dividend calculation purposes.

For the purpose of establishing an appropriate exchange rate the New Zealand/Australia exchange rate should be used (these are set out on page 23 for the purposes of those transactions identified). Taxpayers may use the department's IR 270 exchange rate form or its online calculator, which gives the mid-month telegraphic buying rates for Australia, or obtain from their bank the actual exchange rate for the day in question.

Tax treatment of the dividend differs according to whether the New Zealand tax resident is a corporate or non-corporate shareholder.

1.  _Non-corporate shareholders (including individuals, trusts (other than unit trusts) and superannuation funds)_  
      
    New Zealand tax resident non-corporate shareholders must include the amount of the distribution derived (converted to equivalent New Zealand dollars) as dividend income, when calculating gross income in their income tax return for the relevant year.  
      
    It is unlikely that any foreign tax credits would be available as these payments (including demerger dividends) are not treated as dividends under Australian tax rules, so no non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) will have been deducted.  
      
    
2.  _Corporate shareholders (including unit trusts)_  
      
    Dividends derived from a foreign company by corporate New Zealand tax resident shareholders are exempt income under section CB 10(1) ITA.  
      
    However, corporate shareholders are required by section NH 1 ITA to deduct and pay to the Commissioner an upfront dividend withholding payment from foreign withholding payment dividends. The amount of dividend withholding payment is calculated according to a formula provided in section NH 2 ITA. The formula uses the basic company income tax rate of 33%.  
      
    Underlying foreign tax credits would only be available if any person held more than 10% of the Australian head company's shares (which, in the examples discussed, is unlikely).

### Gains on any disposal of shares

The Scheme of Arrangement (or equivalent documentation) sent to shareholders for a "spin-out" or "demerger" may include a sale facility option. That is, shareholders have the ability to instruct the company to sell the “spin-out” shares and receive cash.

The normal tax rules regarding share disposals apply to New Zealand resident shareholders wishing to sell shares received under the restructuring process.

Where the shares in the "head" company are held on capital account the shares in the "spin-out". Company should also be held on capital account. Thus there should be no tax implications for those shareholders who use the sale facility to sell their shares, or sell later, provided that the shares continue to be held on capital account. However, taxpayers, if uncertain, should obtain their own advice on the issue.

Sale proceeds, whether by way of the "sale facility option" or later, will be gross income if the "head" company shares which created the distribution entitlement were held on revenue account. A deduction is available for the cost of the shares.

### Cost base of shares for tax purposes

The scheme applies funds that belong to the shareholders (being the capital reduction and any demerger dividend) to acquire shares in the demerged company. Therefore the cost base for tax purposes to the shareholder of the shares acquired in the demerged company will be equal to the amount of the dividend received.

Again for tax purposes the cost base of the shares in the head company does not change.

### Recent Australian demergers

In the last twelve months at least three Australian-listed companies have demerged:

*   BHP Billiton Limited: shareholders now have shares in BHP Billiton Limited ("head") and, on a one-for-five basis, BHP Steel Limited (the "spin-out") (effective 22 July 2002 ),
*   WMC Limited: shareholders now have shares in Alumina Limited (formerly WMC Limited) and, on a one-for-one basis, WMC Resources Limited ("spin-out") (effective 11 December 2002 ), and
*   CSR Limited: shareholders now have shares in CSR Limited ("head") and, on a one-for-one basis, Rinker Group Limited ("spin-out") (effective 11 April 2003).

Each of these will have a number of New Zealand shareholders.

Using the exchange rates on IR 270, the dividend amounts of the three demergers (both the capital reduction, and where appropriate, the demerger dividend) are:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Head company** | **$A dividend per head share** | **$NZ dividend per head share** |
| BHP Billiton Limited | $0.69 | $0.80 |
| WMC Limited | $3.51 | $3.86 |
| CSR Limited | $1.53 | $1.69 |

  

### Example of effect on a shareholder

Using WMC Limited as the example, the demerger involved the following steps:

*   A capital reduction in WMC Limited of $A2.78 per WMC Limited share
*   A "Share Scheme Dividend" or "demerger" dividend of $A0.73
*   The application of the total proceeds of this, $A3.51, to acquire shares in WMC Resources Limited, and
*   The renaming of WMC Limited to Alumina Limited.

The shareholder still has the same number of "head company" shares, now in Alumina Limited, at their original cost. The shareholder also has an equivalent number of shares in WMC Resources Limited at a cost of $A3.51 and has received a dividend of $A3.51.

### Return filing

While taxpayers have a duty to make due enquiry about their own tax affairs, this item is published to clarify the Commissioner's position.

Some taxpayers may have already filed tax returns for the year ending 31 March 2003 and may have overlooked inclusion of the dividends (and where applicable the proceeds of share sales) derived from the spin-out. The department will accept and process a request to amend the return from those taxpayers.

Starting your own business can be pretty exciting.

Being your own boss, working on the projects you want to, and being responsible for your own tax matters.

One of the first things to do, is choose a business structure that's right for you.

The 3 most common business structures are sole trader, company, and partnership.

In this video, we'll look at companies, which are their own separate legal entitles, and how they do their taxes.

Leeann appears on the left of the screen, John appears on the right. A shop appears between them.

COMPANY STRUCTURE appears on the shop. This is then replaced by 2 percent signs with a 50/50 split down the middle of the shop indicating Leeann and John each hold 50 percent of the company’s shares. Leeann’s percentage then increases to about 66 percent, while John’s decreases to about 33 percent.

Leeann and John appear behind a counter inside the shop, looking at a computer. They are registering their company and getting their IRD number online through the Companies Office.

PATINA ANTIQUES LIMITED appears on the front side of the counter, and as a sign at the top right of the screen.

‘LIMITED’ on the sign is highlighted and expands as this is explained. A circle above each person’s head appears showing their share percentage again.

**Narrator**

Meet Leeann and John. They’ve decided a company structure is best for their antique business.

When people form a company, they each get shares, usually in proportion to the money they contribute.

Leeann and John contact the Companies Office to register their company as Patina Antiques Limited, and get an IRD number at the same time.

Most companies have limited after their name.

This means if the company gets into financial difficulty, a shareholder's personal liability is limited to their share in the company.

**Narrator**

In its first year in business, Patina Antiques Limited makes a profit of 150,000 dollars.

During the year, Patina Antiques pays Leeann and John 40,000 dollars each, leaving the company with a profit of 70,000 dollars.

Leeann and John each file an individual tax return, called an IR3, showing their income from the company of 40,000 dollars each.

Patina Antiques files a company tax return, called an IR4, declaring a profit of 70,000 dollars for the year, and pays tax on this profit.

Patina Antiques has its business year end at the thirty-first of March, the standard date for many companies.

So, Patina Antiques files it’s returns by the seventh of July, and avoids any late-filing penalty.

Company tax rate reductions - consequential and transitional amendments
=======================================================================

2007 amendments to imputation and dividend withholding payment credit ratios, qualifying company election tax, foreign investor tax credits and more.

**_Sections ME 8(1), MG 8(1) and MG 10(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections CD 43(27)(b), GB 27(3), HA 15, LE 8, LE 9, LF 1, LF 6, LF 7, LP 2, LP 5, LP 8, OA 18, OB 7B, OB 16(1), OB 73, OB 75, OB 78, OB 80, OC 29, OD 1, OD 22, OE 2, OP 99, OZ 7 to OZ 17, RE 2(5)(i) and YA 1 and Table O1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 140B, 140BB, 140C and 140CA of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

A number of mainly transitional amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 in relation to imputation and dividend withholding payment (DWP) credit ratios, qualifying company election tax (QCET), branch equivalent and conduit memorandum accounts and foreign investor tax credits (FITC). These changes follow the reduction in the company tax rate, the tax rate for widely held savings vehicles and the top rate for portfolio investment entities (PIEs) from 33% to 30%. In addition, a few changes were made to the Income Tax Act 2004.

All section references are to sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise specified.

#### Background

In July 2006, the government released the Business Tax Review discussion document for public comment. It set out a range of possible business tax initiatives, including reducing the company tax rate to 30%, to help transform the New Zealand economy by enhancing productivity and improving our international competitiveness.

The resulting reduction in the company tax rate is intended to encourage more investment into New Zealand by businesses that have decided to locate here. This will tend to increase New Zealand's stock of plant, equipment and buildings, which will boost labour productivity.

The lower tax rate is also intended to reduce biases between different investments that companies undertake, leading to further capital productivity.

Finally, the reduction in the company tax rate will tend to encourage New Zealand companies to stay here, rather than shift to Australia or elsewhere. It will also increase the after-tax profits of companies, which means more funds are available for reinvestment.

#### Key features

**Imputation and DWP credit ratios**

The reduction in the company tax rate to 30% will automatically cause the maximum imputation credit ratio and the DWP ratio ("the tax credit ratio") to fall to 30/70 credits to cash. To ensure that shareholders are not disadvantaged by this, a transitional period has been introduced. During this period, a company will be able to allocate imputation and DWP credits at a maximum tax credit ratio of 33/67 on profits that have been taxed at 33%. The transitional period will run from the beginning of a company's 2008-09 income year to the end of its 2009-10 tax year (being 31 March 2010).

When the 33/67 tax credit ratio is used during the transitional period, the amount of imputation and/or DWP credits included as a credit against shareholder companies and widely held savings vehicles income tax liability will be capped at the 30/70 tax credit ratio, although the full credit will flow through to any imputation credit accounts.

**Attribution of income from personal services**

Relief is provided from double taxation by exempting dividends when a company paying dividends meets certain criteria.

**Branch equivalent and conduit memorandum accounts**

Effectively the net balances in these accounts that relate to periods when the tax rate was 33% will be reduced to reflect the lower corporate tax rate. This is necessary because credits in these accounts will be used to match future actual or potential income tax liabilities that will have been calculated using the lower company tax rate.

**FITC**

A reduction in the company tax rate will affect how FITC is calculated. When a dividend is imputed at 30/70 or less, the new 30/70 FITC formula will apply. If imputation credits exceed 30/70, they will be apportioned between 33% credits and 30% credits. As a result, two FITC formulas will apply during the transitional period.

#### Application dates

Most of the amendments apply from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year. The main exceptions are:

*   the amendments that relate to a portfolio tax rate entity that does not choose to be subject to section HL 22, which will apply on and after 1 April 2008; and
*   the removal of the references to imputation years in sections ME 8, MG 8 and MG 10 of the Income Tax Act 2004, which applies from 1 October 2007. This ensures that the maximum ratio by which a dividend can be credited is income-year related, and not imputation-year related.

#### Detailed analysis

The legislative changes are broadly grouped into two areas:

*   new sections OZ 7 to OZ 17 (which are the substantive transitional amendments), and the "sign posts" to these sections; and
*   a new imputation and DWP penalty tax in the Tax Administration Act for companies that over-distribute their 33/67 tax credits during the transitional period.

**Technical issues**

The amending Act (the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007) contains a number of errors relating to the company tax rate change, generally attributable to the almost contemporaneous introduction of the Income Tax Act 2007. This item presumes that these errors have been fixed, but notes the corrections when appropriate. These errors are scheduled at the end of this TIB item. Generally they will be corrected retrospectively.

**Terminating provisions**

**Imputation and DWP crediting ratios - now income year related**

From the 2008-09 income year, the maximum imputation credit ratio in section OA 18 will change automatically from 33/67 to 30/70, in line with the company tax rate reduction. Sections ME 8, MG (8) and MG (10) of the Income Tax Act 2004 have had the reference to imputation year removed, so it is clear that the maximum permitted crediting ratio is income year related, not imputation year related. Section OA 18 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be retrospectively amended to also provide this effect.

Moving directly to a maximum 30/70 imputation credit ratio in 2008-09 would have been the simplest option. However, it might have been difficult for some companies that want to distribute profits that have been taxed at 33% with full credit for these taxes before 2008-09.

A maximum tax credit ratio of 30/70 applying from 2008-09 would have potentially disadvantaged shareholders on income derived by companies before the new rate applied. "Trapped" credits may have occurred when the underlying tax that generated unused imputation credits was paid at 33%.

A number of shareholders would also have been disadvantaged because they would have needed to pay more tax than if the distribution had been made before the reduction in the company tax rate.

**Override of maximum tax credit ratio - new transitional section OZ 8**

An immediate credit ratio change to 30/70 for dividends at the start of companies' 2008-09 income year has the potential to disadvantage some groups of shareholders if the income that underpins the dividend has been taxed at 33%. In particular, presuming that for New Zealand shareholders company tax is a withholding tax, there would not be a full flow-through of credit for the underlying tax.

To deal with this problem, new section OZ 8 allows companies a transitional period in which the core imputation and DWP maximum ratios set out in section OA 18 can be overridden. The section sets out how companies can elect to allocate imputation and DWP credits up to a maximum ratio of 33/67 from the 2008-08 income year until the end of their 2009-10 tax year (being 31 March 2010), to the extent the underlying income was taxed at 33%.

The transitional rule has been crafted to ensure that the underlying income could have been that of another company, where that income has been passed up by way of dividend to a corporate shareholder (the corporate intermediary), whether in the transitional period, or before it. The corporate intermediary must be able to confirm that the relevant credits arose at the 33% tax rate. It could be that the dividend was fully credited at 33/67, or the corporate intermediary may have specific knowledge that the credits result from tax paid at 33%.

RWT may be deducted from a dividend or interest received by a company. When RWT has been deducted while the company tax rate was 33% the resulting imputation credits can be allocated at a ratio up to 33/67. However, RWT may be deducted at 33% when the company tax rate is 30%. This latter RWT is not available for 33/67 imputation credits as the credit does not arise from the application of the old company tax rate.

**New transitional section OZ 9 - benchmark dividends**

New section OZ 9 alters the benchmark dividend ratios in sections OB 61(4) and OC 48(4) when an election has been made to use the 33/67 tax credit ratio. Its purpose is to ensure that a change of tax credit ratio from 33/67 does not necessarily cause the benchmark dividend ratio to be changed.

In particular, companies can pay a subsequent dividend at the 30/70 ratio without having to go through the ratio change processes. This applies when a subsequent dividend is credited at 30/70 and the benchmark dividend is 33/67 because it was paid out before the start of the company's 2008-09 income year (in either the 2007-08 tax year for early balance date companies, and in the 2008-09 tax year for late balance date companies).

Likewise, when a subsequent dividend is credited at 30/70 and the benchmark dividend is 33/67 (which was paid using the provisions of section OZ 8 to over-credit), no ratio change declaration is necessary if the reversion is caused by the 33/67 credits running out.

**Shareholders' tax credits - transitional section OZ 10**

It should be noted that section OZ 10 will be retrospectively amended to have the following effects.

Sections LE 8 and 9, and sections LF 6 and 7 set out rules that determine or limit, in particular circumstances, the amount of imputation credit or FDP credit regarded as being attached to a dividend for shareholders. At a 30% company tax rate, this maximum is expressed by the ratio 30/70.

As discussed above, section OZ 8 allows for over-credited dividends to use a 33/67 ratio during the transitional period. This means that sections LE 8 and 9 and sections LF 6 and 7 need to be overridden to allow for the new section OZ 8 over-credited dividends. New section OZ10 increases the maximum tax credit ratio to 33/67 in sections LE 8 and 9 and sections LF 6 and 7, when the actual tax credit ratio of the dividend is greater than 30/70 and less than or equal to 33/67 to allow for over-credited dividends.

**Limits on the amount of shareholders' tax credit - transitional section OZ 11**

Section OZ 11 limits the imputation and FDP credits attached to dividends received that can be claimed as a credit against their tax liability by taxpayers whose tax rate is 30% (new tax rate persons). These taxpayers are companies and the various savings funds whose tax rate is 30%. The credit against tax liability is limited to 30/70, if the crediting ratio of the actual dividend received is higher than this.

The section LA 9 pointer to section OZ 11 will be retrospectively repealed and instead, a pointer in section LE 1(1) will be provided, to go with the existing section LF 1(1) pointer.

The policy rationale for the limitation is set out in the following example. Consider a new tax rate person that receives $100 of income during the 2007-08 income year and pays tax of $33 on this income. No further income tax implications would arise if the income was passed out to the new tax rate person as a dividend during the 2007-08 income year. This is the appropriate policy outcome, given that the company tax rate and tax rate on savings vehicles were aligned for the 2007-08 income year at 33%.

If, however, the dividend was received during the new tax rate persons' 2008-09 income year as a 33/67 dividend, in the absence of capping, the shareholder would have a grossed-up dividend of $100 on which $30 of gross tax would be payable. If section OZ 11 had not been introduced, this would be offset by a tax credit of $33, which would lead to a net tax credit of $3. This $3 of net credit would offset the tax due on $10 of other income, which is inappropriate.

(Note that where the recipient of the dividend is a company that keeps an imputation or FDP credit account, the full credit is credited. This is conceptually necessary to ensure that shareholders in this company can also receive the benefits of the 33/67 credit ratio.)

**Credits for non-resident investors - transitional section OZ 12**

Note that sections LP 2(2) and OZ 12 will be retrospectively amended to have the following effects.

In the Income Tax Act 2007, the amount of the credit for dividends paid to non-resident investors is determined according to the amount of the imputation credits that would have been allocated to the shareholder in the absence of subpart LP. **20** The credit is calculated by multiplying the amount of imputation credits that would have been attached by a formula in section LP 2(2). This formula, as amended by the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, uses a ratio of 7/10. Given that the rewrite of the Income Tax Act changed the basis of the formula, this ratio should be 7/17, and this change will be made retrospectively.

However, this formula is not appropriate when the dividend is imputed at a higher ratio than 30/70 under the transitional rules. Transitional section OZ 12 provides that the section LP 2(2) formula shall be 67/120 when the dividend is imputed to 33/67. This will be retrospectively amended to 67/187 because of the change in the methodology from the Income Tax Act 2004 to the Income Tax Act 2007.

When the dividend is imputed between 30/70 and 33/67, the credits are apportioned and the section LP 2(2) formula is amended to 67/120 (and as above, this will be retrospectively corrected to 67/187).

Section OZ 12 also amends the relevant tax rate in the section LP 8(2) formula to 33% where appropriate, to parallel the treatment described above, and modifies the effects of section LP 5 to allow for the transitional formula.

**Available subscribed capital amount - transitional section OZ 13**

The concept of "available subscribed capital" is relevant when a company cancels its shares and pays consideration to compensate a shareholder for the cancellation. The calculation required to ascertain the extent of crediting of a dividend is set out in section CD 43(26). When the actual credit ratio exceeds 30/70 it is deemed to be 30/70 for the purposes of section CD 43(26).

**Dividends from qualifying companies - transitional section OZ 14**

When a qualifying company pays a dividend, the amount of the dividend that is taxable is limited to the amount that can be fully credited with imputation of FDP credits. The formula for this is set out in section HA 15. This provision has been over-ridden by section OZ 14 to allow for dividends to be over-credited during the transitional period.

**Statutory producer boards and co-operative companies - transitional section OZ 15**

Statutory producer boards and co-operative companies which are imputation credit account or FDP companies may allocate imputation credits or FDP credits to cash distributions and to notional distributions.

For a statutory producer board, the allocation of imputation credits to cash distributions must be done according to the formula in section OB 73(4). Section OB 75(2) allocates imputation credits for statutory producer boards' notional distributions.

For a co-operative company, the allocation of imputation credits to cash distributions must be done according to the formula in section OB 78(3). Section OB 80(2) allocates imputation credits for co-operative companies' notional distributions.

Transitional section OZ 15 amends the imputation provisions relating to statutory producer boards and co-operative companies to allow them to credit at 33/67 during the transitional period.

**Branch equivalent tax account (BETA) and conduit tax relief account (CRTA) - transitional sections OZ16 and OZ 17**

All entries that relate to 2007-08 and earlier years are to be adjusted to reflect the reduced company tax rate of 30% by multiplying them by 30/33.

#### Other amendments

**Attribution of income from personal services**

The attribution rule is an anti-avoidance rule designed to buttress the 39% rate. It targets higher income individuals who channel their income through an intermediary, frequently a company. It does this by deeming, in defined circumstances, the person providing the personal services to derive income that would otherwise be derived by the intermediary. Some double taxation can occur when the attribution rule is applied to income derived by a company because the cash still has to be extracted from the company as dividends.

Section OB 16 provides for an imputation credit to arise when income is attributed to help limit the double taxation. Before the tax rate changes, the credit was 49.25% of the amount attributed, which partially or fully relieves, depending on the circumstances, the double taxation that could otherwise occur. As a result of the change in the company tax rate to 30%, the imputation credit that arises under the section has been reduced to 42.86%, consistent with the new maximum imputation credit ratio of 30/70.

The reduction to 42.86% increases the potential for double taxation to arise. Further relief against double taxation has been provided (by way of amendments included at the request of the Finance and Expenditure Committee) by the new sub-section GB 27(4). After further amendment, this will allow the company, subject to meeting certain criteria, to elect to pay out the underlying cash that relates to the amount attributed as an exempt dividend. The election is made merely by paying out the dividend using the qualifying company mechanism discussed in the next paragraph and making the appropriate ICA entry.

This relief is provided by ensuring that dividends paid by eligible companies are either fully imputed or exempt from tax, as if the company was a qualifying company. When a company uses this treatment, any credit that arises under section OB 16 in respect of the attributed income should be contemporaneously cancelled on the last day of the relevant tax year, but before the debit from paying the dividend arises. The legislation will be retrospectively amended to achieve this last point.

Relief applies if a company's only activity is the one from which the income has been attributed. Also, it would be acceptable if it earned some incidental interest. The legislation is currently incorrect on the temporal aspects of this - and will be amended so that the qualifying company treatment concession will only apply when a company has never earned any income other than from the provision of personal services, or from interest/financial arrangements. These amendments will be in the June 2008 tax bill which should be enacted before 31 March 2009, the first date that these amendments become practically effective.

If a company engaged in other activities, dividends would be subject to tax in the normal way, and a credit would arise under section OB 16. This prevents the concessionary qualifying company type exempt tax treatment being manipulated to gain unintended benefits.

Section 103 of the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, which introduced new section GC 14EB into the Income Tax Act 2004, will be retrospectively repealed. The concessionary qualifying company treatment is intended to apply only to dividends paid out in relation to the 2008-09 and subsequent years' income.

**Section OB1 - definitions** Two new definitions reflect the reduced company tax rate:

*   New tax rate person - a person who uses a 30% basic tax rate that applies from the 2008-09 and later income years and a portfolio tax rate entity - that is, companies and savings vehicles.
*   Old company tax rate - the 33% tax rate that applied before the 2008-09 income year.

#### Imputation and DWP penalty ta

Section 140B of the Tax Administration Act provides that where an imputation credit account has a debit balance at 31 March 2010, the company must pay further income tax equal to the debit balance plus a 10% imputation penalty tax.

If a company elects to over-impute dividends in accordance with the new section MZ 10, and in doing so, causes a debit balance to arise in relation to the number of 33/67 credits, a new 10% transitional imputation penalty tax will apply.

**New section 140BB - imputation penalty tax payable in some circumstances**

New section 140BB sets out how the transitional imputation penalty tax should be applied and calculated. The 10% penalty will only be applied at 31 March 2010 if the taxpayer has distributed more 33/67 credits than were available.

When a taxpayer is in a debit position in both their 33/67 and overall imputation account, two imputation penalties will apply. However, the section 140B penalty will be reduced to the extent of any section 140BB penalty.

**New section 140CA - dividend withholding payment penalty tax in some circumstances**

New section 140CA sets out how the transitional DWP penalty should be applied and calculated.

It applies to the FDP account in exactly the same way as section 140BB applies to the imputation account.

#### Resident withholding ta

The resident withholding tax rate for interest and dividends is unchanged. Inland Revenue is currently considering the merits of an operational review of RWT to determine whether efficiencies can be made.

As a result, when a taxpayer who is subject to RWT receives a dividend fully imputed using the 30/70 tax credit ratio, they will be subject to withholding tax deductions of 3%.

A concession has been made for unit trusts and group investment funds that have not previously accounted for RWT on dividends. These entities will be able to calculate RWT at 30/70ths of the cash dividend. The amount payable will be after deducting any imputation credits. This will generally mean that no RWT is payable by those entities. The rationale for the concession is that a number of unit trusts and group investment funds that pay dividends have no RWT system in place as to date they have only paid fully imputed dividends and therefore have not needed to deduct RWT. It is inappropriate to require these entities to implement systems to account for RWT at 33/67 when consideration is being given to reviewing the RWT system.

#### Clarification of policy - business restructuring to take advantage of the reduction in the company tax rat

In a very high percentage of cases the restructuring of a business into a corporate form cannot be considered to be "tax avoidance". However, applying the tax avoidance provisions may be considered if the restructuring results in the alienation of income that is essentially personal services income. In some cases the alienation also effectively undermines some of the government's social assistance programmes, such as Working for Families tax credits, which are based on the tax definition of "assessable income".

For example, surgeons who corporatise their private practice but don't receive most of the taxable income from that structure may be asked if their use of the corporate structure is appropriate from a taxation perspective.

**Schedule of proposed legislative changes**

The following table contains the extraneous section MZ references in the Income Tax Act 2004 that will be retrospectively repealed:

The following changes are also proposed for the Income Tax Act 2004, on the basis that they are supposed to apply from either 1 April 2008 of the 2008-09 income year and therefore don't belong in the Income Tax Act 2004:

*   repeal of new section GC 14EB (section 103 of the amending act);
*   repeal of new subparagraph NF 1(2)(xi) (subsection 179(2) of the amending Act);
*   repeal of the amendments to subsection NF 8(1) (section 180 of the amending Act); and
*   repeal of the new section OB 1 definition of "old company tax rate" (subsection 182(31) of the amending Act).

The following changes are proposed to the Income Tax Act 2007:

*   subsection GB 27(4) will be amended to ensure that the relevant company from which the income is attributed will qualify for the exempt qualifying company treatment if its only income has never been from the personal services that have been attributed, or from interest income;
*   the section LA 9 pointer to section OZ 11 will be repealed;
*   section LP 2(2) will be amended to change the tax credits for supplementary dividends formula to 7/17;
*   subsection LE 1(1) will be amended to provide a pointer to section OZ 11;
*   section OA 18 will be amended to remove the reference to "tax year" (the Income Tax Act 2007 does not use the term "imputation year");
*   subpart OB will be amended to provide an imputation credit account debit when an attributing company elects to pay out an exempt dividend under subsection GB 27(4);
*   the transitional section OZ 10 reference to subsections OZ 5(2) and (3) will be removed and replaced with references to sections LE 8 and 9, and sections LF 6 and 7;
*   section OZ 12 which states how supplementary dividends are calculated when dividends are imputed to more than 30/70, will be amended so that the formula is 67/187.

**20** This is a change from the Income Tax Act 2004.
COMPETENT AUTHORITY ARRANGEMENT The Competent Authorities of the United States and New Zealand have reached the following arrangement (“Arrangement”) concerning the meaning of the term “resident in New Zealand” as that term applies to a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a “unit trust” which is deemed to be a company for purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007) under paragraph 1(1) of Article 1 (Definitions) of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA, signed on 12 June 2014 (“IGA”). This Arrangement is entered into pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 1 of the IGA and paragraph 3 of Article 24 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the Convention between the United States of America and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, together with a related Protocol, done at Washington on December 1,2008. It is understood that for purposes of this Arrangement, “Article” refers to an Article of the IGA. New Zealand Financial Institution under Article 1(1)0) of the IGA Article 1(1 )(l) provides that the definition of the term “New Zealand Financial Institution” means “any Financial Institution resident in New Zealand, but excluding any branch of such Financial Institution that is located outside New Zealand” and “any branch of a Financial Institution not resident in New Zealand, if such branch is located in New Zealand.” Under Article 1(2), “\[a\]ny term not otherwise defined in this Agreement \[the IGA\] shall, unless the context otherwise requires or the Competent Authorities agree to a common meaning (as permitted by domestic law), have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of the Party applying this Agreement \[the IGA\], any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that Party prevailing over the meaning given to the term under the laws of that Party.” A Financial Institution that is a trust is a New Zealand Financial Institution if it is resident in New Zealand. The laws of New Zealand provide residency rules for income tax purposes for individuals and certain entities that have a separate legal personality. Trusts (with the exception of unit trusts) are not separate legal entities in New Zealand, and thus New Zealand does not have residency rules for income tax purposes for trusts (other than unit trusts). Common Meaning of the Term “Resident in New Zealand” with Respect to a Financial Institution that is a Trust (other than a Unit Trust) Pursuant to Article 1(2), New Zealand has requested, and the Competent Authorities of the United States and New Zealand have reached, the following common understanding 1 of the meaning of the term “resident in New Zealand” with respect to a trust (other than a unit trust): Beginning on or before April 1,2017, the term “resident in New Zealand” means, in the context of a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust), a trust that has one or more trustees resident in New Zealand for New Zealand income tax purposes at any time during the reporting period, or is managed by a branch of a trustee located in New Zealand provided that the branch of the trustee is subject to regulatory supervision in New Zealand. However, a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust) would not be considered “resident in New Zealand” if the trust is resident in a Partner Jurisdiction or in another jurisdiction that permits the trust to comply with the requirements of a participating FFI under the U.S. Treasury Regulations, and the trust reports all the information required to be reported pursuant to the Partner Jurisdiction’s IGA or the U.S. Treasury Regulations, as applicable, with respect to Financial Accounts maintained by the trust. Prior to April 1,2017, a trust (other than a unit trust) may rely on any reasonable definition for the term “resident in New Zealand” including, for instance, in the context of a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust), a trust that is established under the laws of New Zealand, whereby the trust is settled, executed, and governed by New Zealand law. Upon signature of both Competent Authorities, this Arrangement is operative. 2
COMPETENT AUTHORITY ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND NEW ZEALAND On June 12, 2014, the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand signed an intergovernmental agreement (“IGA”) entitled, “Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA.” The IGA requires, in particular, the, exchange of certain information with respect to U.S. and New Zealand Reportable Accounts on an automatic basis, pursuant to the provisions of Article 25 of the Convention between the United States of America and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, done at Wellington on July 23, 1982, as amended by a Protocol, done at Washington on December 1, 2008 (the “Convention”). Article 3(6) of the IGA provides that the Competent Authorities of the United States and New Zealand (the “Competent Authorities”) shall enter into an agreement or arrangement under the mutual agreement procedure provided for in Article 24 of the Convention, in order to establish and prescribe the rules and procedures necessary to implement certain provisions in the IGA. Article 24 of the Convention permits the Competent Authorities to also address other matters regarding implementation of the Convention. These matters may also be addressed herein as the IGA is entered into pursuant to the Convention. Consistent with the IGA and after consultations between the Competent Authorities, the Competent Authorities have reached the following arrangement (this "Arrangement”). Terms used both in this Arrangement and in the IGA have the same meaning as in the IGA, unless otherwise specified in this Arrangement. References to Paragraphs and Attachments pertain to Paragraphs of, and Attachments to, this Arrangement, unless otherwise specified. Except as otherwise provided in the IGA, any references to U.S. Treasury Regulations are to the relevant regulations in effect at the time of application. References to Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Publications include updated versions. All references to days comprising time periods for completion of actions refer to calendar days and not business days. However, if such period ends on a Saturday, Sunday or national statutory holiday, it would be treated as ending on the next calendar day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or national statutory holiday. Paragraph 1 OBJECT AND SCOPE 1.1 As provided in Article 3(6) of the IGA, this Arrangement establishes the procedures for the automatic exchange obligations described in Article 2 of the 1 IGA and for the exchange of information reported under Article 4(1)(b) of the IGA. Information to be exchanged pursuant to Articles 2 and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA includes information provided: 1.1.1 by a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, 1.1.2 by or on behalf of each of the following Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions that would be treated as a deemed-compliant FFI under Annex II of the IGA for purposes of section 1471 oftheU.S. Internal Revenue Code (a "Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution”): - a Financial Institution with a Local Client Base, as described in Section lll(A) of Annex II of the IGA; - a Trustee-Documented Trust, as described in Section IV(A) of Annex II of the IGA; - a Sponsored Investment Entity, as described in Section IV(B)(1) of Annex II of the IGA; - a Sponsored Controlled Foreign Corporation, as described in Section IV(B)(2) of Annex II of the IGA; - a Sponsored, Closely Held Investment Vehicle, as described in Section IV(C) of Annex II of the IGA; or 1.1.3 by a Reporting U.S. Financial Institution. 1.2 A New Zealand Financial Institution that would otherwise qualify as a Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution, and thus as a Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution under Article 1(1 )(q) of the IGA, but does not satisfy one or more applicable requirements in Annex II or the relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations is a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution under Article 1(1 )(o) of the IGA. 1.3 As provided in Article 3(6) of the IGA, this Arrangement prescribes rules and procedures as may be necessary to implement Article 5 of the IGA. 1.4 As permitted by Article 24 of the Convention, this Arrangement addresses other matters concerning implementation of the IGA, including: registration, confidentiality and data safeguards, costs, consultation and modification, and publication of this Arrangement. 2 Paragraph 2 REGISTRATION OF NEW ZEALAND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 2.1 In General: The Competent Authorities note that, under Article 4(1)(c) and Annex II of the IGA, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution or Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution would be treated as compliant with, and not subject to withholding under, section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code if the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution or Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution (or, as applicable, its sponsor or trustee), among other requirements, complies with the applicable registration requirements on the FATCA registration website. The Competent Authorities also note the IRS intends to issue a unique Global Intermediary Identification Number (“GIIN”) to each Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution and Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution that successfully completes the FATCA registration requirements. 2.2 Inclusion of New Zealand Financial Institutions on IRS FFI List: The IRS intends to include on the “IRS FFI list” (as defined in section 1.1471-1 (b)(73) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations) the name and GIIN of each New Zealand Financial Institution issued a GIIN by the FATCA Registration System. Pursuant to Article 5(2)(b) of the IGA and Paragraph 4.3.2.2, however, a registered New Zealand Financial Institution would be removed from the IRS FFI list if an issue of significant non-compliance is not resolved within a period of eighteen (18) months. 2.3 Exchange of Registration Information: The U.S. Competent Authority intends to provide the New Zealand Competent Authority annually with the information necessary to identify each registered New Zealand Financial Institution included on the IRS FFI list. Paragraph 3 TIME AND MANNER OF EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 3.1 Automatic Exchange within Nine (9) Months: Consistent with Articles 3(5) and 3(6) of the IGA, the Competent Authorities intend to exchange automatically the information described in Articles 2 and 4(1)(b) of the IGA within nine (9) months after the end of the calendar year to which the information relates. 3.2 Format: 3.2.1 Information Described in Articles 2(2) and 4(1)(b) of the IGA: The FATCA XML Schema, as reflected in the FATCA XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5124), and the FATCA Metadata XML Schema, as reflected in 3 the FATCA Metadata XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5188), posted on IRS.gov are intended to be used as the format for the exchange of information described in Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA. The FATCA XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5124) and the FATCA Metadata XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5188) describe the structure of the schemata and include data dictionaries with summaries of the relevant data elements. 3.2.2 Notices: The U S. Competent Authority intends to use the schemata described in the FATCA XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5124), FATCA Metadata XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5188), and FATCA Reports ICMM Notification XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5216) posted on IRS.gov as the format for providing notices pursuant to this Arrangement. 3.2.3 Schema Changes: The IRS intends to post any changes to schemata applicable to a particular calendar year on http://www.irs.gov/FATCA as soon as possible. When feasible, IRS intends to provide notice of such changes prior to posting. The Competent Authorities anticipate a collaborative process concerning schemata changes. 3.3 Information Transmission: 3.3.1 Method: The Competent Authorities intend to use the International Data Exchange Service (“IDES”), as reflected in the FATCA IDES User Guide (IRS Publication 5190) and the FATCA Metadata XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5188) posted on IRS.gov, for all exchange of information, including notices described in Paragraph 4.3, pursuant to the IGA. 3.3.1.1 Use of Regional Router for Transmission: The New Zealand Competent Authority may elect to use a regional router (e.g. the European Union’s "Speed 2”) to transmit information to, and download information from, IDES where the U.S. Competent Authority has approved that regional router in writing for compliance with specified standards, including encryption and internet transmission protocols. This election should be made in writing and delivered to the U.S. Competent Authority prior to transmitting information via the regional router to IDES or downloading information from IDES via the regional router. 3.3.1.2 Use of IDES as a Data Collection Tool: The New Zealand Competent Authority may elect to use IDES as a Model 1 Option 2 ("Ml 02”) data collection tool for its information exchange pursuant to the IGA. The procedures and methodology for using IDES in this manner are described in greater detail in the FATCA IDES User Guide (IRS Publication 5190). The M102 election should be made 4 in writing and delivered to the U.S. Competent Authority prior to the uploading or downloading of information to or from IDES by a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution or by or on behalf of a Paragraph 1,1.2 Financial Institution. 3.3.1.3 Consistency: The Competent Authorities intend that an election described in Paragraph 3.3.1.1 or 3.3.1.2 would be applied consistently to all information uploaded or downloaded from the time of the election, unless such election is properly revoked consistent with Paragraph 3.3.1.4. 3.3.1.4 Revocation of Election: The New Zealand Competent Authority may revoke an election described in Paragraph 3.3.1.1 or 3.3.1.2 following consultation with, and written notice to, the U.S. Competent Authority. 3.3.2 When Information is Exchanged: Information described in Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA would be considered exchanged at the time of receipt specified in Paragraph 3.3.4. See Paragraph 5.2 concerning each Competent Authority’s responsibility for maintaining confidentiality and other protections with respect to exchanged information. 3.3.3 Feedback and Consultation: The Competent Authorities understand that feedback with regard to data quality and usability is an important element of the exchange process and they may consult with each other as provided in Paragraph 7.2 about data error or transmission problems inadequately addressed through standard notification processes over IDES. 3.3.4 Time of Receipt: Except as described below, information transmitted via IDES by the New Zealand Competent Authority would be considered provided to, and received by, the U.S. Competent Authority on the date the information is successfully uploaded onto IDES. Except as described below, information transmitted by the U.S. Competent Authority via IDES would be considered provided to, and received by, the New Zealand Competent Authority on the date the information is available for downloading from IDES. 3.3.4.1 Regional Router: If the New Zealand Competent Authority elects the use of a regional router for information transmission via IDES, information the regional router transmits would be considered provided to, and received by, the U.S. Competent Authority on the date it is successfully uploaded from the router to IDES, and information transmitted by the U.S. Competent Authority would be considered provided to, and received by, the New Zealand Competent Authority on the date it is available for downloading to the router from IDES. 5 3.3.4.2 M102 Data Collection Tool: If the New Zealand Competent Authority elects to use IDES as an M102 data collection tool, information would be considered provided to, and received by, the U.S. Competent Authority on the date the New Zealand Competent Authority approves and therefore releases the information on IDES to the U.S. Competent Authority, and information transmitted by the U.S. Competent Authority would be considered provided to, and received by, the New Zealand Competent Authority on the date it is available for downloading from IDES. See FATCA IDES User Guide (IRS Publication 5190). 3.4 Notification of File Processing Success or Failure: 3.4.1. Notification of File Processing Success: Within fifteen (15) days of successfully receiving a file containing the information described in Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA in the time and manner described in Article 3(5) of the IGA and in Paragraph 3, the Competent Authority receiving the file (the “receiving Competent Authority”) should provide notice of such successful receipt to the Competent Authority providing the file (the “providing Competent Authority"). The U.S. Competent Authority expects to generate such notification automatically through the International Compliance Management Model (“ICMM”) and transmit it via IDES. The notice need not express the receiving Competent Authority’s view about the adequacy of the information received or whether the receiving Competent Authority believes that the providing Competent Authority should take measures pursuant to Article 5 of the IGA to obtain corrected or complete information. 3.4.2. Notification of File Processing Failure: Within fifteen (15) days of receiving a file containing information that cannot be processed, the receiving Competent Authority should provide notice of such processing failure to the providing Competent Authority. The U.S. Competent Authority expects to generate such notification automatically through the ICMM and transmit it via IDES. 3.4.3 ICMM: A description of, and additional information regarding, ICMM, including the (i) FATCA Reports ICMM Notifications User Guide (IRS Publication 5189), and (ii) FATCA Reports ICMM Notification XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5216), can be found on IRS.gov. 3.5 Transliteration: Any information the New Zealand Competent Authority exchanges that is reported in a non-Latin domestic alphabet or literation is expected be transliterated pursuant to New Zealand domestic procedures or rules aligned with international standards for transliteration (for example as specified in ISO 8859) into the Latin alphabet. The New Zealand Competent Authority may send designatory data (e.g., name or address) both in its domestic alphabet or literation and separately in the Latin alphabet within each account 6 record if it so chooses. The New Zealand Competent Authority should also be prepared to transliterate the information it receives from the U.S. Competent Authority from the Latin alphabet to any non-Latin domestic alphabet or literation it uses or accepts. Paragraph 4 REMEDIATION AND ENFORCEMENT 4.1 In General: The U.S. Competent Authority and the New Zealand Competent Authority should each seek to ensure that all of the information specified in Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA has been identified and reported to the U.S. Competent Authority and the New Zealand Competent Authority, as applicable, so that such information is available to be exchanged in the time and manner described in Article 3(5) of the IGA and in Paragraph 3. 4.2 Categories of Non-Compliance: Non-compliance with the IGA may be administrative or minor in nature, or may constitute significant non-compliance. 4.2.1 Significant Non-Compliance: Under Article 5(2) of the IGA, the receiving Competent Authority has the discretion to determine whether there is significant non-compliance with the obligations to obtain and exchange information described in Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA with respect to a Reporting Financial Institution in the other jurisdiction. The U.S. Competent Authority also has the discretion to determine significant non-compliance based on failure to satisfy due diligence, reporting, withholding and other obligations with respect to a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution. The receiving Competent Authority may determine that certain failures constitute significant non-compliance with respect to a Reporting Financial Institution regardless of whether the failure is attributable to the providing Competent Authority or the Reporting Financial Institution. Examples of significant non-compliance are set forth in Paragraphs 4.2.1.1 through 4.2.1.3. 4.2.1.1 Reporting Failures: The U.S. Competent Authority may find significant non-compliance based on a failure by a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to report information on U.S. Reportable Accounts, as specified in Article 4(1 )(a) of the IGA, or on 2015 and 2016 payments to Nonparticipating Financial Institutions, as specified in Article 4(1)(b) of the IGA. 4.2.1.2 Failure to Timely Correct: Failure by a Reporting Financial Institution to correct administrative or other minor errors may, in the discretion of the receiving Competent Authority, 7 lead to a determination of significant non-compliance. The Competent Authorities expect, however, that in the ordinary course a determination of such significant non-compliance would not occur until at least 120 days after the notice specified in Paragraph 4.3.1 is provided to, and received by, the providing Competent Authority (per Paragraph 3,3.4). 4.2.1.3 Other Non-compliance Under the IGA: The U.S. Competent Authority may make a determination of significant non- compliance with respect to a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to the extent it does not meet the conditions set forth in Article 4 of the IGA, including by failing to (i) withhold on any U.S. Source Withholdable Payment made to any Nonparticipating Financial Institution to the extent required under Article 4(1)(d) of the IGA; (ii) provide to any immediate payor of a U.S. Source Withholdable Payment the information required for withholding and reporting on any such payment to a Nonparticipating Financial institution to the extent required under Article 4(1 )(e) of the IGA; and (iii) comply with Article 4(5) of the IGA with respect to Related Entities and branches that are Nonparticipating Financial Institutions. Lack of compliance with other conditions set forth in Article 4, such as compliance with applicable registration requirements, may also lead to a determination of significant non-compliance with regard to a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution. 4.2.1.4 Consultation: In the ordinary course, the Competent Authorities anticipate consultation prior to a determination of significant non-compliance. 4.2.2 Administrative or Other Minor Errors: Under Article 5(1) of the IGA, administrative and other minor errors include incorrect or incomplete reporting of information described under Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA or other errors that result in infringements of the IGA. 4.2.2.1 Self-initiated Reporting Changes: In the event a providing Competent Authority receives a notice from a Reporting Financial Institution or by or on behalf of a Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution regarding an omission or other error in an exchanged report, the report should be amended. The providing Competent Authority should forward any amended reports to the receiving Competent Authority as soon as practicable. 4.3 Notification Procedures: To address non-compliance, the receiving Competent Authority would notify the providing Competent Authority pursuant to Article 5 of the IGA. The notification procedures would differ depending upon whether the 8 receiving Competent Authority seeks to address administrative or other minor errors or significant non-compliance. 4.3.1 Procedures for Administrative or Other Minor Errors: As provided in Article 5(1) of the IGA, the receiving Competent Authority would notify the providing Competent Authority when the receiving Competent Authority has reason to believe that administrative errors or other minor errors may have led to incorrect or incomplete information reporting or result in other infringements of the IGA. The providing Competent Authority would then apply its domestic law (including applicable penalties) to obtain complete and correct information or to resolve other minor or administrative infringements of the IGA and exchange such information with the receiving Competent Authority. 4.3.2 Procedures for Significant Non-Compliance: 4.3.2.1 In General: Under Article 5(2) of the IGA, the receiving Competent Authority would notify the providing Competent Authority when the receiving Competent Authority has determined there is significant non-compliance with the obligations under the IGA with respect to a Reporting Financial Institution. After such notification of significant non-compliance from the receiving Competent Authority, the providing Competent Authority would apply its domestic laws (including applicable penalties) to address the significant non- compliance described in the notice. The Competent Authorities may consult on the steps needed to address such non-compliance. If the U.S. Competent Authority were to notify the New Zealand Competent Authority of a determination of significant non-compliance, the date on which notification was provided to, and received by, the New Zealand Competent Authority (per Paragraph 3.3.4) would constitute the beginning of the eighteen (18) month period set forth in Article 5(2)(b) of the IGA. 4.3.2.2 Notice to Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution: The New Zealand Competent Authority should notify the relevant Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution of the significant non-compliance determination, including the date the U.S. Competent Authority provided notice of such non-compliance to the New Zealand Competent Authority (per Paragraph 3.3.4). The notice should also indicate that if the significant non-compliance is not cured within eighteen (18) months after the date the U.S Competent Authority provided notice to the New Zealand Competent Authority, the relevant Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may be treated as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, its name may be removed from the IRS FFI list, and it may therefore be subject to 30-percent withholding under section 1471(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. 9 4.4.1 The Competent Authorities intend calendar years 2014 and 2015 to be a transition period for purposes of the enforcement and administration of any data collection, due diligence, information reporting, automatic information exchange, and withholding requirements described in the IGA. The Competent Authorities intend to take into account the good faith efforts of each other, Reporting Financial Institutions, and Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institutions toward compliance with any such requirements during this transition period when pursuing enforcement. 4.4.2 The transition period described in Paragraph 4.4.1 may be extended by mutual written decision of the Competent Authorities. 4.4 Transition Period for Remediation and Enforcement: Paragraph 5 CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA SAFEGUARDS 5.1 Confidentiality and Use: in accordance with Article 3(7) of the IGA, all information exchanged pursuant to the IGA is subject to the confidentiality and other protections provided for in the Convention (hereinafter “Confidentiality Protections”), including the provisions limiting the use of the information exchanged. The Competent Authorities intend to maintain appropriate safeguards and infrastructure (“Data Safeguards”). 5.2 Transmission Risk and Responsibility: The New Zealand Competent Authority intends to maintain Confidentiality Protections regarding information transmitted by the U.S. Competent Authority via IDES from the time it successfully downloads such information from IDES. The U.S. Competent Authority intends to maintain Confidentiality Protections regarding information transmitted via IDES from the time information is successfully uploaded to IDES. Where the New Zealand Competent Authority elects to use IDES as an M102 data collection tool, the New Zealand Competent Authority intends to maintain Confidentiality Protections from the time information is successfully uploaded by a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution or by or on behalf of a Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution to IDES. See FATCA IDES User Guide (IRS Publication 5190). 5.3 Notification of Actual or Potential Breach of the Confidentiality and Safeguard Protections: A Competent Authority should notify the other Competent Authority promptly regarding any actual or potential breach of the Confidentiality Protections, or in the event that the Competent Authority no longer intends to maintain the Data Safeguards. 10 Paragraph 6 COSTS 6.1 Unless the Competent Authorities specify otherwise in writing, each Competent Authority intends to bear its own ordinary costs incurred in administering its domestic iaws and providing assistance under this Arrangement. The Competent Authorities may consult with each other in advance of the incidence of extraordinary costs to consider whether, and if so how, to allocate such costs between the Competent Authorities. Paragraph 7 EFFECT, CONSULTATION AND MODIFICATION 7.1 Operative Date: This Arrangement becomes operative on the later of (i) the date the IGA enters into force, or (ii) the date the Arrangement is signed by the U.S. and the New Zealand Competent Authorities. Once the Arrangement is operative, its provisions apply to all information that is exchanged pursuant to the IGA, including information for calendar years that precede the operative date. 7.2 Consultation: Each Competent Authority may at any time request consultations on the implementation, interpretation, application, or modification of this Arrangement. Such consultation (through discussion or correspondence) should take place within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such request, unless otherwise mutually decided. If the Competent Authority of a Contracting State believes the other Contracting State has failed to fulfill its obligations under the IGA, it may request immediate consultation to ensure fulfillment of the IGA. 7.3 Modification: This Arrangement may be modified at any time by mutual consent of the Competent Authorities, in writing. 7.4 Discontinuation: This Arrangement is intended to be discontinued automatically upon termination of the IGA. In the event of discontinuation, all information previously received under this Arrangement would remain subject to the Confidentiality Protections. 11 Paragraph 8 PUBLICATION 8.1 The Competent Authorities intend to make this Arrangement publicly available through official publication by each Contracting State within thirty (30) days from the last date of signature of this Arrangement. The Competent Authorities expect to set the precise date and time through consultation.

Government agencies are expected to work together and achieve better outcomes for New Zealanders. The Government also expects all New Zealanders to meet their legal obligations. 1.2 A practical way for government agencies to work together to help achieve these high-level objectives is through information sharing of specific information, for specific purposes. Such collaboration also allows for more prudent use of taxpayer funds by agencies. Summary of the proposal 1.3 Both Inland Revenue and the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) hold information that, if provided to the other agency, would help the other agency better discharge their functions and duties. Currently, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Privacy Act 2020 do not allow the sharing of this information between the agencies. 1.4 MBIE has responsibility for a range of services and functions which could be significantly improved through the use of information shared by Inland Revenue which is custodian to a large amount of taxpayer information. 1.5 Inland Revenue currently exchanges information with certain areas of MBIE for different purposes but expanding the range of purposes would be beneficial. In turn, Inland Revenue’s administration of the tax system could also benefit by receiving certain information from MBIE. 1.6 More specifically, the Government believes that certain problems reported by both agencies could be alleviated through expanded information sharing. These problems include, but are not limited to, ‘phoenix companies’ 1 , levels of non-compliance, and the inability of the agencies to communicate certain information to New Zealand businesses. These issues are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. 1.7 This discussion document sets out the objectives of a proposed approved information sharing agreement (AISA). It sets out the proposed parameters of the information sharing agreement and explains why government considers that it is needed. Public views are sought on all aspects of implementing this information sharing agreement, including safeguards to protect confidentiality. 1.8 The proposed AISA is expected to deliver the following benefits: • Improving the administration and governance of the tax system, some MBIE administered registers, the criminal proceeds regime, and the insolvency regime. • Enabling and co-operation on compliance and enforcement work, including: 1 This includes where company directors transfer the assets of a company to a new company at under market value, or simply leave the debts of the old company behind, with the intention of defeating the interests of creditors of the old company. October 2024 Page 5 of 35 – ensuring the efficient and effective prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution of offences under the Crimes Act 1961 and legislation that either agency administers (where either agency has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has occurred, is occurring or will occur) – ensuring that appropriate penalties and administrative sanctions are imposed on individuals and entities under legislation that either agency administers, and – assisting with decision-making and collaboration on strategic approaches to compliance work and to enforcing the obligations of common customers. • Allowing relevant information to be delivered to New Zealand businesses. • Enabling the development of public policy (including potential costings and impact modelling for public policy proposals).

October 2024 Page 7 of 35 Chapter 2 Background 2.1 The Government proposes that Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) enter an approved information sharing agreement (AISA), under the Privacy Act 2020, to share more information effectively and carry out their respective responsibilities. 2.2 The proposed AISA would help with some current issues faced by the agencies. It would consolidate existing memorandums of understanding and incorporate additional information shares, leading to improved administration of the tax system, some MBIE administered registers, the criminal proceeds and insolvency regimes, and more effective compliance and enforcement work. It would benefit New Zealand businesses by enabling the provision of helpful information to support them. The AISA will also help enable the development of public policy. Current issues 2.3 As mentioned in Chapter 1, the underlying issue is that there is information held by Inland Revenue and MBIE which cannot currently be shared with the other agency. If this information was shared with the other agency, it would have the potential to help both agencies better discharge their functions and duties, save on costs, and improve their efficiency. Some of the specific issues where information sharing could help are discussed below. Phoenix companies 2.4 The Government is concerned about poor and illegal business practices by some company directors, often called ‘phoenixing’. This includes where company directors transfer the assets of a company to a new company at under market value, or simply leave the debts of the old company behind, with the intention of defeating the interests of creditors of the old company. These so called ‘phoenix companies’ have a range of negative impacts for New Zealand businesses and consumers. 2.5 Although there is anecdotal evidence of phoenix companies, the true scale of the problem is not known. There is not one fixed definition of ‘phoenixing’ and its wider conception outside of specific provisions in the Companies Act 1993. There is, therefore, little quantitative evidence about it. This also makes it hard to collect data on phoenixing and leads to confusion amongst market participants. The phoenixing provisions in the Companies Act 1993 aim to address the potential harm caused by a new company having a similar name to an old company, which can lead to consumers and others being misled about who they are dealing with. However, there are other types of behaviours that can also be called “phoenixing”, such as when a company sells its assets below value to a new company, or simply walks away from the company leaving the debts behind. 2.6 There is concern this harmful practice continues to occur and that more could be done to prevent it, particularly when the behaviours are repeated. There is no reliable data demonstrating the scale of phoenixing in New Zealand, but whenever this occurs it can cause significant harm to businesses, individuals, and the New Zealand October 2024 Page 8 of 35 economy. Even low levels of this type of harmful activity impacts on the integrity of the corporate governance regulatory system. 2.7 The AISA would authorise Inland Revenue to give MBIE information that could help combat phoenixing. Specifically, Inland Revenue will be able to give MBIE information that will enable it to better identify phoenix companies, prohibit a person from acting as a director, and bring prosecutions for offences under the Companies Act 1993 that address phoenixing. 2.8 The AISA would also allow Inland Revenue to access director information on the Companies Register to compare contact details, including phone numbers, email, and IP addresses, of a prohibited director with those of the person in control of the new entity. This will help Inland Revenue identify if a prohibited director is associated with, and controlling, a newly incorporated company. This would help determine whether the matter should be referred to MBIE for enforcement action. Compliance and enforcement 2.9 Barriers to information-sharing also prevent co-operation between the agencies on compliance. Both agencies are responsible for the stewardship of their respective regulatory systems and undertake enforcement action against directors and companies who are non-compliant. There can be overlap between the agencies’ jurisdictions, but due to their inability to communicate with one another regarding enforcement and prosecution, the agencies have sometimes separately investigated or prosecuted the same director. This is time-consuming for both the agencies and the director concerned. 2.10 This inability to share information allows opportunities for non-compliance. Both agencies are responsible for conducting investigations and initiating proceedings to address non-compliance in their respective areas. However, existing information sharing agreements are limited and do not permit such usage. 2.11 For instance, MBIE can prohibit a person from acting as a director when: • the person has been a director of a company which failed as a result of mismanagement, or • MBIE seeks orders to have a person disqualified from acting as a director on various grounds including where they have committed specified offences. 2.12 There are some situations where Inland Revenue can prosecute a director for non- compliance but, due to the current restrictions, cannot share this information with MBIE. Because of this, the Market Integrity Branch within MBIE is sometimes not aware of individuals who should be considered for prohibition. This allows these individuals to continue their activities, undermining the integrity of the tax system. 2.13 There is concern that there are many cases where a director should be prohibited but, due to the current restrictions, the agencies are unable to share information that will help to build cases against these directors. Providing information to New Zealand businesses 2.14 Inland Revenue holds information about New Zealand businesses that currently cannot be shared. This includes information such as contact details, industry segment information, business type and size. The MBIE Business and Consumer October 2024 Page 9 of 35 Branch could use this information to contact businesses directly to provide them with tailored information from across government and the private sector, critical to their success, including compliance requirements and support available. 2.15 The lack of an agreement reduces agencies’ ability to provide targeted services to New Zealand businesses and assist in complying with their obligations. As Inland Revenue cannot currently share this information, these interventions cannot take place, leading to greater costs for both agencies. Businesses undergoing compliance activities would also incur extra costs if dealing with both agencies. 2.16 During COVID-19, there was an exemption made under the Tax Administration Act 1994 2 that allowed Inland Revenue to share some New Zealand business information with MBIE’s Business and Consumer Branch. This information sharing proved beneficial for the Business and Consumer Branch to inform businesses of the support they had available to them during that period. This exemption has now lapsed. Policy development 2.17 Another area where there are perceived benefits from information sharing is in public policy development. The agencies both develop policy that affects businesses operating in New Zealand. The agencies collect data to help inform the development of policy interventions. However, as each agency cannot access information held by the other, their ability to develop targeted policy interventions and accurately gauge the cost of new measures or their impact on business is limited. Options analysis 2.18 The agencies considered five possible options to address issues with their information sharing arrangements: • maintaining the status quo • using the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s powers to collect information • making regulations to permit bulk data collection • amending primary and secondary legislation, and • establishing an AISA. 2.19 Each option was evaluated based on its effectiveness in facilitating existing information sharing between the agencies, as well as its ability to enable further information sharing in accordance with current legislation. A full options analysis can be found in Appendix 1. 2.20 The options analysis determined that an AISA was the best way to enable the agencies to share the information that would help one another carry out their responsibilities. 2.21 The AISA regime in the Privacy Act 2020 was designed as a flexible mechanism to enable the secure sharing of information to better facilitate the provision of public services. 2 COVID-19 sharing provision to support MBIE’s communication with businesses on COVID-related initiatives. October 2024 Page 10 of 35 2.22 An AISA can modify the information privacy principles in the Privacy Act 2020 3 (by Order in Council), enabling the sharing of personal information that would not otherwise be allowed under that Act. The information privacy principles to be modified in the proposed AISA are: • Principle 2 – Source of personal information: It will not be a breach of information privacy principle 2 for the agencies to collect personal information from each other for the purposes of the AISA. • Principle 10 – Limits on use of personal information: It will not be a breach of information privacy principle 10 for the agencies to use personal information that they obtain for one purpose for the purposes of the AISA. • Principle 11 – Limits on disclosure of personal information: It will not be a breach of information privacy principle 11 for the agencies to disclose personal information to each other for the purposes of the AISA. 2.23 An AISA gives transparency about the information that may be shared and the purposes of the sharing. It also provides further safeguards, which protect the security of the information shared under the AISA. Such transparency and safeguards are designed to encourage public trust in the information sharing process. 2.24 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) was consulted during the initial AISA drafting process and is pleased to see that the Privacy Commissioner’s recommendations have been adopted with respect to information collected and disclosed for policy development purpose not being able to be used for any other purpose by the parties to the proposed AISA; restrictions on further on-sharing of information; use of anonymised information wherever practicable and taking all reasonable steps to prevent the re-identification of individuals in any research or statistical material published. 2.25 An AISA is agreed between the proposed parties after consultation with the public and further consultation with OPC. Once approved through an Order in Council, the AISA will take effect as secondary legislation. This requires approval from Ministers and Cabinet. 2.26 An AISA can be amended once it comes into force, but if the amendments have any privacy implications, they must go through a robust consultation process (including with OPC) before they can be approved. Amendments require Cabinet to authorise the Governor-General to make an Order in Council approving the amendment to the AISA. 2.27 Information proposed to be shared in this AISA is detailed in Chapter 3, with more detail included in Appendices 2 and 3. Advantages of an AISA 2.28 An AISA can provide the following advantages: • facilitating agency co-operation and efficiency in shared public service delivery while meeting privacy expectations 3 Privacy Act 2020, section 22. October 2024 Page 11 of 35 • legal authority to share where there is a lack of authority or incomplete authority • certainty and assurance about how information will be protected, reported and deleted • accountability and transparency for the public about information sharing arrangements • potential to accommodate multiple parties – either as signatories to the agreement, or through a representative party • flexibility to tailor privacy safeguards in the AISA depending on the privacy risks involved, and • flexibility to make minor changes without further legislative instruments. Proposed parties to the AISA 2.29 The proposed parties to the AISA are Inland Revenue and two branches in MBIE, the Market Integrity Branch (MIB) and the Business and Consumer Branch (BCB) (the parties). Given the size and scope of MBIE, it is appropriate to narrow the application of the AISA to the relevant branches and business units below: • MIB’s relevant business units are: – the Business Registries unit (known as the New Zealand Companies Office), which administers a number of registers – the Criminal Proceeds, Integrity, and Enforcement unit (CPIE), which manages criminal proceeds and undertakes compliance and enforcement functions for the Registrars of the registers administered by the Companies Office and the Official Assignee – the Insolvency and Trustee Service unit (ITS), which administers certain types of bankruptcy and some company liquidations • BCB’s relevant business unit is the Small Business Services unit (known as business.govt.nz), which supports New Zealand businesses. 2.30 If there are any changes to the branches and business units, which undertake the functions listed above, the parties would look to update the names used in the AISA. Current state and limitations 2.31 Inland Revenue and MIB already exchange information through three memorandums of understanding (MOUs). These MOUs allow Inland Revenue and MIB to work together to manage removals from the New Zealand Companies Register and the Limited Partnerships Register, investigate specific offences under the Companies Act 1993, and manage insolvencies. BCB has also previously been able to use information from Inland Revenue, through an MOU, to send newsletters, updates, and other communications to businesses on COVID-19 related initiatives. 2.32 Although there are three MOUs in place to facilitate an exchange, the agencies cannot share additional information beyond the scope of the MOUs as the Tax Administration Act 1994 and Privacy Act 2020 do not allow this. October 2024 Page 12 of 35 2.33 The tax system must keep taxpayers' information confidential to encourage voluntary compliance with tax rules. The Tax Administration Act 1994 requires Inland Revenue staff to keep all sensitive revenue information confidential, including information that is reasonably capable of identifying a person or entity. Inland Revenue can share such information with agencies such as MBIE only where an exception in the Act applies. 2.34 The Privacy Act 2020 ensures responsible information sharing between the agencies. They are typically unable to share much of the personal information they hold about individuals with each other. 2.35 Inland Revenue has information-gathering powers to obtain MBIE-held information using section 17B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, using section 17B can lack transparency and public scrutiny. Inland Revenue takes the view that this power should be used judiciously and that other, more transparent, avenues for obtaining information on an ongoing basis (such as an AISA) should be considered in appropriate cases. 2.36 The agencies have identified that if they could share some additional information, they would be able to better discharge their functions and duties. They have carefully considered what information would be needed and defined the purposes of the sharing. They have also considered what sharing would require the authority of an AISA, as opposed to what can already be shared under the Privacy Act 2020 or the Tax Administration Act 1994. October 2024 Page 13 of 35 Chapter 3 The proposals 3.1 An AISA can effectively address current legal restrictions, as it is one of the few exemptions to the confidentiality obligations in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Additionally, an AISA can modify restrictions in the Privacy Act 2020 that would otherwise prevent information sharing. Moreover, an AISA would enable Inland Revenue and MIB to consolidate their existing information sharing agreements (replacing the three MOUs), enable information sharing with BCB, and include additional provisions for a broader range of purposes under a single agreement. Proposed AISA 3.2 The existing and additional shares under the proposed AISA can be categorised according to the type of information being shared between Inland Revenue (IR), MIB, and BCB. Table 1 summarises each category of proposed information share and the associated parties. Full details of each category can be found in Appendix 2.

Each section includes narrative around the current arrangements, proposed changes, use of information, and related benefits. 3.4 Inland Revenue, MIB, and BCB will consider all feedback and may make changes to the proposed AISA based on this. The parties will then communicate feedback to relevant Ministers when the proposed AISA is put forward for their approval. Cabinet will also need to authorise Ministers to make a recommendation to the Governor- General to make an Order in Council approving the AISA. October 2024 Page 15 of 35 Chapter 3.1: Information sharing between IR and the Companies Office in MBIE’s MIB Category of information shared Description Information flow 1. Register information Expansion of existing share IR  MIB 2. Removal and restoration information Expansion of existing share IR  MIB 3. Contact details New share IR  MIB 4. Large company information New share IR  MIB 3.5 The Companies Office is a unit within MBIE’s Market Integrity branch (MIB), which is responsible for the administration of a number of public corporate registers. Category 1: Register information (expansion of existing share) Existing information sharing 3.6 Inland Revenue regularly uses its information collection powers under the Tax Administration Act 1994 to obtain information held by the Companies Office on, or in relation to, the Companies Register. Inland Revenue uses this information to assist in the administration of the tax system, including to assist with service delivery and to support its compliance and enforcement functions. For example, Inland Revenue uses the Companies Register information to update its contact details for taxpayers and to identify who owns or controls an entity or to check for associations between individuals and companies. 3.7 The types of information sought by Inland Revenue include both personal and non- personal information. The information is mainly sourced from publicly available parts of the Companies Register, but it also includes other information, such as a director’s date and place of birth, which is held by the Registrar but not available to the public. 3.8 The existing information sharing will be incorporated into the proposed AISA. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.9 Under the proposed AISA, Inland Revenue would have more effective access to the Companies Office publicly available information on the following registers 4 : • New Zealand Companies Register, established under the Companies Act 1993 • Incorporated Societies Registers, being the register established under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 and the newer register established under the Incorporated Societies Act 2022, and • Incorporated Charitable Trust Boards Register (Charitable Trusts Register), established under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. 4 The register information that can be viewed by the public includes information in data fields and documents, which have been filed for an entity. Under the proposed ASIA, Inland Revenue would only receive the information in data fields, meaning they would not receive copies of documents filed. October 2024 Page 16 of 35 3.10 The Companies Office would also give Inland Revenue certain information held by the Registrars that is relevant to these registers, but which is not publicly available. 3.11 Details of the types of information to be shared in respect of each register is set out in Appendix 3. The types of information are split into those that are publicly available on the registers, and those that are not publicly available. 3.12 Inland Revenue will use the information from the Companies Office to: • verify and update the contact details it holds for taxpayers and other parties • assist with service delivery and the provision of services to taxpayers • help businesses to comply with their tax obligations • support Inland Revenue’s compliance and enforcement functions, including prevention, detection and enforcing offences under any legislation it administers (currently or in the future) and other non-compliance with tax obligations, and • assist in tax policy development and assessing the impact of tax policy products. 3.13 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.14 The registers held by the Companies Office are the legislatively designated sources of information for entities such as companies, charitable trust boards, and incorporated societies. They contain information relating to the ownership and control of entities in New Zealand. 3.15 The registers are comprehensive sources of information, populated by information supplied by people wanting to incorporate an entity, register information about an entity, or to otherwise gain or maintain registration status. Other information is also collected by the Companies Office to assist with the administration of the registers (such as contact email addresses). 3.16 The three registers proposed to be included are those with details of entities and individuals most likely to have distinct tax and reporting obligations. 3.17 As of 31 March 2024, there were 726,827 companies registered on the Companies Register, and there were more than 1,230,371 searches of the register during March 2024 alone. These figures evidence the prevalence of companies as the most used corporate structure for businesses in New Zealand and the value of the information on the Companies Register to Inland Revenue. 3.18 Specific registers, such as the Charitable Trusts Register, provide information that Inland Revenue can use to identify non-for-profit entities misusing corporate structures to minimise tax obligations. When used together, information from across the registers is valuable in providing a complete picture of a taxpayer and their interests. Information on the Incorporated Trust Boards Register could assist in the unmasking of non-compliant activity associated with trusts. 3.19 As the three registers do not include IRD numbers, Inland Revenue requires access to certain personal information to accurately identify entities and individuals. For instance, the Companies Office would provide company directors’ names, dates of October 2024 Page 17 of 35 birth, and addresses. Inland Revenue needs this information to accurately link register information to its taxpayer information. 3.20 To help Inland Revenue in linking register information to taxpayer information, the Companies Office will also provide presenter details. A presenter is any person who files a document or information for registration, and presenter details can include name, IP address and email address. Presenter details would be especially useful in verifying the origin of information received from taxpayers. 3.21 Although the three registers are available to the public, and can be searched by anyone, they are built for one-off public enquiry and are built with search criteria that is limited. It is not possible to obtain a full copy of a register through a standard search, to return compilations of register information, or to return bulk register information. The registers are not built for use by government agencies, such as Inland Revenue, to search at scale or to search across registers. 3.22 The proposed AISA would allow Inland Revenue greater access to data to help it carry out compliance and enforcement work. This could include the ability to search across the registers, and in bulk, or to merge register information with information from a variety of sources to create information about business networks. 3.23 Access to the register information will help Inland Revenue to accurately identify which people control which entities (for example, by checking the IP address), giving the agency greater clarity of overall business compliance in New Zealand. This knowledge will better enable Inland Revenue to enforce compliance with tax requirements, which impacts tax revenue and provides an unfair advantage to non- compliant businesses. Minimising this unfair advantage improves the New Zealand business environment. 3.24 The proposed AISA would also allow Inland Revenue to use presenter details and match the IP address of a director filing information with the Companies Office with potentially false and misleading tax returns filed with Inland Revenue. This information can be useful to inform the prosecution of a person filing incorrect tax returns or avoiding paying tax. 3.25 Information from the registers would also be used to assist the development of future policy. The registers contain a wealth of information submitted by the entities themselves, which would be of great assistance in developing and assessing the impact of policy products. Category 2: Removal and restoration information (expansion of existing share) Existing information sharing 3.26 MIB’s Companies Office and Inland Revenue have an existing information sharing arrangement that supports the processes under the Companies Act 1993 and the Limited Partnership Act 2008 to remove entities from the Companies Register and the Limited Partnerships Register. 3.27 The existing information sharing arrangement ensures that Inland Revenue is aware of which companies and limited partnerships are proposed to be removed from the Registers. Inland Revenue would be able to object to a removal where there are grounds to do so, for instance, if tax is still owed, or there is evidence the company is still trading. October 2024 Page 18 of 35 3.28 Under the existing information sharing arrangement, the Companies Office also gives Inland Revenue a list of all current objections Inland Revenue has lodged to the removal of an entity from the relevant registers. This acts as a checkpoint between agencies so Inland Revenue can track its objections and withdraw any that are no longer relevant, enabling removal of entities from the registers at the appropriate time. 3.29 The current information sharing arrangement helps ensure that entities are not wrongfully removed from the register and that objections to removals are withdrawn in a timely manner. 3.30 The Companies Office also gives Inland Revenue a list of companies and limited partnerships that have been removed or restored to the registers, enabling Inland Revenue to update its records. 3.31 The existing information sharing arrangement concerning company and limited partnership removals will be incorporated into the proposed AISA. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.32 The proposed AISA would allow the Companies Office to give Inland Revenue lists of entities: • proposed to be removed from, or restored to, the registers • for which Inland Revenue has an existing objection, and • that have been removed from, or restored to, the registers. 3.33 Inland Revenue would use this information to lodge and monitor objections, and to update its records on companies and limited partnerships. 3.34 The proposed AISA would also allow Inland Revenue to give the Companies Office information about an entity: • that is relevant to Inland Revenue’s objection to its removal or restoration, and • where Inland Revenue considers there may be grounds for the Registrar to initiate removal from, or restoration to, the register. 3.35 The Companies Office would use this information to support the statutory processes for restoring and removing companies and limited partnerships to the registers, including identifying entities for which there are grounds to remove or restore. 3.36 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.37 This category of information sharing will help to ensure that companies and limited partnerships are appropriately removed from, retained on, or restored to, the registers. This in turn, assists in maintaining the integrity of these registers. Category 3: Contact details (new share) Existing information sharing 3.38 No information is currently shared for this category. October 2024 Page 19 of 35 Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.39 The register information that the Companies Office is proposing to share with Inland Revenue under Category 1, includes contact details for entities and individuals. 3.40 If Inland Revenue considers that any contact details may be incorrect, the proposed AISA will allow Inland Revenue to give the Companies Office the correct contact details according to their records. Inland Revenue will also give the reasons why it considers MIB’s contact details may be incorrect. 3.41 The Companies Office would use the information it receives from Inland Revenue to verify or correct the contact details on the registers. 3.42 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.43 Sharing this information would improve the integrity of contact details held on, or in relation to the Companies Register, the Incorporated Societies Registers and the Register of Incorporated Charitable Trusts Boards. This in turn should improve customers’ experience with the parties. Category 4: Large company information (new share) Existing information sharing 3.44 No information is currently shared for this category. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.45 “Large companies” are companies that meet certain asset and revenue thresholds under section 198 of the Companies Act 1993 and section 45 of the Financial Reporting Act 2013. Large companies must file audited financial statements under the Companies Act 1993, which are then made available on the Companies Register. 3.46 The proposed AISA would allow Inland Revenue to give the Companies Office information that will help it identify which companies may qualify as “large companies” under the Companies Act 1993. The information Inland Revenue would provide will include information about the value of companies’ assets and annual revenue. 3.47 The Companies Office would use information provided by Inland Revenue to determine which companies are “large companies” and check whether they have been complying with their financial reporting obligations under the Companies Act. If necessary, when filings have not occurred, the information may also be used to take appropriate compliance and enforcement action against the company concerned. 3.48 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.49 It is important that large companies comply with their financial reporting obligations. Audited financial statements provide persons interested in the performance of a large company, such as lenders or investors, with reliable and transparent financial information. October 2024 Page 20 of 35 3.50 The Companies Office is tasked with enforcing the financial reporting obligations of large companies. However, it does not hold information about every company’s asset and revenue levels. This means it is often difficult for the Companies Office to identify large companies for the purposes of the Companies Act 1993. 3.51 Inland Revenue, however, does hold the type of information needed to identify large companies. The proposed AISA would give Inland Revenue the ability to share this type of information with the Companies Office to enable better enforcement of financial reporting obligations. Question for submitters Do you support the proposed four categories of information sharing outlined in this section? Please explain your answer. October 2024 Page 21 of 35 Chapter 3.2: Information sharing between IR and CPIE in MBIE’s MIB Category of information shared Description Information flow 5. Information relevant to offences and the imposition of administrative sanctions or penalties Expansion of existing share IR  MIB 6. Failed entity information New share IR  MIB 7. Information concerning GST tax status New share IR  MIB 3.52 MIB’s Criminal Proceeds, Integrity, and Enforcement unit (CPIE) is the enforcement arm for the Companies Office and the Insolvency and Trustee Service (ITS). The unit is responsible for compliance and enforcement work under the Companies Act 1993, the Insolvency Act 2006, and other relevant legislation. CPIE also has responsibilities under the Criminal (Proceeds) Recovery Act 2009. Category 5: Information relevant to offences and the imposition of administrative sanctions or penalties (expansion of existing share) Existing information sharing 3.53 CPIE and Inland Revenue have an existing information sharing agreement that allows: • CPIE to request information from Inland Revenue where it suspects certain serious offences have been, are being, or will be committed under the Companies Act 1993, and • Inland Revenue to proactively provide CPIE with information where it suspects those same offences have been, are being, or will be committed. 3.54 This current sharing applies to offences under sections 138A(1), 377, 382(4), 383(6), 385(9), 385AA(9) and 386A(2) of the Companies Act 1993. These are serious offences punishable by up to five years imprisonment. 3.55 This information sharing is authorised by an exception in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3.56 The existing information sharing will be incorporated into the proposed AISA. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.57 Under the proposed AISA, Inland Revenue and CPIE will be able to share with one another: • information relevant to the enforcement of any offences under the Crimes Act 1961 and any legislation that warrants imposition of administrative sanctions or penalties that Inland Revenue or CPIE administer (not just serious offences punishable by up to five years imprisonment), including insolvency and tax- related offences October 2024 Page 22 of 35 • information relevant to the imposition of administrative sanctions and penalties (such as prohibition from being a director) under legislation that Inland Revenue or CPIE administer, and • information about each party’s compliance and enforcement approach and activities, including: – the party’s current priorities for compliance and enforcement – the party’s resources dedicated or available to compliance and enforcement matters – any policies and guidelines relevant to compliance and enforcement – current enforcement and compliance activities, and – details of compliance or enforcement activities against an entity or individual where they know or reasonably suspect the other may also be carrying out compliance or enforcement activity. 3.58 Inland Revenue and CPIE may each use the information they receive from the other to: • prevent, detect, investigate, and provide evidence of offences or of breaches giving rise to administrative sanctions or penalties that may require compliance or enforcement action by that party • prosecute or impose administrative sanctions or penalties • help decision-making on the party’s approach and strategy to compliance and enforcement, and • collaborate with the other party on compliance and enforcement actions such as co-ordinating prosecutions or bringing joint prosecutions. 3.59 Information shared under this category could be used to prosecute an individual or entity. Given the seriousness of such a consequence, the proposed AISA imposes a threshold when either party wants to share information that it thinks the other party may use for the purpose of prosecuting an offence. In that situation, a party may share the information only if it: • has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been, is being, or is likely to be committed, and • believes the information is relevant to the other party being able to detect, investigate, or prosecute that offence. 3.60 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.61 Inland Revenue and CPIE both hold information that is relevant to each other’s enforcement and compliance functions. However, Inland Revenue can currently only share limited Companies Act offence-related information with CPIE. In turn, CPIE can generally only share such information with Inland Revenue where permitted under the Privacy Act 2020. 3.62 The proposed AISA would enable the parties to exchange information about a broader range of behaviour, misconduct, and offending, better enabling each party October 2024 Page 23 of 35 to identify more situations warranting enforcement or compliance action and to put forward more robust prosecutions. 3.63 For example, where a person has been a director in multiple company failures, or a single failed company with a substantial tax debt, Inland Revenue is likely to hold relevant information (such as about tax debt), which it can helpfully share with CPIE, enabling it to prohibit that person from being a director or managing a company under the Companies Act 1993. 3.64 The proposed AISA would also benefit Inland Revenue by allowing it to use presenter details and match the IP address of a director filing information with the Companies Office with potentially false and misleading tax returns filed with Inland Revenue. This information can be useful to inform the prosecution of a person filing incorrect tax returns or avoiding paying tax. 3.65 Inland Revenue administers legislation that is designed to uphold the integrity of the tax system by imposing penalties on individuals and entities that incur but do not discharge the debts they owe. Inland Revenue is aware of cases where entities are being used as vehicles for non-compliant tax activities. Individuals who use the protections of limited liability to incur debts to other businesses and the tax system, and who avoid discharging them, place the integrity of the tax system at risk. It also gives non-compliant businesses a competitive advantage over compliant ones. 3.66 In these situations, Inland Revenue undertakes investigations and enforcement to minimise future tax risk and demonstrate that it will act to protect the integrity of the tax system. Although Inland Revenue has limited ability to prevent the repetition of this behaviour and the risks it poses to other businesses, creditors, and the tax system, CPIE may be able to prohibit an individual from being a manager or director of a company. 3.67 CPIE administers legislation that is designed to uphold the integrity of the corporate governance regulatory system, for example, by preventing financial harm due to the misuse of incorporation and limited liability. Entities that are in a ‘better’ financial position by not discharging their debts place compliant entities at a disadvantage. This can significantly damage the financial lives of individuals who invest or trade with such entities or are employed by them. 3.68 While there can be an overlap between their jurisdictions, both Inland Revenue and CPIE are currently limited in what offence and compliance-related information they can share with one another. Inland Revenue and CPIE are not always aware of entities and individuals who should be considered for compliance or enforcement action under legislation they administer. This means some people may get away with non- compliance on occasion, undermining the integrity of the tax system and the corporate governance regulatory system. 3.69 For example, the AISA will allow Inland Revenue to share information with CPIE that is relevant to CPIE’s consideration of whether a director of a failed company has breached the phoenix company provisions in section 386A of the Companies Act 1993 or whether an exception to the general offence provisions applies. In general terms, section 386A prohibits directors of failed companies from being a director of, or being involved in, the formation or management of a phoenix company with the same or a similar name as the failed company in specified periods. The legislation October 2024 Page 24 of 35 provides for certain exceptions, including where the phoenix company has been known by that name and has not been dormant for specified periods. Under the ASIA, Inland Revenue would be able to provide CPIE with information such as trading and accounting records for an entity, which would evidence whether it had been dormant. 3.70 Current limitations to information sharing also impede Inland Revenue and CPIE’s ability to collaborate and co-operate on compliance and enforcement activities, such as co-ordinating prosecutions or bringing joint prosecutions. On occasion, Inland Revenue and CPIE have separately investigated or prosecuted the same director for the same corporate mismanagement, albeit in relation to different offences. 3.71 Establishing a closer working relationship through the AISA will help Inland Revenue and CPIE avoid disconnected proceedings against the same person or entity. This will result in improved public services through more efficient use of expertise and resources. This in turn will help uphold the integrity of the corporate governance regulatory system and the tax system. Category 6: Failed entity information (new share) Existing information sharing 3.72 No information is currently shared for this category. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.73 The proposed AISA would allow Inland Revenue to give CPIE information about any company or limited partnership that Inland Revenue reasonably suspects may be a failed entity. A failed entity is a company that meets any of the criteria in section 385(1) of the Companies Act 1993 or a limited partnership that meets any of the criteria under section 103D(1) of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. These criteria include companies and limited partnerships that are insolvent and have been put into some form of administration, such as liquidation or voluntary administration. 3.74 CPIE would use the information to support the exercise of the Registrars’ powers under: • section 385 of the Companies Act 1993, which allows the Registrar to prohibit a person from being a director of a company or from being involved in the management of a company, and • section 103D of the Limited Partnership Act 2008, which allows the Registrar to prohibit a person from being a general partner of a limited partnership or from being involved in the management of a limited partnership. 3.75 These powers of prohibition can be used by the Registrar only where there is evidence that mismanagement was wholly or partly responsible for the failure of a company or limited partnership. 3.76 Mismanagement includes failures to pay taxes or failures to keep records that correctly record the transactions of a company or limited partnership. In most cases where a power of prohibition has been exercised, mismanaged entities have failed to account for taxes. 3.77 Inland Revenue holds information that is directly relevant to the exercise of the Registrar’s powers of prohibition. This includes information about a company or October 2024 Page 25 of 35 limited partnership’s tax affairs and finances, and other information that shows the mismanagement of failed entities. 3.78 CPIE would use information from Inland Revenue to investigate failed entities and persons involved in their management (including their directors and general partners). This information could be used as evidence of mismanagement and to support the Registrar’s prohibition powers. 3.79 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.80 This new information share would better support the Registrar’s use of the prohibition powers in section 385 of the Companies Act 1993 and section 103D of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. Use of these powers helps in upholding the public’s confidence in the integrity of New Zealand’s corporate system, given prohibition is aimed at removing persons from office who are not fit to be a director or general partner. The regime serves to protect the public from unfit or unscrupulous directors, deterring others, and setting appropriate standards of behaviour. 3.81 This share would also assist in upholding the integrity of the tax system, as it would assist in prohibiting those responsible for trading to the detriment of the Crown from obtaining an unfair trading advantage. Category 7: Information concerning GST tax status (new share) Existing information sharing 3.82 No information is currently shared for this category. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.83 Under the proposed AISA, Inland Revenue would be able to share information with CPIE about whether an entity or individual is required to account for GST for the sale of property that is subject to an order of sale under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009 that is to be discharged by the Official Assignee. 3.84 CPIE would use the information it receives from Inland Revenue to assist in accounting for GST in the sale of the entity’s or individual’s property. 3.85 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.86 This information share will help CPIE to comply with applicable GST obligations when selling property that has been forfeited. This reduces the risk of MBIE being liable for unpaid GST on any such sale. Question for submitters Do you support the proposed three categories of information sharing outlined in this section? Please explain your answer. October 2024 Page 26 of 35 Chapter 3.3: Information sharing between IR and ITS in MBIE’s MIB Category of information shared Description Information flow 8. Information relevant to bankrupts and company liquidations Expansion of existing share IR  MIB 3.87 The Insolvency and Trustee Service (ITS) is a unit in MIB. ITS is responsible for administering personal bankruptcy procedures and company liquidations where the Official Assignee has been appointed as liquidator. Category 8: Information relevant to bankrupts and company liquidations (expansion of existing share) Existing information sharing 3.88 ITS and Inland Revenue have an existing MOU that assists them to effectively discharge their respective responsibilities and statutory functions. The current information sharing includes: • ITS provides Inland Revenue with lists of persons adjudicated bankrupt, those admitted to the no asset procedure or who have entered a debt repayment order, and those who are undischarged or whose bankruptcy has been annulled. It also gives Inland Revenue lists of companies for which the Official Assignee has been appointed as liquidator. ITS also provides Inland Revenue with a copy of the sealed order for consent for a bankrupt regarding their employment status. • Inland Revenue provides ITS with information about the GST status of bankrupt taxpayers, advice about the revenue content of tax refunds, and specific information relating to changes in bankrupts’ employment status and their KiwiSaver funds as requested by the Official Assignee. 3.89 All existing information sharing between Inland Revenue and ITS relating to insolvency matters will be captured in the AISA. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.90 The proposed AISA will enable ITS to continue to provide the same information it currently does to Inland Revenue, such as lists of adjudicated bankrupts. Inland Revenue will use this information to maintain its records, undertake operational activities, and to discharge its statutory responsibilities. 3.91 The proposed AISA will also allow Inland Revenue to give ITS any information that may be relevant to the Official Assignee’s administration of a bankruptcy, or a company liquidation being administered by the Official Assignee. Inland Revenue will also be able to share information that is relevant to the Official Assignee’s statutory functions and duties in relation to bankruptcies or liquidations. The type of information that Inland Revenue might give ITS includes: • information about a third party that is or may be relevant to the Official Assignee’s administration of a bankruptcy or liquidation October 2024 Page 27 of 35 • any information regarding tax debts or relevant financial information held in relation to an individual or entity • any known bank account details for an individual or entity, and • information about any civil action that Inland Revenue has previously taken against an individual or entity. 3.92 ITS will use this information to support the Official Assignee’s administration of bankruptcy estates and company liquidations, and for compliance and enforcement under the Insolvency Act 2006 and the Companies Act 1993. 3.93 Additionally, the proposed AISA would allow Inland Revenue to share information when a person who is currently bankrupt has died. ITS will use this information to help the Official Assignee discharge the person from their bankruptcy where they have not filed a statement of affairs. 3.94 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.95 For the purposes of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Official Assignee is classed as: • the personal legal representative of a bankrupt taxpayer, and • the agent of a company where that company has been put into liquidation, and the Official Assignee has been appointed as liquidator. 3.96 This means that Inland Revenue is permitted to disclose to the Official Assignee information about a bankrupt taxpayer or a company for which the Official Assignee is the liquidator. 3.97 However, the applicable exceptions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 do not permit Inland Revenue to disclose information to the Official Assignee that is not directly about the bankrupt taxpayer or company in liquidation, even though it may indirectly impact their affairs. For instance, Inland Revenue is unable to give the Official Assignee information about a third party’s dealings with a bankrupt that might affect that bankrupt’s insolvency compliance (for example, if Inland Revenue held information about a third party purchasing an asset from a bankrupt taxpayer). This sort of information can be helpful to the Official Assignee. 3.98 Section 171 of the Insolvency Act 2006 empowers the Official Assignee to obtain documents by notice in writing from any person relating to the property, conduct or dealings of a bankrupt. This power is in addition to the Official Assignee’s power to summons people to be examined or produce documents in person and allows the Official Assignee to gather information on bankrupt persons. Section 261 of the Companies Act 1993 also provides the Official Assignee with a similar power in relation to companies in liquidation. 3.99 However, the Official Assignee’s information gathering powers do not overcome the limits on disclosure in the Tax Administration Act 1994. As a result, the Official Assignee cannot use these powers to get information from Inland Revenue that it may want to better carry out its responsibilities. October 2024 Page 28 of 35 3.100 The proposed AISA would ultimately clarify and consolidate the basis on which information can be shared between Inland Revenue and the Official Assignee. It would enable the proactive sharing of relevant information about third parties that might affect insolvency compliance. An AISA would also enable the improved administration of the personal and corporate insolvency regimes. Question for submitters Do you support the proposed category of information sharing outlined in this section? Please explain your answer. October 2024 Page 29 of 35 Chapter 3.4: Information sharing between IR and business.govt.nz in MBIE’s BCB Category of information shared Description Information flow 9. Entity information enabling direct communication with New Zealand businesses Expansion of previous share IR  BCB 3.101 business.govt.nz is part of the Small Business unit within MBIE’s Business and Consumer branch (BCB). It supports New Zealand businesses by providing expert guidance and tools. Category 9: Entity information enabling direct communication with New Zealand businesses (expansion of previous share) Previous information sharing 3.102 Under COVID-19 legislation, clause 23B was inserted into Schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which allowed information to be shared between Inland Revenue and other agencies where needed to support the pandemic response. This power was introduced temporarily to deliver COVID-19 support to businesses. 3.103 In March 2020, as part of this all-of-government response, Inland Revenue and MBIE’s BCB entered an MOU enabling the sharing of information for the purpose of contacting businesses impacted by COVID-19. The information shared included: • full legal name and trading name (if applicable) • business contact details, physical address, email address or other addresses • New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) • an ‘in business’ indicator • business type (for example, ANZSIC code 5 ) • number of employees, and • organisation type indicator (for example, self-employed, small/medium enterprise, large enterprise). 3.104 The aim of sharing this information was to enable business.govt.nz to reach businesses with tailored COVID-19 related information and support. The sharing of information helped BCB reach about 500,000 more businesses who were not subscribed to the business.govt.nz newsletter, enabling them to better access support, information, and updates from government as it related to COVID-19. The newsletters also provided support and recovery information, and often included updates from other government agencies. These newsletters were well received, with an average engagement rate consistently above 50%. Recipients were able to easily unsubscribe at any time. 5 ANZIC is the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification. October 2024 Page 30 of 35 3.105 The MOU between Inland Revenue and BCB that enabled this share was underpinned by COVID-19 legislation. However, in a post-COVID-19 context, this MOU and entity information shares between Inland Revenue and business.govt.nz has ended. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.106 It is proposed that Inland Revenue will give business.govt.nz the information listed above for every entity and individual in business in New Zealand, excluding the NZBN number. 3.107 Additionally, it is proposed that Inland Revenue will give business.govt.nz the following information: • business age • location of business (by region) • segment (i.e. micro-business, families, individuals, significant enterprises, small-medium) • revenue (by bands), and • financial ratios (e.g. from IR10 tax return form). 3.108 business.govt.nz will use this information to send direct communications to New Zealand businesses, and to provide tailored support, guidance, and advice from across government and the private sector critical to their success, including compliance requirements and support available. 3.109 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.110 This share under the AISA would ensure business.govt.nz can contact all relevant businesses on an on-going basis, that is, not just in a COVID-19 context. The ongoing communications from business.govt.nz would be targeted to the relevant businesses’ circumstances, enabling businesses to better comply with their obligations and to access the support available to them. 3.111 Research suggests that businesses are likely to be more compliant, successful, and resilient if they have access to the right advice at the right time. 6 Most business owners want to comply with rules and make their businesses a success. However, many struggle to afford expert advice for all issues. Even if this advice is freely available, businesses may not be aware of where to look, what their obligations are, how to act on them, or what they should trust. 3.112 business.govt.nz was established to bring together information in one place to support small businesses. The business.govt.nz newsletter alerts businesses to law changes, new support and issues they may not know about. Each year more and more small businesses use business.govt.nz to find out about law changes and support available for them. 3.113 There is a significant benefit and public interest in businesses receiving information that assists them to comply with their legal obligations and succeed. The best way 6 Inland Revenue’s Young Business Journeys research and business.govt.nz’s New Business Journeys research (which followed on from the Young Business Journeys research). October 2024 Page 31 of 35 business.govt.nz can help businesses is by communicating directly with them, and tailoring information to their needs as much as possible. To do this business.govt.nz needs to be able to reach all businesses and having access to their contact information can assist this process. Having access to information about the nature of the business (e.g. size and type) better helps business.govt.nz to target information to those who will find it most useful. Question for submitters Do you support the proposed category of information sharing outlined in this section? Please explain your answer. October 2024 Page 32 of 35 Chapter 3.5: Information sharing between IR and MBIE’s MIB and BCB Information shared Description Information flow Any of the information that can be shared under Categories 1 to 9 for the development of public policy. New share IR  BCB and MIB 3.114 This is not an explicit category of information share in the proposed AISA. It is open to either Inland Revenue or either of MBIE’s branches (MIB or BCB) to ask one another for any of the information that can already be shared under any of Categories 1 to 9 if they want to use it to help develop public policy. The information shared may be used for potential costings and impact modelling for public policy proposals. 3.115 Where information is shared for the purpose of helping develop public policy, the party giving the information must anonymise the information if practicable. The party receiving it can only use it for public policy purposes and must not subsequently publish or disclose it in a way that any individual or entity can be reasonably identified. Question for submitters Do you support the proposal to exchange information for the purpose of public policy development? Please explain your answer. October 2024 Page 33 of 35 Chapter 4 Privacy safeguards 4.1 Inland Revenue, MIB, and BCB take the protection of New Zealanders’ information seriously. The proposed AISA would include a range of safeguards to minimise any risks of loss, misuse, or improper disclosure of the information that is shared. 4.2 Individuals would continue to have: • the right to seek access to, and correction of, their personal information under the Privacy Act 2020, and • the ability to use the agencies’ internal complaint procedures if they have concerns about how their information has been treated. 4.3 If any serious privacy breach were to occur, the party involved would need to notify the Privacy Commissioner and the affected individuals. The steps that would need to be taken to minimise and mitigate any risk to those individuals from a serious privacy breach include: • designated senior personnel in the party would meet to assess the issue and manage the response • information-sharing would be immediately suspended if there were any risk of on-going breaches, and • the Office of the Privacy Commissioner would be notified if it is a notifiable privacy breach under Part 6 of the Privacy Act 2020. Operational protocols to be developed 4.4 The parties would agree operational protocols under the proposed AISA before sharing any information. The operational protocols will provide details on the methods of information sharing, including: • security arrangements and technical standards for the transfer of information • procedures to verify an individual or entity’s identity, to identify any discrepancies in the information that is held by each party, and how to update that individual or entity’s record • provisions that specify how frequently the information is to be shared and in what format • requirements for the retention and disposal of information shared, and • the appointment and training of authorised staff, so that they can share information appropriately and according to the AISA. Limits on use and disclosure of information shared 4.5 The sharing of information would be permitted only for the purposes set out in the proposed AISA. Each party’s use of the information it receives under the AISA would be limited to the particular purposes for that category of information (see the purposes set out in Appendix 2). October 2024 Page 34 of 35 4.6 The parties will not be able to disclose the information shared under the AISA to any third party, unless the disclosure was: • necessary or incidental to the party’s permitted use of the information • to other parts of MBIE where that is reasonably necessary for a lawful business purpose connected to the purposes of the AISA • to the individual or entity that is the subject of the information, or their agents or advisors, or • permitted or required by law. 4.7 Staff who knowingly disclose Inland Revenue information outside what is permitted by the proposed AISA would face potential criminal liability for breaching taxpayer confidentiality under section 143C or 143D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. On conviction, they could be liable to a term of imprisonment of up to six months and a fine not exceeding $15,000. 4.8 Staff who knowingly disclosed information outside of what is permitted by the proposed AISA would also be in breach of the Public Service Code of Conduct. 7 Secure transfer of information 4.9 The parties propose to transfer the information that is shared under the AISA using a secure transmission method that complies with government security standards, such as SEEMail 8 , Secure File Transfer Protocol, or B2B framework. The transmission method may change over time as new and improved technology becomes available. Information would be shared only by authorised staff. Pre-requisites to apply before information is shared that may lead to prosecution 4.10 Some of the information shared under the AISA could potentially be used by Inland Revenue and MIB to prosecute an individual or entity for an offence under legislation that the party administers. This would be a potentially serious consequence for the affected individual or entity. 4.11 The proposed AISA, therefore, imposes a threshold when either party wants to share information that it thinks the other party may use for the purpose of prosecuting an offence. In that situation, the party may share the information only if it: • has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been, is being, or is likely to be committed, and • believes the information is relevant to the other party being able to detect, investigate, or prosecute that offence. Written notice to be given to individuals before adverse action is taken 4.12 Section 152 of the Privacy Act 2020 requires agencies that are party to an AISA to provide written notice to individuals before any adverse action is taken against them based on personal information shared under that AISA. The type of things that might 7 The Standards of Integrity and Conduct, as defined in the Public Service Act 2020, s17(2) 8 https://www.ict.govt.nz/services/show/SEEMail October 2024 Page 35 of 35 constitute an adverse action include investigating a breach of legislation, bringing a prosecution, or imposing an administrative sanction or penalty. 4.13 The written notice must include details of the proposed adverse action, and the personal information on which the action is based. It must also give the individual 10 working days to dispute the correctness of that information. 4.14 Section 153 of the Privacy Act 2020 allows an AISA to provide that a party may dispense with this written notice requirement. The proposed AISA allows a party to dispense with the notice only where the sharing of personal information gives them reasonable grounds to suspect that: • either: – an offence has been, is being, or is likely to be committed under legislation that the party administers; or – a person has engaged, is engaging, or will engage in activity that means they may be subject to an administrative sanction or may warrant the imposition of a penalty under legislation that the party administers – the personal information is relevant to the party’s decision-making on preventative, investigative or enforcement interventions related to that offence, administrative sanction, or penalty, and – advance notification by the party to the subject of the adverse action would be likely to defeat the purpose of the intervention. 4.15 Other than in these circumstances, Inland Revenue and MIB will be required to give the necessary written notice to the affected individual before taking an adverse action. 4.16 For example, Inland Revenue or MIB might dispense with giving written notice of an adverse action if to do so would likely interfere with an investigation of a suspected offence. Ongoing assessment of the AISA 4.17 The agencies will assess the operation of the AISA annually to check it is operating as intended, and to check that the safeguards remain sufficient to protect the privacy of individuals. This assessment may involve a full audit or some other form of assessment. 4.18 The assessment may include the completion of the security Certification and Accreditation process. 4.19 The results of the assessment will inform Inland Revenue’s report (as lead agency for the AISA) on the operation of the AISA in its annual report. Question for submitters Would there be sufficient safeguards for the protection of people’s information under the proposal? Is there anything else that should be considered? APPENDIX 1 October 2024 Page 1 of 3 Appendix 1: Options analysis Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) evaluated five options to address issues with their information sharing arrangements. These were: • Option 1: Maintain the status quo • Option 2: Use the Commissioner of IR’s powers to request information • Option 3: Make regulations to permit bulk data collection • Option 4: Amend primary legislation, and • Option 5 (preferred option): Establish an approved information sharing agreement (AISA). Each option was evaluated based on its effectiveness in facilitating existing information sharing between the parties, as well as its ability to enable further information sharing in compliance with current legislation (outlined in Chapter 2). Option 1: Maintain the status quo • The first option considered was maintaining the status quo. Under this option, information-sharing between the parties would not be expanded beyond the current settings as Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) cannot legitimise disclosures that would otherwise be unauthorised under the Tax Administration Act 1994, Privacy Act 2020, or any other statute. • Additionally, as the MOU between Inland Revenue and business.govt.nz was underpinned by COVID-19 legislation and has since expired, any proposed entity information shares in Category 9 would no longer be possible. Option 2: Use the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s powers to request information • The second option considered was using Inland Revenue’s existing information- gathering powers, particularly the power to request information in section 17B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to obtain information from MBIE. • The information-gathering power contained in section 17B is broad and could potentially be used by Inland Revenue to access any relevant information from MBIE. However, while it allows Inland Revenue to obtain information from MBIE, it would not allow MBIE to obtain information from Inland Revenue in return. • Using section 17B in this manner also lacks transparency. No Order in Council or other process open to public scrutiny is required for Inland Revenue to request information under this section, and few limits exist on the nature or extent of data which Inland Revenue can request. While this is appropriate for audits and criminal investigations, it is less appropriate for regular bulk collection of data concerning the public. A different approach would allow more public oversight about what data is being collected and why. • Ultimately, this option would not allow Inland Revenue and MBIE to share further information. It would not alter existing information sharing arrangements. APPENDIX 1 October 2024 Page 2 of 3 Option 3: Make regulations to permit bulk data collection • The third option considered was using another of Inland Revenue’s information- gathering powers, set out in section 17L of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to request information. Section 17L empowers the Commissioner to request bulk data on an ongoing, recurring basis for a particular purpose relating to administration or enforcement of Inland Revenue’s responsibilities. • An Order in Council approved by the Governor-General is required to collect information under section 17L. This Order must specify the nature of the information Inland Revenue can request and the purpose for which the information must be used. This allows for public scrutiny and the placement of appropriate limits on what information Inland Revenue can collect. Section 17L is therefore a more appropriate tool than section 17B for ensuring transparency. • However, like section 17B, section 17L authorises the gathering of information by Inland Revenue, but does not authorise Inland Revenue to share information with MBIE. Again, this option would not overcome the legislative restrictions that prevent Inland Revenue from sharing information with MBIE that will help it to better carry out its responsibilities. Nor would it alter existing information sharing arrangements. Option 4: Amend primary legislation • The fourth option considered was legislative amendments to allow the parties to disclose information to one another on a broader basis. This would require amendments to several pieces of primary legislation, including to the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Companies Act 1993, the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, and the Incorporated Societies Acts 1908 and 2022. • This option would allow two-way sharing between Inland Revenue and MBIE and negate the need for Inland Revenue to use its information gathering powers. For this reason, it would be superior to options 2 and 3, which only enable a one-way share of information and rely on the use of IR’s information gathering powers. • Another advantage of this option is that it would require the full parliamentary process, which allows for public transparency and debate. • This option could, however, be complex and take significant time. It would likely involve changes to multiple pieces of primary legislation, and it could take some time for the passage of all the necessary legislation. Use of parliamentary resources for such legislation would limit the opportunity to address other unrelated matters through legislation. • Legislative change may also be a less flexible option than other options considered. If the requirements for information sharing were to change, an Act of Parliament would likely be required to make future legislative changes. • Ultimately, this option would achieve the desired outcomes of providing for existing information sharing and enabling sharing that is currently not allowed. It does, however, come with some difficulties, in that it would be time-consuming to undertake and lack flexibility once enacted. Option 5: Establish an AISA (preferred option) • The fifth option considered was the use of an approved information sharing agreement (AISA). APPENDIX 1 October 2024 Page 3 of 3 • The AISA proposed by Inland Revenue and MBIE would consolidate the existing information sharing agreements in the MOUs, alongside other proposed information shares. Essentially it would create a single authority for the sharing of information between the parties, applying the same processes and protections across all shares. • Importantly, an AISA would enable a two-way share of information between Inland Revenue and MBIE. An AISA can address current legal restrictions, as it is one of the few exemptions to the confidentiality obligations in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (see the exception in section 18B(2)). AISAs can also modify restrictions in the Privacy Act 2020 that would otherwise prevent MBIE from sharing information with Inland Revenue. • The process for developing and approving an AISA allows for public scrutiny and transparency. The parties are obliged to consult with the public, and the Privacy Commissioner, before presenting an AISA to ministers. An AISA will take effect only if the Governor-General approves it through an Order in Council. The Order in Council will ensure the terms of the AISA are publicly available. • The AISA regime in the Privacy Act 2020 provides a clear mechanism for agencies to share information to enable the better delivery of public services. It is a scheme tailored to achieve the types of outcomes that Inland Revenue and MBIE are seeking to achieve. It has inbuilt protections for privacy. For instance, an AISA must clearly set out what types of information are to be shared, the purposes for which such information can be used, and the types of security arrangements that will apply to the transfer and handling of the information. This ensures that individuals’ privacy is not unreasonably impinged and that there are adequate safeguards to protect the privacy and security of information. • An AISA is also easier to amend than primary legislation if changes to it are needed. The mechanism for this would be an amendment to the AISA, which would have effect only once the Governor-General approved it through an Order in Council. The parties would need to consult the public and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner before agreeing to any changes that would have privacy implications. • While AISAs can take time to develop, they are more flexible and less resource intensive to put in place than amending primary legislation and should make less use of parliamentary resources. • Overall, establishing an AISA is a positive step because it would allow Inland Revenue and MBIE to share more information effectively. This will help them fulfil their obligations, uphold privacy expectations, and better discharge their functions and duties. APPENDIX 2 October 2024 Page 1 of 10 Appendix 2: Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment proposed approved information sharing agreement master table of categories of information shares Categories of information Existing information share Information to be shared Purpose for use of information Category 1: Register information Relying on Inland Revenue’s (IR) collection powers in s17B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, IR currently obtains access to some information: • on the Companies Register, or • held by Market Integrity branch (MIB) in connection with its administration of the Companies Register. MIB to give IR certain information held by the Registrars in relation to the following registers: • Companies Register (Companies Act 1993) • Incorporated Societies Registers (both the current register under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 and the new version of the register under the Incorporated Societies Act 2022) • Incorporated Charitable Trust Board Register (Charitable Trust Board Act 1957). The register information provided by MIB will include information on the registers that is publicly available, and also other information held by the Registrar that is not publicly available. The registers themselves include information in data fields and also copies of documents which have been filed for an entity. The register information provided by MIB will include only the information in data fields. See Appendix 3 for specific details of the types of information that MIB will provide for each register. Purpose 2(a) of the Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA), including the following uses: 1. IR may use the register information to: a. verify or update the contact or other details it holds for taxpayers and other parties b. assist with general service delivery and the provision of services to taxpayers c. assist businesses to comply with their tax obligations d. support its compliance and enforcement functions, including to detect or provide evidence of offences under any legislation it administers (currently or in the future) or the Crimes Act 1961 or to detect or provide evidence of non- compliance with other tax obligations e. assist in tax policy development and assessing the impact of tax policy products. In carrying out these purposes, IR may depart from the standard search criteria available to the public when using the register information. For example, IR may search the register information at scale and carry out searches across the different registers and merge register information with information from a variety of sources to create information to support the uses listed above. APPENDIX 2 October 2024 Page 2 of 10 Categories of information Existing information share Information to be shared Purpose for use of information Category 2: Removal and restoration information MIB already shares removal information with IR under an MOU. MIB regularly propose that entities are removed from the Companies and Limited Partnerships Registers. A list of the notices of intention to remove an entity is sent to IR.

APPENDIX 4 Page 9 of 26 (b) Principle 10: Limits on use of Personal Information It is not a breach of information privacy principle 10 for the Parties to use Personal Information that they obtain for one purpose for the purposes of this Agreement. (c) Principle 11: Limits on disclosure of Personal Information It is not a breach of information privacy principle 11 for the Parties to disclose Personal Information to each other for the purposes of this Agreement. 5. The public services that this Agreement is intended to facilitate This Agreement intends to facilitate the following public services: (a) IR’s administration of the tax system, including the protection of the public revenue, the integrity of the tax system and the development of public policy; (b) MIB’s administration of the Registers, including the performance of its statutory functions, duties and powers in relation to those Registers; (c) MIB’s enforcement and compliance activities in relation to the legislation it administers; (d) MIB’s administration of the insolvency regime, including carrying out the functions, duties and powers of the Official Assignee; and (e) BCB’s delivery of information to support New Zealand businesses. 6. Adverse Actions (a) Section 152 of the Privacy Act 2020 requires parties to an approved information sharing agreement to provide written notice to individuals before any Adverse Action is taken against them on the basis of information shared under that agreement, including details of the Adverse Action that the party proposes to take and the Personal Information about the individual on which the action is based. The notice must give those individuals 10 Working Days to dispute the correctness of the information. Section 153 of that Act allows an approved information sharing agreement to provide that a party to that agreement may give a shorter period of notice or dispense with the notice requirement. (b) The Parties agree to dispense with the notice requirement under section 152, in line with section 153(a)(ii), where the sharing of Personal Information under this Agreement gives either of them reasonable grounds to suspect that: (i) either: I. an offence has been, is being, or is likely to be committed under legislation that a Party administers; or II. a person has engaged, is engaging, or is likely to engage in activity that means they may be subject to an administrative APPENDIX 4 Page 10 of 26 sanction or may warrant the imposition of a penalty under legislation that a Party administers; and (ii) the Personal Information is relevant to the Party’s decision-making on preventative, investigative or enforcement interventions related to that offence, administrative sanction or penalty; and (iii) advance notification by a Party to a subject of an Adverse Action would be likely to defeat the purpose of the intervention. (c) The Adverse Actions that a Party may take under this Agreement are specified at Schedule 2. (d) Notwithstanding sub-clauses 6(a)-6(c) above, the Parties may not take any Adverse Action as a result of the sharing of Information solely for the purpose set out in sub-clause 2(d) (regarding public policy development). 7. Where members of the public can view this document This Agreement is available for viewing by members of the public: (a) on the public website or websites of each Party; and (b) in person at IR, 55 Featherston Street, Wellington. 8. Overview of operational details (a) The Information will be transferred securely between the Parties using the methods specified in clause 9 and in accordance with the Operational Protocols.

(g) Operational details will be included in the Operational Protocols, rather than in this Agreement, as they may need to be regularly updated over time, and they relate to matters that it is appropriate for the Parties to manage internally within their respective organisations. The Parties may provide copies of the Operational Protocols to the Privacy Commissioner either proactively or on request. (h) Information will only be accessible by those staff who need to use it for the purposes of this Agreement and who have signed certificates or declarations of confidentiality under the TAA if required by IR. (i) Each Party will be responsible for responding to requests for Personal Information as appropriate in the circumstances, in accordance with Part 4 of the Privacy Act 2020. 9. Safeguards that will be applied to protect the privacy of individuals and ensure that any interference with their privacy is minimised (a) Security Provisions The Parties will have mechanisms and procedures for: (i) the secure storage and transfer of Information in accordance with government security standards (including by encrypted USB Iron Key, SEEMail, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or B2B framework, as applicable to the particular Operational Protocol); (ii) the appointment of Authorised Staff; (iii) the training of Authorised Staff, so that they share Information appropriately and in accordance with this Agreement; (iv) ensuring that the Information is of adequate quality at the time it is provided to the other Party; (v) ensuring that the Information is used only as permitted under this Agreement.

(d) Audit and assurance (i) The Parties will assess the operation of this Agreement annually to check that the safeguards in the Agreement are operating as intended, that they remain sufficient to protect the privacy of individuals, and to ascertain whether any issues have arisen in practice that need to be resolved. (ii) This assessment may (as agreed by the Parties) involve a full audit or another form of assessment that is less than a full audit and that enables the exchange of letters of assurance between the Parties. (iii) The assessment of mechanisms and procedures for the secure storage and transfer of Information may involve completion of the security Certification and Accreditation process that is required by the Government Chief Information Officer at the Department of Internal Affairs. (iv) The Parties will co-operate with each other during the assessment process and will take all reasonable actions to make the required resources available. (v) The Lead Agency will use the results of the assessment to report on the operation of this Agreement as part of its annual report, in accordance with sections 154 to 156 of the Privacy Act 2020.

Assistance statement The Parties will provide any reasonable assistance that is necessary in the circumstances to allow the Privacy Commissioner or an individual who wishes to make a complaint about an interference with privacy to determine the Party against which the complaint should be made. 11.

Inland Revenue wants to provide transparency on tax compliance so business can get on with business. Managing tax risk is a key element of a multinational’s global risk plan. This booklet will inform your planning by openly describing Inland Revenue’s compliance priorities. We list the familiar ten red flags that always attract Inland Revenue attention, and highlight the particular areas to which we pay special attention. Transfer pricing and international financing arrangements are key issues. The OECD is working to combat base erosion and profit shifting across the world, and that work is supported by the G20. Change in the international tax landscape is inevitable. Inland Revenue is actively contributing to OECD dialogue. You’ll see this reflected in local activities, including our focus on international financing arrangements and controlled foreign companies. GST refunds and non-resident remuneration feature. For New Zealand-based tax activities we routinely screen all GST refunds, and we continue to pay attention to tax arrangements for non-resident contractors. Alongside this, we keep looking across all other tax areas to ensure we make tax responsibilities clear and provide straightforward options for people and businesses to file, pay and claim the right amount. The vast majority of New Zealanders and businesses do the right thing and contribute to New Zealand’s prosperity. Inland Revenue’s job is to make it as easy as possible for customers to manage their business with us. We will also take action where companies or individuals are actively avoiding their obligations, and we’ll continue to publish the results of those actions. I am proud of Inland Revenue’s work to support customers and protect New Zealand’s economy and wellbeing. New Zealand already rates highly on international scales for ease of doing business and for integrity — this guide encourages both. 2 www.ird.govt.nz What your taxes pay for Revenue (Inland Revenue Annual Report 2012) Core Crown revenue $49.1bn Expenditure (Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand: Treasury 2012) Core Crown expenses $69.1bn $21.0bn PAY E $13.1bn Goods and services tax $9.1bn Company tax $0.7bn Employer superannuation contribution tax $0.5bn Fringe benefit tax $14.2bn Health $11.7bn Education $2.2bn Transport and communications $2.2bn Economic and industrial services $3.4bn Law and order 3 www.ird.govt.nz How we manage multinationals’ compliance We have introduced a basic compliance package for most groups of companies with annual turnover in excess of $80 million. In total, we have 500 major groups either under direct compliance management or subject to the Significant Enterprises Initiative. Tax governance by multinationals Managing tax risk should be a key element in any multinational’s global risk management policy. New Zealand members of multinationals should be no exception. You should ask yourself these key questions. In addition to our established compliance programme, our Significant Enterprises Initiative 2013 marks a major change in how we approach the risk assessment of multinationals. These groups now provide us with copies of their financial statements, tax reconciliations and group structures at return filing time. This lets us examine a wider range of multinationals more closely, carry out additional macro-analysis of industries and identify variations by jurisdiction. As a result, multinationals can expect to receive far more tailored information requests and audit inquiries from us. We will cover all groups over $30 million in annual turnover using this approach. • Are appropriate resources (including local capability) being applied to tax matters? • Are sufficient internal controls, checks and balances in place and actually carried out? • Is there good tax awareness in critical business areas beyond the central tax or finance team? • Are you aware of legislation changes affecting your business? 4 www.ird.govt.nz We are often quizzed about which particular issues attract our attention and the questions multinationals should expect from us. This ‘familiar red flags’ list may seem obvious, but is worth repeating here so you can prepare in advance, and be able to give us explanations with supporting documentation. The familiar red flags 2013/2014 1 Effective tax rate – is the group’s effective tax rate substantially less than the statutory rate of 28%? 2 “Low or no tax” jurisdictions – has the group participated in any material transactions involving these jurisdictions? 3 Differing accounting treatments – are there material differences in the treatment of major items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes? 4 Large tax benefits – has the group taken part in any transactions where the anticipated net return is predominantly due to projected tax benefits? 5 Cross-border mismatches – are there any differences in tax treatment of a transaction or an entity between countries (eg, debt in one, but equity in another)? 6 Complexity – has the group been involved in any complicated arrangements (eg, major restructures, use of special purpose vehicles or innovative financial arrangements)? 7 Capital gains/tax credits – have any untaxed profits been derived or unusually high foreign tax/ imputation credits been claimed by the group? 8 Tax losses – have any uncharacteristic losses arisen (or been utilised) within or across the group as a whole? 9 Ownership changes – have any mergers, takeovers or ownership changes occurred and affected continuity tests for losses and imputation credits? 10 Variances between years – are there any material variances in profitability, tax payable, or major line items in supporting financial statements for the group? 5 www.ird.govt.nz Tax avoidance – our interpretation statement Even when an arrangement is complex or unusual, or produces tax results that may be undesirable from a policy perspective, it may not be interpreted as tax avoidance. Features like undue complexity, artificiality and circularity can indicate tax avoidance. However, these features on their own do not establish tax avoidance. The Commissioner’s approach to reaching a view on whether there is tax avoidance is set out in our Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 at www.ird.govt.nz \[keyword : IS 13/01\] Briefly, there is tax avoidance if an arrangement uses tax legislation in a way that Parliament did not intend, when the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement are taken into account. 6 www.ird.govt.nz International financing arrangements We will ask for explanations whenever an interest deduction is taken on cross-border funding arrangements, without any corresponding non-resident withholding tax or approved issuer levy being paid. When interest has been paid to a branch without any non-resident withholding tax impost, we will check the bona fides of the branch to ensure the substance truly matches the form. We will examine closely any capital restructurings, which result in major reductions in New Zealand tax paid, especially if an interest deduction results with no economic cost suffered by the New Zealand entity. Getting it right The 2% approved issuer levy is not available to associated parties. Unfortunately, this mistake does occur, which can be very costly to taxpayers. Cross-border financing forms a substantial part of total associated party dealings by New Zealand members of multinational groups. Key issues include the pricing of interest and guarantee fees at market rates, and capital structuring within New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules. New Zealand-owned multinationals also need to account for the very same issues in their outbound financing activities. In our work programme, we are paying close attention to: • structured financing arrangements • hybrid instruments (eg, mandatory convertible notes) and hybrid entities (eg, certain foreign limited partnerships) • unusual financings (eg, long-term subordinated debt facilities) • exotic or novel financial products • all inbound loans of more than $10 million • outbound loans of all sizes (no or low-interest loans, or no fees charged for guarantees). We do not routinely deny interest deductions to taxpayers carrying high debt levels that satisfy the thin capitalisation rules. If a loan transaction would not have taken place in the open market, we may question the commerciality of the financing arrangement between the associated parties. In such extreme circumstances, we would consider using the general anti-avoidance provision. $ 7 www.ird.govt.nz Ask yourself these key transfer pricing governance questions 1. Do you know the nature and extent of your cross- border associated party transactions? 2. If material, do you have documentation to support the transfer prices and do you keep it updated? 3. Has your finance team been fully involved in the documentation process and signed off the factual analysis, as well as the final outcomes? 4. Have you considered an advance pricing agreement? Advance pricing agreements Advance pricing agreements (APAs) are a good example of a more cooperative approach to addressing transfer pricing compliance. Compared with audits, APAs produce significant time and cost savings for both multinationals and tax authorities. We have completed over 100 APAs since the programme started, including a record 21 APAs being finalised in the year to 30 June 2013. Transfer pricing and New Zealand exporters A large number of New Zealand businesses export through their overseas associates. We focus especially on: • use of correct commodity price benchmarks • low/no-interest loans or credit support • recovery of New Zealand costs, eg, research and development and head office overheads • offshore operations returning abnormally high profits. Transfer pricing The overall goal of our transfer pricing compliance programme is to maintain New Zealand’s share of multinational tax, in accordance with our tax law, acceptable income recognition principles and best international practices. We are not alone in wanting to maintain our fair share of the multinational tax pie. Other tax authorities are also implementing and updating their rules and regulations on international transactions, and increasing their audit activities. As other tax authorities put more emphasis on transfer pricing issues, the likelihood of lengthy disputes with these overseas administrations will increase, along with costly double taxation. Where there are difficult or complex issues, we prefer to work through arrangements with multinationals upfront, avoiding disputes where possible. The attraction of this approach for business is certainty – multinationals that behave transparently can expect an earlier resolution of tax issues with less intrusive audits and lower compliance costs. The major transfer pricing risks Our main interest in transfer pricing is in the bottom line. Has the group reported sufficient profit locally? Other fundamental transfer pricing risks include: • no documentation to support transfer prices • material levels of untested transactions • major downward shifts in profitability of a New Zealand company when acquired by a multinational • widely differing profits between the local company, other members of the group, the group as a whole and the industry • New Zealand management accepting prices set by overseas associates without question • the payment of unsustainable levels of royalties and/or management fees • transactions with no or low tax jurisdictions • losses, especially chronic recurring ones. 8 www.ird.govt.nz Some jurisdictions have reputations for aggressive tax collection activities. Should I leave more income in those jurisdictions to avoid conflict? Definitely not – overseas associates should pay the right amount of tax. They should also adopt the arm’s length standard promoted by the OECD and respected by all our major tax treaty partners. Common questions exporters ask us about transfer pricing What effect does a brand or knowhow have on transfer pricing? The benefit of any intellectual property should lie with the owner. It is important to establish where the intellectual property was created and where it is legally owned. For exporters, we would expect the ownership to lie in New Zealand. The intellectual property owner can be rewarded either through the pricing of goods sold to the overseas distributor or direct through a royalty charge. How do I find out if offshore associates have created any intellectual property? You should closely examine any research and development costs and/or above average marketing expenditure, including any spending on market penetration. As the New Zealand parent, you should consider either reimbursing this expenditure (but not at a later date) or some other reward strategy to ensure that the overseas associate cannot claim ownership of the intellectual property. How do I know if offshore associates are performing any specialised functions or providing additional services? Staff remuneration is a good barometer, with highly paid staff generally providing special skills (leading to greater economic value added). Job descriptions are also useful. How can a New Zealand exporter get a quick picture of major international transfer pricing risks? You should closely examine the bottom line returns of your associates. Most New Zealand exporters operate through buy/sell distributors and/or service providers. Ask yourself: • Do their operating margins reflect commercial reality? • Have any targeted strategies been pursued? These may not be easy to explain to tax authorities some years later, especially if plans do not quite work out. If a market development strategy has been pursued, make sure you fully document the expenditure, sales, cost savings, duration and likely payback period from the start. How should I identify and charge out management and other support services provided to offshore associates? You could consider applying Inland Revenue’s guidelines, ie, cost plus 7.5% for non- core/de minimis services. Also, look out for any services requiring specialist knowledge or expertise provided from New Zealand requiring higher mark-ups. Have market interest rates been charged for loans to offshore associates? In general, an offshore associate’s credit rating will not be as strong as the New Zealand parent’s credit rating, so interest charges should exceed the parent’s domestic weighted average cost of debt. As a guideline, an interest rate set at the current bank bill rate plus 275 basis points will be fair and reasonable for small- value loans (less than $2 million in loan principal). What about New Zealand Customs’ requirements? Be careful of the 28-day rule. The New Zealand business must generally export the goods within 28 days of the time of supply to qualify for zero- rating of GST. The standard rate of 15% GST will apply otherwise. 9 www.ird.govt.nz Controlled foreign companies For income years starting on or after 1 July 2009, New Zealand’s amended tax rules for controlled foreign companies (CFCs) have included an active/passive division. In focusing on CFCs, we check technical compliance with these new rules. We also watch for any possible abuse of the rules through aggressive tax planning schemes. Given the total exemption from attribution of income for holders of sufficient interests in active CFCs, there are flow-on tax risks around: • whether foreign incorporated companies are New Zealand tax • how results compare between years • intellectual property transfers and significant financing transactions • utilisation of any carried forward loss and foreign tax credit balances • any unusual transactions or unexpected outcomes. For many enterprises, the comprehensiveness of the old CFC rules meant that transfer pricing matters The OECD base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project resident through their management, control or director decision making • the correctness of cross-border associated party transfer pricing methodologies. In examining compliance with the CFC rules, we look closely at: • any changes in CFC operations between the old and new CFC rules (such as restructuring operations or shifting functions/assets/risks) received little attention, the approach being that a zero sum game would generally result from any lack of pricing policies. Even if this was true, the new CFC rules put an end to this approach. We recommend you have adequate transfer pricing documentation in place to ensure transfer prices involving CFCs are in line with the arm’s-length standard. Addressing international tax evasion From late 2012, global media and political reactions suggest that some multinationals seem to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. The wide range of international tax planning techniques used to achieve these results is collectively referred to as base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Part of the problem is that international tax standards have not kept pace with developments in the global economy. For example, problems arise from complex interactions between the tax rules of different countries. Other difficulties come from an increasing source of multinational profits resulting from intangibles or digital services that can be located anywhere in the world. Just as multinationals are becoming more integrated across their global supply chains, tax authorities are also moving towards greater cooperation and coordination of their compliance activities. New Zealand has been closely involved in the development of the OECD BEPS Action Plan. It will continue to support future initiatives strongly because it recognises that effective action on BEPS requires a coordinated international effort. New Zealand has joined more than 70 other countries in signing the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. The convention provides a multilateral basis for a wide variety of tax administration assistance, including international exchanges of information and facilitating simultaneous/joint audits and assistance in collecting tax debts. Closer to home In New Zealand’s case, we have a wide tax treaty network, including double tax agreements (DTAs) and tax information exchange agreements which we are growing progressively. We have a very close relationship with our major tax treaty partner, Australia, and routinely exchange information on taxpayers and industries with the Australian Taxation Office. We also operate a trans- Tasman financing desk to exchange new or emerging issues about funding arrangements, staffed by experts from both tax administrations. Across Asia, we have definitely noticed an upward trend in exchanges of information between tax authorities. These exchanges are a great help in the earlier identification of aggressive arrangements, which may adversely affect the New Zealand tax base. 10 www.ird.govt.nz OECD BEPS Action Plan – the highlights In each work area, the OECD will develop specific recommendations for member countries to implement. Some will be implemented through a multilateral agreement or updates to the OECD’s existing guidelines and agreements (in particular, the Transfer Pricing Guidelines and Model Tax Convention). Other recommendations will rely on countries being willing and able to make reforms to their domestic laws. The OECD BEPS Action Plan is both comprehensive and multilateral. Over the next two and a half years, the OECD will work on 15 action items. Significant areas of interest to New Zealand include: • considering whether special tax rules are needed to tax digital goods and services provided over the internet • reviewing hybrid mismatches which occur because countries have different tax rules for distinguishing between debt and shares or companies and partnerships • improving CFC rules that allow countries to tax their multinationals on passive/mobile income earned through foreign subsidiaries • reviewing domestic rules for limiting interest deductions (eg: thin capitalisation rules) • preventing the misuse of tax treaties • improving the permanent establishment rules for determining when an overseas business has a taxable presence in a foreign country • improving transfer pricing rules, particularly in relation to debt and intangibles. This allows a taxpayer to present their case to the competent authority to resolve a dispute. As the competent authority, we may: • agree with the merits of the overseas adjustment and give a corresponding downwards adjustment in New Zealand, or • try to persuade the treaty partner to reduce or withdraw their adjustment. International disputes – the mutual agreement procedure Our double tax agreements contain a provision called the Mutual Agreement Procedure, also known as a request for competent authority assistance. We recommend you tell us as soon as possible about any pending dispute with another tax authority. In nearly all cases when there has been early intervention by us as the competent authority, the double tax issue has been successfully resolved.

Failing to recognise associated party transactions Enterprises sometimes fail to report the proper GST on transactions with associated parties. Common oversights include property leases, management services or provision of employee time and supplies of stock. Getting it right Special timing rules apply to transactions between associated parties. • You may disregard supplied goods and services where the parties are GST grouped. • If the parties are not GST grouped, you must account for GST at the right time. Accounting for GST later than required If you are registered on an invoice basis, you must account for the full amount of the GST when any part- payment (eg, a deposit) is received, or any invoice is issued. If you are GST registered on a payments basis, you must generally account for GST when you receive payments. Getting it right You must take care to correctly account for the GST when you take deposits. • Correctly apply the rules for your type of GST registration. • Correctly apply the time of supply rules. Incorrect treatment of non-routine transactions If you engage in non- routine transactions, there is an inherent risk that the usual treatments, processes and controls may not apply. Common oversights include failing to return GST when required, eg, insurance settlements can be subject to GST. Getting it right Apply the correct GST treatment to non-routine transactions, eg, a new property lease with incentive payments, or the sale of a capital asset such as disposal of plant. GST Zero-rating Supplies of exported goods or services may be zero- rated if certain conditions are met, but supplies are often zero-rated when these conditions are not met. Getting it right Generally, for goods to be zero-rated, the supplier must export them. It is not usually possible to zero-rate if the customer exports the goods instead. Preparation errors We receive many GST returns with small errors that can make a big difference to whether the return is correct or not. For example: • mistakes in arithmetic • transposed numbers • blank fields • not including transactions in the correct return period. Getting it right • Take care when filling in your return. • Consider having it independently checked before filing it with us. • Check that you have declared all the relevant transactions for the return period. 12 www.ird.govt.nz When the people you pay are not New Zealand tax residents First things first When you hire people who are not New Zealand tax residents, they generally fall into a couple of categories: • an employee • a contractor, who might be an individual or a company. Employees usually work at the employer’s premises for specified hours and pay, and have signed either a collective or individual employment agreement. If you are a New Zealand resident with employees from overseas, they are treated the same as your other employees. Contractors usually have a contract, agreement or arrangement with an organisation to supply services or equipment under a lease. The organisation generally views the contractor as a supplier, not an employee. Note: This information does not apply to anyone who has migrated to New Zealand with the intention of living here permanently. Where things get tricky If a non-resident contractor receives contract payments, for physically performing work in New Zealand, it is New Zealand-sourced income and in the first instance taxable in New Zealand. Tax must be withheld at the time the contract payments are made. This is the case even if the non-resident contractor is paid by an overseas entity or the money is paid to an overseas bank account. A non-resident contractor will not have tax deducted from contract payments if Inland Revenue has issued them with a Certificate of Exemption, under the terms of a double tax agreement New Zealand has with the country where they are a tax resident. Non-resident contractors can apply for a Certificate of Exemption by completing the form at www.ird.govt.nz/nrcwt. For detailed information about non-resident contractor tax obligations, please email our Non- Resident Contractors’ Team at nr.contractors@ird. govt.nz Getting it right If your business employs non-resident contractors, you must deduct the correct amount of New Zealand tax from their contract payments unless the non-resident contractor gives you a Certificate of Exemption. For employees – benefits and allowances such as cost of living allowances, free accommodation, accommodation allowances, rental support payments, employee share schemes, superannuation payments and home travel are generally subject to tax. These need to be considered when accounting for a person’s total gross income. It’s a good idea to recommend to your non- resident contractors that they contact a trusted tax advisor to obtain their own advice about their New Zealand tax obligations. Check that the right tax type is deducted from benefits and allowances. For example, provision of accommodation is subject to PAYE, not fringe benefit tax. If your company’s payroll and human resources function are outside New Zealand, ensure that payments are converted to New Zealand dollars using the correct exchange rate, before deducting tax. 13 www.ird.govt.nz Executive remuneration Senior executives often receive benefits and allowances as part of their total remuneration package. We usually find that organisations apply the correct tax type and rate to each part of these packages, but we have seen mistakes in taxing less common benefits. For example, cars provided to spouses and low-interest loans to employees can have fringe benefit tax implications. We recommend you take great care around employee tax equalisation arrangements, which commonly occur in executive remuneration packages. Additional sums arising from disparities in personal tax rates, or allowances paid outside New Zealand for services performed by employees in New Zealand are subject to PAY E . Getting it right Benefits and allowances, eg, cost-of-living allowances, free accommodation, accommodation allowances, rental support payments, employee share schemes and superannuation payments are generally subject to tax. These need to be considered when accounting for a person’s total gross income. Check that the right tax type is deducted from benefits and allowances. For example, accommodation is subject to PAYE, not fringe benefit tax. So who pays what tax where? Johan is an IT specialist in the Melbourne office of an American company. You’ve been having issues with your computer systems so you’ve contracted with his American employer to bring him to Auckland for five months to sort things out. When you start the paperwork, you see that Johan is an Australian tax resident even though he is currently working for an American company. Contract payments are being made to his American employer who continues to pay Johan’s salary while he is in New Zealand. Because Johan is physically performing the work in Auckland on behalf of his employer, you should deduct schedular tax from the contract payments made to his employer. These are paid through your New Zealand payroll system. If his employer wants to apply for a Certificate of Exemption, its eligibility will be assessed under New Zealand’s double tax agreement with the US. At that time Inland Revenue will address any issues the American company has relating to Johan’s remuneration. ? 14 www.ird.govt.nz Binding rulings, factual reviews and indicative views Binding rulings We can issue binding rulings for customers to provide certainty about the interpretation of tax laws. A binding ruling is Inland Revenue’s interpretation of how a tax law applies to a particular arrangement. An arrangement is any agreement, contract, plan or understanding (whether or not it’s enforceable), including any steps and transactions that carry it into effect. Factual reviews If you have applied for a binding ruling, you may request a factual review to obtain a level of certainty on whether a critical factual condition or assumption in the ruling will be satisfied. You can request a factual review (in writing) at any time before or immediately after the issue of the ruling. Indicative views In some circumstances, a request for an indicative view may be a more suitable option. Indicative views are non-binding on the Commissioner and are available to larger enterprises. An indicative view would generally be provided for prospective major transactions. It will not be provided for arrangements involving potential tax avoidance or hypothetical situations. If you have been given a binding ruling, you are not required to follow the approach. But if you do follow a binding ruling exactly as described in the ruling and satisfy any stated assumptions or conditions, Inland Revenue is bound by it. A binding ruling does not remove the requirement to file an income tax return and pay any taxes arising from the arrangement. Before you apply for a binding ruling, you can set up a pre-lodgement meeting to help clarify the issues and determine the scope of the ruling. We aim to complete binding rulings within three months of an application. To provide you with greater certainty about tax issues we have a range of options in place. 15 www.ird.govt.nz Bribery awareness Worldwide, governments are actively working to curtail bribery with all its negative effects on international trade and investment, political stability, welfare and economic development. New Zealand strongly supports the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. 1 Emerging markets pose particular risks when securing contracts and starting business activities. Check your business’s risk exposure by answering the ten key questions below. For further information, read the OECD’s Good Practice Guidance on Internal Controls, Ethics and Compliance at www.oecd.org \[keyword: good practice guidance\]. Combating bribery internationally 10 key questions to assess your risk: Do directors and senior management display zero- tolerance to corruption and bribery? 2 Is the group operating in any high-risk jurisdictions (see the Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index) or high-risk sectors (eg: defence, oil and gas, property development, shipping)? 3 Do you have a comprehensive code of conduct that must be signed by staff and agents in all countries where the group is operating? 4 Is there a full suite of system processes and internal controls in place to support the code of conduct? In particular, are there clear gifting/corporate hospitality/entertainment procedures, and staff training and whistle-blower protection? 5 Do you have a dedicated position (eg, a compliance officer) with responsibility for the organisation’s anti-corruption programme across all countries? 6 Are staff implementing the organisation’s anti-corruption policies? 7 Are any employees or agents circumventing established organisational processes or arguing special cases? 8 Do any employees or agents have an unusual interest in a particular contract or a specific contractor? 9 Is an employee’s lifestyle out of kilter with their known level of income? 10 Are you fully aware of the activities of your overseas agents (eg, no indication of “splashing the cash” to attract business)? 16 www.ird.govt.nz

In the last few years Inland Revenue has placed an increased level of scrutiny on the tax practices of multinationals. I’m pleased we have found nearly all businesses open and willing to engage with us positively, and proud to contribute to New Zealand. Indeed, multinationals are major contributors. The 600 largest taxpayer groups, whose tax affairs we review every year, contribute more than $6 billion tax to NZ annually. But this is no time to rest on our laurels. Internationally there are serious challenges in collecting tax from multinationals. New Zealand needs to play our part in addressing that. And while I am confident that most are paying the tax they should in New Zealand, the public appears less convinced. We each need to conduct ourselves in a way to correct that misperception. So being transparent about our expectations, how we apply international best practice, and compliance risks that raise red flags is important to Inland Revenue. Global attention on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) is still centre stage. Addressing BEPS requires an international effort, and New Zealand is contributing to thinking and action in this regard. We will continue to work closely with you as we implement agreed changes from the OECD action plan on BEPS, and tailor future changes to New Zealand conditions. The next few years are among the most important in Inland Revenue’s history as we continue to modernise the entire tax system. I want to thank significant enterprises and representative organisations for your professional input into our Business Transformation programme, and in implementing initiatives such as FATCA and automatic exchange of information. We appreciate your help in shaping a responsive tax system fit for business in the 21st century. I’m proud to lead Inland Revenue’s customer-centred change, and our work to protect New Zealand’s economy and wellbeing. New Zealand continues to rate highly on international scales for ease of doing business and for integrity. This guide once again aims to encourage both, providing transparency on tax compliance so business can get on with business. Naomi Ferguson Commissioner of Inland Revenue To maintain a healthy economy and society New Zealand needs to be an attractive place to do business. Inland Revenue’s shift to a more open and strategic approach to tax compliance is supporting business to get it right from the start and contribute to New Zealand. Contributing to New Zealand 2.

How we manage multinationals’ compliance We have an extensive international compliance programme. Key performance data (including tax payments, operating margins and interest expenditure) are monitored closely with expert assistance from full-time in-house specialists on transfer pricing and financial arrangements. An intelligence-led approach...right from the start... Our top priority has been the Significant Enterprises customer segment which comprises nearly 600 taxpayer groups with turnover in excess of $80m, 50% of which are foreign-owned, with a further 25% involved in international operations mainly through controlled foreign companies. In 2012 we introduced a more proactive intelligence-led approach to ensure compliance by significant enterprises. This approach requires all significant enterprises to submit annually a basic compliance package (BCP) comprising a group structure, financial statements and tax reconciliations which are then examined closely. The risk rating from the review of the BCP, past history and other intelligence, determines our compliance interventions which can range from no action through to further review or an in-depth audit where required. Based on the amount they pay, the top 50 taxpayer groups within the Significant Enterprises segment receive additional coverage, being account managed on a one-to-one basis. Four years on, this approach has proven to be very successful as we have managed to secure a large part of the corporate tax base through a wider range of more tailored interventions rather than relying mainly on the traditional audit product. International questionnaire In 2015 we introduced the International Questionnaire to improve our understanding of major international risks, especially their relative significance for New Zealand. We have further refined the questionnaire and issued it to over 300 foreign-owned groups in 2016. For both years we have received a resounding 100% response rate. Expanding coverage We are extending our focus on multinationals still further next year by expanding coverage of this population to include all foreign- owned significant enterprises over $30m in turnover. This is expected to increase the number of significant enterprises being reviewed annually through the provision of both BCPs and international questionnaires to nearly 900 taxpayer groups. 5. Corporate tax governance OECD guidance Guidance on tax control frameworks has recently been released by the OECD’s Forum on Tax Administration (“FTA”) . It follows on from two earlier OECD publications (Principles of Corporate Governance and Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises), and seeks to assist businesses in designing and implementing effective tax governance. We fully support this FTA guidance, a full copy of which can be found on the OECD website at the link below: www.oecd.org/tax/co-operative-tax-compliance-9789264253384-en.htm. Application in New Zealand We consider the FTA guidance applies particularly to multinational enterprises. We agree with the FTA that the actual specifics of a tax control framework (“TCF”) for any business will of course depend upon the particular circumstances of that business and the industry in question. At a minimum, we recommend that the following key questions be addressed routinely by boards: • Is there a documented tax strategy and has it been kept up-to-date? • Have effective systems, procedures and resources been put in place to manage tax risks and, if so, is a clear statement made in the annual report to that effect? • Is annual reporting sufficiently transparent such that all stakeholders have the capacity to analyse and effectively interpret the information provided on taxes paid? Consideration should be given to providing an explanation in simple terms reconciling the tax expense in financial statements with the actual amount of cash taxes paid for the year, identifying major differences arising such as losses, the effect of specific tax regimes and capital gains. In setting the right tone from the top, we also recommend that boards of directors consider endorsing a set of overarching principles. In this regard, the Business & Industry Advisory Committee (“BIAC”) Statement of Tax Principles for International Business is reproduced as Annex A in the FTA guidance and can also be found at: www.biac.org/wp-content/ uploads/2014/05/07-Final\_5\_September\_ BIAC\_Statement\_of\_Tax\_Principles\_for\_ International\_Business.pdf What is BIAC? BIAC is an international network of 2800+ business experts. It provides business perspectives through more than 30 policy groups to OECD committees, working parties and governments. 6. Tax strategy – this should be clearly documented and owned by the senior management of the enterprise (ie the board of directors). Comprehensive – all transactions entered into by an enterprise are capable of affecting its tax position in one way or another, which means that the TCF needs to be able to govern the full range of the enterprise’s activities and ideally should be embedded in day-to-day management of business operations. Responsibility – the board of an enterprise is accountable for the design, implementation and effectiveness of the TCF of that enterprise; the role of the enterprise’s tax department and its responsibility for the implementation of the TCF should be clearly recognised and properly resourced. Governance – there needs to be a system of rules and reporting that ensures transactions and events are compared with the expected norms and potential risks of non- compliance identified and managed; this governance process should be explicitly documented. Testing – compliance with the policies and processes embodied in the TCF should be the subject of regular reporting, testing and maintenance. Assurance – the TCF should be capable of providing assurance to stakeholders, including external stakeholders such as Inland Revenue, that tax risks are subject to proper control and that outputs such as tax returns can be relied upon; this is accomplished by establishing the entity’s “risk tolerance” and then by ensuring that their risk management framework is capable of identifying departures from that with mechanisms for mitigating/eliminating the additional risk. The final building block, assurance, can be seen as the overall result of having put in place all the other building blocks; if they are there, it is possible to provide the desired assurance. Top-down building block approach The FTA guidance assumes that the essential features of a TCF will be determined at the top level of an enterprise rather than being an amalgamation of individual decisions made lower down in the organisation as to which particular controls may be needed. Rather than attempting to prescribe a one-size- fits-all TCF, the guidance identifies the following six essential building blocks of a TCF: 6. 7. We are often quizzed about which particular issues attract our attention and the questions multinationals should expect from us. This “familiar red flags” list may seem obvious, but is worth repeating here so you can prepare in advance, and be able to give us explanations with supporting documentation. Don’t be surprised if we ask you questions <28% Effective tax rate – is the group’s effective tax rate substantially less than the statutory rate of 28%? Complexity – has the group been involved in any complicated arrangements (eg major restructures, use of special purpose vehicles or innovative financial arrangements)? “Low or no tax” jurisdictions – has the group participated in any material transactions involving these jurisdictions? Capital gains/tax credits – have any untaxed profits been derived or unusually high foreign tax/ imputation credits been claimed by the group? Differing accounting treatments – are there material differences in the treatment of major items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes? Tax losses – have any uncharacteristic losses arisen (or been utilised) within or across the group as a whole? Large tax benefits – has the group taken part in any transactions where the anticipated net return is predominantly due to projected tax benefits? Ownership changes – have any mergers, takeovers or ownership changes occurred and affected continuity tests for losses and imputation credits? Cross-border mismatches – are there any differences in tax treatment of a transaction or an entity between countries (eg debt in one, but equity in another)? 2015/2016 Variances between years – are there any material variances in profitability, tax payable, or major line items in supporting financial statements for the group? 8. International financing arrangements Cross-border financing forms a substantial part of total associated party dealings by New Zealand members of multinational groups. Documenting intragroup lending Too often we see minimal or even non-existent documentation in respect of loans between associated parties. In particular, this can be problematic for companies when we are reviewing the interest rates on cross-border loans if the terms and conditions of such loans are uncertain. Our expectation is that the following fundamentals are documented clearly: KEY RISK AREAS INCLUDE: • The pricing of interest and guarantee fees at non-market rates • Capital structuring within New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules • Use of hybrid instruments and hybrid entities in structured arrangements • Unusual financings or novel financial products • Incorrect accounting for non-resident withholding tax and approved issuer levy Purpose or intention (should be unambiguous e.g. working capital, term finance, etc) Parties (all lenders and borrowers named in full) Amount and currency (this includes the total amount available to be borrowed under a loan facility, not just the initial sum advanced) Interest rate (an absolute rate or an external benchmark rate plus a margin, whether the interest rate is fixed or floating and how it was determined as being reasonable) Interest payment dates (specific dates or periodic e.g. every 3 months) Term and repayment (start date and maturity or a specific period e.g. on demand, 5 years, etc) Fees (specify any and all fees e.g. guarantee fee, facility commitment fee, etc) Security (whether repayment obligations are secured or unsecured; if secured, the form of the security e.g. the borrower’s assets) Guarantee (whether repayment obligations are guaranteed or indemnified; if so, the relevant names of the party or parties) Amendment (note any changes to the above that arise over the loan’s life) 8. 9. Transfer pricing Transfer pricing remains as important as ever on the international scene. We continue to cover the full range of both inbound and outbound associated party transactions. Wholesalers/distributors We monitor the profitability of foreign-owned wholesalers/distributors – firms that purchase and on-sell goods to other firms without significant transformation. They represent the most common form of multinational enterprise in New Zealand. For smaller businesses of this nature with annual turnover of less than $30m, we will seek explanations for any performance resulting in a weighted average profit-before-tax margin of less than 3%. Supply chain restructures We keep a close eye on multinationals restructuring their operations involving the shifting of any major functions, assets or risks away from New Zealand. According to responses to our international questionnaire in 2015, some 10% of foreign-owned groups have experienced material structural changes in the last three income years. We make sure that such restructures have commercial substance and the actual conduct of the parties is consistent with the written agreements reflecting these changes. Not only do we have concerns as to the level of profitability for income tax purposes, but also caution needs to be taken to ensure the GST consequences of any restructuring are addressed appropriately such as where goods are sold from offshore to a New Zealand distributor and the supplier wishes to register and charge GST. Residency issues may arise when setting up a new (or offshoring an existing) Business to Consumer (“B2C”) retail operation. For example, where the offshore supplier uses a New Zealand associate to facilitate shipping logistics and handle returns or warranty claims, a “fixed or permanent place” for GST residency purposes may result which then “onshores” the supplies. Country-by-Country reporting New country-by-country (“CbC”) reporting requirements are being introduced globally which will apply to multinationals with annual consolidated group revenue of EUR 750m and above. We have contacted all New Zealand-headquartered groups potentially affected by this new measure to ensure they are well prepared for first reporting from 2017. We are looking forward to receiving CbC reports from our treaty partners covering the major foreign-owned multinationals operating in New Zealand. These reports will further strengthen our transfer pricing risk assessments, providing us with a full picture of supply chain profitability. We maintain a special focus on the following: • Unexplained tax losses returned by New Zealand multinational operations • Loans in excess of $10m principal and guarantee fees • Cash pooling arrangements • Payment of unsustainable levels of royalties and/or service charges • Material associated party transactions with no or low tax jurisdictions, including the use of offshore hubs for marketing, logistics and procurement services • Appropriate booking of income arising from e-commerce transactions • Any unusual arrangements or outcomes that may be identified in controlled foreign company disclosures OECD recommendations The OECD has recommended that transfer pricing documentation be maintained in two forms: • a master file providing a high level overview of the multinational’s global business operations and transfer pricing policies, and • a local file providing detailed information regarding material related party transactions. We endorse these recommendations and consider the master file/local file approach provides a solid platform on which taxpayers with material transfer pricing risks can meaningfully describe their compliance with the arm’s length standard. 10. Making compliance easier We endeavour to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the tax base and containing compliance costs. We have introduced several administrative measures to ease the transfer pricing compliance burden for multinationals: • for the provision of management and other support services, consider applying the cost-plus method with a 7.5% mark-up if services are non-core or de minimis • for small value loans up to $10m principal in total per year, consider using a rate of interest set by reference to a relevant base indicator plus 250 basis points. New Zealand exporters We are seeing increased scrutiny of transfer pricing issues by other tax authorities, as countries continue to update their rules and regulations on international transactions. Make sure you: • know the nature and extent of your overseas operations and all your cross-border associated party transactions; • check operating margins to ensure they reflect commercial reality; and • fully document any market development strategies and be prepared to explain any swings in profitability that may occur. Controlled foreign companies We also try to provide practical guidance where possible to assist taxpayers in getting it right, so do pay a visit to the transfer pricing section of our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: transfer pricing) where you will find guidance on a wide range of transfer pricing topics. In focusing on CFCs, we check technical compliance with these new rules. We also watch for any possible abuse of the rules through aggressive tax planning schemes. Given the total exemption from attribution of income for holders of sufficient interests in active CFCs, there are flow-on tax risks around: • whether foreign incorporated companies are New Zealand tax resident through their management, control or director decision making. • the correctness of cross-border associated party transfer pricing methodologies. Our recent reviews have focused on active business test calculations as well as calculations of taxable income or losses attributed from CFCs. We suggest you pay special attention to the following so that compliance errors do not occur: • All interests in CFCs must be disclosed annually in a Foreign investment fund/Controlled foreign company disclosure (s) (IR458) form. You can file this electronically. • To qualify to use the accounting standards method of the active business test, your financial statements (including those prepared for each CFC) must comply with IFRS or NZ GAAP with NZ IFRS and be supported by an unqualified audit opinion. • Under the default method of the active business test, you must calculate a CFC’s financial arrangement income and expenditure in New Zealand dollars in certain circumstances (for example, where the total value of financial arrangements is more than $1m). • Passive income, which is legislatively defined, is subject to a number of carve-outs. For example, rental income derived from land situated in the CFC’s country of residence is excluded from passive income. You should check whether any of the carve-outs apply to you. • Foreign exchange movements on financial arrangements must be taken into account when completing the active business test. • The rules prescribe adjustments that are required to be made to deductions for funding costs when calculating taxable income or losses attributed from CFCs. • The old branch equivalent rules no longer apply. • You need to make adjustments to losses and tax credits brought forward from the old CFC rules. In most circumstances, losses and tax credits generated under the old rules are not fully available for offset under the current rules. For income years starting on or after 1 July 2009, New Zealand’s amended tax rules for controlled foreign companies (“CFCs”) have included an active/passive division. 11. Base erosion and profit shifting International tax is getting sexy because of the financial crisis.” - Pascal Saint-Amans, Director, Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, OECD BEPS Action Plan Like all developed countries, New Zealand needs to respond to domestic and international threats to our revenue from tax avoidance and evasion, as well as wider changes driven by technological innovation and volatility in the global economy. Some multinationals are able to structure their business affairs to pay very little tax anywhere in the world. The wide range of international tax planning techniques used to achieve such results are collectively referred to as BEPS tax planning strategies. These strategies exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to make profits disappear for tax purposes or to shift profits to locations where there is little or no real activity but the taxes are low, resulting in little or no corporate tax being paid. “ 3.

We have been working closely with the OECD, recognising that BEPS is a global problem which requires a global solution. In an increasingly interconnected world, national tax laws have not always kept pace with global corporations, fluid movement of capital, and the rise of the digital economy, leaving gaps and mismatches that can be exploited to generate double non-taxation. This undermines the fairness and integrity of tax systems. (OECD website) 13.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has led a global response to the issue and produced an action plan which details key recommendations that governments around the world can use to strengthen their tax rules. New Zealand, like other countries, is now considering those recommendations and will act on them. This is a major step forward. New Zealand has long had strong tax rules in this area, but the advent of the OECD changes will mean a hugely improved global environment where tax laws of different nations are generally of a higher standard, making it more difficult for tax avoidance and evasion.” - Hon Michael Woodhouse, Minister of Revenue, July 2016 “ 14. International disputes New Zealand has 40 double taxation agreements (“DTAs”), each with an Article establishing a Mutual Agreement Procedure (“MAP”) for resolving difficulties arising out of the application of the particular DTA. New Zealand has 11 Tax Information Exchange Agreements (“TIEAs”) in force which also contain a MAP Article, as well as six Supplementary Agreements to these TIEAs which include a MAP Article. In addition, the DTAs with Australia and Japan contain arbitration clauses for resolving disputes. We have recently updated our guidance on the Mutual Agreement Procedure covering its scope, the interaction with our domestic disputes process, the filing of MAP requests (including information required) and the implementation of MAP agreements. This updated guidance can be found at: www.ird.govt.nz/international/business/international- obligations/mutual-agreement-procedure/mutual- agreement-procedure-guidance.html. We recommend you tell us as soon as possible about any pending dispute with another tax authority. In nearly all cases when there has been early intervention by us as the competent authority, the double tax issue has been resolved successfully. New Zealand’s DTAs generally follow the OECD Model Tax Convention (“OECD MTC”). New Zealand has made no observations or reservations on Article 25 of the OECD MTC which covers the MAP. Under the MAP Article, the competent authorities of the Contracting States engage with each other and endeavour to resolve disputes that arise from the way one or both Contracting States are interpreting or applying the particular DTA. Article 25 effectively equips the tax administrations with the practical means to ensure that cross-border income earning activity is taxed correctly in accordance with DTAs. The New Zealand competent authority role falls in the first instance on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, but in practice is delegated to John Nash (Manager, International Revenue Strategy) who leads on double taxation cases arising from audit/compliance activities, and Carmel Peters (Policy Manager) who leads on treaty interpretation issues. These two competent authorities work closely together and interact with other divisions of Inland Revenue as needed to resolve MAP cases. The competent authorities act independently of others, forming their own view of issues in dispute. Our overall aim is to complete MAP cases within 12 months of receiving a request for assistance. The time taken to resolve MAP cases will vary depending largely on the complexity of the matter in dispute. For the 2015 calendar year, 18 MAP cases were resolved taking between four months and 25 months to complete with an average cycle time to completion of 10 months. 15. Binding rulings, factual reviews, indicative views and advance pricing agreements To provide you with greater certainty about tax issues and to get it right from the start we have a range of options in place. Indicative views In some circumstances, a request for an indicative view may be a more suitable option. Indicative views are non-binding on the Commissioner and are available to larger enterprises. An indicative view would generally be provided for prospective major transactions. It will not be provided for arrangements involving potential tax avoidance or hypothetical situations. Advance pricing agreements Advance pricing agreements (“APAs”) have also proven extremely useful as a robust upfront means of dealing with transfer pricing risk, especially the more complex issues that arise. An APA is an agreement between us and the taxpayer which confirms the basis for their international pricing. Multinationals that complete an APA need to submit annual reports and supporting evidence to us to confirm their compliance with the agreement. APAs represent a more co-operative approach to tax compliance as opposed to adversarial audits. The product is ideally suited to the more complex transfer pricing issues, such as intangibles and the provision of specialised services. We completed 20 APAs this last year, five more than 2015. As at 30 June 2016, we had completed 153 APAs in total. Exchange of cross-border rulings A new international standard has been agreed which requires the exchange of information between tax treaty partners concerning certain rulings. We are currently implementing this standard which for New Zealand covers essentially permanent establishment issues and unilateral APAs. Binding rulings We can issue binding rulings for customers to provide certainty about the interpretation of tax laws. A binding ruling is Inland Revenue’s interpretation of how a tax law applies to a particular arrangement. An arrangement is any agreement, contract, plan or understanding (whether or not it’s enforceable), including any steps and transactions that carry it into effect. If you have been given a binding ruling, you are not required to follow the approach. But if you do follow a binding ruling exactly as described in the ruling and satisfy any stated assumptions or conditions, Inland Revenue is bound by it. A binding ruling does not remove the requirement to file an income tax return and pay any taxes arising from the arrangement. Before you apply for a binding ruling, you can set up a pre-lodgement meeting to help clarify the issues and determine the scope of the ruling. We aim to complete binding rulings within three months of an application, although shorter timeframes may be possible in some circumstances. For more information, please refer to our guide for Binding rulings (IR715). Factual reviews If you have applied for a binding ruling, you may request a factual review to obtain a level of certainty on whether a critical factual condition or assumption in the ruling will be satisfied. You can request a factual review (in writing) at any time before or immediately after the issue of the ruling. 16. Tax treaty programme update We continue to work with the OECD and treaty partners to ensure our international agreements are fit for purpose. We have double tax agreements with 40 countries and are currently negotiating several new DTAs and protocols. We are re-negotiating two key treaties – China and Korea. These two countries are major trade and investment partners for New Zealand, but our current treaties with them are more than 30 years old. Because of historical international and legal principles that otherwise impose barriers to countries assisting each other in enforcing their tax laws, forms of tax co-operation between jurisdictions such as exchange of information are typically conducted under bilateral agreements. The joint OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (“the Multilateral Convention”) has emerged internationally as the pre-eminent international instrument for tax co-operation generally. The Multilateral Convention has now been signed by over 100 jurisdictions. New Zealand signed the Multilateral Convention on 26 October 2012. In 2010 the United States enacted provisions commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or FATCA. These provisions require financial institutions to provide details about the accounts and investments they hold for American citizens, tax residents and others to the Internal Revenue Service in the United States. We started transmission of information from New Zealand financial institutions to the United States in September 2015. We have also made good progress to continue to meet OECD timelines to implement the global automatic exchange of information to assist with offshore compliance. Other on-going international commitments include: • Supporting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade free trade agreement programme. • Supporting and guiding the New Zealand delegation at the United Nations on tax matters. • Active participation in the Study Group on Asian Tax Administration and Research (“SGATAR”). We will be chairing the 46 th Annual Meeting in November. 17. Employee share schemes under review Arrangements providing shares and share options by companies to employees are an important form of employee remuneration in New Zealand and internationally. Although the design and the accounting treatment of these plans have evolved considerably over recent decades, the tax rules applying to them in New Zealand have not been comprehensively reviewed during that period and are now out of date. Employee share schemes can have beneficial economic effects and it is important that the tax rules do not raise unintended barriers to their use. In some circumstances, the current rules can result in over-taxation; in others they result in under- taxation. We are working on a number of proposals to address these problems in a manner consistent with New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate taxation principles. The goal of the proposals is to ensure that the taxation of employee share schemes is simple, efficient and fair. New anti-corruption law Globally, governments are actively working to curtail bribery and corruption which impact adversely international trade and investment, political stability, welfare and economic development. New Zealand has a strong reputation for being free and intolerant of bribery and corruption. In November 2015, the Organised Crime and Anti-corruption Legislation Bill was passed. On 1 December 2015, New Zealand ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. New Zealand’s ability to combat bribery and corruption is now stronger than ever. To assist New Zealand businesses in complying with our law, the Ministry of Justice has produced the following comprehensive set of guidance materials: • Saying No to Bribery and Corruption – A Guide for New Zealand Businesses. • Facilitation Payments and New Zealand’s Anti-Bribery Laws. • How to Create a Fraud and Corruption Policy. These materials can be found on the Ministry’s website: (http://www.justice. govt.nz/justice-sector-policy/key- initiatives/bribery-corruption/) and are recommended to all enterprises participating in international trade and investment, especially when securing contracts and starting business activities in emerging markets. 18. Our business transformation To deliver on our objectives and vision for a modern tax system, we have embarked on a major change programme. Our multi-year, multi- stage Business Transformation programme will re-shape the way the department serves New Zealanders. Simple, certain and open customer- centred services will be designed and delivered in partnership with others inside and outside government. The overall result will be a modern, digital tax system that will serve the needs of all New Zealanders and fit seamlessly into their lives. It will also be a system that keeps pace with change, protecting the Government’s ability to keep providing services. Delivering our future tax system will require us to: • Simplify policy and legislative settings. • Make more intelligent use of information to ensure customers get it right from the start. • Fit revenue processes seamlessly into people’s lives and enable them to self-manage with speed and certainty. • Become more agile, effective and efficient. • Implement a modern technology platform that is digitally based and highly automated. Enable Secure Digital Services will allow the majority of customers to self-manage and reduce businesses’ compliance burden in fulfilling their GST obligations, significantly contributing to Better Public Services Result 9 and the Business Growth Agenda. 1st S TA G E 2nd S TA G E 3rd S TA G E 4th S TA G E Streamline Income and Business Tax will build on the foundations delivered in the previous stage and further reduce the compliance burden that businesses face. Streamline Social Policy will improve the delivery of the social policies that Inland Revenue administers. Complete Delivery will include transitioning any remaining taxes and social policies to a new platform and decommissioning technology platforms that are no longer required. 2016-20172017-20192018-20202019-2021 ✓ 19. We are often quizzed about which particular issues attract our attention and the questions multinationals should expect from us. This “familiar red flags” list may seem obvious, but is worth repeating here so you can prepare in advance, and be able to give us explanations with supporting documentation. Don’t be surprised if we ask you questions <28% Effective tax rate – is the group’s effective tax rate substantially less than the statutory rate of 28%? Complexity – has the group been involved in any complicated arrangements (eg major restructures, use of special purpose vehicles or innovative financial arrangements)? “Low or no tax” jurisdictions – has the group participated in any material transactions involving these jurisdictions? Capital gains/tax credits – have any untaxed profits been derived or unusually high foreign tax/ imputation credits been claimed by the group? Differing accounting treatments – are there material differences in the treatment of major items for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes? Tax losses – have any uncharacteristic losses arisen (or been utilised) within or across the group as a whole? Large tax benefits – has the group taken part in any transactions where the anticipated net return is predominantly due to projected tax benefits? Ownership changes – have any mergers, takeovers or ownership changes occurred and affected continuity tests for losses and imputation credits? Cross-border mismatches – are there any differences in tax treatment of a transaction or an entity between countries (eg debt in one, but equity in another)? 2015/2016 Variances between years – are there any material variances in profitability, tax payable, or major line items in supporting financial statements for the group? 20. Original release: September 2013 BIAC Statement of Tax Principles for International Business Intention of statement of tax principles This Statement of Tax Principles is intended to promote and affirm responsible business tax management by international business. These principles are based on five key observations:  Public trust in the tax system is a vital part of any flourishing society and growing economy.  Most businesses comply fully with all applicable tax laws and regulations, recognising the obligations of governments to protect a sustainable tax base.  International businesses contribute significantly to the global economy and pay a substantial amount of tax comprising not only corporation tax, but also labour taxes, social contributions and other taxes such as environmental levies and VAT.  Transparency, open dialogue and co-operation between tax authorities and business contributes to greater compliance and a better functioning tax system.  Tax is a business expense which needs to be managed, like any other, and therefore businesses may legitimately respond to tax incentives and statutory alternatives offered by governments The objectives  To enhance co-operation, trust and confidence between tax authorities, business taxpayers and the public in regard to the operation of the global tax system.  To promote the efficient working of the tax system to fund public services and promote sustainable growth.  To support stability, certainty and consistency in global tax principles that will foster cross-border trade and investment. Tax planning principles  International businesses should only engage in tax planning that is aligned with commercial and economic activity and does not lead to an abusive result.  International businesses may respond to tax incentives and exemptions.  International businesses should interpret the relevant tax laws in a reasonable way, consistent with a relationship of ‘co-operative compliance’ with tax authorities.  In international tax matters, businesses should follow the terms of the applicable Double Taxation Treaties and relevant domestic and OECD guidance. Business should engage constructively in international dialogue on the review of global tax rules and the need for any changes. Transparency and reporting principles Relationships between international businesses and tax authorities should be transparent, constructive, and based on mutual trust with the result that tax authorities and business should treat each other with respect, and with an appropriate focus on areas of risk. International businesses should, therefore:  Be open and transparent with the tax authority in each jurisdiction about their tax affairs and provide the relevant, reasonably requested information (subject to appropriate confidentiality provisions) that is necessary to enable a reasonable review of possible tax risk.  Work collaboratively with tax authorities to achieve early agreement on disputed issues and certainty on a real-time basis, wherever possible. - Seek, where necessary, to increase public understanding in the tax system in order to build public trust in that system, and, to that end: - Where they determine such explanations would be helpful to building public trust in the tax system, they should consider how best to explain to the public their economic contribution and taxes paid in the jurisdictions in which they operate. www.ird.govt.nz

With the increasing complexities of globalisation, we are actively participating in international solutions to facilitate compliance and have implemented the automatic exchange of financial account information. In June last year, the Government passed legislation which ensures multinational enterprises (MNEs) pay tax based on the actual economic activity they carry out in New Zealand. This legislation improves the fairness of the tax system and helps preserve its integrity. I am especially pleased with the level of engagement we have had from the business community to help us design robust policies that meet international standards and reflect the New Zealand context. Internationally, New Zealand continues to rate highly for integrity and ease of doing business. We have recently refreshed our compliance approach. This refresh explicitly outlines our objective - to collect the “right amount of tax at the right time through the right channels”. Our commitment to our customers is that we will prioritise our efforts and focus mainly on prevention. We will be pragmatic and proportionate in reaching solutions to problems. Our approach recognises the new anti-BEPS measures and the resulting restructuring of multinationals. It is great to see already the desired behavioural shift from these new measures. MNEs are becoming more aware of their reputations and of how aggressive tax positions can tarnish their brands. Designing and delivering services and systems that facilitate compliance in a customer-centric manner remains a priority for Inland Revenue. We continue working to ensure that individuals and businesses that are conducting cross-border transactions pay their fair share of tax. To this end, we are working actively with other OECD jurisdictions on a multilateral agreement on how best to tax the digital economy. I want to thank all multinational enterprises and representative organisations for their professional input and willingness to work with us as we collectively contribute to the social and economic well-being of New Zealand. Naomi Ferguson Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1 NOVEMBER 2019 “The tax we collect from significant enterprises accounts for almost 10% of total annual tax revenue. I am confident that the anti-base erosion and profit shifting measures we have implemented, together with our refreshed compliance approach, will continue to protect the New Zealand tax base and ensure multinationals pay their fair share.” Contributing to New Zealand 1 | | 2 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 All New Zealanders benefit from tax In 2018-19 the Government expected to spend in the following areas: What Your Taxes Pay For TAX REVENUE $77.9b OTHER TAX REVENUE $881.8M Individual income tax $37.8b 49% of tax revenue Other $4.3b 5% of tax revenue Corporate income tax $16.4b 21% of tax revenue GST $19.4b 25% of tax revenue Social security and welfare $28.9b Health Education Core government services Law and order Transport and communications Economic and industrial services Defence Environmental protection Primary services Housing and community development Heritage, culture and recreation Other $18.3b $14.3b $5.3b $4.8b $3.2b $3.0b $2.4b $1.1b $1.1b $0.9b $0.7b $0.2b $0.1b Government Superannuation Fund pension expenses The money we collect helps pay for the public services all New Zealanders benefit from, such as education, transport and healthcare. One of our responsibilities is to make sure the Government has funding for these essential services. In 2018–19, we collected $77.9b of tax revenue to help fund government programmes. | 2 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 3 | New Zealand Context New Zealand individuals and businesses are becoming more involved in international trade and investment and we collect a substantial amount of corporate tax (21% of the overall tax take). This reflects the consistent and strong emphasis placed by New Zealand on tax policy and administration to ensure the integrity of the corporate tax base. A greater proportion of corporate tax, together with the fact that a relatively small number of companies account for most of it, means that New Zealand remains vigilant on corporate tax base erosion. Significant enterprises (SEs) with an annual turnover of at least $80m account for approximately $7.3b worth of corporate tax, which is approximately 45% of the total corporate tax base. More than half of these SEs are multinational enterprises. MNEs are a significant force in New Zealand’s economic environment and protecting New Zealand’s tax revenue means we need to look at compliance internationally as well as domestically. The increasing complexity of global business requires us to be actively involved in international solutions to facilitate compliance. Our work in this area means New Zealand continues to be an attractive place for people to do business and invest. Inland Revenue plays a unique role in making New Zealand a great place to live, work and raise a family. It is important that we are ready to maintain this role in a changing world. The success of our Business Transformation programme, which is well-advanced, is helping us to do this. We want to ensure that tax is more simple, open and certain for our customers and that we have the capabilities we need to meet their needs. | 4 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 The Last Three Years Our 2016 Multinational Enterprises Compliance Focus Document aimed to make tax compliance more transparent for businesses and to give them more certainty. In this 2019 update, we are once again aiming to provide transparency and certainty. Considerable progress has been made in the last three years as we move through the various stages of our Business Transformation programme. At the same time, we are meeting our international commitments and working with other jurisdictions to transform the international tax scene. Since 2016, we have successfully implemented BEPS minimum standards such as country-by-country reporting and exchange of tax rulings. We have signed up to the OECD’s multilateral instrument (MLI), made our dispute resolution mechanisms more effective, and introduced a range of new anti-BEPS measures that ensure New Zealand responds appropriately to domestic and international threats to its tax base. The BEPS Action Plan recommendations have already brought about major changes in the global taxation scene. New Zealand’s anti-BEPS measures have given Inland Revenue more administrative powers, encouraging MNEs to respond adequately to information requests and to be more open and transparent. Inland Revenue is subject to rolling peer reviews led by the OECD and we are pleased to report that New Zealand is meeting the international standards, helping us maintain a global reputation we can all be proud of and enjoy. We have successfully increased our coverage of MNEs by expanding the SE population to all groups with an annual turnover greater than $80m and all foreign-owned SEs with an annual turnover in excess of $30m. This has seen the population expand from 600 to just under 1000 groups. They are reviewed annually and risk-assessed on information they provide. Based on the amount of tax they pay, the top 50 corporate customers continue to receive additional attention through one-on-one account management. As a result of this expansion, we have more than doubled the population that receives the international questionnaire. We would like to thank all those multinationals and their representatives who work closely with us every year to achieve a 100% response rate over the last five years. The responses we received helped shape our anti-BEPS measures and continue, cost-effectively, to inform our customer-centric compliance approach for MNEs. IR1106 NOVEMBER 2016 Multinational Enterprises COMPLIANCE FOCUS 5 | International Tax Strategy New Zealand’s taxation of cross-border flows on income New Zealand’s international obligations Taxing New Zealanders who invest offshore Often driven by broader economic and foreign policy objectives – not just tax Engagement with international tax agencies, organisations and developing countries Taxing foreign investors on income earned in New Zealand Our international tax strategy aligns well with Inland Revenue’s Compliance Model which outlines the principles of how we should interact with our customers. 68 Japan 127 Australia 33 UK 131 USA 32 GERMANY Ultimate ownership (largest jurisdictions) 623 foreign-owned groups 67% of our foreign- owned groups over $30m are subject to CbC reporting HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE 5 | | 6 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 Through the integration of this strategy, we expect to achieve a future state with the following characteristics: • An appropriate compliance environment that supports New Zealand businesses operating globally and assists MNE operations in New Zealand by working with other tax authorities and key business interests to facilitate trade and investment. • A New Zealand economy made more productive by a level playing field for compliant taxpayers, fewer competitive distortions and the lowest possible compliance costs. • Increased assurance to the community that Inland Revenue is tackling aggressive tax planning by multinationals. • Continued active collaboration with international organisations to deliver the best outcomes for New Zealand. Facilitating international tax compliance Inland Revenue and SEs have an important relationship in New Zealand’s overall revenue collection landscape. More than half of them are foreign-owned, with a further 25% involved in international operations mainly through controlled foreign companies. In 2018-19, this customer segment paid approximately $7.3b in corporate tax, which is almost 45% of the total corporate tax collected last year. New Zealand’s compliance objective for multinationals is to collect the “right amount of tax at the right time through the right channels”. Our commitment to our customers is that we will prioritise our efforts and focus mainly on prevention. We will be pragmatic and proportionate in reaching solutions to problems. Our refreshed compliance approach recognises the new anti-BEPS measures in effect from 1 July 2018 and the consequent restructuring of MNEs. The following principles define the way we want to work with multinational enterprises to facilitate international tax compliance. PRIORITISATION • We will prioritise our work based on tax risk and materiality, keeping taxpayer compliance costs and Inland Revenue’s administrative costs as low as possible. PREVENTION • We will embrace the “right from the start” concept and, as far as possible, our primary focus will be on working co-operatively with MNEs to prevent BEPS. We will capitalise on our recent law reform to drive behavioural change in any MNEs inclined to indulge in aggressive tax planning practices. P R AG M AT I C • We will be reasonable and realistic, taking a pragmatic approach overall, especially in respect of transfer pricing given the various limitations in data and methodologies. PROPORTIONATE • We will respect the additional dimensions presented by the Mutual Agreement Procedure in our tax treaties as well as the global nature of MNE operations.

The relationship concept is based on risk management, fair, open and responsive administration, and greater transparency by taxpayers. The hypothesis is that “taxpayers who behave transparently can expect greater certainty and an earlier resolution of tax issues with less extensive audits and lower compliance costs”. We endeavour to nurture relationships with taxpayers and their advisers and establish an environment that welcomes full and frank dialogue. We closely monitor all significant enterprises with a turnover greater than $80m and all foreign-owned corporates with a turnover in excess of $30m. These SEs are required to submit a Basic Compliance Package (BCP) every year. The BCP comprises a group structure, financial statements, and tax reconciliations. The information is run through our risk rules engine and based on the assigned rating, the SE may undergo further in-depth examination (including risk reviews and audits). Foreign-owned groups are also required to complete an annual international questionnaire (IQ) which is designed to collect key information about financing/debt and transfer pricing issues. The intelligence derived from the information collected informs our strategic and operational risk assessment processes relating to these businesses in New Zealand. As part of implementing Action 13 of the BEPS Action Plan, we commenced the exchange of country-by-country (CbC) reports last year. The standard applies to MNEs with annual consolidated group revenue of over EUR 750m (approximately NZ$1.3b). In the year to 31 December 2018, we received 1402 CbC reports. The reports we are receiving are not only for SEs but also for the small to medium enterprises and microbusinesses in New Zealand. The reports contain a range of important information such as gross revenues, profit/loss before income tax and employee numbers. The BCP, IQ and account management processes already in place, combined with the CbC reports, mean we can give multinationals greater certainty and tailor our interventions to facilitate their compliance with tax law in New Zealand. Our Compliance Approach Over two-thirds of world trade involves MNEs and, according to the OECD, over 60% of international trade takes place between related parties. This gives MNEs an unprecedented ability to engineer their finances for the greatest tax advantage. 7 | Aggressive financial structuring involving, in particular, hybrid instruments / entities / transfers Income misallocation by digital enterprises Misuse of low / no tax jurisdictions Profit stripping through supply chain restructures Related party licensing Major New Zealand International Tax Risks (Integrity and Revenue) | 8 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 Inland Revenue aims to head off non-compliance before it occurs, by close monitoring, advance pricing agreements (APAs) and practical guidance to allow MNEs to better self-manage their financing and transfer pricing risks. APAs lock in compliant outcomes by agreeing on the criteria for transfer prices in advance of transactions occurring. They can eliminate the need for potentially costly post-lodgement reviews and audits. They are not only a faster and clearer route to multilateral tax certainty, but also give the wider community more confidence in the compliance of MNEs. The IQ has been critical in informing our risk picture as well as the new anti-BEPS measures. We have also used all the intelligence we hold on SEs, especially MNEs, to identify the groups that are impacted by the anti-BEPS measures and develop an international monitoring framework (IMF) to actively track them. We can see already a global tax reset. Behavioural changes are taking place with MNEs adjusting supply chains, locations of intangibles, financing arrangements and contracting practices. Monitoring the Implementation of Anti-BEPS Measures It is widely accepted that the anti-BEPS measures will continue to drive significant changes in the global tax landscape as countries implement them. | 8 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 In the coming year we will be asking for more information and clarification of changes in MNEs’ tax affairs to give us a clearer view of the impact of the new anti-BEPS measures. It will also help us design tailored interventions where behavioural change has not taken place. We look forward to working cooperatively with multinationals and their representatives as we continue to provide greater certainty and facilitate international tax compliance in New Zealand. IMF covers the following key areas: Debt / capitalisation The digital economyRestructuring Royalties Transactions with low tax jurisdictions 9 | OECD Guidance Compliance begins with the right “tone from the top” being set by directors and senior management. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises are recommendations addressed by governments to multinational enterprises operating in or from adhering countries. They provide non-binding principles and standards for responsible business conduct in a global context consistent with applicable laws and recognised international standards. Specifically, in respect of taxation matters, the Guidelines emphasise the importance of tax governance: “102. Enterprises’ commitments to co-operation, transparency and tax compliance should be reflected in risk management systems, structures and policies. In the case of enterprises having a corporate legal form, corporate boards are in a position to oversee tax risk in a number of ways. For example, corporate boards should proactively develop appropriate tax policy principles, as well as establish internal tax control systems so that the actions of management are consistent with the views of the board with regard to tax risk. The board should be informed about all potentially material tax risks and responsibility should be assigned for performing internal tax control functions and reporting to the board. A comprehensive risk management strategy that includes tax will allow the enterprise to not only act as a good corporate citizen but also to collectively manage tax risk, which can serve to avoid major financial, regulatory and reputation risk for an enterprise.” (page 61) www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf The Guidelines are the only multilaterally agreed and comprehensive code of responsible business conduct that governments, including New Zealand, have committed to promoting.

See Co-operative Tax Compliance: Building Better Tax Control Frameworks at: From The Top Down... 11 | International Progress According to surveys and feedback from tax practitioners, a significant percentage of multinationals are implementing restructurings, revising their tax planning and changing the location of their investments to fall in line with the new environment. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework has over 130 members representing some 95% of global gross domestic product. Members are required to implement four minimum standards, resulting in major legal and practical changes: Action 5 (Harmful Tax Practices) Action 13 (CbC Reporting) Action 14 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) Action 6 (Tax Treaty Abuse) over 25,000 previously secret tax rulings have been exchanged 80 jurisdictions have engaged in the exchange of CbC reports the number of cases closed has increased the MLI covers 89 jurisdictions Each of the four BEPS minimum standards is subject to peer review in order to ensure timely and accurate implementation and thus safeguard the level playing field. New Zealand has committed to implement the minimum standards and has been subject to peer reviews covering these minimum standards. Monitoring Implementation 11 | | 12 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 Prior to the implementation of the BEPS recommendations, New Zealand had some of the strongest tax base protection rules in the world. New Zealand has implemented the great majority of the BEPS recommendations, further strengthening our tax laws to protect against profit shifting by multinational enterprises. Action taken has included ensuring our transfer pricing laws reflect world’s best practice, implementing country-by-country reporting, adopting a range of new tax treaty rules through the multilateral instrument (MLI), and introducing new measures to prevent tax avoidance through hybrid/branch mismatches and related-party financing arrangements. These measures (together with our pre-existing law) address all of the BEPS issues identified by the OECD. Explanations of the new measures can be found in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 3 April 2019. Special reports on each measure, which mirror the bulletin, and changes since April 2019 can be found on our policy website. “It is not in the interest of New Zealand taxpayers if multinational companies avoid paying taxes here. The changes address the problem of companies operating cross-border and using aggressive tax structuring to reduce the tax they pay. These changes enjoy the unanimous support of Parliament and are possible thanks to the work of MPs from all political parties, as well as valuable advice from tax professionals and useful submissions from members of the public. We will have a better, fairer tax system as a result of these changes.” Hon Stuart Nash MINISTER OF REVENUE, 27 JUNE 2018 New Zealand’s Implementation of Anti-BEPS Measures 13 | BEPS Action Plan OECD recommendations NZ law prior to anti-BEPS measures NZ’s responses to OECD recommendations 1 Address the tax challenges of the digital economy The report identified issues raised by the digital economy and possible actions to address them. It made recommendations on GST but did not generally recommend fundamental changes to the international income tax framework. Generally consistent with existing international tax norms. New Zealand imposed GST on online services from 1 October 2016 and has enacted new GST rules covering online sales of low value goods to apply from 1 December 2019. 2 Neutralise the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements Recommendations regarding the design of domestic rules. Changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention and MLI to address hybrid entities. Domestic law and DTAs already contained some targeted anti-hybrid mismatch rules. New Zealand enacted comprehensive domestic hybrid mismatch rules based on OECD recommendations in 2018. New Zealand also adopted MLI provisions to strengthen DTAs. 3 Strengthen controlled foreign company rules Recommendations regarding the design of domestic rules. Generally consistent with existing international tax norms. No proposal to change controlled foreign company rules. 4 Limit base erosion via interest deductions and other financial payments Recommendations regarding the design of domestic rules, with a preference for the EBITDA approach. Generally consistent with existing international tax norms. New Zealand improved its rules in 2018 by introducing restricted transfer pricing rules for interest on related- party debt and requiring adjustment for “non-debt liabilities” in the thin capitalisation rules. 5 Counter harmful tax practices more effectively, taking into account transparency and substance Finalise review of member country regimes. Expand participation to non-OECD members and revision of existing criteria. New Zealand’s laws are already robust - no harmful tax practices identified. New Zealand has implemented the requirements to exchange summaries of binding rulings and advance pricing agreements as recommended by OECD. 6 Prevent treaty abuse Changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention and changes to DTAs through the MLI to insert a general anti-avoidance provision called a “principal purpose test”. New Zealand’s anti- avoidance law is generally strong, but the MLI presented an opportunity to further strengthen the law. New Zealand has adopted the principal purpose test through signing the MLI. 7 Prevent the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status Changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention and changes to DTAs through MLI to prevent PE avoidance. New Zealand’s PE definition is generally based on the existing OECD and UN models. New Zealand has implemented OECD best practice standards for a number of DTAs by signing the MLI. New Zealand also introduced a new anti-avoidance rule in 2018 for large multinationals that structure to avoid having a PE in New Zealand and are not subject to the OECD’s best practice PE definition. 5 6 New Zealand’s Progress | 14 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 BEPS Action Plan OECD recommendations NZ law prior to anti-BEPS measures NZ’s responses to OECD recommendations 8 to 10 Ensure transfer pricing reflects economic substance Changes to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. New Zealand currently applies the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. New Zealand has made changes to domestic legislation to follow the revised OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. 11 Establish methodologies to collect and analyse data on BEPS and the actions to address it Recommendations regarding data to be collected and methodologies to analyse BEPS. New Zealand collects and analyses certain data on BEPS as a matter of course. In 2015, Inland Revenue implemented an annual international questionnaire that collects key data to assess BEPS risks. BEPS disclosures are required to be made with tax returns from 2019. 12 Require taxpayers to disclose their aggressive tax planning arrangements to revenue authorities Recommendations regarding the design of domestic disclosure rules. No requirement under current law to disclose aggressive tax planning arrangements, however the combination of our strong anti-avoidance rules and the binding rulings and penalties regimes, incentivise disclosure. No law reform planned but existing law incentivises disclosures. Taxpayers will often apply for binding rulings on potentially aggressive transactions to obtain certainty as to the tax treatment especially in light of our strong anti- avoidance law. Penalties on aggressive transactions are reduced for early disclosure of such arrangements. Re-examine transfer pricing documentation Changes to OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and recommendations regarding the design of domestic rules, including country-by- country reporting. New Zealand currently applies the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines but does not have a formal programme for collection of transfer pricing documentation. Inland Revenue has implemented CbC reporting. 14 Make dispute resolution mechanisms more effective Recommendations on operational minimum standards and best practices for dispute resolution. New Zealand has strong dispute resolution systems but does not currently allow taxpayers to approach the competent authority of either DTA partner for resolution of a dispute (the taxpayer must approach the authority in their home country) and does not generally offer arbitration of any disputes between authorities. New Zealand has implemented OECD recommendations on dispute resolution by signing the MLI. In particular, New Zealand will allow taxpayers to approach the competent authority of either DTA partner in a treaty dispute and will also provide for arbitration of any disputes between authorities. Inland Revenue has issued guidance on the mutual agreement procedure. 15 Develop the MLI to strengthen DTAs The MLI implements substantive recommendations made in OECD’s Action 2, 6, 7 and 14 reports. New Zealand has a network of 40 DTAs. Some of the MLI provisions are already included in a few DTAs. New Zealand signed and ratified the MLI in 2018. A number of DTAs have been modified in 2019 as a consequence. 13 14 15 | The OECD has noted that this new guidance ensures that: • actual business transactions undertaken by associated enterprises are identified, and transfer pricing is not based on contractual arrangements that do not reflect economic reality; • contractual allocations of risk are respected only when they are supported by actual decision-making; • capital without functionality will generate no more than a risk- free return, assuring that no premium returns will be allocated to cash boxes without relevant substance; and • tax administrations may disregard transactions which are commercially irrational. New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules have been amended to ensure alignment with the new OECD guidance and remain effective at combatting BEPS. The following key amendments have been made: • The economic substance and actual conduct of the parties, along with the legal contract, will inform the transfer pricing analysis. In certain circumstances, the economic substance and actual conduct will have priority over the terms of the legal contract. This is achieved by requiring the transfer pricing transaction to be “accurately delineated”. (See flow chart.) • Where a transfer pricing arrangement is not commercially rational because it includes unrealistic terms that unrelated parties would not be willing to agree to, the transaction may be disregarded and, if appropriate, replaced. Transfer Pricing Transfer pricing rules guard against multinationals using related-party arrangements to shift profits offshore. The rules require the profits from these arrangements to be determined using the arm’s length conditions, including price, which unrelated parties would agree to use. The overall objective of the BEPS Action Plan for transfer pricing is to see operational profits allocated appropriately to the significant economic activities which generate them. As a result, changes have been made to more than half of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017 with four key chapters fully revised. Accurate Delineation Factual analysis: contract and conduct, taken together Accurately delineated transaction Price (comparability, method) Allocate risk (contract and financial capacity) Interpretation of facts • Alignment of contract and conduct? • Control over risk and financial capacity? YESNO | 16 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 Other changes have been made to strengthen Inland Revenue’s ability to monitor and enforce the new transfer pricing rules. These changes include: • Putting the onus of proof on the taxpayer for providing evidence (such as documentation) that their transfer pricing positions are correct (that is, they are determined using arm’s length conditions). • Allowing Inland Revenue to extend the time bar for assessing transfer pricing issues to seven years, in those cases where Inland Revenue has notified the taxpayer that a tax audit or investigation has commenced within the usual four-year-time b ar. • Additional powers for Inland Revenue to request information from large multinational groups in order to assist a tax investigation of the relevant multinational. Transfer pricing rules have also been extended to those not usually regarded as associated parties such as non-resident investors that act in concert to effectively control a New Zealand entity, in particular private equity structures. The new transfer pricing rules: • place increased importance on people and local New Zealand functions; • focus on key decision-makers, where they are located, their decisions made with regard to risk, and their financial backing; and • limit profits associated with legal ownership alone of contractual rights and intangibles. Documentation As the burden of proof for transfer pricing matters rests with the taxpayer, a lack of adequate documentation may make it difficult for a company to rebut an alternative arm’s length transfer price proposed by Inland Revenue. In the event of a transfer pricing adjustment being imposed, a lack of adequate documentation is also likely to result in penalties. Checklist 1 Do you know the nature and extent of your cross-border associated party transactions? 2 If material, do you have documentation in support of the transfer prices and is this documentation kept updated? 3 In compiling this documentation, have you critically evaluated all intercompany agreements? 4 Does the documentation explain: • value adding functions of various parties to arrangements? • actual conduct of the parties? • how key risks are managed and controlled by the parties? 5 Has your local management and finance function been fully involved in the documentation process and signed off the factual analysis, as well as the final outcomes? 6 Have you given due consideration to applying for an advance pricing agreement? 17 | New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules have always been about striking a balance between protecting the tax base and containing compliance costs. We have implemented a range of simplification measures targeted at reducing compliance costs in situations that are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk. Low Value-Adding Intra-Group Services The OECD has introduced an elective, simplified approach for pricing low value-adding intra-group services. Inland Revenue has recognised that there are considerable benefits for taxpayers in aligning our practice with international standards and has adopted this simplification measure for qualifying low value-adding intra-group services with a total value below NZ$1m per annum. For income years commencing on or after 1 July 2018, qualifying services may be priced at cost plus a mark-up of 5% without the need to provide benchmarking analysis. Application of Restricted Transfer Pricing Approach to Outbound Loans New rules have been introduced requiring certain related-party loans between a non- resident lender and a New Zealand-resident borrower to be priced using a restricted transfer pricing approach. To further reduce compliance costs, Inland Revenue will accept a symmetrical approach also being taken on outbound loans. Accordingly, where New Zealand-resident lenders correctly apply the restricted transfer pricing approach to set the interest rate on their loans to related non-resident borrowers, we will consider the result to be arm’s length. This is on the basis that the amount deducted by the non-resident borrower in the foreign jurisdiction does not exceed the amount returned as income by the New Zealand resident lender. Small Value Loans For small value loans (i.e. for cross-border associated party loans by groups of companies for up to $10m principal in total), we currently consider 325 basis points (3.25%) over the relevant base indicator is broadly indicative of an arm’s length rate, in the absence of a readily available market rate for a debt instrument with similar terms and risk characteristics. Transactions priced in accordance with this simplification measure are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk and as such no further benchmarking is required. Small Wholesale Distributors Foreign-owned wholesale distributors (i.e. firms that purchase and on-sell goods to other firms without significant transformation) are the most common multinational business model encountered in New Zealand. For foreign-owned wholesale distributors with an annual turnover of under $30m, we currently consider a weighted average EBITE ratio of 3% or greater is broadly indicative of an arm’s length outcome in the absence of readily available transactional data for that distributor’s transfer pricing transactions or other comparable market data for distributors operating with similar risk characteristics. Transfer pricing outcomes in accordance with this indicative ratio are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk and as such no benchmarking is required to support the arm’s length nature of the distributor’s weighted average EBITE ratio. Further Measures Inland Revenue is considering additional simplification measures, including threshold levels set for existing measures, especially in respect of coverage of small and medium enterprises. We continuously monitor best practices of other tax administrations and are open to ideas on potential measures from both tax practitioners and the business community.

However, this only applies if the other country signs the MLI and chooses to adopt the definition. Where the new definition does not apply, a new anti-avoidance rule has been passed into our domestic law which also overrides those double tax treaties without the widened MLI definition. These anti-avoidance measures target multinationals with global turnover above EUR 750m that try to avoid New Zealand tax by carrying on significant sales activities through associated or commercially dependent parties in New Zealand. The following factors will be applied by Inland Revenue to determine whether more in-depth inquiries are required in this regard: • Significant functions are in practice carried out in New Zealand in relation to the sale, including those activities designed to convince a customer to acquire supplies from the non-resident. • The non-resident has little or no contact with the New Zealand customer (other than executing the sales contract). • The more complicated the supply, the more likely significant functions will be carried out in New Zealand to achieve sales. • The employees of the New Zealand facilitator are highly remunerated, possibly indicating the provision of high value activities for non-residents. • No or low foreign tax ultimately being payable on the income from New Zealand (though the payment of tax on the income in another jurisdiction is not sufficient to circumvent the application of the rule). Where a supply is subject to the new rule, the non-resident is deemed to make that supply through the deemed PE. The activities of the facilitator in relation to the supply are also attributed to the PE. Notional charges for royalties and intra- company funding as well as mark-ups on general administration services will generally not be available as deductions for branch-to-branch and head office-to- branch dealings. Inland Revenue is supportive of taxpayers in restructuring their New Zealand operations in response to this new PE anti-avoidance rule by either adopting a formal PE, or by moving to a standard local distributor model (where the goods or services are sold by the non-resident to an associated party that then on-sells the goods to unrelated customers). However, Inland Revenue will not accept returning more income in another taxpayer in lieu of a formal restructure. New Permanent Establishment Anti-Avoidance Rule | 20 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 New Zealand has adopted new rules to counter hybrid and branch mismatches, following closely the BEPS Action 2 recommendations of the OECD. Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements are cross- border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an instrument, entity or branch under the laws of two or more countries to eliminate, defer or reduce income tax. This is often referred to as double non-taxation. Common examples of mismatches include the following: • A payment that is interest and deductible in New Zealand, but is treated as an exempt dividend in another jurisdiction. • A deductible payment made by a New Zealand subsidiary to its foreign parent where, under the tax law in the parent’s country, the parent treats the subsidiary as a branch and disregards it. • A dual resident company or branch that claims deductions for expenditure in both New Zealand and another jurisdiction. The following are not hybrid mismatches: • Mismatches in tax rates between jurisdictions. • Deductible payments made to tax exempt entities (unless they would be hybrid payments if made to a taxable entity). • Deductible payments made to entities in a jurisdiction that does not tax foreign-sourced income. With the exception of structured arrangements, the new rules are limited to taxpayers that are related to persons subject to tax in one or more other jurisdictions or are themselves subject to tax in another jurisdiction. Taxpayers who are potentially affected by the rules will need to ensure they understand how payments made to or by them are treated by their counterparty for tax purposes. The intended outcome of the introduction of hybrid and branch mismatch rules is to reduce the incidence of hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements. Generally, if a taxpayer chooses an ordinary arrangement or structure over one that exploits a mismatch, then the tax advantage will be removed, without any need to apply the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Even if this choice does not result in additional tax revenue for New Zealand, this is a desirable outcome. To monitor compliance with these new rules, the BEPS disclosure (to be completed with company tax returns) contains a section on hybrid and branch mismatches. Hybrid and Branch Mismatches 21 | Cross-border financings form a substantial part of total associated party dealings by New Zealand members of multinational groups. Key issues include the pricing of interest and guarantee fees at market rates, taking into account the special considerations addressed by the restricted transfer pricing rules, and capital structuring within New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules. New Zealand-owned multinationals also need to account for the very same issues in their outbound financing activities. Restricted Transfer Pricing Rules New rules have been introduced requiring related-party loans between a non-resident lender and a New Zealand-resident borrower to be priced using a restricted transfer pricing approach. Under this approach, specific rules and parameters are applied to certain inbound related-party loans to: • determine the credit rating of New Zealand borrowers at a high risk of BEPS; and • remove any features not typically found in third party debt (“exotic features”) in order to calculate (in combination with the credit rating rule) the appropriate amount of interest that is deductible on the debt. For the purposes of the restricted transfer pricing rules, a New Zealand-resident borrower, who is neither an insuring nor lending person, will be considered a high BEPS risk when at least one of two factors is present: • It has a New Zealand group debt percentage as measured for thin capitalisation purposes, that is greater than 40%, unless its ratio is within 110% of its world-wide group where relevant. • The borrowing is from a low tax rate jurisdiction that is different from the ultimate parent (i.e. a borrowing from a lender resident in a country where the interest income is subject to a lower than 15% tax rate). Exotic features under the new rules include: • The term of the loan being greater than five years. • Subordination. • Payment other than in money (for example, repaying a loan by issuing shares). • Interest payment deferral beyond 12 months. • Options which give rise to premiums on interest rates (for example, on early repayment by the borrower). • Promissory notes or other instruments which do not provide rights to foreclose/accelerate repayment in the event of borrower default. • Contingencies (for example, where interest is repaid only under certain conditions). Separate rules apply to financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. A lender may wish to invoke the mutual agreement procedure (MAP) if it considers that the deductible amount in New Zealand under the restricted transfer pricing rules is less than the lender’s jurisdiction will require to be returned as income, applying the arm’s length standard. This will require the presentation of a case to the lender jurisdiction’s competent authority and/or the New Zealand competent authority. Borrowers are not entitled to determine their deductible interest on the basis that the restricted transfer pricing rules are over-ridden by a double tax agreement unless they have first been through the MAP process. Related-Party Financing Arrangements | 22 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 Thin Capitalisation Rules New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules have been based on the principle that a multinational group should not have significantly less capital in New Zealand, relative to the size of its New Zealand business, than it has on a worldwide basis, unless it has no more than a 60% debt/assets ratio. Historically, this comparison has been made by comparing the ratio of debt to assets for the New Zealand group with the same ratio for the worldwide group. However, this measure did not deal well with companies which have non-debt liabilities (such as large trade creditors or deferred tax liabilities). When a New Zealand group has significant non- debt liabilities, its debt/assets ratio can appear relatively low, even though it has very little equity contributed by its owners. The thin capitalisation rules have been amended to prevent this, by excluding non-debt liabilities from the definition of assets. A number of other changes have been made to strengthen the thin capitalisation rules, including: • Reducing the ability for companies owned by a group of non- residents to use related-party debt. • New rules for when a company can use an asset valuation for thin capitalisation purposes that is different from what is used for financial reporting purposes. • An anti-avoidance rule that applies when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end of a year to circumvent the thin capitalisation rules. Note that the BEPS disclosure (to be completed with company tax returns) contains a section on both the restricted transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules. Debt Assets Debt Assets – Non-debt liabilities HAS BECOME 23 | Revised Rules In 2017, a number of changes to the taxation of interest payments to non-residents were enacted to correct anomalies in the rules. There were two parts to this reform package: Changes to the NRWT rules generally to bring the rules dealing with timing and quantification of income subject to withholding tax in line with the financial arrangements rules, ensuring a better matching of deductions for the borrower with the imposition of NRWT on the lender. Changes to the NRWT/AIL rules, which particularly affect branch structures previously used to get around the rules. In relation to the first set of rules, New Zealand borrowers who have related-party debt where interest payments are made more than a year in arrears will need to consider whether the rules now require them to deduct NRWT on an accrual basis (i.e. as interest is deducted) rather than as payments are made. Non-Resident Withholding Tax/Approved Issuer Levy Cash Pooling Arrangements Inland Revenue is monitoring cash pooling arrangements. In general, all cash pool participants should benefit from enhanced interest rates applicable to debit and credit positions within a cash pooling arrangement compared with the rates they would expect to obtain from borrowing or depositing cash outside the pool. If a negative balance in a cash pool extends beyond a short- term liquidity arrangement, it may be more appropriate to treat that participation as a term loan. Guarantees and Cross-Guarantees The restricted transfer pricing rules do not explicitly refer to guarantee fees. Inland Revenue considers no fee is generally appropriate for a financial guarantee of debt between parties that are commonly owned unless it can be clearly shown that the guarantee provides benefits to the borrower beyond those that are obtained as a consequence of being part of a multinational group. In most circumstances, the guaranteed borrower will not benefit beyond the level of credit enhancement attributable to the implicit support of other multinational group members. Similar issues arise in respect of cross-guarantees, where two or more entities in a multinational group guarantee each other’s obligations. Payment of a guarantee fee to a non-resident related party may be appropriate if it guarantees third party debt. However, this would have to be considered on a case-by-case basis and the total cost of the arrangement would not be expected to materially exceed the cost of a non-resident group member borrowing from a third party and on-lending to the New Zealand borrower with the New Zealand borrower’s interest deduction calculated under the restricted transfer pricing rules. Derivatives We are monitoring the use of cross-border derivatives between related parties. Such derivatives should not only be priced in accordance with the arm’s length principle but also must be commercially explicable. Financing Risks Under Watch (a) (b) | 24 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 The purpose of this multilateral instrument is to amend a significant number of bilateral double tax treaties to include recommendations from the BEPS Action Plan. The treaty allows New Zealand to update and strengthen most of our tax treaties without having to enter into negotiations with each of our tax treaty partners. Some jurisdictions have chosen to adopt the minimum standard provisions; others have adopted a combination of minimum standard and best practice provisions. New Zealand has agreed to adopt as many of the provisions as possible, as far as they are in line with our overall tax treaty policy. This is intended to give New Zealand the best chance of strengthening our treaties with as many jurisdictions as possible.

It is possible under current rules for companies to derive substantial income from a country in which they have significant presence without being liable for income tax there. The OECD is trying to achieve an internationally agreed solution to the problem by the end of 2020, which would involve changing the current international income tax framework. Some countries have adopted separate digital services taxes as unilateral measures to address the problem in the interim. New Zealand is actively participating in the OECD discussions on this major issue. An internationally agreed solution is considered preferable; however, we are considering other options such as a digital services tax should an international solution not be reached in a reasonable time frame. As a small open economy, we generally try to keep our tax policy settings within the bounds of international norms to provide a stable and certain environment for cross-border investment. June 2019 – Endorsement by G20 “We welcome the recent progress on addressing the tax challenges arising from digitalization and endorse the ambitious work program that consists of a two-pillar approach, developed by the Inclusive Framework on BEPS. We will redouble our efforts for a consensus-based solution with a final report by 2020.” The OECD proposals for addressing the tax challenges arising from the digital economy have been grouped into two pillars: Four proposals: User contribution. Marketing intangibles. Significant economic presence. Distribution approach. All four proposals eliminate the physical presence requirement but determine profits in the source jurisdiction differently. A “unified approach” based on the commonalities of all the above proposals is also to be considered. One proposal: Address ongoing profit shifting that arises due to significant disparities in tax rates and limit the “race to the bottom” on tax rates. Provide residence and source countries a right to “tax back” profits subject to no or very low rates of taxation in jurisdictions where those profits are derived. The Digital Economy — “Unfinished Business” (a) (b) (c) (d) Pillar 2 – GloBE (Global anti-Base Erosion) Pillar 1 – Nexus and profit allocation | 26 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 Post-BEPS Top 10 Recommended Actions 1 Recalculate thin cap ratios (e.g. adjust for large trade creditors and deferred tax liability). 2 Check borrower credit ratings, especially if less than investment grade (BBB-). 3 Review loan agreements for exotic features (e.g. subordination, five year+ terms). 4 Scrutinise inter-company contracts as to consistency with actual behaviour. 5 Update transfer pricing documentation for control and management of key risks. 6 Examine booking locations of all sales to New Zealand customers, especially where there is a New Zealand entity carrying out sales-related activity. 7 Obtain reliable information about the foreign tax treatment of payments to foreign related parties and group members. 8 Review treatment of foreign hybrid entities (e.g. Australian limited partnerships). 9 Evaluate New Zealand branches and hybrid entities (e.g. limited partnerships and unlimited liability companies) as to possible double deductions. 10 Consider overall reasonableness of results – do they make sense as to New Zealand value add? 27 | “Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.” - Louis Brandeis (1914) International Transparency The availability of timely, targeted and comprehensive information is essential to enable tax administrations to quickly identify risk areas. There has been a major paradigm shift globally over the last ten years to greater disclosure and increased international exchanges of information. Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters This convention is the most comprehensive multilateral instrument available for all forms of international tax co-operation. New Zealand has signed and ratified the convention and, with 130 jurisdictions currently participating in the convention, our exchange of information network now extends to all G20 countries, all BRICS, all OECD countries and major finance centres. Exchange of Information on Tax Rulings In accordance with the BEPS Action 5 minimum standard, New Zealand exchanges information on tax rulings, primarily summary details of unilateral advance pricing agreements and permanent establishment determinations. In the three years to 31 December 2018, New Zealand has exchanged details on 106 qualifying rulings and received details from treaty partners as to 164 qualifying rulings. The initiative has been aimed at “soft” or “sweetheart” rulings that may in effect provide tax holidays to multinationals. Not only has the receipt of details of rulings from treaty partners provided valuable insights into arrangements of multinationals, the initiative has provided much needed integrity to the overall system of rulings internationally. Country-by-Country Reporting New Zealand exchanges CbC reports with treaty partners in accordance with the BEPS Action 13 minimum standard. In the first year of the initiative, New Zealand exchanged CbC reports for 21 multinationals headquartered here and, in the year to 31 December 2018 we received 1402 CbC reports from treaty partners. Over two-thirds of foreign-owned multinationals with annual group turnover in New Zealand above $30m are subject to inward-bound CbC reporting. The rich information in these CbC reports as to how multinationals allocate their global income together with indicators as to the location of economic activity within these groups, further strengthen our transfer pricing risk assessments, providing us with a full picture of supply chain profitability. Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration Inland Revenue, along with 39 other tax administrations, is an active member of JITSIC which offers a platform to enable active collaboration within the legal framework of bilateral and multilateral conventions and tax information exchange agreements. New Zealand has benefited through the sharing of intelligence and strategies to deal with emerging tax risks involving multinationals as well as advances in analytical techniques and best practice compliance approaches. Liaison with New Zealand Customs Service Customs plays an important role in New Zealand’s international trade. Customs and Inland Revenue work closely together, especially in respect of period- end valuation adjustments. It is not uncommon for multinationals to invoice their intercompany transactions based on budget data and then adjust at year end to earn an agreed arm’s length operating margin. The new provisional values scheme in the Customs and Excise Act 2018 allows certain importers to provide a reasonable estimate of value on an import entry when they cannot establish the customs value at time of import. Importers with acceptable transfer-pricing arrangements can apply to use provisional values. Customs now consults with Inland Revenue to determine whether the importer does have an acceptable transfer-pricing arrangement where the criteria for automatic qualification for the provisional values scheme are not met. Contributing to Capacity Building in Asia and the Pacific Greater tax transparency and the exchange of information are vital to combatting aggressive tax planning. New Zealand is committed to supporting tax administrations in Asia and the Pacific in implementing international tax standards and increasing international co-operation. We do this by way of various one-to-many outreach activities and participation in joint training events arranged through organisations such as the OECD (Global Relations), the Study Group on Asian Taxation Administration and Research, and the Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association. | 28 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 Binding Rulings, Factual Reviews, Indicative Views and Advance Pricing Agreements To provide taxpayers with greater assurance about tax issues and to get it right from the start we have a range of options in place. Binding Rulings We can issue binding rulings for taxpayers to provide certainty about the interpretation of tax laws. A binding ruling is Inland Revenue’s interpretation of how a tax law applies to a particular arrangement or to the tax status of a person or thing. An arrangement is any agreement, contract, plan or understanding (whether or not it is enforceable), including any steps and transactions that carry it into effect. In addition, we have the ability to rule on the status of a taxpayer, such as whether they are a “non-resident”, and certain other matters, without the need to have an arrangement. From 1 October 2019, we are providing short process rulings. The basic criteria for being eligible to apply for this type of ruling are the person’s annual gross income for the tax year prior to the year in which the application is made is $20m or less and the matter on which the ruling is sought concerns a tax (other than provisional tax), duty, or levy that is expected to amount to less than $1m. If you have been given a binding ruling, you are not required to follow the ruling. But if you do follow a binding ruling exactly as described in the ruling and satisfy any stated conditions, Inland Revenue is bound by it. A binding ruling does not remove the requirement to file an income tax return and pay any taxes arising either by following the ruling, or taking a different tax position. Before you apply for a binding ruling, you can set up a pre-lodgement meeting to help clarify the issues and determine the scope of the ruling. We aim to complete binding rulings within 10 weeks of an application, although shorter timeframes may be possible in some circumstances. For more information, please refer to our guide for Binding Rulings (IR715). Factual Reviews If you have applied for a binding ruling, you may request a factual review to obtain a level of certainty on whether a critical factual condition in the ruling will be satisfied. You can request a factual review (in writing) at any time before or immediately after the issue of the ruling. Indicative Views In some circumstances, a request for an indicative view may be a more suitable option. Indicative views are not binding on the Commissioner and are available to larger enterprises. An indicative view would generally be provided for prospective major transactions. It will not be provided for arrangements involving potential tax avoidance or hypothetical situations. Advance Pricing Agreements Advance pricing agreements have proven extremely useful as a robust upfront means of dealing with transfer pricing risk, especially the more complex issues that arise. An APA is an agreement between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer which confirms the basis for their international pricing. Multinationals that complete an APA need to submit annual reports and supporting evidence to us to confirm their compliance with the agreement. APAs represent a more co-operative approach to tax compliance as opposed to potentially adversarial audits. The product is ideally suited to the more complex transfer pricing issues such as intangibles and the provision of specialised services. We completed 23 APAs this last year, 11 more than 2018. As at 30 June 2019, we had completed 205 APAs in total. Most of our bilateral APA work has been with Australia. We have also completed bilateral APAs with Belgium, Canada, Japan, Korea, Switzerland and the United States. We are currently working on our first bilateral APAs with China, India and the United Kingdom. We have found unilateral APAs successful in both inbound and outbound transfer pricing scenarios. Although unilateral APAs are one-sided, should double taxation arise on transactions covered by a unilateral APA, we will enter into competent authority negotiations with the other jurisdiction on the basis of the unilateral APA position. Unilateral APAs are especially viable where the amounts at stake are small and/or where most of the transfer pricing risk lies in New Zealand. Our aim is to complete unilateral APAs within six months of the date of acceptance of a formal application. Bilateral negotiations, especially beyond Australia, generally take considerably longer to conclude . 29 | Mutual Agreement Procedure New Zealand has 40 double taxation agreements, each with an article establishing a mutual agreement procedure for resolving difficulties arising out of the application of the particular DTA. New Zealand has 11 tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) in force which also contain a MAP article, as well as six supplementary agreements to these TIEAs which include a MAP article. Under the MAP article, the competent authorities of the contracting states engage with each other and endeavour to resolve disputes that arise from the way one or both contracting states are interpreting or applying the particular DTA. Article 25 effectively equips the tax administrations with the practical means to ensure that cross-border income earning activity is taxed correctly in accordance with DTAs. Our overall aim is to complete MAP cases within 12 months of receiving a request for assistance. The time taken to resolve MAP cases will vary depending largely on the complexity of the matter in dispute. We have experienced a moderate case load in recent years with good turnaround times as follows: International Disputes Year to 31 DecemberNumber ResolvedAverage Cycle Time (months) 20151810 2016618 20171910 2018107 The genesis of BEPS Action 14 developed from a recognition that the actions to counter BEPS must be complemented with actions that ensure certainty and predictability for businesses and individuals. It was therefore necessary to develop robust dispute settlement processes across jurisdictions to ensure that disputes are resolved in a timely, effective and efficient manner. New Zealand is a member of the Forum on Tax Administration’s MAP Forum and has committed to resolving treaty-related disputes within an average timeframe of 24 months. We have also been subject to a rigorous peer review by the MAP Forum, their main recommendation being that we update a number of our older DTAs to the latest wording of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which we are progressing through the implementation of the multilateral instrument and bilateral negotiations. Arbitration New Zealand has opted to apply Part VI of the MLI which introduces arbitration as a means of dispute resolution. If a solution cannot be reached under MAP, taxpayers have the ability to request unresolved issues be taken to arbitration. New Zealand has had arbitration in the double tax treaties with Australia and Japan but has had no requests to date. We consider arbitration incentivises competent authorities to resolve disputes within a reasonable time period (the general standard being two years). | 30 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 New Zealand continues to work with the OECD and treaty partners to ensure our international agreements are fit for purpose. We have double tax agreements with 40 countries and negotiate updates to those DTAs and conclude new DTAs as needs or circumstances arise. The most recent notable update has been a new DTA signed with China on 1 April 2019 (this is not yet in force). We commenced the automatic exchange of financial account information with the United States in September 2015 and, following New Zealand’s commitment to the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard, we have agreed to exchange financial account information to another 90 jurisdictions. We have a number of on-going international commitments, including: • Active participation in various OECD and Forum on Tax Administration working parties and projects, membership of the Study Group on Asian Tax Administration and Research, and observership with the Belt and Road Initiative Tax Administration Cooperation Forum; and • Supporting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade free trade agreement programme and the New Zealand delegation at the United Nations on tax matters. Tax Treaty Abuse BEPS Action 6 identified tax treaty abuse, and in particular treaty shopping, as one of the most important sources of BEPS concerns. Taxpayers that engage in treaty shopping and other types of treaty abuse undermine tax sovereignty by claiming treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances, especially where companies route profits through low or no tax jurisdictions to avoid paying taxes in a third country. Tackling treaty shopping is one of the four BEPS minimum standards, and jurisdictions have committed to include provisions in their tax agreements to ensure a minimum level of protection against treaty shopping. The majority of Inclusive Framework members, including New Zealand, are progressing towards implementation of the minimum standard by modifying their treaty networks with the help of the multilateral instrument. Dual Resident Entities - Good Housekeeping Required Dual resident entities can be used to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities by manipulating the current “place of effective management” test in double tax treaties. Article 4(1) of the MLI, if countries agree to its application, requires competent authorities to determine the residence status of a dual resident entity. If there is no agreement, then treaty benefits will be denied or only granted to the extent to which the competent authorities can agree. In making a determination, competent authorities will consider several factors: • Place of effective management; • Place where the company is incorporated or otherwise constituted; and • Any other relevant factors. In terms of trade and investment, our double tax treaty with Australia is the most significant and this has been modified accordingly as to dual residence by the MLI with effect from 1 January 2019. Taking a risk-based approach, the two competent authorities have agreed an administrative practice which should result in the great majority of trans-Tasman corporates being excluded from the competent authority determination process. From a practical perspective, the tax consequences of being a dual resident company can lead to a number of undesirable outcomes (restrictions on maintaining an imputation credit account, grouping losses, being a member of a consolidated tax group and deductions being denied under anti-hybrid rules). New Zealand companies doing trans-Tasman business need to carefully review their governance arrangements (including where board meetings are held and where directors and senior executives make strategic decisions) to ensure dual residence does not arise inadvertently. Tax Treaty Programme Update 31 | Business Transformation To deliver on our objectives and vision for a modern tax system, we have embarked on a major change programme. Our multi-year, multi-stage Business Transformation programme is reshaping the way the department serves New Zealanders. Simple, certain and open customer-centred services are being designed and delivered in partnership with others inside and outside government. The overall result will be a modern, digital tax system that will serve the needs of all New Zealanders and fit seamlessly into their lives. It will also be a system that keeps pace with change, protecting the Government’s ability to keep providing services. Delivering our future tax system will require us to: • Simplify policy and legislative settings. • Make more intelligent use of information to ensure customers get it right from the start. • Fit revenue processes seamlessly into people’s lives and enable them to self-manage with speed and certainty. • Become more agile, effective and efficient. • Implement a modern technology platform that is digitally based and highly automated. This year saw the most significant changes to tax on income in a generation including: • Migrating income tax and Working for Families to new systems and processes. • Introducing a new, automatic year-end process so that people who only earn income which is reported to Inland Revenue no longer need to do anything at the end of the year. • New reporting requirements for employment and investment income information. • Implementing and operating a data and intelligence platform to enable better tailoring and targeting of services to customers. • Replacing Inland Revenue’s website and revamping digital channels and services. • Implementing and embedding new tool sets and equipment that support Inland Revenue’s new ways of working, including networked teams and more remote working. • Implementing a new Enterprise Support Services platform which will replace Inland Revenue’s existing human resources and financial systems. New analytical capabilities are changing the way Inland Revenue interacts with customers Discovery Manager and Integrity Manager are capabilities within START. Discovery Manager is where Inland Revenue looks at returns received and information held to “discover” things. For example: • Customers registering for GST are separated into different groups, such as those registering for the first time, and tailored education is provided to them. • Employer information files are analysed to identify inaccurate information early. • People on incorrect tax codes can be helped to get things right, for example, by suggesting a tailored tax code to them. Integrity Manager enables assessments and refunds to be stopped where there is a high likelihood they are wrong or fraudulent. Inland Revenue may call the customer, release the return or refund, or decide to investigate further. Things that require review are now more easily identified. For example: • Rules look at donations as a percentage of income. • Claims for non-business expenses can be assessed. • Searches can be done for IP addresses and the use of anonymisers or proxies. Inland Revenue also has the ability to view someone’s session online if there is doubt – such as a customer making multiple changes and then checking back repeatedly to see the progress of a refund. S TA RT DISCOVERY MANAGER INTEGRITY MANAGER | 32 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 Third parties and customers will be proactively contacted during the year where Inland Revenue identifies things that are not right: • Deductions and entitlements will be adjusted during the year as customers’ circumstances change to ensure assistance is provided at the time it is needed and tax is withheld correctly. • There will be fewer errors because problems will be identified during the year and customers prompted to address them, making any under or over payments easier to manage. • More people will be on the right tax code regardless of their employment arrangements. Over time, proactively prompting customers to make changes during the year will mean fewer people will end up with a refund or tax to pay at the end of the year. In addition, the average amounts will be less. It will take a couple of cycles for these benefits to become fully evident. 33 | Glossary AIL Approved issuer levy APA Advance pricing agreement BCP Basic compliance package BEPS Base erosion and profit shifting BRICS Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa CbC Country-by-country reporting DTA s Double taxation agreements EBIT Earnings before interest and tax EBITDA Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITE Earnings before interest, tax and exceptional items Guidelines OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises IMF International monitoring framework | 34 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2019 IQ International questionnaire JITSIC Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration MAP Mutual agreement procedure MLI or multilateral instrument Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS MNEs Multinational enterprises NRWT Non-resident withholding tax OECD Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development PE Permanent establishment PPT Principal purpose test SE Significant enterprises TIEA Tax information exchange agreement UN United Nations 35 | Contacts Purpose Contact Principal Competent Authorities John Nash (International Revenue Strategy Manager) Anu Anand (Strategy and Intelligence Manager) Carmel Peters (Strategic Policy Advisor) Bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements John Nash International Revenue Strategy Manager Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz Mutual Agreement Procedure John Nash International Revenue Strategy Manager Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz Unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (including advice and arranging pre-application meetings) Team Manager Technical Services Office of the Chief Tax Counsel PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Rulings@ird.govt.nz General Transfer Pricing Queries Transfer.Pricing@ird.govt.nz Exchange of Information Anu Anand Strategy and Intelligence Manager International Revenue Strategy Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz Country-by-Country Reporting CbC@ird.govt.nz Dual Residence Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz

New Zealand is now starting to recover from the major impacts of the global pandemic. During this challenging period, we have successfully completed our business transformation programme, which has modernised our country’s tax and social policy system. Introduction from the Commissioner Our new systems meant we could respond quickly to legislative and policy changes, setting up a range of initiatives in a matter of days and weeks, to support the Government’s COVID-19 response. We were able to help many businesses stay afloat at a critical time for them, moving at a pace that was not possible before transformation. As the principal steward of New Zealand’s tax system, we play a crucial role in maintaining and enhancing its integrity by striving for clarity, consistency and simplicity in meeting both domestic and global challenges. We advise the Government on international tax issues and help to develop and implement New Zealand’s international tax legislation. We actively work with groups such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and tax agencies in other jurisdictions. Internationally driven measures feature heavily in our work to ensure New Zealand’s tax system contributes to global solutions for global tax issues. We are working actively with other jurisdictions bilaterally and multilaterally to promote tax transparency and facilitate international tax compliance. We continue to work hard to ensure all individuals and businesses conducting cross-border transactions and investing overseas pay their fair share of tax. We are very fortunate that in New Zealand most individuals and businesses comply voluntarily and we aim to make tax matters as easy as possible for them. For those few who do not comply we are increasing our focus on enforcement and taking action where necessary. I want to take this opportunity to thank all multinationals and their representatives for their cooperation and efforts to comply with their tax obligations, even when faced with considerable disruption through the recent challenging years. We value the contribution that we can make together to improve the wellbeing of current and future generations of New Zealanders. What Your Taxes Pay For Everyone benefits from tax Ka puta he hua ki te katoa i te tāke The money Inland Revenue collects helps pay for the essential services that all New Zealanders benefit from such as healthcare, social policy payments, education and protecting our environment. It’s our responsibility to ensure government has funding for them. $6.8b | Core government services $6.2b | Law and order $5.5b | Transport and communications $3.7b | Economic and industrial services $2.9b | Defence $2.4b | Environmental protection $2.3b | Housing and community development $1.5b | Heritage, culture and recreation $1.2b | Primary services $0.13b | Other $0.61b | Government Superannuation Fund pension expenses $41.5b Social security and welfare $28.5b Health $18.4b Education TAX REVENUE $104.5b Individuals tax $54.6b 52% of tax revenue Other $5.4b 5% of tax revenue GST $25.9b 25% of tax revenue Corporate tax $18.6b 18% of tax revenue In 2022–23, total revenue was $105.5 billion. Tax revenue was $104.5 billion. Direct or income taxation (for example, individuals income tax or corporate tax) accounted for 75% of tax revenue. GST accounted for 25%. In 2022-23, Government spend was as follows: 1 1 From Te Tai Ōhanga, the Treasury’s Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2024, published in May 2024: treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2024-05/befu24.pdf | 3 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 4 | New Zealand Context New Zealand individuals and businesses have become increasingly involved in international trade and investment. Although the vast majority of taxpayers voluntarily fulfil their tax obligations, some look for ways to evade or avoid paying their fair share. In doing so, they place an unfair burden on others and erode Government programmes from which all New Zealanders benefit. The New Zealand Government wants a productive and inclusive economy, and needs a sustainable revenue base to fund improvements to the wellbeing of New Zealanders and their families. This means it is important for everyone to pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand. New Zealand has a self-assessment tax system, which is based on people voluntarily complying with their tax obligations. Taxpayers are best placed to assess their tax liabilities, and specific obligations are set out in law. The integrity of the system is maintained because the majority of New Zealanders pay taxes and claim social support payments appropriately, and they are confident in Inland Revenue’s ability to take appropriate action against those who do not. In New Zealand there is a strong emphasis placed on tax policy and administration to ensure the integrity of the corporate tax base. A greater proportion of our tax base comprises corporate tax compared with other OECD member countries, together with the fact that a relatively small number of companies account for most of it, means that New Zealand remains vigilant on corporate tax base erosion. Foreign-owned multinational enterprises (MNEs) with an annual turnover of at least $30m account for $6.1b worth of corporate tax which is approximately 33% of the total corporate tax base. MNEs are a significant force in New Zealand’s economic environment and protecting New Zealand’s tax revenue means we need to look at compliance internationally as well as domestically. The increasing complexity of global business requires us to be actively involved in international solutions to facilitate compliance, and apply best international practices. Our work in this area means New Zealand continues to be an attractive place for people to do business and invest. Inland Revenue plays a unique role in making New Zealand a great place to live, work and raise a family. It is important that we are ready to maintain this role in a changing world. Inland Revenue’s Role At Inland Revenue we aspire to improve oranga for current and future generations. We make our biggest contribution to oranga through economic activities including collecting and distributing money. We deliver value for New Zealand and New Zealanders through three roles – being effective and efficient, active stewardship and making a broader contribution. Oranga derives from Te Ao Māori and encompasses the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of an individual and their interconnectedness with the natural world around them. | 5 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 The Last Five Years... Our previous documents have sought to make our approach to tax compliance more transparent for businesses and to give more certainty. In this 2024 update we are again aiming to create greater certainty for businesses as we collectively work to facilitate compliance. Considerable progress has been made in the last five years, as Inland Revenue saw the completion of the Business Transformation programme and successfully managed to move through the challenging period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2019 we have worked very hard domestically and globally to support our MNEs through any challenges they have faced as a result of the pandemic and all of its impacts. We have now successfully embedded all the anti-BEPS measures as business as usual and increased our intelligence sources through more information-sharing arrangements both domestically and internationally. Through this period there has also been a considerable amount of time and effort put into BEPS 2.0, as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been working with countries from around the globe on the Two Pillar Solution. New Zealand has continued to actively participate in the international effort to find the right global solution for taxing all MNEs appropriately. Inland Revenue continues to go through rolling peer reviews led by the OECD and we are pleased to report that New Zealand is meeting the international standards, helping us maintain a global reputation we can be all proud of and enjoy. Over recent years the number of MNEs operating in New Zealand has also increased, with over 800 significant foreign-owned groups in the 2023 income year. These MNEs remain a high priority for our compliance programme. They are reviewed annually and risk-assessed on the information they provide coupled with the other intelligence we receive from various domestic and international sources. Amongst the several information and intelligence sources for the MNEs, our short international questionnaire remains a top priority for Inland Revenue when it comes to collecting the right information in a timely and cost-effective manner. We thank all the MNEs and their representatives who have worked very closely with us annually to achieve a 100% response rate to this questionnaire over the last five years. The responses we have received helped us shape our compliance campaigns as well as ensure we minimise compliance costs for our customers by not imposing on their time and resources unless considered totally necessary. Multinational Enterprises Compliance Focus 2019 IR1106 NOVEMBER 2016 Multinational Enterprises COMPLIANCE FOCUS 6 | Our Compliance Framework The framework illustrated in the diagram below demonstrates what we have been able to achieve through the success of our multi-year multi-stage transformation programme. This programme has enabled us to design our systems and introduce new policies that assure a larger part of our tax base which means we collect more revenue with reduced effort. We have designed and enhanced our systems and processes to automate and make it easier for our customers. Through effective policy and smart system design buttressed by the appropriate guidance, we are now able to ensure that most New Zealanders get the right tax treatment at the right time through the right channels with minimal effort on their part. Through our transformation programme we have also gained a wide suite of sophisticated analytical capabilities which enable us to work more in real-time and be intelligence-led. These new capabilities coupled with human intelligence allow us to design and deploy effective compliance campaigns, with multi-faceted tailored interventions. This ability to target our interventions to the right customers means we should only be in the lives of those customers who are deserving of further inquiries and interventions.

The OECD has over many years promoted international cooperation in tax matters through a range of international standards, including the initial BEPS Action Plan and more recently the comprehensive work on introducing the Two Pillar Solution. New Zealand continues to actively participate in this work to do our part in tackling global tax problems and ensuring New Zealand’s interests are also fed into the design and development of these standards to the extent possible. New Zealand has signed up to all the international minimum standards, these include the following from the BEPS Action Plan: Action 5 – exchanging summaries of cross-border tax rulings Action 6 – preventing tax treaty abuse Action 13 – country-by-country (CbC) reporting Action 14 – making dispute resolution mechanisms more effective. More recently New Zealand has also signed up to Pillar Two which will come into effect from 1 January 2025. New Zealand is a net importer of information from treaty partners, hence, the additional information and intelligence we receive through international transparency initiatives further enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to design better solutions for our MNEs and also prevent any base erosion in an effective manner. The role of the Competent Authority The role of the Competent Authority (CA) is defined in our tax treaties and generally involves serving as the primary point of contact for both domestic taxpayers with offshore links and competent authorities in other jurisdictions. The CA function facilitates the exchange of information and intelligence with tax treaty partners, both individual requests for information and automatic exchanges of information (such as the exchange of CbC reports, summaries of tax rulings and future Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (GloBE) information returns). Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) cases to eliminate double taxation or resolve double taxation disputes are also handled by the CA function. New Zealand’s CA function sits within Inland Revenue’s International Revenue Strategy (IRS) team. As New Zealand’s competent authority office, IRS administers New Zealand’s international tax agreements. The relevant contact details for the CA are listed on page 34 and our website: ird.govt.nz/international-tax/who-we-are 8 | International Tax Strategy Our international tax strategy aligns with Inland Revenue’s compliance model and the compliance framework which outlines the principles of how we should interact with our customers. New Zealand’s taxation of cross-border flows of income New Zealand’s international obligations Taxing New Zealanders who invest offshore Often driven by broader economic and foreign policy objectives – not just tax Engagement with international tax agencies, organisations and developing countries Taxing foreign investors on income earned in New Zealand Through our strategy we continue to strive to achieve a future state with the following characteristics: A New Zealand economy made more competitive and productive by ensuring there is a level playing field for all tax-compliant customers, fewer competitive distortions and the lowest possible compliance costs. Increased assurance to the community that Inland Revenue is tackling abuse of the tax system, especially through eliminating any base erosion by MNEs. Continued active collaboration across the globe with the aim to deliver the best outcomes right from the start for New Zealand.

New Zealand’s compliance objective for MNEs is to collect the “right amount of tax at the right time through the right channels”. In 2019 we launched our new compliance approach for MNEs – making a commitment to our customers that we will prioritise our efforts and focus mainly on prevention. We will be pragmatic and proportionate in reaching solutions to problems. In the intervening years, we have truly embedded this approach and remain committed to it. Pragmatism We will be reasonable and realistic, taking a pragmatic approach overall, especially in respect of transfer pricing given the various limitations in data and methodologies. Proportionality We will respect the additional dimensions presented by the MAP in our tax treaties as well as the global nature of MNE operations. Prioritisation We will prioritise our work based on tax risk and materiality, keeping taxpayer compliance costs and Inland Revenue’s administrative costs as low as possible. Prevention We will embrace the “right from the start” concept and as far as possible our primary focus will be on working cooperatively with MNEs to prevent BEPS. We will capitalise on our law reform to drive behavioural change in any MNEs inclined to indulge in aggressive tax planning practices. As a refresher the key principles of this approach are: 10 | Our Compliance Approach Helping customers get it right is at the heart of our approach. The approach we take is to focus on collecting revenue, and ensuring New Zealanders get the social policy payments they’re entitled to, with minimal effort for our customers and us. We continue to endorse the OECD’s concept of “enhanced relationships” regarding MNEs based on risk management and transparency as well as a fair, open and responsive administration. Through this approach, we invest in cooperative and constructive relationships with taxpayers and their advisers, fostering an environment that supports full and frank dialogue. This is reflected especially in our “four Ps” commitment to taxpayers (prioritisation, prevention, pragmatism and proportionality). Our international tax strategy is based on a customer-centric compliance model, which includes a number of principles setting out how we will interact with our MNE customers. We take a proactive “right from the start” approach, the aim of which is to engage with MNEs to ensure that they pay the right amount of tax at the right time through the right channels. This cooperative compliance environment also involves working closely with other tax administrations and key business interests to foster tax certainty and to facilitate trade and investment. Acting in real time and up-front. Prompting our customers at the time they interact with us will help us prevent non-compliance or address errors as they occur. We do this by encouraging MNEs to apply for rulings and unilateral/bilateral advance pricing agreements (APAs) which also give them certainty. Focusing on end-to-end processes from a customer point of view. Viewing the environment through the lens of a customer group allows us to build a comprehensive view of the customer’s lifecycle and therefore align interventions at the point in time where choices leading to compliance or non-compliance are made. We endeavour to gather good intelligence on our customers and understand their context. MNEs can obtain earlier certainty through binding rulings, including unilateral APAs. Make it easy to comply and difficult not to. By designing a customer-centric system that is intuitive and has limited opportunities to get it wrong, we can achieve sustainable behavioural change and reduce compliance effort for our customers. Where possible and appropriate we provide practical guidance and promote simplification measures for our customers. Actively involving and engaging customers and other stakeholders. Working with third parties and other key stakeholders we can influence changing technologies and evolving service channels to align to customer processes, achieve a reduction in effort, and increase customer certainty. We work collaboratively with MNEs and their representatives as we design new products and processes to ensure they are fit for purpose and mindful of compliance costs.

We have been actively monitoring all foreign-owned MNEs with an annual turnover of over $30m for ten years now. Over and above the open relationships, we designed an international questionnaire that most foreign-owned groups are required to complete annually. The intelligence gathered from the information in this questionnaire assisted in shaping New Zealand’s anti-BEPS measures and continues to inform our strategic and operational risk processes and compliance interventions in relation to this population. In more recent years, this intelligence has been further enhanced with additional information from the exchange of country-by-country reports and the summaries of cross- border tax rulings internationally, as well as information from the Overseas Investment Office (OIO) and the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) domestically. This enriched information helped shape our refreshed compliance approach. Based on our analysis of this intelligence, we developed a range of campaigns based around sector risks or specific issues. The primary intent of the campaigns was to ask for information and clarification of changes in MNE tax affairs to provide a clearer view of the impact of New Zealand’s anti-BEPS measures on MNE behaviour. Targeted interventions have ranged from analysis of questionnaire responses through to in-depth reviews involving additional documentation requests and discussions with the customers and/or their representatives. This approach has resulted in the effective prioritisation of audit cases, minimising any disruption to the operations of the MNEs unless absolutely necessary and giving us the assurance required of compliance by MNEs.

This year we have celebrated ten years of IQ in action. This was mainly designed to collect key information about financing and transfer pricing issues relating to foreign-owned MNEs operating in New Zealand. We now hold ten years of information and intelligence on MNEs that help us ensure they are complying with their tax obligations. The data also helps us design tailored approaches as we consider implementing major international initiatives in New Zealand. This information was very useful as we were recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite some significant losses reported by tourism and hospitality enterprises in the recent years, most MNEs have reported steady profits. Information from the IQ has also shown that the anti- BEPS measures taken here to reduce instances of MNEs’ shifting profits overseas have been working well. We carry out a macro analysis of the IQ data, examining patterns and trends, and identifying any potential anomalies. The following key performance indicators have been drawn from IQ data over the last three years: MetricIncome Year 202120222023 EBIT/Sales (Median, IQ population)5.7%6.0%5.0% EBIT/Sales (Median, IQ Distributors/Wholesale)4.4%5.0%4.1% Proportion of MNEs reporting material structural changes3.0%2.8%2.7% Proportion of groups without non-resident associated party debt64.9%65.6%62.3% Median Debt/Capitalisation (All groups where Debt > 0)47.3%40.9%38.0% You can find a copy of our latest IQ and the annual summaries for the last ten years at the following link: ird.govt.nz/international-tax/business/international-questionnaire | 13 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 Key Factors That Influence MNE Compliance M N E COMPLIANCE 7 1 6 2 5 83 10 4 9 Providing Practical Guidance/Increasing Certainty Expediting Resolution of International Tax Disputes Improving Corporate Tax Governance Building International Tax Capacity Increasing Tax Transparency Expanding the Tax Treaty Network Enhancing Intelligence and Analytics Strengthening Legislation Reducing Compliance Costs Extensive Monitoring and Targeted Enforcement (Including Campaigns, Audits and Litigation) 14 | 1. Strengthening Legislation Base Erosion and Profit Shifting – BEPS 1.0 BEPS refers to the various tax planning strategies used by MNEs to shift profits from higher tax jurisdictions (like New Zealand) to lower tax jurisdictions (including preferential tax regimes), exploiting loopholes and mismatches in tax rules. To address the growing concern about increasing BEPS practices, the 15-point BEPS Action Plan was agreed and published by the OECD in 2015. This action plan represented a major update of the international tax system, recognising that fundamental changes were needed in order to bolster its coherence, realign substance with taxation rights, and increase transparency. A wide range of anti-BEPS measures were introduced subsequently in New Zealand: Stronger rules as to permanent establishments Revised transfer pricing rules Revised thin capitalisation rules Strengthened non-resident withholding tax rules Anti-hybrid rules Interest limitation/restricted transfer pricing rules Anti-treaty shopping rules Country-by-country reporting Exchanges of cross-border tax ruling summaries New administrative measures to obtain key information and collect tax from MNEs Changes in New Zealand’s collection of goods and services tax have also helped to address the issues raised by globalisation and digitalised business models ensuring that GST is paid on goods and services consumed in New Zealand whether supplied by a local or overseas business. The implementation of these initiatives has reduced the ability of MNEs to engage in aggressive tax planning. When combined with existing anti-avoidance rules and close compliance scrutiny, New Zealand’s position within the current international tax framework is robust. In particular, we have noted considerable behavioural change, with many foreign-owned MNEs having: Introduced additional equity and/or reduced debt financing Changed terms and conditions of loan agreements with associated parties Unwound hybrid instruments, discontinued use of hybrid entities or otherwise eliminated previous hybrid or branch mismatch arrangements Updated transfer pricing policies and documentation taking into account the adoption of revised OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines Commenced booking sales in New Zealand which had previously been booked offshore Changed the local mode of operations, such as converting branches into subsidiaries or limited risk distributors into full risk distributors. | 15 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 There are four BEPS minimum standards that are subject to peer review to ensure timely and accurate implementation and thus safeguard the global level playing field: Base Erosion and Profit Shifting – BEPS 2.0 Pillar One Reallocation of Taxing Rights (Amount A) Amount A of Pillar One provides for a reallocation of taxing rights over a portion of the profits of the largest and most profitable MNEs based on the location of the customers or users. Unfortunately, there have been multiple delays in concluding this work. Updating the rules on a globally agreed, cohesive and principled basis remains the preferred option over other unilateral measures such as a digital services tax on gross revenues arising from highly digitalised business models that earn income from New Zealand. Optional Simplified and Streamlined Approach to In-Country Baseline Marketing and Distribution Activities (Amount B) The design of this approach was strongly focused on the specific needs of low-capacity jurisdictions who were unable to apply, or experienced extreme difficulties in applying, existing transfer pricing approaches (especially identifying local market comparables). New Zealand has not opted to apply this approach and, accordingly, the introduction of this approach in other jurisdictions does not change our current rules or practices. Pillar Two Minimum Global Effective Tax Rate of 15% New Zealand will be implementing the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules from 1 January 2025. The GloBE rules are designed so that MNEs with annual revenues above EUR 750m pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on their income (less a mark-up on cost of tangible assets and employees) in every country where that income is earned. Action 5 exchanges of summaries of cross-border tax rulings Action 6 preventing tax treaty abuse Action 13 exchanges of country-by-country reports Action 14 making international dispute resolution more effective New Zealand has implemented these minimum standards and has been peer reviewed covering these minimum standards. However, the following modern business practices have outgrown the international tax framework: Scale without mass – MNEs are able to transact with customers over the internet without having the physical presence required by double taxation agreements (DTAs) for income tax to be charged in the customer’s country. User value creation – even where an MNE does have a physical presence, the profit allocation rules do not recognise the new types of value that digital business models can generate in their market countries. Intangibles – much of the value of modern MNEs is attributable to intangible assets which are both highly mobile and difficult to value, meaning that such businesses are able to shift their profits to low tax jurisdictions by locating their intangible assets there and charging royalties. Addressing these issues requires fundamental changes beyond the concepts of source and residence that currently provide the basis for a jurisdiction’s taxing rights over income of MNEs. The OECD’s Two Pillar Solution aims to provide additional taxing rights for market jurisdictions (under Pillar One) as well as put a floor on tax competition and discourage profit shifting by way of an agreed global minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15% (under Pillar Two). 16 | Key Takeaways It is estimated that over 90% of MNEs globally that meet the scope criteria will be subject to the global minimum tax by 2025. Smaller MNEs are not impacted by the GloBE rules, whereas large MNEs with high levels of profits in countries where they have little or no substantial activity and little tax are the most affected. The Substance Based Income Exclusion relieves certain profits from the effect of the Top-up Tax based on the amount of economic substance reflected in tangible assets and payroll. MNEs should consider the use of safe harbour concessions to mitigate these new compliance costs. TOP-UP TAX CALCULATION Covered Taxes calculated on a jurisdictional basis GloBE Income calculated on a jurisdictional basis Jurisdictional Effective Tax Rate (ETR) Top-up Tax % = Minimum rate - Jurisdictional ETR Jurisdictional Excess Profit = GloBE Income – Substance Based Income Exclusion Jurisdictional Top-up Tax = (Top-up Tax % x Excess Profit) – Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax Source countries may implement a domestic minimum Top-up Tax to ensure they have priority taxing rights before other jurisdictions apply the GloBE rules. New Zealand is implementing a Domestic Income Inclusion Rule which will apply to undertaxed domestic source income of a domestic parent company and its domestic subsidiaries from 1 January 2026. The GloBE rules are complex and involve considerable collection and analysis of data to complete the standardised GloBE Information Return. Early planning and system development are critical in getting Pillar Two right from the start. Further guidance on Pillar Two can be found on our website: ird.govt.nz/international-tax/business/inclusive- framework-two-pillars-solution Pillar Two Six-Step Determination To identify tax liability under the GloBE rules, an MNE must broadly follow these six steps: 1. Identify whether in scope. 2. Determine which jurisdictions are not eligible for a safe harbour exclusion. 3. Determine GloBE Income of each group member in jurisdictions where there is no safe harbour (broadly this is financial accounting net income with some adjustments). 4. Calculate Covered Taxes attributable to each entity (broadly this is current and deferred taxes with some adjustments for timing differences). 5. Calculate the Top-up Tax rate and Jurisdictional Top-up Tax. This step includes a requirement to calculate the Substance Based Income Exclusion for each country (see Top-up Tax Calculation below). 6. Identify liable entities and allocate Top-up Tax. | 17 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 2. Increasing Tax Transparency Over the last 15 years, enormous progress has been made in establishing high standards of tax transparency and information-sharing globally so as to improve tax administrations’ ability to gain a full picture of MNE business activities. The availability of timely, targeted, and comprehensive information is essential to enable tax administrations to quickly identify risk areas. Exchange of information on request is the foundation of the international architecture for transparency and is the most widely used form of exchange. New Zealand has signed and ratified the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the MAAC) which provides a global, unified legal basis for multilateral cooperation and has been adopted by 147 jurisdictions. The MAAC has greatly expanded New Zealand’s network of exchange partners and the volume of information exchanged has increased markedly with the anti-BEPS initiatives involving the exchange of cross-border ruling summaries and country-by-country reports. In accordance with the BEPS Action 5 minimum standard, New Zealand exchanges information on tax rulings, primarily summary details of unilateral advance pricing agreements and permanent establishment determinations. In the three years to 31 December 2023, New Zealand has exchanged details on 68 qualifying rulings and received details from treaty partners as to 149 qualifying rulings. The initiative has been aimed at “soft” or “sweetheart” rulings that may in effect provide tax holidays to MNEs. Not only has the receipt of details of rulings from treaty partners provided valuable insights into arrangements of MNEs, the initiative has provided much needed integrity to the overall system of rulings internationally. New Zealand exchanges CbC reports with treaty partners in accordance with the BEPS Action 13 minimum standard. On average, New Zealand exchanges CbC reports for 25 MNEs headquartered here and we receive over 1,500 CbC reports annually from treaty partners. Over two-thirds of foreign- owned MNEs with annual group turnover in New Zealand above $30m are subject to inward-bound CbC reporting. The rich information in these CbC reports as to how MNEs allocate their global income together with indicators as to the location of economic activity within these groups, further strengthens our BEPS risk assessments, providing us with a full picture of supply chain profitability. Along with 41 other tax administrations, we are an active member of the Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration (JITSIC) which offers a platform to enable active collaboration within the legal framework of bilateral and multilateral conventions and tax information exchange agreements. New Zealand has benefited through the sharing of intelligence and strategies to deal with emerging tax risks involving MNEs as well as advances in analytical techniques and best practice compliance approaches. 18 | 3. Improving Corporate Tax Governance Not only is a robust tax governance framework fundamental to tax compliance, but MNEs today are expected to demonstrate tax responsibility as part of their broader environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments, aligning with global trends towards sustainability and ethical business practices. Our approach to date has not been to mandate rules or dictate practices, instead we have encouraged improved fit for purpose corporate tax governance. In our view, a “one size fits all” approach does not work for tax governance purposes, we prefer an approach tailored to the specific facts and circumstances of the business. We have endeavoured to foster an environment of mutual trust and cooperation by working with taxpayers, and their representatives, and not taking a prescriptive or adversarial approach. RiskMitigation Reliance on key personsDocumentation of procedures Set and forgetTest and update Lack of directionReport to the board Lift and shift offshore modelCustomise to New Zealand Both boards and management play key roles in tax governance. While the board sets strategy, management operationalises it with policies, procedures, and controls specific to the enterprise. For boards and management to better consider potential tax risks, we have highlighted some key “work-ons” to lift overall corporate tax governance: Documentation of tax strategy and tax control framework. Regular testing and updating of tax controls. Executive reporting to boards. Additionally, for MNEs with overseas models, customisation to the New Zealand environment is necessary. Global tax policies need to be adjusted for New Zealand tax law and practice (for example, using appropriate transfer pricing methodology and local comparables), and relevant checks made of head office tax functions (for example, knowledge of possible upstream imported hybrid mismatch arrangements). Governance | 19 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 Applying this “maturity model” approach, we consider the overall state of tax governance in New Zealand to be slightly above an intermediate level (i.e., between “Progressing” and “Established”). We are pleased with the recent direction of travel, with MNEs lifting their game and endeavouring to move to the desired “Established” stage, with a number progressing towards the “Aspirational” stage. We recommend that MNEs operating in New Zealand set aside time to review their tax governance frameworks and test whether adequate policies, procedures and controls are in place as well as up-to-date documentation. A useful step in this process is to undertake a self-assessment as to their current state of tax governance by using the checklist below. Boards may also want to use the Tax Risk Barometer and Transfer Pricing Tax Governance Questions in Appendices 1 and 2 respectively. We not only consider the adequacy of tax governance in arriving at annual risk ratings for MNEs, but if adjustments arise as a result of future compliance activities, we will also take into account whether an MNE has paid sufficient attention to tax governance in our penalty deliberations. A board setting the appropriate “tone from the top”, coupled with a robust tax control framework, prevents risky tax positions being taken and reduces tax inefficiency. TAX GOVERNANCE MATURITY MODEL 1. Does the company have a well-documented overarching tax strategy? 2. Does the chief financial officer or tax manager formally confirm, at least once annually, that this strategy has been regularly reviewed, updated where necessary and followed in practice? 3. Does the company have an effective tax control framework to manage day-to-day tax risks? 4. Has the operation of the tax control framework been tested independently in the last three years? 5. In the last three years, have any tax control deficiencies been identified? If so, have any follow-up actions been taken to remediate those deficiencies? 6. Are key internal policies, procedures and controls covering the data collection, analysis, calculation, recording and reporting for tax filing and other tax compliance requirements, documented and available for examination by Inland Revenue if required? 7. Does a review take place at least annually for changes to accounting policies upon which group financial statements are prepared and all items examined where tax treatment may differ materially from financial accounting treatment? 8. Is there a robust process in place for the finance and/or tax teams to stay on top of all relevant changes in tax law and related Inland Revenue guidance? 9. Is a process in place to identify significant transactions (including those which need to be reported to the board or relevant board sub-committees) in respect of which external advice and/or binding rulings may be required? 10. Does senior management report regularly to the board or relevant board sub-committees on potentially material tax issues or risks? TAX GOVERNANCE CHECKLIST Based on the insights gained from our compliance work and other commonly used OECD frameworks we developed a simplified model to demonstrate the different levels of maturity amongst businesses in New Zealand. 20 | 4. Providing Practical Guidance/ Increasing Certainty To provide taxpayers with greater assurance about tax issues and to get it right from the start we have a range of options in place. Binding Rulings We can issue binding rulings for taxpayers to provide certainty about the interpretation of tax laws. A binding ruling is Inland Revenue’s interpretation of how a tax law applies to a particular arrangement or to the tax status of a person or thing. An arrangement is any agreement, contract, plan or understanding (whether or not it is enforceable), including any steps and transactions that carry it into effect. In addition, we have the ability to rule on the status of a taxpayer, such as whether they are a “non-resident”, and certain other matters, without the need to have an arrangement. Inland Revenue also provides short process rulings. The basic criteria for being eligible to apply for this type of ruling are that the person’s annual gross income for the tax year prior to the year in which the application is made is $20m or less, and that the matter on which the ruling is sought concerns a tax (other than provisional tax), duty, or levy that is expected to amount to less than $1m. If you have been given a binding ruling, you are not required to follow the ruling. But if you do follow a binding ruling exactly as described in the ruling and satisfy any stated conditions, Inland Revenue is bound by it. A binding ruling does not remove the requirement to file an income tax return and pay any taxes arising either by following the ruling or taking a different tax position. Before you apply for a binding ruling, you can set up a pre- lodgement meeting to help clarify the issues and determine the scope of the ruling. We aim to complete binding rulings within ten weeks of an application, although shorter timeframes may be possible in some circumstances. For more information, please refer to our guide for Binding Rulings (IR715). ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/short-process-rulings/ applying-for-other-types-of-rulings Factual Reviews If you have applied for a binding ruling, you may request a factual review to obtain a level of certainty on whether a critical factual condition in the ruling will be satisfied. You can request a factual review (in writing) at any time before or immediately after the issue of the ruling. Indicative Views In some circumstances, a request for an indicative view may be a more suitable option. Indicative views are not binding on the Commissioner and are available to larger enterprises. An indicative view would generally be provided for prospective major transactions. It will not be provided for transfer pricing arrangements or arrangements involving potential tax avoidance or hypothetical situations. Advance Pricing Agreements APAs have proven extremely useful as a robust upfront means of dealing with transfer pricing risks, especially the more complex issues that arise. They are a valuable tool to prevent transfer pricing disputes arising in the first place. An APA is an agreement between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer which confirms the basis for their international pricing. MNEs that complete an APA need to submit annual reports and supporting evidence to us to confirm their compliance with the agreement. APAs represent a more cooperative approach to tax compliance as opposed to potentially adversarial audits. The product is ideally suited to the more complex transfer pricing issues such as where intangibles are created and/or developed, specialised services are provided, and comparables cannot be identified. | 21 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 We finalised 21 APAs in the year to 30 June 2024, and as at that date we had completed 297 in total. Most of our bilateral APA work has been with Australia. We have also completed bilateral APAs with Belgium, Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. We have found unilateral APAs successful in both inbound and outbound transfer pricing scenarios. Although unilateral APAs are one-sided, should double taxation arise on transactions covered by a unilateral APA, we will enter into competent authority negotiations with the other jurisdiction on the basis of the unilateral APA position. Unilateral APAs are especially viable where the amounts at stake are small and/or where most of the transfer pricing risk lies in New Zealand. Our aim is to complete unilateral APAs within six months of the date of acceptance of a formal application. Bilateral negotiations, especially beyond Australia, generally take considerably longer to conclude. Mutual Agreement Procedure A key issue in increasing tax certainty is to improve the resolution of tax-related disputes between jurisdictions under the MAP Article in our tax treaties. Please refer to the section on Expediating Resolution of International Tax Disputes on page 28. Global Mobility The issue of employees working internationally or remote working, including senior decision-makers, is not a new phenomenon. However, the pandemic accelerated the deployment and widespread adoption of more flexible, global and remote work across all industries. We are actively participating in the work of the OECD in this area. Permanent establishment recognition issues are the main concern, with consideration of residence, employment income, and pensions as secondary priorities. There are also a number of potential transfer pricing challenges for MNEs, in particular: The accurate delineation of a transaction when functional/risk control contributions are made by globally mobile individuals How to account for contributions that are made overseas by individuals on an irregular, periodic, or temporary basis Assessing contributions to control of risks and DEMPE (development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation) of intangibles by senior employees who are globally mobile The relevance and implications of dispersed senior management footprints for centralised business models Business restructuring implications when a senior employee re-locates to another jurisdiction for business versus personal reasons. 22 | 5. Reducing Compliance Costs International Questionnaire Unlike detailed questionnaires and supplementary disclosures required by many other tax administrations, we focus on the information that really matters in our annual International Questionnaire issued to over 800 significant foreign-owned MNEs operating in New Zealand. This two-page questionnaire is a mix of group financial information and targeted questions as to performance. We value additional contextual information provided by MNEs alongside their responses to the questionnaire, explaining any abnormal events or major changes in their performance or business operating model for the year in question. Such details enable us to have a clearer picture of their financial affairs and avoid unnecessary follow-up queries. Transfer Pricing Simplification Measures Over the years, the number of jurisdictions implementing transfer pricing rules has increased substantially. The rules themselves have become more sophisticated and nuanced. At the same time, increased global footprints of MNEs have progressively reduced the availability of comparable data from independent enterprises. Consequently, transfer pricing compliance and administration can be complex and costly, particularly when viewed on a global basis from the perspective of an MNE. The situation is particularly acute for small and routine business operations (such as wholesale distributors), where compliance costs may become disproportionate to specific transfer pricing risks. Taking an economy-wide view, enterprises can be required to incur business-specific compliance costs, such as searching for comparable data, which do not produce significantly more accurate outcomes than could be achieved on a generic industry or functional basis. In these scenarios, it is appropriate to consider whether simplification measures could minimise compliance and administrative costs whilst maintaining or potentially improving overall compliance outcomes. New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules have always been about striking a balance between protecting the tax base and containing compliance costs. We have implemented a range of simplification measures targeted at reducing compliance costs in situations that are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk. Small Wholesale Distributors Foreign-owned wholesale distributors (i.e. firms that purchase and on-sell goods to other firms without significant transformation) are the most common multinational business model encountered in New Zealand. For foreign-owned wholesale distributors with an annual turnover of under $30m, we currently consider a weighted average earnings before interest, tax and exceptional items (EBITE) ratio of 3% or greater is broadly indicative of an arm’s length outcome in the absence of readily available transactional data for that distributor’s transfer pricing transactions or other comparable market data for distributors operating with similar risk characteristics. Transfer pricing outcomes in accordance with this indicative ratio are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk and so no benchmarking is required to support the arm’s length nature of the distributor’s weighted average EBITE ratio. Low Value-Adding Intra-Group Services The OECD designed an elective, simplified approach for pricing low value-adding intra-group services. We recognised there were considerable benefits for taxpayers in aligning our practice with this international standard and initially adopted this simplification measure for qualifying low value-adding intra- group services with a total value below NZ$1m per annum. For income years commencing on or after 1 July 2018, qualifying services could be priced at cost plus a mark-up of 5% without the need to provide benchmarking analysis. Finally, we removed the threshold requirement for income years commencing on or after 1 April 2021. | 23 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 Small Value Loans For small value loans (i.e. for cross-border associated party loans by groups of companies for up to $10m principal in total), we currently consider 175 basis points (1.75%) over the relevant base indicator is broadly indicative of an arm’s length rate, in the absence of a readily available market rate for a debt instrument with similar terms and risk characteristics. Transactions priced in accordance with this simplification measure are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk and as such no further benchmarking is required. Risk Indicators The provision of risk indicators assists MNEs to self-evaluate their compliance with anti-BEPS measures and identify potential deficiencies. See below for the 2024 update. Application of Interest Limitation Rules to Outbound Loans Certain related-party loans between a non-resident lender and a New Zealand-resident borrower are required to be priced using interest limitation rules referred to as restricted transfer pricing. To further reduce compliance costs, we will accept a symmetrical approach also being taken on outbound loans. Accordingly, where New Zealand-resident lenders correctly apply the interest limitation rules to set the interest rate on their loans to related non-resident borrowers, we will consider the result to be arm’s length. This is on the basis that the amount deducted by the non- resident borrower in the foreign jurisdiction does not exceed the amount returned as income by the New Zealand resident lender. Draw a high-level risk picture by using the following simple checklist. If any one (or more) of the risk indicators listed below is present then don’t be surprised if we ask you for additional information. EBIT = earnings before interest and tax EBITE = earnings before interest, tax and exceptional items “You Do The Math” Purchases + other operating expenses (involving low/no tax jurisdictions) >$30m Cross-border associated party transactions of gross revenue = 20%+ Tax losses in two of last three years 2 Retailer EBITE <5% Debt (Assets – Non-debt liabilities) >40% Manufacturer EBITE <7% Negative EBIT ? Cost plus margin on service charges >5% Interest EBITDA >20% EBITDA = earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation Low or no tax jurisdictions = those where company tax rates are less than 15% Distributor EBITE <3% Royalties EBITE >33% 6. Enhancing Intelligence and Analytics Avoidance of permanent establishment status Mispricing of debt instruments Misuse of low/no tax jurisdictions Circumvention of withholding taxes, including treaty shopping Profit stripping arising from tax-driven supply chain restructures Inappropriate apportionment of branch profits Non-arm’s-length transfer pricing of tangible and intangible goods and services Non-commercial arrangements driven by aggressive tax planning Excessive interest deductions through thin capitalisation Hybrid mismatch arrangements (including imported mismatches) To p Te n BEPS Risks 24 | | 25 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 Inland Revenue recognises that it must accept risk and uses thoughtful analysis to determine the level of risk it is willing to accept. We follow international best practice by employing a risk-based system of interventions, alleviating the compliance burden and costs as much as possible for low-risk MNEs and activities. We focus compliance and enforcement resources to the identified areas of highest risk. Risk ratings are assigned based on both quantitative and qualitative information with considerable judgement applied: Key sources of intelligence Environmental scanning (media, open source searches, etc.) Historical Inland Revenue data Tax treaty information (including JITSIC) OIO Information CbC reporting data International Questionnaire Exchange of tax ruling summaries Companies Office Customs data (provisional value scheme) We pay close attention to the size and complexity of the New Zealand economy and its tax base, the nature and extent of cross-border financial flows, and the predominance of certain sectors. We assess risk against both likelihood and impact. We draw on a wide range of intelligence sources. Consequences if risk materialises Likelihood of risk occurring Medium RiskHigh Risk Low Risk Medium Risk HIGHEST LOWESTHIGHEST unlikely/possible/likely/probable minor/moderate/major/critical A wide range of factors are taken into account, including: MNE history and ownership Industry type and relevant commercial practices Extent and complexity of cross-border transactions Key performance indicators. Low risk – accept and monitor Medium risk – pay close attention in case of further deterioration High risk – address with appropriate interventions, immediate priority given to critical-level risks There is no single element capable of providing a complete picture of the existence and scale of BEPS. For example, the presence of material transactions with low/no tax jurisdictions may not be as strong an indicator of BEPS risk as the overall level of cross-border associated party transactions. However, where an MNE has both these features as well as low relative profitability then BEPS risk increases appreciably. 26 | 7. Extensive Monitoring and Targeted Enforcement BEPS Campaigns Background As part of our “right from the start” compliance strategy, we have undertaken targeted BEPS campaigns focused on specific sectors and issues, making use of a range of information obtained from questionnaires and follow-up actions. The campaigns were proactive in nature and reflected the cooperative approach that we took in general during the COVID-19 pandemic, achieving assurance as to a significant part of the tax base at a time when traditional audits were generally suspended. We also gained some key insights to factor into our risk assessment models and future interventions. BEPS campaigns to date Sector/Issue MNEs Distributors/Wholesalers372 Financing84 Intangible property/royalties30 Losses14 Manufacturing32 Services44 COVID-19 wage subsidy436 Transfer pricing documentation65 Tax Compliance Tax Compliance Bundled intangible property (i.e. a single payment for several types of rights) is the highest risk category of intangible, as it is difficult to identify (and price) the individual elements with specificity. Geographic isolation and lack of competitive pressures lead to large MNEs dominating the New Zealand market and thus higher operating margins should result than most other markets. Global transfer pricing policies and associated target rates of return should not be applied in isolation but customised to New Zealand circumstances and specific results. Where losses have been incurred, detailed explanations as to how these have arisen as well as turnaround plans to return to profitability should be available. High risk arrangements such as the provision of intangible property and specialised services, complex financing arrangements and market support payments should be supported by inter-company agreements and transfer pricing documentation (including additional contextual explanations and analysis). Comparable data must be drawn from the same or similar markets as the New Zealand-tested party; it will generally involve reference to Australasian data. This is supported by both Governments’ commitments to a process called the Single Economic Market agenda, designed to create a seamless trans-Tasman business environment. Australia is recognised as our closest reference country in terms of demographics, size of economy and stage of economic development. In contrast, the use of data from large Asian economies (such as China, India, Japan and Korea) provides weak support for New Zealand tested party results as none of these are considered comparable to the New Zealand market. MNE distributors generally undertake more functions and hold higher inventory levels than those operating in other markets. The Berry ratio is not a reliable profit level indicator apart from cases involving basic service providers. Higher risk is associated with the application of the residual profit split method, as opposed to methods which rely upon market comparables; a cross-check using a secondary transfer pricing method is recommended to mitigate this higher risk. Sales to end-consumers require more sales and marketing investment along with higher levels of service and after-sales care; higher operating margins are expected due to this increased functionality. Ten Key Insights from Campaigns | 27 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 28 | 8. Expediting Resolution of International Tax Disputes Mutual Agreement Procedure New Zealand has 40 double taxation agreements (DTAs), each with an article establishing a mutual agreement procedure for resolving difficulties arising out of the application of the particular DTA. New Zealand has 11 tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) in force which also contain a MAP article, as well as six supplementary agreements to these TIEAs which include a MAP article. Under the MAP article, the competent authorities of the contracting states engage with each other and endeavour to resolve disputes that arise from the way one or both contracting states are interpreting or applying the particular DTA. Scope of MAP Our general position is to support the availability of the MAP in a wide range of double taxation cases, including those arising from: transfer pricing adjustments attributing profits to permanent establishments determining residence for individuals and companies withholding taxes deducted incorrectly the application of anti-abuse provisions in DTAs or the general anti-abuse doctrine applicable to the interpretation o f DTA s the application of domestic anti-avoidance provisions bona fide taxpayer-initiated foreign adjustments. The OECD Model Tax Convention allows for competent authorities to consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for by a particular DTA. Our general approach is to allow taxpayers the benefit of the MAP where possible, so the terms of individual DTAs should be read broadly. If the terms of a DTA are unclear, New Zealand will allow access to the MAP. Year to 31 December Number Resolved Average Cycle Time 2021137 months 2022267 months 2023248 months MAP Performance Article 25 effectively equips tax administrations with the practical means to ensure that cross-border income earning activity is taxed correctly in accordance with DTAs. Our overall aim is to complete MAP cases within 12 months of receiving a request for assistance. The time taken to resolve MAP cases will vary depending largely on the complexity of the matter in dispute. We have experienced a moderate case load in recent years with good turnaround times as follows: While we take a pragmatic approach to transfer pricing disputes especially, recognising limitations in data and transfer pricing methods, we will not be unprincipled in finding solutions. Best endeavours are made to reach satisfactory outcomes but resolution is not always possible so it is important for MNEs to also remain engaged in domestic disputes processes. | 29 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 Information required in a MAP request Taxpayers can facilitate the MAP by ensuring the competent authorities of both contracting states receive complete, accurate and timely information. Depending on what may be determined as a result of a pre-filing conference, the following information should be included in a taxpayer’s MAP submission: BEPS Action 14 The genesis of BEPS Action 14 developed from a recognition that the actions to counter BEPS must be complemented with actions that ensure certainty and predictability for businesses and individuals. It was therefore necessary to develop robust dispute settlement processes across jurisdictions to ensure that disputes are resolved in a timely, effective, and efficient manner. The Forum on Tax Administration’s MAP Forum was established to support increased tax certainty through guidance and statistics on MAP cases and bilateral advance pricing agreements, as well as peer reviews of jurisdictional performance to improve dispute prevention and resolution. A minimum standard was introduced to ensure access to MAP is available and cases are resolved within a reasonable timeframe, with outcomes implemented quickly. Two rounds of peer reviews have been completed by the MAP Forum and have led to changes in the management of MAP cases, a greater number of closed cases, an increase in the availability of country profiles and better guidance on rules and procedures. New Zealand has committed to resolving treaty- related disputes within an average timeframe of 24 months. We have also undergone two rigorous peer reviews by the MAP Forum, with their main recommendation being that we update a number of our older DTAs to the latest wording of the OECD Model Tax Convention. We are progressing that through the implementation of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (MLI) and bilateral negotiations. New Zealand is scheduled to be reviewed for a third time by the MAP Forum in 2025. Arbitration New Zealand has opted to apply Part VI of the MLI which introduces arbitration as a means of dispute resolution. New Zealand has also had arbitration in the DTAs with Australia and Japan for several years. If a solution cannot be reached under MAP, taxpayers have the ability to request unresolved issues be taken to arbitration. We consider the availability of arbitration incentivises competent authorities to resolve disputes within a reasonable time period (the general standard being two years). We are progressively concluding working arrangements with competent authorities of jurisdictions that have agreed to arbitration. We have had no requests for arbitration to date. 1. Name, address and IRD number of the taxpayer. 2. The provision of the specific article of the DTA which the taxpayer considers is not being applied correctly by either one or both contracting states. 3. The relevant facts of the case, including any documentation substantiating these facts, the period involved and the amounts involved. 4. An analysis of the issues involved supported by relevant documentation. 5. Where a request has also been made to the competent authority of the other contracting state, a copy of that submission. 6. If the issue has been previously dealt with by some other means (such as an advance ruling, advance pricing agreement or settlement agreement), then a copy of any relevant ruling or agreement. 7. If the MAP request has been submitted to another authority under another instrument that provides for a mechanism to resolve treaty-related disputes, then a copy of that submission (including all related documentation) unless the content of both MAP submissions are exactly the same. 8. If the MAP request is ‘protective’ (that is, submitted to ensure compliance with a time frame provided under the relevant tax treaty but not to be examined until further notification from the taxpayer to do so), then a clear statement to this effect. 9. A final statement confirming that all information provided in the MAP request is accurate and additional information will be provided in a timely manner if required by the competent authority. 10. In multilateral cases, the information required will include the above-mentioned across all relevant parties and treaties. 30 | 9. Building International Tax Capacity Capacity building is essential to help developing countries implement their international tax policy and administration objectives. We do this by way of various one-to-many outreach activities and participation in joint training events. Inland Revenue seeks to work in partnership with international and regional organisations to reduce the risk of duplication and increase overall impact. We work closely with the OECD Global Relations Programme in providing training to tax officials mainly in developing countries on key areas of international tax cooperation and on emerging issues including tax treaties, transfer pricing, dispute resolution, anti-BEPS measures and exchange of information. The goal of the programme is to enable tax officials to share their experiences, acquire a common understanding of international tax systems and develop solutions to common problems. New Zealand meeting its international obligations The enhancement of our reputation internationally Capacity building through international learning opportunities and sharing best practices Together with the Asian Development Bank and other partners under the umbrella of the Pacific Initiative, Inland Revenue has been providing both in-person and virtual training to Pacific Island jurisdictions on international tax standards. | 31 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 10. Expanding the Tax Treaty Network New Zealand continues to work with the OECD and treaty partners to ensure our international agreements are modern and robust. We have DTAs with 40 countries and negotiate updates to those DTAs and conclude new DTAs as needs or circumstances arise. The most recent updates have been a new DTA signed with the Slovak Republic, and a protocol that modernises our DTA with Austria. New Zealand is currently negotiating DTAs or protocols with Australia, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Korea, Portugal, Slovenia and the United Kingdom. More information about New Zealand’s international tax agreements, including the text of the DTAs, can be found at Tax Treaties: taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tax-treaties We have a number of on-going international commitments, including: Active participation in various OECD, Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes and Forum on Tax Administration working parties and projects Membership of the Study Group on Asia-Pacific Tax Administration and Research Membership of the Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators Observership with the Belt and Road Initiative Tax Administration Cooperation Forum Supporting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade free trade agreement programme and the New Zealand delegation at the United Nations on tax matters. Tax Treaty Abuse BEPS Action 6 identified tax treaty abuse, and in particular treaty shopping, as one of the most important sources of BEPS concerns. Taxpayers that engage in treaty shopping and other types of treaty abuse undermine tax sovereignty by claiming treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances, especially where companies route profits through low or no tax jurisdictions to avoid paying taxes in a third country. Tackling treaty shopping is one of the four BEPS minimum standards, and jurisdictions have committed to include provisions in their tax agreements to ensure a minimum level of protection against treaty shopping. The majority of OECD/ G20 Inclusive Framework members, including New Zealand, are progressing towards implementation of the minimum standard by modifying their treaty networks with the help of the MLI. To ensure that DTAs are easy to understand, New Zealand will seek to incorporate the relevant anti-abuse provisions directly into any renegotiated treaty. Double Taxation Agreements New Zealand has a network of 40 double tax agreements in force with its main trading and investment partners: Australia Austria Belgium Canada Chile Chinese Taipei Czechia Denmark Fiji Finland France Germany Hong Kong India Indonesia Ireland Italy Japan Korea Malaysia Mexico Netherlands Norway Papua New Guinea People’s Republic of China Philippines Poland Russian Federation Samoa Singapore South Africa Spain Sweden Switzerland Thailand Tü r k i y e United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States of America Viet Nam Tax Information Exchange Agreements New Zealand has the following tax information exchange agreements in force: Anguilla Bahamas British Virgin Islands Cayman Islands Cook Islands Curaçao Dominica Gibraltar Guernsey Isle of Man Jersey Marshall Islands Netherlands Antilles Niue Saint Vincent and the Grenadines San Marino Sint Maarten Turks and Caicos Islands Vanuatu ASIA EUROPE NORTH AMERICA SOUTH AMERICA AFRICA OCEANIA New Zealand’s Major International Tax Instruments Multilateral Instruments New Zealand is a party to: Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters; Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS. 32 | | 33 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 APA Advance Pricing Agreement BEPS Base Erosion and Profit Shifting CA Competent Authority CbC Country-by-Country Reporting Customs New Zealand Customs Service DTA Double Taxation Agreement EBIT Earnings before interest and tax EBITDA Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITE Earnings before interest, tax and exceptional items G20 The Group of Twenty GloBE Global Anti-Base Erosion IQ International Questionnaire IRS International Revenue Strategy JITSIC Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration MAAC Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters MAP Mutual Agreement Procedure MLI Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS MNE Multinational Enterprise Group OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OIO Overseas Investment Office TIEA Tax Information Exchange Agreement Glossary 34 | Contacts Purpose Contact Principal Competent Authorities John Nash (Strategic Advisor, International) Anu Anand (Service Leader, International) Carmel Peters (Strategic Policy Advisor) Bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements John Nash (Strategic Advisor, International) Anu Anand (Service Leader, International) Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz Mutual Agreement Procedure John Nash (Strategic Advisor, International) Anu Anand (Service Leader, International) Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz Binding Rulings and Unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (including advice and arranging pre-application meetings) Team Manager Technical Services Tax Counsel Office PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Rulings@ird.govt.nz General Transfer Pricing Queries Transfer.Pricing@ird.govt.nz Exchange of Information John Nash (Strategic Advisor, International) Anu Anand (Service Leader, International) Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz Country-by-Country Reporting CbC@ird.govt.nz Dual Residence Competent.Authority@ird.govt.nz | 35 Multinational Enterprises | Compliance Focus 2024 Tax Risk Barometer Appendix 1 Risk appetite / Tone from the top Tax strategy Policy on facilitation payments Rulings/APAs PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING Three-year operating margins/returns on assets Local comparables CbC report comparisons CROSS-BORDER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Extent of revenue/expenditure Extent of transactions with no/low tax jurisdictions Related party debt TAX ACCOUNTING Effective tax rate Capital gains/foreign tax credits Controlled foreign company results Complexity Corporate structure/diverse business models Hybrid mismatches/special purpose vehicles Innovative financial arrangements Tax Control Framework Documentation/reporting Testing/updating Remediation Structural Changes Ownership Acquisitions/divestments Functions/assets/risks 36 | Transfer Pricing Tax Governance Questions 1 Do you know the nature and extent of your cross-border associated party transactions? 2 If material, do you have documentation in support of the transfer prices and is this documentation kept updated (especially for changes in functions, assets or risks)? 3 In compiling this documentation, have you critically evaluated all intercompany agreements? 4 Does the documentation explain: value adding functions of various parties to arrangements? actual conduct of the parties? how key risks are managed and controlled by the parties? 5 Has your local management and finance function been fully involved in the documentation process and signed off the factual analysis, as well as the final outcomes? 6 Have you given due consideration to an advance pricing agreement?

Te hōtaka tautuku mō ngā utu whakawhiti Compliance programme for transfer pricing
=================================================================================

Our goal
--------

Over two-thirds of world trade involves multinational enterprises (MNEs). Well over 60% of world trade comprises associated party transactions which must be transfer priced for taxation purposes. MNEs are a significant force in New Zealand's economic environment.

The overall goal of our transfer pricing compliance programme is to maintain New Zealand's share of multinational tax in accordance with our tax law, acceptable income recognition principles and best international practices.

Self-assessment
---------------

New Zealand's tax system operates on a self-assessment basis, where the taxpayer is expected to keep sufficient records to support its tax position. Consistent with this, for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, the burden of proof for transfer pricing matters rests with the taxpayer. Historically, the burden of proof had been on the Commissioner. 

You do the math
---------------

To assist taxpayers to better understand their risk profile we have provided a series of risk indicators. Draw a high-level risk picture by using the following simple checklist. If one (or more) of the risk indicators listed below is present, then don’t be surprised if we ask you for additional information. 

### Risk checklist

*   2 consecutive years of tax losses
*   Negative earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)
*   Cost plus margin on service charges is less than 5% 
*   Distributor earnings before interest, tax and exceptional items (EBITE) are less than 3%
*   Retailer EBITE is less than 5%
*   Manufacturer EBITE is less than 7%
*   Royalties are greater than 33% EBITE 
*   Interest is greater than 20% earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
*   Debt is greater than 40% (assets minus non-debt liabilities)
*   Purchases and other operating expenses are greater than $20 million (involving low/no tax jurisdiction) 

Balancing compliance costs
--------------------------

New Zealand's transfer pricing rules have always been about striking a balance between protecting the tax base and containing compliance costs. Our rules are to be applied consistently with the OECD's Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations - July 2022.

New Zealand endorses the OECD approach to transfer pricing documentation and accepts local file and master file documentation prepared in accordance with this approach. In the interests of containing compliance costs, we have not implemented specific rules for the maintenance or filing of local file and master file documentation.

We have implemented a range of simplification measures targeted at reducing compliance costs in situations that are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk.

[Simplification measures for transfer pricing](/international-tax/business/transfer-pricing/simplification-measures)

Current focus
-------------

Our compliance programme is based on maintaining a broad coverage of MNEs who engage in significant cross-border transactions, supported by a specific focus on high risk transfer pricing transactions and structures. We continue to cover the full range of both inbound and outbound associated party transactions.

Our top priority is the Significant Enterprises segment. These taxpayer groups present the highest risk as to profit shifting due to the extent of their international transactions. We will continue to refine our risk assessments of all significant enterprises informed through analysis of annual basic compliance packages (financial statements, tax reconciliations and corporate structures) supplemented by questionnaires.

In regard to issues across all segments of the corporate population, we will maintain a special focus on:

*   unexplained tax losses returned by foreign-owned groups
*   loans in excess of $10 million principal and guarantee fees
*   payment of unsustainable levels of royalties and/or service charges
*   material associated party transactions with no or low tax jurisdictions, including the use of offshore hubs for marketing, logistics and procurement services
*   appropriate booking of income arising from e-commerce transactions
*   supply chain restructures involving the shifting of any major functions, assets or risks away from New Zealand
*   any unusual arrangements or outcomes that may be identified in controlled foreign company disclosures.

We will continue to monitor the profitability of foreign-owned wholesale distributors (for example, firms that purchase and on-sell goods to other firms without significant transformation). They are the most common multinational business form encountered in New Zealand. 

For smaller wholesale distributors (those under $30 million in annual turnover), we will seek explanations for any performance resulting in a weighted average earnings-before-interest-tax-and-exceptional-items of less than 3%.

Remember, it is the responsibility of local management to ensure a company's transfer prices are in accordance with the arm's length standard and adequate supporting documentation is maintained in support of positions taken.

Compliance strengthened for property speculation
================================================

**18 June 2019**

Inland Revenue is to gain greater oversight of land transfer information to ensure those buying and selling properties are complying with tax rules on property speculation.

Cabinet has agreed to implement recommendation 99 of the Tax Working Group’s (TWG) final report. It will require most people who buy and sell properties to supply their IRD number on land transfer documentation.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the TWG made the recommendation after hearing submissions on ways to improve the fairness, balance and structure of the tax system.

“Most people already provide their IRD number to Land Information NZ (LINZ) when buying and selling property, but there are some exemptions which are open to manipulation,” says Mr Nash.

“Up to one-third of land transfers are made without a record of the IRD number of the buyer or seller.

“Inland Revenue needs a complete picture of property transactions to determine if tax rules are being manipulated. The requirement for nearly all land transfers to include an IRD number is a small change but improves the overall integrity of the system.

“If a home owner regularly buys and sells their properties in a short time frame it suggests they are engaged in property speculation and are flipping properties with the intention of creating income.

“When the previous government introduced the bright line test in 2015, it made it clear that owner-occupiers with a regular pattern of buying and selling residential properties had to comply with the bright line rule in certain circumstances.

“If an owner-occupier buys and sells properties twice or more in two years, under existing law they are generally considered to be trying to manipulate the bright line test.

“The requirement to provide an IRD number on nearly all land transfers makes the rules easier to understand for everyone. It removes uncertainty around what information people need to provide when buying or selling a property.

“Capturing the relevant tax information for property sales will also help us work with jurisdictions in other countries to combat global tax evasion,” says Mr Nash.

A Supplementary Order Paper will be tabled today to make the change to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill currently before Parliament. It will apply from 1 January 2020.

A small number of land transfers do not require the provision of an IRD number. Examples include land transfers under a Treaty settlement or by a local authority.

Compliance with the Bright-line Test
====================================

**06 April 2021**

The Bright-line Test means if someone sells residential property within a set period after acquiring it, they may be required to pay income tax on any profit made through the property increasing in value.  They do that by including the income in their income tax return (or adding it to their automatically generated income tax assessment). Up until this year, they were meant to add it to the Other Income box – it's not specifically labeled as due to the Bright-line test and there are other types of income that are added to this box also, so there is no easy way for Inland Revenue to know how much tax has been collected due to the Bright-line test.

However, Inland Revenue does know when properties are bought and sold, and we usually know the sale price, so we have a good idea what we expect to see being added to someone’s Other Income. We can also receive the information when someone fills out an IR833 – the Property Income Worksheet – but this is not compulsory. Each year we analyse all the transactions and follow up with those that are most likely to have not included the income they are meant to due to the Bright-line Test. Each year our analysis is getting more accurate.

What Inland Revenue is finding through its analysis
---------------------------------------------------

There is natural delay between when a property is sold and when Inland Revenue might investigate it.  For example, if someone sells a property in April 2022, they would include any income required from the Bright-line Test in an income tax return due in July 2023, and payment of any tax due isn’t until February 2024. Inland Revenue will begin some investigations before then, but others will start after, and may continue for a while. So to get an understanding of compliance with the Bright-line rules we need to look at property sales from a few years ago.

In the 2018-19 tax year there were 28,552 property sales that happened within the Bright-line period.

Of those, 9,126 were potentially taxable based on the information we had at the time.  The remainder were mostly excluded from the Bright-line Test because they were main homes or inherited, or sold by developers or property dealers who pay tax on those sales in other ways.

For those 9,126, we can see an appropriate amount of income being included in Other Income for 33% of them.  So that leaves 67% where income may not have been properly included. It has been suggested that if most of those were people not declaring their income, then the non-compliance rate could be higher than 50%.  But we know this is not the case because of what we’ve been finding when we investigate this in more detail.

Our investigations into those 9,126 property sales are still ongoing.  But from our prior year investigations (of those people our analysis showed were most likely to be avoiding their obligations) we found the following:

*   37% were not subject to the Brightline at all.  Mostly they were subject to the Main Home exclusion, but just didn't tick the box indicating the property was their main home.
*   Of the remaining, 74% had already included the Bright-line income in their tax return - they just didn't do it in quite the right way.  For example, they put the income in the wrong place.
*   This means most of those we reviewed were actually meeting their Bright-line Test obligations.
*   Of those we found did have tax outstanding, 80% corrected their return when we first contacted them.

Given this is a new process for most people, it is not surprising that many aren't getting it quite right, and it is not a sign of deliberate non-compliance.

Calculating a level of compliance
---------------------------------

Over the past week there has been media interest in the current level of compliance with the Brightline Test.  Inland Revenue will never be able to provide an actual compliance rate for any form of tax, as we do not audit every taxpayer.  Nor do we usually provide formal estimates of compliance rates. Estimates are always unreliable and rarely help us target non-compliance better. For something like the Bright-line Test, which is not a category of tax in its own right, an estimate is even less reliable.

We have provided various numbers about our compliance activity to the media, leading others to make estimates of compliance rates.  Because such estimates could differ widely based on how people understand the numbers, we felt it would be useful to outline how a rough calculation, based on the numbers we have provided, could be made.

Because this is only a rough calculation, and no actual year will conform to it exactly, we illustrate it with an imaginary year in which there were 10,000 property sales that on the initial information Inland Revenue holds look like they could be taxable under the Bright-line Test.

| Description | Number |
| --- | --- |
| **Number of property sales** that IR's data shows are potentially taxable under the Bright-line test (an imaginary year with 10,000 such transactions for this illustration only) | 10,000 |
| **Less** the number of people that included full Bright-line income in the tax return correctly (33% found in IR's investigations mentioned above) | \-3,300 |
| **Equals the number of property sales potentially not reporting some or all income required under the Bright-line Test** | **6,700** |
| **Less** the number of those that are not actually subject to the Bright-line Test (37% found in IR's investigations mentioned above, mainly due to the seller not ticking the main home box when they should have) | \-2,479 |
| **Equals the number of property sales still potentially not reporting** **some or all income required under the Bright-line Test** | **4,221** |
| **Less** the number of those assumed to have included the Bright-line income somewhere else in their tax return (74% found in IR's investigations mentioned above) | \-3,124 |
| **Equals the number of property sales assumed to actually be not reporting some or all income required under the Bright-line Test, before Inland Revenue starts any investigations** | **1,097** |

Based on the above assumptions, the number of transactions actually taxable under the Brightline test would be 7,521 (the 10,000 potentially taxable less the 2,479 found to not actually be taxable). The number of people who proactively included that income in their tax return would be 6,424 (the 3,300 we identified initially, and the 3,124 where the income was included, but in the wrong place)

**A rough calculation of those who proactively include their Bright-line Test income in their income tax returns would be 85%** (6,424 divided by 7,521).

878 of the 1,097 who did not include the income will realise their mistake and correct it when IR first contacts them (80% found in IR’s investigations mentioned above).

**That would leave only 219 requiring further enforcement, which is 3% of those required to return Bright-line income.**

Next steps from Inland Revenue

While the above is only a rough calculation from early data, it indicates that the majority of people are proactively including their Bright-line income in their tax returns. That fits with NZ’s approach to tax compliance, where we trust most people to do the right thing, help them when they’re trying to get it right, and follow up with those we identify as most likely to be avoiding their obligations.

Inland Revenue continues to encourage people to meet their Bright-line Test obligations by:

*   informing people of their obligations with our materials and advertising
*   getting in touch with people when they sell properties that appear to be subject to the Bright-line tests
*   making the process easier – for example creating a box for property related income on tax returns
*   improving the targeting of our investigations through continually refining our data analysis
*   pursuing through audits and prosecutions those who refuse to meet their obligations.

Compromise proposals fail to convince Court
===========================================

2010 case note - decision is an analysis of the various creditors' compromise provisions of the Companies Act 1993 - class, liquidation, secured.

Case

CIR v Atlas Food & Beverage Ltd & Ors; FM 1 Ltd & Ors v CIR

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993

### Summary

There were a number of significant irregularities in the debtor companies' compromise proposals. The Court held that it was not appropriate to ratify or grant compromises in these circumstances.

### Impact of decision

The decision is a helpful and thorough analysis of the various creditors' compromise provisions of the Companies Act 1993.

### Facts

This summary is in respect of two related decisions that were delivered contemporaneously. The _FM 1_ decision is a companion judgment to the _Atlas_ decision, and the two decisions should be read together. The proceedings were in respect of compromises proposed by the companies with their creditors under Part 14 and/or 15 of the Companies Act 1993 ("the Act").

The proceedings involve seven companies owned and controlled by the same person. Four of the companies (the Atlas companies) are involved in the hospitality industry. The other three (the FM 1 companies) are no longer trading, but were previously property-owning companies.

The Commissioner applied to liquidate each of the companies on the grounds that they were unable to pay their debts. The companies then proposed compromises with their creditors under Parts 14 and/or 15 of the Act.

#### _**Atlas companies**_

The Commissioner had a number of concerns with the compromises:

*   He was classified together with secured creditors, which was inappropriate.
*   A secured creditor's debt was grossly overstated, and was contingent.
*   A number of companies related to the Atlas companies were permitted to vote on the compromises.
*   The timeframe for payment was too long and that the likelihood of payment was uncertain.
*   The compromises purport to contract out of the statutory interest (ie UOMI) and penalty regime.
*   The terms of the compromises were irreconcilable with the Commissioner's obligation to uphold the integrity of the tax system.

The Commissioner voted against the compromises, but the compromises were purportedly accepted by the creditors in relation to two of the four companies. The compromises were rejected by creditors in relation to the other two companies.

The Commissioner applied for orders under section 232 of the Act that he not be bound by the two compromises that were purportedly passed, on the grounds that there were material irregularities in the compromises and/or the compromises were unfairly prejudicial to the Commissioner.

The four Atlas companies each applied to the Court for orders under section 236 of the Act approving the compromises.

#### _**FM 1 companies**_

The Commissioner had a number of concerns with the FM 1 companies' compromises. While there were multiple creditors, the only creditor whose debt was being compromised was the Commissioner. The other creditors were to take no part in the compromise, and receive nothing under it. They retained all their rights. Additionally:

*   the compromises provided that penalties and interest would not accrue on the outstanding debt which was not possible;
*   the debts owed to the Commissioner arose from transactions which indicated a cynical disbursement of proceeds to defeat the Commissioner's claims;
*   the Court and the Commissioner could have no confidence that the compromises would be performed on their terms because of the "untidy" way in which the proposals were presented and advanced and because of the commercial uncertainty surrounding the proposed repayment arrangement over a five-year time frame;
*   that the affairs of the three applicant companies and the actions of their directors in and about August 2008 warranted investigation and this was best able to be achieved through the making of liquidation orders and the appointment of liquidators;
*   public policy considerations militated against granting the applications as each of the three companies was insolvent, with no recent trading history and no legitimate interest to protect;
*   the proposal to pay $1,000,000 over a five-year time frame represented only a modest proportion of the core debt (about 62%).

A meeting of creditors was scheduled to consider and vote on the proposed compromises. After the Commissioner drew the companies' attention to apparent defects in the compromises, the meeting was cancelled. The companies then applied for orders under section 236 of the Act that the compromises be approved.

### Decision

#### _Material irregularities with Atlas companies' applications_

The Court was satisfied that the Atlas companies' applications were affected by material irregularities. In particular, the Court held that the Commissioner as a preferred creditor should not have been placed with secured creditors but in a separate class; that a large-contingent creditor should have been placed in a separate class (not the secured class) and should have had the value of its debt (incorrectly stated) discounted; that related parties who were not to receive anything under the compromise should have been separately classified and their votes discounted in full.

#### _Compromises unfairly prejudicial to the Commissioner_

Based upon the findings made regarding material irregularities and the overlap with the section 236 arguments, the Court had no difficulty in establishing that the compromises were unfairly prejudicial to the Commissioner and he could not be bound by them.

#### _Atlas companies' section 236 applications_

The Court was not persuaded to grant the Atlas companies' section 236 applications. The Court held inter alia that aside from the Atlas and Schwartz (one of the other applicants) applications being tainted by material irregularity pursuant to section 232 the four section 236 applications failed due to a lack of reliable evidence. The Court was reasonably scathing about the manner in which the applications had been presented:

*   \[74\] The findings I have already made in relation to material irregularities remain relevant in the present context. For the reasons already discussed I do not consider there is reliable evidence available as to the true level of creditor support for the compromises. In addition, the section 236 applications have been presented in a most informal manner. Creditors are not directly apprised of the revised terms of the compromises, rather they have been invited to make further inquiry if they see fit. Mr Forbes argued that because the amendments serve to improve the proposed terms of compromise the process employed should not be viewed as a matter of concern. I do not agree. To my mind I am being asked to approve four compromises absent a proper and adequate opportunity for creditors to have an informed input.

The Court also held grave concerns regarding the continuing role played by the director of most, if not all, of the relevant companies. The Commissioner argued that of the 64-odd companies presently registered with Inland Revenue under his control, 90% of income tax returns from those 64 companies were outstanding. In response to defaults by these companies, the Commissioner had issued 28 statutory demands and filed 13 liquidation proceedings, in addition to filing 44 District Court applications seeking orders requiring various companies to file overdue returns. The Court's view on the suitability of the director's control of the relevant companies particularly as it related to overseeing the proposed repayment proposal was stark:

*   \[95\] In my view \[his\] position as the director of all relevant companies and as the person responsible for the implementation of the compromise proposals, is untenable.

#### _FM 1 companies section 236 applications_

The Court formed a clear view that the proposals should not be approved, essentially because it would not be fair and equitable to do so. The Court was influenced by the following matters:

*   Where a solitary creditor is affected by a compromise and it is proposed that he should only receive a proportion of his debt, there would need to be highly persuasive considerations in favour of the applicant company continuing in existence before approval would be appropriate.
*   There weren't any good reasons for not liquidating the applicant companies.
*   The Court viewed that the affairs of the applicant companies warranted investigation which may be best achieved by liquidation.

Concerns about unexpected tax bills
===================================

**17 June 2021**

Over the past few days some people have been concerned about receiving a tax bill they weren’t expecting. We apologise for any instances where our processes have contributed to that concern. The bills are correct based on the information provided to Inland Revenue.

There are a number of reasons people may be receiving unexpected bills.

*   During 2020, as part of the Government’s COVID response, bills under $200 were written off.  In 2021, this amount has reverted to the normal $50.
*   Receiving an extra pay in the tax year, for example 27 fortnightly payments, often means tax has been under-paid.  Once someone confirms the information we have about their wages is correct, that extra tax may be written off.
*   Where it looks like a wrong tax code is being used, Inland Revenue asks employers and employees to correct it.  We have done that hundreds of thousands of times in the past year.  In a small number of cases, around one thousand, Inland Revenue believed that someone receiving the pension had stopped their employment when perhaps they hadn’t.  This was because of the information we received from their employer, and led to the wrong tax code being used on their pension. We apologise for that, and are working to contact the people involved.
*   During the response to COVID there was a short delay in processing tax code changes for the pension, which may have led to some people being under-taxed during the year.
*   A few people believe they have incorrectly changed their tax code based on a conversation with us. Our staff are well trained to provide the right advice, but sometimes there may be additional information we are not aware of.
*   Now that our system creates a tax assessment for everyone, some people will be receiving bills and refunds they didn’t previously.

Rest assured that being on the wrong tax code does not mean you will pay the wrong amount of tax, but it does mean you have to balance it at the end of the tax year with a bill or refund. If you have received a bill you weren't expecting you can check how that was calculated in your myIR account on Inland Revenue's website, [ird.govt.nz](/)
.

We'd also like to thank New Zealanders for their overwhelming commitment to paying the tax they are required to.  When we all do what we're meant to, it helps make New Zealand a great place to live.

Conducting a taxable activity
=============================

2012 case note – CIR determined taxpayer not conducting a taxable activity – taxpayers must show that activities are both continuous and regular.

Case

A Taxpayer v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The Commissioner determined that the taxpayer was not conducting a taxable activity, because the activity undertaken in relation to the disputant's property was insufficient to constitute a taxable activity in itself, and there was insufficient evidence of any activity in relation to the disputant's asserted intent to undertake further developments. The Commissioner therefore considered that the disputant should have its goods and services tax (GST) registration cancelled pursuant to sections 52(5) and 52(5A) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The disputant challenged the Commissioner's decision by filing challenge proceedings in the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA").

### Impact of decision

This case reaffirms the standard position in _Newman v CIR_ \[1994\] NZCA 150, NZTC 1 12097 about the need for a taxpayer to show that the activity in question was both continuous and regular and as such does not have any binding implications. This case is very fact-specific.

### Facts

In June 2007, the disputant purchased a residential property in St Heliers, Auckland, ("the property") for $8.7 million (including GST). It claimed the purchase price of the property as an input credit for GST purposes on the basis that it was conducting a taxable activity involving the purchase, subdivision, refurbishment and sale of high-end residential properties.

The disputant says it intended to subdivide and resell the property, as the first of a number of property projects. The property was duly listed for sale nine days after purchase, subject to the proposed subdivision. At this point, approximately $40,000 had been spent on repairs and maintenance. The property was eventually resold, undivided and undeveloped, back to the original vendor (and second mortgagee) in August 2008. The disputant paid GST output tax on the sale back to the vendor, which resulted in a net GST position of $60,000 in favour of the disputant. The disputant has undertaken no further activity.

The Commissioner determined that the disputant was not conducting a taxable activity, because the activity undertaken in relation to the property was insufficient to constitute a taxable activity in itself, and there was insufficient evidence of any activity in relation to the disputant's asserted intent to undertake further developments.

The Commissioner declined the disputant's claim for a GST input credit and deregistered it for GST. The disputant challenged those decisions.

### Decision

The evidence for the disputant was given solely by Mr K who was listed as a general manager but for many years had been an experienced property developer. The TRA noted that he was closely associated with the disputant and another trust which acted as a development manager for the disputant as well as being the husband of the sole shareholder and director of the corporate trustee of the disputant.

A summary of the submissions made by the disputant in relation to why it had conducted a taxable activity on a continuous basis is given at \[61\].

The Commissioner argued that the disputant's activities did not constitute "continuous or regular" activities and therefore could not constitute a "taxable activity" for GST purposes.

The TRA made a finding at \[96\] that Mr K was a credible and honest witness and that the disputant had purchased a substantial property for three prime reasons, namely: first, to sever part of it and sell that part to its associated trust; second, to substantially upgrade the house on the remainder of the property and sell it; and, third, to reinvest those funds with profits into a similar project and so on indefinitely.

The TRA did not regard the activity in selecting the property and purchasing it (which included financing arrangements) as merely preparatory steps to commencing a taxable activity. The TRA also noted that there were some substantial survey and subdivision costs and evidence of significant expenditure in upgrading the property, and the further activity of marketing it. Further, the TRA found that the activity was "continuous" and it was intended to be "regular" but did not get to that as events unfolded.

The TRA did not accept the Commissioner's contention that the venture was never financially viable and found that the venture failed through lack of capital and a deteriorating property market.

For these reasons, the TRA found that at all material times, until the sale of the property at issue, the disputant was carrying on the taxable activity of a property developer and needed to be registered for GST and was entitled to the said GST input.

Consequential changes to the Māori authority tax rate
=====================================================

2010 changes to the M?ori authority tax rate to align it with the individual statutory rate of the majority of M?ori authority members.

_Sections OZ 7B and RZ 5D and schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

As a consequence of the changes to personal tax rates arising from Budget 2010, the Māori authority tax rate has been lowered from 19.5% to 17.5%, to align it with the individual statutory rate of the majority of Māori authority members.

### Background

Māori authorities are taxed as a proxy for their members. The 19.5% tax rate represented the statutory tax rate that applied to the majority of Māori authority members when the rules for Māori Authorities were introduced in 2004.

As part of Budget 2010, individual tax rates were lowered. Having a Māori authority tax rate that was not the statutory rate for individual members would have meant the Māori authority rate was no longer an effective proxy for these members. If left to continue, this situation would have increased compliance costs for these members because their taxable Māori authority distributions would not have been imputed to the correct ratio - making end-of-year corrections more common.

### Key features

*   The Māori authority tax rate has been reduced from 19.5% to 17.5%, as has the resident withholding tax rate for taxable Māori authority distributions. Both of these rates are contained in schedule 1.
*   New section OZ 7B allows Māori authorities to continue to attach Māori authority credits at the previous 19.5/80.5 credit-to-distribution ratio until 31 March 2013.
*   New section RZ 5D allows Māori authorities that pay provisional tax using the standard method or the GST ratio method to have immediate access to the tax cut.

### Application date

The rate reduction applies for the 2011-12 and subsequent income years, which is the same effective date as the company tax rate decrease.

### Detailed analysis

As part of the Budget 2010 package, which lowered the company tax rate, targeted provisions were introduced to assist the transition to the new company tax rate. As Māori authorities are taxed on a model based on the company imputation system, two of those transitional measures have also been introduced for the Māori authority tax rate transition.

#### _"Grandparenting" imputation ratios - new section OZ 7B_

The new maximum Māori authority credit ratio is 17.5/82.5. This ratio change can result in effective double taxation, as earnings taxed at the rate of 19.5% (prior to the rate change) may carry a maximum imputation ratio of 17.5% if distributed after the rate change. The result is that pre-rate change credits can be "trapped" in the Māori authority.

A "grandparenting" period of two years has been introduced to allow Māori authorities an opportunity to review their credit accounts and make distributions of pre-rate change profits if necessary. This two-year window is the same period afforded to companies as a consequence of their rate reduction. Therefore, the new section OZ 7B applies the company transitional measures in sections OZ 8 to OZ 11 and section OZ 13 to Māori authorities, with appropriate terminology changes and deletions to make them applicable to the Māori authority context.

#### _Provisional tax adjustments - new section RZ 5D_

An adjustment has been made to the provisional tax rules so that the rate decrease can be immediately reflected in the tax paid by provisional taxpayers. This change recognises the fact that, all other things being equal, the tax paid by a Māori authority is expected to be less in the year of the decrease.

This provision applies to taxpayers that base their provisional tax on an earlier year’s tax obligations, that is, taxpayers that use the standard or the GST ratio method of calculation. The reduction is achieved by amending the uplift factor used to calculate the current year liability.

The change to the uplift factor is slightly different from that enacted for companies, reflecting the fact that the 2% rate reduction for Māori authorities is larger in real terms than the corresponding 2% company rate reduction. As with the imputation ratio change mentioned above, new section RZ 5D implements these measures by deeming the relevant company transition provisions in sections RZ 3 to RZ 5 to apply to Māori authorities with appropriate terminology changes. Māori authorities that actually estimate their liability would be unaffected by these changes, as they would factor the lower rate into their estimates.

Consequential R&D amendments
============================

2010 amendment to Income Tax Act clarifies the income tax rules for grants in relation to two new research and development incentives. Applies from 1 Oct 2010.

_Sections CX 47 and DF 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Technology Development Grants and Technology Transfer Vouchers were two new R&D incentives announced in Budget 2010. Several consequential amendments have been made to the special income tax rules for grants to make the tax treatment of these incentives clear and to deal with a compliance issue.

Part of the payment under a Technology Development Grant may be paid after the end of the income year in which a relevant deduction is incurred. Dealing with the deduction and the payment under the special grant rules where the deduction arises in one year and the grant is received in a subsequent year can result in disproportionate compliance costs. This problem is addressed by these amendments.

Technology Transfer Vouchers deliver R&D support in a way which does not fall clearly within the normal grant rules. These rules have been amended to make the tax treatment of Technology Transfer Vouchers straightforward.

### Background

As part of Budget 2010, the Government announced two new research and development (R&D) initiatives:

*   Technology Development Grants to be made to businesses. The amount claimed by the business under a grant will be paid out in instalments over the course of its R&D programme. However, a proportion of the grant amount will be withheld until the grant administrator is satisfied that the grant claims which have been made meet the eligible expenditure criteria that are a condition of the award of a grant. The grant administrator will initially be the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology and, from 1 February 2011, the Ministry of Science and Innovation (MSI).
*   Technology Transfer Vouchers. Under this initiative, the Government will pay 50% of the costs of R&D work which a business contracts out to a third party research provider.

The Technology Development Grant initiative takes effect from 1 October 2010 and the Technology Transfer Vouchers from 1 November 2010.

Tax legislation contains special rules which deal with grants. In short, grants are treated as excluded income, but the expenditure to which the grants relate is not deductible (or not depreciable, if the grants relate to expenditure on the acquisition of depreciable property).

### Key features

The changes will:

*   provide the facility for businesses to "opt out" of the special grant rules when a payment is received in an income year later than the year in which the relevant expense was incurred; and
*   make the application of the special grant rules to Technology Transfer Voucher transactions clear.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 1 October 2010.

### Detailed analysis

Section CX 47 of the Income Tax Act essentially provides that, when a business receives a grant, and that grant relates to either deductible expenditure or expenditure on a capital asset which is depreciable, that grant is excluded income.

Two amendments have been made to section CX 47. Section CX 47(1) is replaced. Paragraph (b) has been amended to make it clear that section CX 47 cannot apply to a research provider who receives an amount from the Crown under a Technology Transfer Voucher arrangement. Paragraph (d) is amended to make the application to Technology Transfer Vouchers clear, and in the case of subparagraph (ii), to make it consistent with subparagraph (i).

The second amendment to section CX 47 is to insert a new subsection (4). Under this subsection, a person who receives a grant payment as a Technology Development Grant or under a Technology Transfer Voucher which has been withheld until the conditions of the grant are satisfied, and when the payment is received in a year subsequent to the year the expenditure was incurred can elect that section CX 47 not apply. If the person makes this election, the grant payment will be income of the person, and not excluded income.

Section DF 1 essentially provides that, if a person incurs expenditure which is either deductible or on an asset which is depreciable, and the person receives a grant which relates to that expenditure which is excluded income under section CX 47, that expenditure is not deductible, and no depreciation loss can be claimed in relation to it.

New subsection (1) excludes from the denial of deduction circumstances where a person has made an election under section CX 47(4). The section has generally been restructured, with subsection (1) providing a single point of entry into the section. This is the reason for the new subsection (1B), and the simplification of subsection (3).

**Example 1: Receipt of a Technology Development Grant**

AB Ltd has a 31 March year end. AB Ltd has been awarded a Technology Development Grant to support its R&D programme. The business's R&D programme will involve some of AB's staff, and they will design, build and test modifications to one of AB's production chains. Eligible R&D expenditure for the programme during the 2011-12 year totals $500,000, so the 2011-12 grant amount of 20% is $100,000.

The grant will support the business's R&D programme from August 2011, and claims for grant payments are submitted quarterly - at the end of September and December 2011 ($50,000 each quarter). The grant payments were made shortly after the claims were received, but 10% of the claim amounts were withheld, pending the satisfaction of MSI that the grant claims already made meet the eligible expenditure criteria that are a condition of the grant (in the case of AB Ltd, this involves submitting audited accounts to MSI; other businesses may need to send it externally certified accounts of R&D expenditure). AB Ltd therefore received two payments of $45,000.

AB Ltd will apply sections CX 47 and DF 1 to the payments received during the income year of $90,000. The amount of $90,000 will be treated as excluded income. To the extent to which the $90,000 represented staff wages, it will not be deductible, and to the extent to which the grant represented payment for the modifications made to the production chain, those costs will not be depreciable.

AB Ltd submits its audited accounts to MSI in May 2012, and receives the withheld amount of $10,000 in June 2012.

At this point AB Ltd has a choice.

It could adopt the "ordinary rules basis" and treat the final instalment of $10,000 as exempt income under section CX 47 in 2012-13, the year of receipt. This would mean that section DF 1 will apply to deny any claims for deductions or depreciation for the underlying expenditure in 2011-12. If AB Ltd has already filed its tax return for 2011-12, it may need to amend that return. If AB Ltd has not yet filed its return, it may be straightforward to deal with the denial of deduction and reduction in the depreciation amount.

Alternatively, it could elect to apply new section CX 47(4), which would mean it is required to treat the $10,000 proportion of the grant as ordinary income, but it can claim the deductions or depreciation amount which relate to the $10,000.

**Example 2: Technology Transfer Voucher**

DEF Ltd is a small company which is developing a non-toxic form of timber preservative suitable for use in children's playground equipment and marine farms. It does not have the ability to carry out the relevant R&D in-house, and has been awarded a Technology Transfer Voucher for the R&D to be performed by a third part research provider. Under the voucher arrangements, MSI will pay 50% of the costs of the R&D directly to the research provider. DEF Ltd will pay the other 50% of the costs directly to the research provider. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that the R&D meets the deductibility tests in section DF 34.

Payments to the research provider by both MSI and DEF Ltd are ordinary income to the research provider.

There are two possible ways that DEF Ltd might treat the payments from MSI to the research provider:

*   It may treat the payments as income. If this is the case, section CX 47 will apply and treat the amount as exempt income (potentially subject to an election under new section CX 47(4)). A deduction will be denied for the book entry which DEF Ltd will record as the notional "on-payment" of the grant from itself to the research provider.
*   It may not treat the payments as income (that is, effectively ignore them). If this is the case, section CX 47 cannot apply, and there will be no deduction for section DF 1 to apply to.

Consideration of the "evidence exclusion" rule
==============================================

2012 case note - consideration of the 'evidence exclusion' rule in the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Case

Te Akau Stallion Syndicate No 1 v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayer sought to strike out certain pleadings in the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") Statement of Defence. The Commissioner successfully opposed the strike-out application primarily relying on the "evidence exclusion" rule in section 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

### Impact of decision

The judgment considers the requirement of no arguable defence to succeed in a strike out application and provides some guidance on the application of section 138G of the TAA. It reinforces the legislative requirement for both parties to refer to all issues and propositions of law in a Statement of Position to be raised in a challenge. (This case was dealt with under the old evidence exclusion rule which was replaced by the Tax Administration and Remedial Matters Act 2011 effective 29 August 2011.)

### Facts

The Te Akau Stallion Syndicate No 1 ("the Syndicate") was formed in 2008. It purchased a thoroughbred colt at the 2008 Karaka sale for $550,000.

In the tax years 2008 and 2009, each member of the syndicate claimed a deduction for their respective share of the syndicate loss which was made up of expenditure incurred in relation to the colt and a 75% diminishing value write down of the purchase price.

The Commissioner allowed deductions for expenses incurred in relation to the colt. However, deductions for the cost of the colt were denied on the basis the syndicate was not in the business of breeding bloodstock pursuant to section EC39(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Five syndicate members (the plaintiffs) challenged the Commissioner's finding in relation to the deduction for the cost of the colt. Included in the plaintiffs' Statement of Claim was an allegation that the fourth plaintiff was in the business of breeding outside the syndicate and was therefore entitled to its share of the value of the colt.

The Commissioner considered section 138G of the TAA applied to prevent the plaintiffs raising those three allegations in the challenge that had been referred to in the plaintiffs' Statement of Position and therefore denied he was required to plead to them in his Statement of Defence.

### Decision

Associate Judge Faire began by setting out the general principles of strike out as per _Attorney General v Prince and Gardener_ \[1998\] 1 NZLR 262 (CA). The issue to be determined here was whether there was no reasonably arguable defence that the plaintiffs were estopped from pleading due to section 138G of the TAA.

He also set out the requirements of "due diligence" pursuant to section 138G(2)(a) and "manifest injustice" pursuant to section 138G(2)(b) of the TAA to succeed on the application for leave to raise the matters set out in paragraphs 35, 21, 22 and 25 of the Statement of Claim.

In terms of the allegations concerning the fourth plaintiff, the Judge considered the Commissioner's pleading advanced was a reasonably arguable defence to the allegation made in the Statement of Claim. In addition, there was evidence in support of the contention made in the defence.

It was clear the pleading in the Statement of Defence had foundation to it and there was no justification for striking out the paragraph.

In terms of section 138G of the TAA, the plaintiffs had provided no evidence that they could not have with due diligence discovered the facts and issues referred to. The Judge was not satisfied a case had been made out that would justify the granting of leave.

The Statement of Claim contained allegations in relation to the deductions allowed by Inland Revenue's Adjudication Unit for expenses incurred by the syndicate in relation to the colt. While it was apparent the factual matters referred to in those paragraphs were in the plaintiffs' Statement of Position, there was no reference to inconsistency of the treatment of the two types of deductions claimed.

In terms of the strike-out, the Judge considered there was a reasonably arguable defence of estoppel and therefore could not strike out the pleadings in the Statement of Defence.

In relation to the section 138G of the TAA application, the Judge agreed with the Commissioner that while section 138G(2)(a) of the TAA was satisfied for these paragraphs, there was no manifest injustice in not granting leave as the correctness of the assessment did not turn on the correction of another assessment.

The Statement of Claim contained allegations in relation to the GST dispute. The Commissioner submitted that section 138G of the TAA did not permit the plaintiffs to refer to the GST dispute, particularly in relation to the issue of inconsistency which had not been raised in the Statement of Position. In addition, the Commissioner submitted that an inconsistency argument was not a ground for challenging an assessment and referred to a number of sections in the TAA that allowed the Commissioner to change his assessment.

On the basis of these arguments, the Judge considered that it was not appropriate to strike out the pleadings in the Commissioner's Statement of Defence.

The Judge again agreed with the Commissioner that there would be no manifest injustice in not allowing leave pursuant to section 138G(2)(b) of the TAA as the inconsistency argument was irrelevant to the determination of the issues.

Consolidated groups and foreign losses
======================================

2006 amendment makes the loss rules for consolidated groups consistent with the rules for nonconsolidated groups, to prevent losses being used in two jurisdictions.

##### Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 1994

The law has been amended to make the loss rules for consolidated groups consistent with the rules for nonconsolidated groups. This will prevent losses from being used in two different jurisdictions by a consolidated group.

### Background

Under the group loss rules, a loss-making company can offset its losses against the income of another company in the same group. Companies can group their losses if they are at least 66 percent commonly owned.

Under the consolidation rules, companies can elect to be treated as a single entity (the "consolidated group") if they are 100 percent commonly owned and subject to certain other requirements contained in the definition of "eligible company". Effectively, this means that a loss-making company can offset its income against another company in the same consolidated group.

There are two restrictions that prevent companies in a non-consolidated group from grouping the same loss in more than one jurisdiction. First, dual-resident companies may not offset losses against the income of other companies in a group. A "dual-resident company" is a New Zealand-resident company which is either treated as non-resident under a double tax agreement or is liable for tax in another jurisdiction by reason of domicile, residence or place of incorporation. Second, in order to offset losses, the loss-making company must either be incorporated in New Zealand or carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. This requirement helps ensure that companies cannot change their place of residence to circumvent the restriction against grouping the same loss in more than one jurisdiction.

Under previous law, these rules did not apply in the same way to consolidated groups. While the rules for consolidated groups required that the company be a New Zealand resident, they did not include the requirements relating to incorporation or fixed establishment in New Zealand that are in the loss rules for non-consolidated groups.

Further, although the rules for consolidated groups required that a company must not be treated as a non-resident for the purposes of a double tax agreement, there was no restriction on grouping losses if a company in a consolidated group was also liable for income tax in another country because of their domicile, residence or place of incorporation.

### Key features

Every member of a consolidated group must be an "eligible company" as defined in section OB 1. The amendment modifies the definition of "eligible company" to require that the company in question be incorporated in New Zealand or carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. The amended definition further requires that an eligible company must not be liable for tax in another jurisdiction by reason of domicile, residence or place of incorporation.

To ensure that taxpayers cannot retrospectively take advantage of the discrepancy in the previous law, the equivalent definition in the Income Tax Act 1994 has also been amended. This amendment applies from the 1997-1998 income year. The application date coincides with the date that the income tax core provisions took effect, which included the enactment of current loss grouping rules.

However, a savings provision ensures that the amended definition does not apply to taxpayers who were members of a consolidated group (under previous law) at the time. The position of existing dual-resident members of a consolidated group is protected for their 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 years if they elected to join the consolidated group before 17 May 2006.

Certain dual-resident members that are genuine trading companies are also grandparented for 2005-2006 and later income years. These companies must be in business and have elected to join the consolidated group before 17 May 2006. In addition, the company's interest deductions (or deductions under the financial arrangement rules) for the previous income year, ignoring foreign exchange fluctuations in the debt, must be less than 50 percent of the company's total allowable deductions for that year.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the 1997-1998 income year. Table 1 illustrates when the grandparenting provisions will apply.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |Table 1
| Taxpayer's situation | Savings or grandparenting provision applies for |

| The taxpayer:<br><br>*   elected to be part of consolidated group before 17 May 2006; and<br>*   is in business; and<br>*   less than 50 percent of the company's total allowable deductions for the previous income year were interest deductions (or deductions under the financial arrangement rules). | 2005-06 and later income years |

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Company consolidation allows a group of companies 100% owned by the same shareholders to be treated as a single entity for tax. This single group of companies is known as a consolidated group.

What consolidated companies can do
----------------------------------

Consolidated companies can do the following:

*   transfer assets within the consolidation group, and defer income tax liabilities
*   pay exempt dividends between companies
*   claim deductions for administration and other costs of holding companies that may not have been available to the individual company
*   use losses incurred by group members as though they are losses of the group, subject to continuity requirements
*   offset imputation credits within the group.

Consolidation eligibility
-------------------------

All companies forming the consolidated group must be 100% commonly owned. This is called a wholly-owned group of companies. 

A company is eligible to be part of a consolidated group if:

*   it is a New Zealand resident company 
*   it is incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment.

A New Zealand tax resident that is also a tax resident in another country can be a member of a consolidated group of companies. 

A company is **not** eligible to be part of a consolidated group if: 

*   it only derives exempt income
*   it is a look through company
*   it is a member of another consolidated group.

Qualifying companies, or mineral miner companies, can only be grouped with other companies of the same type.

Forming a consolidated group
----------------------------

For it to apply to the current year, we must be notified of an election to form a consolidated group **within 63 working days** of:

*   For existing companies - the start of an income year.
*   For new companies - the date of the latest incorporation.
*   For newly eligible companies - the first date of eligibility.

Elections made outside of this will not apply until the start of the following income year. However, a company may apply for an extension to the 63 working day rule if the notice could not reasonably have been provided within that time.

An election notice must be in writing and contain an agreement by each of the companies to be jointly and severally liable for any income tax of the consolidated group, and the details of the nominated company of the group. This can be done by using the Election to form a consolidated group - IR494 form on the page below.

[Consolidate my company](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-companies/consolidation-for-companies/consolidate-my-company)

Leaving the consolidated group
------------------------------

A member company must leave the consolidated group if they lose their eligibility status, or are no longer entitled to be a member. A member company may leave for other reasons, but must formally notify us.

Membership will usually end from the beginning of the income year we are notified in. If a member company is struck off the New Zealand Company Register, or liquidated, membership will end from the date of strike off or liquidation.

Consolidated groups and general elections - IR495
-------------------------------------------------

If a company needs to change the group’s structure or operation, they must fill out an IR495 form. This form can be used to make elections within a consolidated group. If your company is a member of a consolidated group, you can use this form to: 

*   elect to leave an existing consolidated group
*   change the nominated company of a consolidated group
*   elect to maintain trading stock concession
*   apply to limit joint and several liability
*   elect to join an existing consolidated group.

API whakapā Contact API
=======================

The contact API enables the creating, updating and deleting of the contact details of a customer or an account. It is 1 of 8 APIs that, together, make up the customer services suite.

[How customer services work](/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue/customer-and-account/customer-services-suite/how-customer-services-work)

How the contact API works
-------------------------

The contact API requires the customer or account API to be integrated.

The contact API enables the contact details held at either the customer level or the customer account level to be added, updated and deleted. It requires either:

*   the customer ID or account ID for the addition of a contact or phone number to a customer or account
*   a contact ID for the update or deletion of a contact from a customer or account
*   a phone ID for the update or deletion of a phone number from a customer or account.

The account ID is available through a call to the account API. The contact ID and phone ID are available through a call to either the customer API or the account API.

The contact API can only be used by:

*   the customer the data is associated to
*   a user with delegated access
*   an intermediary who’s linked to the customer
*   government agencies with a memorandum of understanding that allows them access to customer account level data.

The contact API enables the above users to update Inland Revenue’s customer or account data from their native systems, and to avoid the use of manually facilitated channels.

For access to myIR File Upload and Gateway Services detailed technical documentation, register your organisation or login to Gateway Customer Support Portal using the links below.

Contractor not a party to a sham
================================

2010 case note - Judge held that disputant was not claiming income tax deductions or GST inputs for invoices knowing them to be false - deductibility, agent.

Case

TRA No. 029/08

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Acts 2004 and 2007, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, and Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979

### Summary

Judge Barber held that the disputant was not claiming income tax deductions (or GST inputs) in respect of invoices knowing them to be false. His Honour allowed leave for the parties to make submissions on the legal issue of deductibility (including whether GST inputs can be based on false invoices). However, he considered that the false invoices were costs incurred by the disputant in good faith in seeking to derive assessable income so that they are deductible in the usual way.

### Impact of decision

This decision is limited to its facts.

### Facts

The disputant (an orchardist and contracting company) challenged the Commissioner's reassessments of its GST, PAYE and income tax for 2006 and 2007.

The Commissioner alleged that the disputant had used false invoices from subcontractors to claim income tax deductions, GST inputs and to avoid paying PAYE on salaries paid in cash.

It was accepted by the disputant that five of its subcontractors were involved in a fraudulent invoice writing scheme. However, the disputant claimed that one of its ex-employees was running a secret and separate business operation using the invoice writing companies without the disputant's knowledge.

The Commissioner alleged that the disputant (via its proprietor Mr J) was well aware of its involvement in the fraudulent invoice writing scheme and was attempting to use its ex-employee as a scapegoat.

### Decision

Judge Barber held that he could not be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the disputant (through its proprietor Mr J) knew that the invoices upon which the disputant had claimed income tax deductions and GST inputs were false. In terms of the reasoning of Richardson J in _NZI Bank v Euro-National Corporation Ltd_, Judge Barber held that because the invoices were not a sham to which the disputant was a party, the legal effect of the invoices was to be respected.

The Commissioner argued that Mr J had actual knowledge of the sham and was the directing mind of the disputant. A principal is not bound by an agent's knowledge of fraud; but where a person who may properly be classified as the "directing mind of the company" has actual knowledge, the principal company will be liable: _El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings Plc_ \[1994\] 2 ER 685. His Honour held that the level of proof led for the Commissioner was insufficient for him to find as a fact that Mr J was a knowing participant in the "fraudulent invoice writing scam".

His Honour considered that the disputant had paid out on invoices which it believed were genuine because its proprietor Mr J was duped by an ex-employee. His Honour considered this to be expenditure incurred in the course of the disputant's business even though some of the invoices were false. His Honour allowed leave for the parties to make submissions on the legal issue of deductibility (including, whether GST inputs can be based on false invoices). Nevertheless, His Honour considered that the false invoices are costs incurred by the disputant in good faith in seeking to derive assessable income so that they are deductible in the usual way.

His Honour was uncertain whether the Commissioner still relied on his first ground for disallowing the income tax deductions, GST inputs and for increasing PAYE as being due to insufficient documentation and information. His Honour said that he would reconvene the hearing on that aspect if necessary however, his view was that there was sufficient documentation and information to comply with the discretions available to the Commissioner.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Controlled foreign companies (CFCs) are companies based overseas but controlled by New Zealand residents. They must not be a tax resident in New Zealand or must be treated as foreign under a double tax agreement.

A company may be a tax resident in New Zealand if it's incorporated in New Zealand or has a head office, centre of management or controlling directors in New Zealand.

Controlled foreign companies must be controlled by New Zealanders
-----------------------------------------------------------------

'Control’ usually means total ownership of the non resident company by a New Zealand resident.

However, control can also exist where:

*   5 or fewer New Zealand residents have a [control interest](/api/glossary/item?id={69E34467-735C-423D-94B5-D2D29C9701DF})
     of more than 50%
*   5 or fewer New Zealand residents control the shareholder decision rights
*   a single New Zealand resident has a control interest of 40% or more, and no non associated non resident owns a larger control interest.

Control interests include:

*   voting rights
*   any shareholding
*   any shareholding decision making rights
*   the right to receive income from the company
*   the right to receive distributions from the company’s new assets.

We use the highest percentage of any one control interest type to decide if a company is a controlled foreign company.

How controlled foreign company income is taxed
----------------------------------------------

Generally, income is taxed under the controlled foreign company rules when you have income interests of 10% or more in controlled foreign companies. This income is handled differently depending on whether the business is active or non active.

In active businesses you are not taxed on controlled foreign company income or losses. You may be taxed on providing some personal services.

In non-active businesses you're taxed on your proportional share of passive income and losses.

### Branch equivalent tax accounts

Branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs) can be used by individuals, not companies, who are [New Zealand tax residents](/api/glossary/item?id={CC613A0F-B2AE-4755-B947-A74A5002A8EF})
. These accounts help to prevent double taxation of attributed foreign income you get from:

*   an income interest of 10% or greater in a CFC
*   a FIF where the income from it is treated as if it were from a CFC.

BETAs record a credit for New Zealand income tax paid on the attributed income from the CFC. You can then offset that credit against any income tax payable when you receive dividends from that CFC.

If you use a BETA, you need to complete a Branch equivalent tax account return - IR308 and send it to us with your individual income tax return - IR3.

Convictions for offences under the TAA do not disqualify individuals from acting as liquidators under the Companies Act 1993
============================================================================================================================

2016 case note - Convictions under the Tax Administration Act do not disqualify individuals from acting as liquidators - prohibition order, strike-out.

Case

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Imran Mohammed Kamal \[2016\] NZHC 1053

Legislative References

The Companies Act 1993

### Summary 

The High Court struck out two proceedings brought by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") seeking orders prohibiting an individual from acting as a liquidator for up to five years. The Court found it could not overcome the fact that convictions under the Revenue Acts are not expressly included within the disqualifying criteria set out in s 280 of the Companies Act 1993 ("the Act"). The Court also found that the Act does not impose any general "fit person" requirement on potential liquidators and that resignation as liquidator prior to the proceedings being brought ended any supervisory powers the Court may have had in respect of orders under s 286 of the Act.

### Impact 

The decision confirms that unless an individual falls within any of the express categories set out in s 280 of the Act, they will not be disqualified from acting as a liquidator. The decision also confirms there is no general "fit person" requirement for potential liquidators and the Court does not appear to have jurisdiction to make s 286 orders in relation to liquidators who resign prior to proceedings commencing.

### Facts

From 17 October 2005 Mr Kamal and his company Accountants First Limited ("AFL") were on the Commissioner's list of approved tax agents.

On 15 February 2013 Mr Kamal, having pleaded guilty to six charges under the Tax Administration Act ("the TAA") of aiding and abetting AFL in providing false income tax and GST returns, and in providing misleading information to the Commissioner by way of altered tax invoices, was sentenced to three months' home detention and 150 hours of community work.

On 19 February 2014, the Commissioner sought to remove AFL from the list of approved tax agents. Mr Kamal unsuccessfully sought judicial review of that decision.

The Commissioner was a creditor of two companies, Hillman Ltd ("Hillman") and GDZ Services Ltd ("GDZ") which were both put into liquidation by shareholder resolution in 2014. In both instances the liquidator appointed was Mr Kamal who, through AFL, had continuing business relationships with two other companies involving some of the same directors and shareholders of the companies in liquidation.

In each liquidation Mr Kamal issued a Liquidator's First Report noting that he proposed to dispense with a meeting of creditors pursuant to s 245 of the Act. In each instance the Commissioner gave notice she required that a creditor's meeting be called (with a view to appointing replacement liquidators) and in each instance Mr Kamal failed to comply. The Commissioner subsequently sent Notices of Failure to Comply with Liquidator's Duties inviting a response as to how the failure would be remedied and that any failure to rectify would result in legal action to compel compliance. Mr Kamal declined to hold creditors' meetings.

The Commissioner served notices on Mr Kamal under s 286(2) of the Act requiring him to resign as liquidator and provide a written undertaking that he would not accept appointments as liquidator of any company for five years from that date. Mr Kamal resigned as liquidator but declined to give any such undertaking.

The Commissioner sought to have Mr Kamal prohibited from acting as a liquidator on the basis that he was unfit to accept appointment, or act, as liquidator. Mr Kamal pleaded that he resigned as liquidator before the Commissioner commenced the proceedings and there is no basis for the prohibition order the Commissioner now seeks. Mr Kamal applied to strike out portions of the Commissioner's statements of claim.

### Decision

The Court struck out the entirety of both the Hillman and GDZ proceedings.

_Was it reasonably arguable for the Commissioner that any general unfitness of Mr Kamal to accept appointment, or act as, liquidator amounted to a failure to comply with a "duty" as defined in s 285 of the Act? (Issue 1)_

The Court noted that s 280 (which sets out a list of circumstances which disqualify someone from accepting appointment as a liquidator) does not include in the list conviction for offences involving dishonesty under the TAA. The Court did not accept the Commissioner's submission that the list in s 280 is not exhaustive.

The Court found that the references to s 280 in s 286(4) suggest that the power to remove a liquidator under s 286(4) is limited to the particular circumstances which are identified, in s 280, as disqualifying circumstances and that if there were a broader disqualifying ground of "unfit for appointment as liquidator generally", it is difficult to see why Parliament would have limited the relevant part of s 286(4) to disqualification under s 280.

The Court found that the Act does not impose any general requirement of fitness on liquidators, and it would be beyond the Court's function to add an overarching "fitness" requirement to the detailed list of disqualifying circumstances which Parliament has prescribed in s 280.

The Court held that there was no continuing failure by Mr Kamal to comply with a general duty to be a fit person to accept appointment as or to act as liquidator at the time the Commissioner commenced these proceedings.

_If the answer to Issue 1 was "yes", was it reasonably arguable for the Commissioner that Mr Kamal was guilty of a continuing breach of that duty at the time these proceedings were commenced? (Issue 2)_

Given the conclusion reached on Issue 1, the Court did not find it necessary to examine Issue 2.

_Was it reasonably arguable for the Commissioner that, at the time these proceedings were commenced, there was a continuing failure by Mr Kamal to comply with duties to disqualify himself from appointment as liquidator of Hillman and/or GDZ on account of his alleged continuing business relationships with directors of those companies and to convene meetings of the creditors of Hillman and/or GDZ? (Issue 3)_

The Court considered that while Mr Kamal's respective resignations as liquidator of Hillman and GDZ may not have had the effect of curing the breaches relied upon by the Commissioner, they did have the effect of eliminating any continuing failure to comply with the relevant duties. The Court found that once Mr Kamal had resigned he was no longer bound by the duties on which the Commissioner was relying to seek the prohibition orders sought.

The Court took the view that Mr Kamal was no longer bound by the relevant Companies Act duties when he resigned and that s 284(2) could not be called upon to try and overcome the plain words of s 286(2).

_If it was reasonably arguable for the Commissioner that when these proceedings were issued Mr Kamal was guilty of a continuing failure to comply with a relevant duty or duties, was it also reasonably arguable for the Commissioner that the seriousness or persistence of the failure or failures was such as to make Mr Kamal unfit to act as a liquidator? (Issue 4)_

Given the conclusion on Issue 3, the Court did not find it necessary to resolve this issue.

Corporate migration
===================

2006 amendment to the Income Tax Act ensures companies that migrate from NZ pay tax on the worldwide income they earned while resident in NZ.

### Sections CD 18, CD 32, FCB 1 to FCB 3, ME 6, MG 2, MI 2, MI 10, NF 4, NG 11 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections 49 and 51 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

The Income Tax Act 2004 has been amended to ensure that companies that migrate from New Zealand pay tax on the worldwide income they earned while resident in New Zealand. The changes are intended to remove incentives for companies to migrate for tax reasons.

A company resident in New Zealand is liable for New Zealand tax on its worldwide income. However, a company was previously able to migrate without having necessarily paid tax on all the income that was earned while it was a New Zealand resident.

Under the amendments, a migrating company will be treated as if it had realised all its assets, liquidated, and fully distributed the proceeds to shareholders before migration. The distribution will be subject to tax as a dividend under the usual rules.

Clarifying technical amendments have also been made to the dividend withholding payment and conduit rules. For consistency with current imputation rules, a company that ceases to be resident in New Zealand will also cease to be a dividend-withholding payment account company and a conduit tax relief company.

### Background

#### Applying the liquidation rules

A company has migrated from New Zealand if it is no longer a New Zealand-resident company under the Income Tax Act 2004. This generally happens when companies transfer their place of incorporation overseas.

Under the Income Tax Act 2004, a company is a nonresident company if:

*   it is not incorporated in New Zealand;
*   it does not have its head office in New Zealand;
*   it does not have its centre of management in New Zealand; and
*   control of the company by its directors is not exercised in New Zealand. [1](#01)
    

A company resident in New Zealand is liable for New Zealand tax on its worldwide income. However, before the new amendments, a company was able to migrate without necessarily paying tax on all the income that was earned while it was resident in New Zealand.

For example, any increase in the value of property situated outside New Zealand that accrued when a company was resident in New Zealand was previously not subject to New Zealand income tax if the company migrated and the property was then sold. [2](#02)
 Income tax deductions may have been previously allowed in relation to the property on the assumption that there would be a resulting income stream that would be taxable in New Zealand.

Similarly, other income generated when a company was resident in New Zealand may not have been subject to New Zealand income tax until a distribution was made to the company's shareholders. However, when a company had migrated, distributions made to nonresident shareholders were not taxed in New Zealand at all as the company was no longer a New Zealand-resident company. Distributions to resident shareholders were still subject to New Zealand tax, although offset to some extent by credits for tax paid on the distribution in the company's new country of residence.

#### Company law

The Companies Act 1955 required the liquidation and discontinuation of the legal personality of a company before it could be removed from the New Zealand register of companies. Distributions made to shareholders on the liquidation of a New Zealand company are treated as a dividend.

In contrast, the Companies Act 1993 allows a company to transfer its place of incorporation offshore and become a non-resident company without the need to liquidate, make a distribution and pay New Zealand income tax. This created a tax incentive for companies to migrate rather than liquidate.

Applying the same tax treatment to both liquidating and migrating companies removes the existing tax incentive to migrate rather than liquidate, and increases the neutrality of the tax system.

#### Dividend withholding payment and conduit tax relief accounts

In most cases, a New Zealand-resident company must have an imputation credit account. When a company ceases to be a New Zealand resident, its imputation credit account must close and a debit adjustment made to bring any credit balance to nil.

A New Zealand-resident company may elect to maintain a dividend withholding payment (DWP) account to record credits for the amount of DWP paid by the company on foreign dividends it receives. These DWP credits are available for allocation to its shareholders. The company may also elect to be a conduit tax relief (CTR) company to obtain New Zealand tax relief on its foreign-sourced income based on its foreign shareholding.

The company may subsequently elect to cease to be a DWP account company (and a CTR company). An election may not necessarily be made when a company migrates from New Zealand. If an election is made, the company's DWP accounts will close and a debit adjustment made to bring any credit balance to nil. To recover the amount of CTR provided while the company was resident, a CTR company is also required to pay additional DWP of the amount of any credit balance in its CTR account.

### Key features

Under the new rules, when a company ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident, the company will be treated as if it had been liquidated and paid a distribution to its shareholders.

This means that the existing tax rules that apply on the liquidation of a New Zealand company will also apply in the event of a company ceasing to be a New Zealand resident for income tax purposes.

The company will first be treated as disposing of its property at market value immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident. Under the current tax rules, certain amounts (such as gains in the value of revenue account property and excess depreciation deductions) will be subject to tax. This is consistent with the current treatment of financial arrangements and interests in foreign investment funds when a company ceases to be a New Zealand resident.

The company will then be treated as having distributed all shareholder funds (which will include the proceeds of the deemed disposal) to its shareholders.

While realised capital reserves will generally be excluded from the distribution, a consequence of alignment with the liquidation rules is that they will be included for nonresident related company shareholders.

The amount of the deemed dividend will therefore vary between certain shareholders as shown in Table 1.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Table 1: Treatment of shareholder dividends
| Resident shareholder | Non-related non-resident shareholder | Related non-resident company shareholder |
| Dividend subject to RWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital and realised capital reserves. | Dividend subject to NRWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital and realised capital reserves. | Dividend subject to NRWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital. |

In accordance with the usual tax rules applicable to dividends, a migrating company will be required to withhold tax from a deemed dividend distribution immediately before it ceased to be a New Zealandresident company, under the resident withholding tax (RWT) or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules, as appropriate. The company is allowed to attach imputation credits to the deemed dividends arising on migration.

Under existing rules, RWT on dividends applies at the rate of 33%. A dividend distribution to a resident shareholder will be taxed at the shareholder's marginal tax rate, less imputation credits attached by the company.

A dividend distribution to a non-resident shareholder will be taxed at 30% if the shareholder is a resident of a non-treaty country and the dividend is not fully imputed or credited with dividend withholding payments. If the treaty allows, NRWT of 15% will apply to a dividend distribution to a shareholder from a treaty country or a shareholder from a non-treaty country if the dividend is fully imputed or credited.

Property will be treated as being re-acquired by the company at the same market value it was treated as being disposed of at the time of migration. For property that continues to be subject to tax in New Zealand after a company's migration (for example, standing timber situated in New Zealand), this will establish a new cost base to apply in the event of a subsequent disposal.

To remove the potential for double taxation in the event that, after its migration, a non-resident company pays a dividend to its shareholders, the amount of the distribution deemed to have been paid immediately before the company migrated is added to the company's available subscribed capital (which can be distributed tax-free to shareholders in certain circumstances).

A company that remains incorporated in New Zealand but moves its place of management to another country could also be treated as resident in the other country. In this type of situation, the company will not be considered to have migrated (because it remains a New Zealandresident company for New Zealand income tax purposes) and the new tax rules will not apply to it. It follows that if a dual resident company is treated under a double tax treaty as being resident in another country for the purposes of the treaty the new rules will similarly not apply. The corporate migration rules therefore apply only to companies that cease to be resident under domestic income tax rules. The new rules are consistent with New Zealand's double tax treaties.

#### Consequential technical amendments

If a New Zealand-resident company migrates, it will cease to be a dividend withholding payment (DWP) company and a conduit tax relief (CTR) company. Its accounts will close and a debit adjustment made to bring any credit balance to nil. To recover the amount of conduit tax relief provided while the company was resident, a conduit tax relief company is also required to make an additional dividend withholding payment of the amount of any credit balance in its conduit tax relief account.

Previously, if a company ceased to be a New Zealandresident company it was required to file a DWP account return but it was not clear whether it automatically ceased to be a DWP account company and a CTR company. The DWP and conduit rules have been clarified to ensure that the same treatment that applies to an imputation credit account company ceasing to be a New Zealand resident also applies to DWP and CTR companies. Therefore, if a company ceases to be a New Zealand-resident company, it will automatically cease to be a DWP account company and a CTR company and may be required to pay additional DWP. These amendments are in line with the policy intent of the DWP and conduit rules, and can be regarded as a clarification.

### Application date

The amendments concerning corporate migration apply to companies migrating on or after 21 March 2005, the date of announcement of these amendments by the government.

A grandparenting provision applies to companies that had done everything within their control to migrate by 21 March 2005, but had not yet become non-resident. In particular, the new corporate migration rules do not apply to companies that, before 21 March 2005, completed the requirements in the Companies Act 1993 for migrating companies relating to public notification, shareholder approval, Inland Revenue clearance and solvency, and that applied for incorporation under the laws of another country or territory.

The amendments to the dividend withholding payment and conduit rules apply from 1 April 1997.

### Detailed analysis

#### Deemed liquidation rules

New subpart FCB contains the tax rules for migrating companies. Section FCB 1 is the purpose provision for the subpart. It refers to a company resident in New Zealand that ceases to be a New Zealand resident for the purposes of New Zealand income tax. The company will be subject to the tax rules that apply when it:

*   disposes of its property at market value;
*   is liquidated; and
*   distributes shareholder funds (including the deemed disposal proceeds) to its shareholders.

Under new section FCB 2, a migrating company is treated as if, immediately before it became a nonresident company, it had paid as a cash dividend to its shareholders, the amount that would be available for distribution if the company had disposed of its property at market value and gone into liquidation.

Section CD 18, which defines dividends on liquidation, has been amended to also apply if an amount is treated as being paid under section FCB 2 to shareholders of a migrating company. Therefore, the amount in excess of the available subscribed capital per share and the available capital distribution amount will be a dividend. In relation to amounts treated as being paid to shareholders that are non-resident related companies, paragraph (c)(ii) of the definition of “dividend” in section OB 1 provides that the amount in excess of available subscribed capital per share will be a dividend.

Under the existing section ME 6(1), a migrating company is entitled at the time of emigration to attach existing imputation credits to distributions made under subpart FCB. Amendments have been made to section ME 6 to allow a migrating company to retrospectively attach imputation credits to a dividend arising under subpart FCB. Tax paid that is attributable to income derived before the migration or to the migration itself (from the deemed disposition of property) will be treated for imputation purposes as being paid immediately before the company ceases to be a New Zealand resident. A migrating company will therefore be able to attach the amount of the imputation credits treated as being available immediately before the company ceased to be New Zealand-resident to a deemed dividend arising under subpart FCB.

The amount that is treated as being paid to a resident shareholder will be resident withholding income to which the RWT rules in subpart NF apply. New section NF 4(6B) provides that a migrating company must pay the RWT deductions to the Commissioner by the date that is three months after its migration. Section 51 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to give the company the same three-month period for providing related information to the Commissioner.

The amount treated as being paid to a non-resident shareholder will be non-resident withholding income to which the non-resident withholding tax rules in subpart NG apply. New section NG 11(4B) provides that a migrating company must pay the NRWT deductions to the Commissioner by the date that is three months after its emigration. Section 49 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to give the company the same three-month period for providing related information to the Commissioner.

New section CD 32(15B) removes the potential for double taxation in the event that a migrating company subsequently pays a dividend to its shareholders. The amount of the dividend a migrating company is treated as having paid to shareholders immediately before the company migrated from New Zealand is added to the company's available subscribed capital that may be returned to shareholders tax-free in certain circumstances.

New section FCB 3(a) provides that a migrating company is treated as disposing of all its property at market value immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident. Accordingly, gains in value of revenue account property will be subject to tax under existing legislation (for example, section CB 3 or CB 4) and excess depreciation deductions will be recovered under existing section EE 41.

New section FCB 3(b) treats the company as re-acquiring the property for the same market value for which it was treated as having been disposed of at the time of migration. This will establish a new cost base for property that will continue to be subject to tax in New Zealand.

Section EE 26, which allows for a 20% depreciation loading on New Zealand-new assets, has been amended to disregard the deemed disposition and reacquisition under section FCB 3. This amendment ensures that a migrating company is still eligible for this 20% loading on its assets, which is the appropriate treatment as actual ownership of the relevant property does not change at the time of migration.

Equivalent amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 1994.

#### Amendments to the dividing withholding payment and conduit rules

New section MG 2(6) provides that a migrating company ceases to be a dividend withholding payment (DWP) account company. New section MG 2(7) provides that the company must furnish a DWP return and pay any further DWP payable under section MG 9.

New section MI 2(8) provides that a migrating company also ceases to be a conduit tax relief company and must furnish an imputation return and, under section MI 10(3), pay DWP of the amount of any credit balance in its conduit tax relief account.

Equivalent amendments have also been made to the Income Tax Act 1994.

**Example: Migration of a New Zealand company**  
  
S Ltd was incorporated in New Zealand in 1995 and issued 140,000 ordinary shares at $2 each to resident shareholders and 60,000 ordinary shares at $2 each to non-resident shareholders (40,000 of those shares are held by related non-resident companies).  
  
The shareholders resolve to transfer S Ltd's place of incorporation and its directorial and managerial functions offshore. S Ltd has a realised capital profit of $150,000 and revenue reserves of $300,000. S Ltd also owns shares held on revenue account in a company that owns commercial rental property in Wellington. The market value of these shares is $500,000. They were purchased for $450,000. S Ltd also owns a New Zealand-registered patent worth $250,000. The cost of the patent was $200,000, and depreciation deductions of $50,000 have been claimed.  
  
S Ltd's imputation credit account has a credit balance of $100,000. [3](#03)
  
  
_Disposal rules_  
  
Under section FCB 3, S Ltd is treated as disposing of all its property at market value immediately before ceasing to be a New Zealand resident.  
  
The taxable amount from the disposal of the patent is $100,000 (market value less cost (reduced by the amount of depreciation already claimed)). [4](#04)
 The taxable amount from the disposal of the shares is $50,000 (market value less cost). [5](#05)
 Under the proposed amendments, S Ltd's tax liability on the deemed disposal of its revenue account property is $49,500, and the tax paid is credited to S Ltd's imputation credit account.  
  
The company that owns the commercial property will remain in New Zealand, and the patent is registered in New Zealand. Therefore, future income derived from the shares and the patent will continue to be subject to New Zealand tax. [6](#06)
 Under section FCB 3, S Ltd will be treated as re-acquiring the shares at $500,000 and the patent at $250,000, which will establish new cost bases for those assets.  
  
_Liquidation rules_  
  
Under section FCB 2, S Ltd is treated as if it had been liquidated and distributed all available amounts (being shareholder funds and the disposal proceeds) to its shareholders immediately before it became a non-resident company.  
  
The total amount deemed to have been distributed by S Ltd to its shareholders is $4.75 per share. [7](#07)
  
  
In calculating the amount of the dividend paid by S Ltd it is first necessary to exclude capital amounts from total funds. For these purposes, capital amounts comprise the amount of available subscribed capital (ASC) per share and, for shareholders that are not related non-resident companies, the available capital distribution amount.  
  
Applying the formulae in the legislation, ASC per share is calculated as $2, and the available capital distribution amount is 75 cents. Therefore, the tax-free capital component of the amount distributed by S Ltd for each share held by a shareholder that is not a related non-resident company is $2.75, and the remaining $2 per share (representing revenue reserves) is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend.  
  
S Ltd may attach imputation credits of 70 cents per share [8](#08)
 to dividends paid to its shareholders.  
  
_Resident shareholders_  
  
The total amount received per share by resident shareholders on S Ltd's migration is $4.75, of which $2.75 (being $2 + $0.75) is tax-free. The remaining $2 per share is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. The attached imputation credits of 70 cents per share can be used to satisfy the shareholder's income tax liability.  
  
S Ltd is required to withhold resident withholding tax (RWT) from the dividends paid to resident shareholders. S Ltd's RWT amount per share is 19 cents. [9](#09)
 S Ltd's total RWT amount is $26,600.[10](#10)
  
  
Under section CD 32(15B), the amount of the distribution treated as a dividend is included in the subscriptions amount that S Ltd could return to shareholders tax-free.  
  
_Non-related non-resident shareholders_  
  
The total amount received per share by non-related non-resident shareholders on S Ltd's migration is $4.75, of which $2.75 (being $2 + $0.75) is tax-free. The remaining $2 per share is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend.  
  
S Ltd is required to withhold NRWT from dividends paid to non-related non-resident shareholders. S Ltd's NRWT amount per share held by these shareholders is 30 cents.[11](#11)
 S Ltd's total NRWT amount in relation to these shareholders is $6,000.[12](#12)
  
  
_Related company non-resident shareholders_  
  
The amount of the dividend to the related non-resident company shareholders subject to NRWT is the amount paid in excess of ASC per share.  
  
The total amount paid to related non-resident company shareholders on S Ltd's migration is $4.75, of which $2 is tax-free. The remaining $2.75 (representing revenue reserves and capital profits) is taxable to the company shareholder as a dividend subject to NRWT. S Ltd's NRWT amount per share held by these shareholders is 41 cents.[13](#13)
 S Ltd's total NRWT amount in relation to these shareholders is $16,400.[14](#14)
  
  
These calculations are summarised in Table 2.

Operational implications of new legislation For a company to migrate, an application by the company for removal from the New Zealand register of companies must be accompanied by written notice from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that the Commissioner has no objection to the company being removed from the New Zealand register. This is as per section 351(c) of the Companies Act 1993.

Inland Revenue's current practice is that a company wanting to migrate will not receive such a notice if the Commissioner cannot be sure that tax debts, that may arise or need to be collected once the company has migrated, will be met.

To mitigate this concern, taxpayers have in the past offered Inland Revenue a letter of guarantee from, for example, a related New Zealand company that has the means to satisfy the migrated company's tax liability, or a bank in other circumstances. With the letter of guarantee in place, Inland Revenue is then able to provide written notice to the Registrar of Companies that the Commissioner has no objection to the migration.

While Inland Revenue's practice will not change with the new legislation there is now a greater likelihood of a tax debt, due to the additional income tax and withholding liabilities arising from this legislation, than was previously the case. Thus, companies should be aware that, on a case by case basis, some form of guarantee may need to be offered to ensure that the Commissioner has no objection to the migration.

Previously, when a notice was given that the Commissioner had no objection to the migration of a company, it had been implicit that such a notice applied only to the company at the date of the notice. The notice did not apply should any other company or companies be subsequently amalgamated into the company.

For clarity in future, Inland Revenue practice will be that, when written notice is given that the Commissioner has no objection to a company being removed from the New Zealand register, the notice will explicitly state that it applies only to the company on the date of the notice and not in the event other companies are amalgamated into it.

Corporate reorganisations not affecting economic ownership
==========================================================

2009 legislation ensures shareholder continuity is preserved for restructuring arrangements that result in no change of economic ownership in a group of companies.

_**Section YC 18B**_

Section YC 18B ensures that shareholder continuity is preserved for certain restructuring arrangements that result in no change of economic ownership in a group of companies. The preservation of shareholder continuity will ensure that no unintended consequences of the continuity rules will arise in respect of imputation credits and losses as a result of the restructuring. The new section was required as the existing concessionary continuity rules do not readily apply to the type of restructuring arrangements contemplated by the new section YC 18B.

### Background

Some Australian banking groups with significant New Zealand operations are considering restructuring to separate their banking business from their other businesses. The restructuring results in the Australian bank replacing its initial parent company with a new company as the listed banking group parent company. This potential restructuring is a direct response to Australian regulatory standards and has the full support of the regulators and the Australian government.

The Income Tax Act 2007 provides general rules to determine the shareholder interests in a company. There are a number of concessionary rules that deal with situations where it is impractical to apply the more detailed general rules. However, this particular type of restructuring falls outside of the requirements of those concessions. This means that the initial parent company and its subsidiaries will not easily be able to carry forward any tax losses and imputation credits they had before restructuring under the existing concessionary rules.

### Key features

Section YC 18B ensures that continuity is preserved for certain restructuring arrangements that result in no change in the economic ownership of a group of companies. The type of restructuring arrangement contemplated by the section is where the initial parent company of the group is replaced by a new parent company but results in no change to the economic ownership of the group of companies as a whole.

The preservation of shareholder continuity will ensure that there are no adverse consequences to the group of companies’ imputation credits, losses and other tax balances which depend on shareholder continuity, as a result of the restructuring.

### Detailed analysis

Section YC 18B ensures that shareholder continuity is preserved for restructuring arrangements that do not result in an economic change of ownership within a group of companies. Shareholder continuity will be preserved for the initial parent, new parent and any interests deemed to be held by the initial parent before the restructuring.

The main criteria for the concession will be that the restructuring will result in no significant change to the ultimate economic ownership of the initial parent and all of its subsidiaries.

Section YC 18B(2) sets out the criteria for the concession:

*   Except for a nominal amount of shares issued to facilitate the restructuring, or where securities law requirements make it impracticable or impossible, the shareholders of the initial parent company will at the start of the restructuring and immediately at the completion of the restructuring, own the same interests in the same proportions in the new parent.
*   The market value of any nominal amount of shares issued to facilitate the restructuring expressed as a percentage of the market value of all the shares in the new parent company is such that it is reasonable to treat the exchanging shareholders as owning all the shares.
*   The restructuring does not result in any return to the shareholders (ignoring any nominal amount of shares issued to facilitate the transaction, and shares in respect of which securities law requirements make it impracticable or impossible), apart from the exchange of shares in the initial parent company for shares in the new parent company.
*   The initial parent company before the restructuring and the new parent company after implementation of the restructuring are limited attribution companies. If the initial parent ceases to be a limited attribution company before the new parent company becomes a limited attribution company this will be ignored.

If the criteria are met, the new parent company effectively steps into the shoes of the initial parent company for the purposes of the shareholder continuity rules. This results in no breach of the shareholder continuity rules as a consequence of the restructuring. As such, the group of companies involved in the restructuring will maintain its ability to use or carry forward any imputation credits, losses or other tax balances which depend on shareholder continuity which it had before the restructuring.

Note that certain “excluded preference shares” are ignored when determining the economic ownership of a group of companies for the purposes of this section. That is, shares that fall within the definition of “excluded preference shares” in subsection YC 18B(5)(b) are ignored when applying the criteria set out in section YC 18B(2).

### Application date

Section YC 18B applies from 1 April 2008.

[Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009](/new-legislation/act-articles/2009-63/taxation "Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009")

Correction of minor errors in subsequent returns
================================================

2009 amendment allows taxpayers who have made minor errors in a return (involving $500 or less in tax) to correct them in a subsequent return.

_**Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

A rule has been introduced to allow taxpayers who have made minor errors in a return (involving $500 or less in tax) to correct them in a subsequent return.

This will help to increase certainty for taxpayers, while reducing their compliance costs and exposure to use-of-money interest and penalties.

### Background

The new rule is largely aimed at helping to reduce compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and individuals, although it will apply to taxpayers generally. It was first outlined in the government discussion document, _Reducing tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises_, released in December 2007. The rule's introduction was subsequently part of a wider package of tax measures aimed at SMEs in 2009.

As SMEs account for over 95% of New Zealand's businesses it is important that the people who operate them can concentrate on the things that will help their businesses. Reducing the number of tax returns, payments and calculations SMEs have to deal with will help to ease the tax burden they currently face, and free-up some of their time and money to focus on strengthening their businesses.

Taxpayers are required to correctly determine the amount of tax payable under tax laws. If an amount is not correctly calculated, or not paid on time, penalties can apply. Use-of-money interest also generally applies if the correct amount of tax is not paid when due.

Errors are generally required to be corrected in the returns in which they arose. This involves, in addition to the penalty and interest implications noted above, further compliance costs for the taxpayer.

By allowing taxpayers to rectify minor errors they have identified in previous returns by including them in current returns, taxpayers and their agents will be provided with a greater level of comfort in making such changes. This will also reduce the number of interactions taxpayers have with Inland Revenue.

### Key features

New section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows taxpayers to correct minor errors made in income tax, fringe benefit tax, or goods and services tax returns, in the next subsequent return after discovering the error(s).

A minor error is defined as an error (or errors) that was caused by a clear mistake, simple oversight, or mistaken understanding on the taxpayer's part and that, for a single return, causes a total reduction in the resulting assessment of tax of $500 or less.

For the purpose of calculating the $500 reduction, errors the taxpayer may have for each income tax, fringe benefit tax, or goods and services tax returns are treated separately.

### Application date

The new rule applies from 7 December 2009.

### Detailed analysis

Under the new rule, when a taxpayer identifies and realises they have made an error or errors caused by a clear mistake, simple oversight or mistaken understanding that results in an underpayment of tax of $500 or less, they no longer need to correct the return in which the mistake arose. Instead, the mistake can be rectified in the next return that is due after the discovery of the error, and the associated tax shortfall caused by the mistake paid along with any tax due from that subsequent return.

In these circumstances the new rule allows the taxpayer to correct the error in this manner. The taxpayer will not be required to specifically notify the Commissioner of the change made.

##### Example

As a result of a computer inputting error, a taxpayer inadvertently omits a taxable fringe benefit provided to an employee in their FBT return for the quarter ended 31 June 2010. This results in an underpayment of FBT of $245 for this return. The taxpayer, upon discovering the error in August 2010, can now include the taxable fringe benefit in the FBT return for the quarter ended 30 September 2010 and pay the associated shortfall along with any tax due from that return.

#### _Excepted situations_

It should be noted that Inland Revenue may review error adjustments when examining taxpayers' records, and may consider limited cases under the compliance and penalties provisions for lack of reasonable care (or more serious penalties if appropriate). An example is if a taxpayer makes a number of habitual adjustments to a number of return periods, or several similar adjustments in varying periods. Such a situation may fall outside the new rule.

Cost of obtaining resource consents held to be capital
======================================================

2015 case note - cost of obtaining resource consents held to be capital by Court of Appeal.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Trustpower Limited

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The Court of Appeal held that expenditure incurred in obtaining resource consents was capital expenditure and was, therefore, not deductible under s DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 ("ITA"). As a result, s EE 7(j) of the ITA did not prevent the resource consents of fixed duration from being "depreciable property" under s EE 6 of the ITA.

### Facts

This case is an appeal by the Commissioner from the High Court judgment of Andrews J in _Trustpower Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (\[2014\] 2 NZLR 502 (HC)).

It concerns whether expenditure incurred by TrustPower Limited ("Trustpower") in applying for and obtaining resource consents in the 2006, 2007 and 2008 income years is deductible. The resource consents were acquired in respect of four possible future new generation projects in the South Island.

Trustpower argued that the expenditure was part of its feasibility costs and was, therefore, deductible as a revenue expense. The Commissioner argued that the expenditure was of a capital nature and was not deductible.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal allowed the Commissioner's appeal on the grounds that the expenditure was capital in nature, so the capital limitation in s DA 2(1) of the ITA applied to disallow a deduction.

#### _Application of subpart EE_

The Commissioner argued that resource consents (except land use consents of unlimited duration) were "depreciable intangible property" under subpart EE of the ITA so that the expenditure incurred for those consents was on capital account.

The Court noted that "property" in subpart EE includes certain consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. It also noted that such consents were listed in Schedule 17 of the ITA and, as such, were "depreciable intangible property". However, the issue was whether, as an item of "depreciable intangible property", the resource consents were "depreciable property" under s EE 6 of the ITA.

The Court rejected Trustpower's argument that the resource consents did not fall under s EE 6 because they were not "used or available for use" in deriving income until Trustpower decided to proceed with the particular project. The Court stated that "available" simply meant "capable of being used".

However, because s EE 7(j) of the ITA provided that if a person is allowed a deduction outside of the depreciation regime then the depreciation regime will not apply, the Court decided that it was necessary to first consider whether a deduction was allowed under the general permission.

This approach was consistent with the scheme and purpose of the legislation and with the Commissioner's acknowledgement that there may be some circumstances in which resource consents would be stock in trade and, therefore, the expenditure incurred in acquiring them would be deductible.

#### _The income/capital distinction_

The Court noted that the correct approach to the distinction between income and capital was well established. It cited several cases by the appellate authority recounting the general factors to be taken into account in deciding whether an item of expenditure was capital or revenue, including _Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation_ ((1946) 72 CLR 634 (HCA)) ("_Hallstroms_"), which the Court said was the starting point, _Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines_ (\[1964\] AC 948 (PC)) ("_Nchanga_") and _BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia_ (\[1966\] AC 224 (PC)) ("_BP Australia_").

The Court emphasised that no rigid test could be applied. Instead, the Court was required to reach a common-sense appreciation of all the guiding features that provide the ultimate answer. It stated the following:

1.  The general principles stated in _Hallstroms_ and _Nchanga_ remained the best guide for distinguishing between income and capital and may well be sufficient for that purpose without resort to the _BP Australia_ factors.
2.  The _BP Australia_ indicia were just that, and were not determinative.
3.  The answer will depend on a close examination of the facts of the particular case and the character of the particular payment to ascertain the nature and purpose or effect of the relevant expenditure.
4.  There needs to be a sufficient relationship or connection between the expenditure or loss and the income or capital as the case may be. It is the object or effect of any given payment that will be determinative.

The Court further noted that the general principles apply equally to the characterisation of expenditure on intangible property. It cited cases in which expenditure incurred in investigating a new source of income was held to be of capital nature (_Re Griffin Coal Mining Co Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation_ \[1990\] FCA 343 and _Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia_ \[1992\] FCA 851). It also stated that the High Court had been wrong to rely on _The Commissioner of Taxation v Ampol Exploration Ltd_ ((1986) 13 FCR 545), which could be distinguished on its facts. The Court then went on to cite several cases in which expenditure incurred in obtaining resource consents and permissions was held to be capital (_ECC Quarries Ltd v Watkis (Inspector of Quarries)_ \[1977\] 1 WLR 1386 (Ch), _Waste Management New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1995) 17 NZTC 12,147 (CA), _Case T53_ (1998) 18 NZTC 8-404 (TRA) and _Milburn New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2001) 20 NZTC 17-017 (HC)).

The Court stated that determining which side of the line the expenditure fell involved an objective analysis of the factual background relating to the nature and purpose or effect of the expenditure, and not a subjective approach based on the views of the witnesses for Trustpower.

On this basis the Court concluded that the disputed expenditure was capital. Its reasons were as follows:

1.  The expenditure was incurred for the purpose of enabling Trustpower to extend or expand its electricity generation business.
2.  The resource consents gave Trustpower valuable rights, which were essential to Trustpower's long-term programme of future capital works, and valuable options.
3.  The High Court finding that the resource consents were not stand-alone assets separate to the projects to which they relate is irrelevant.
4.  The disputed expenditure was not incurred in carrying on Trustpower's business or in earning the income of the existing business or in performing the income-earning operations of the existing business. Trustpower's profit-making enterprise was the generation and retailing of electricity, not the development of its pipeline of possible new projects.
5.  The disputed expenditure was incurred in respect of possible future capital projects, including the resource consents needed to proceed with them.

The Court stated that by obtaining the resource consents, Trustpower invested unequivocally in capacity, whether or not it was committed at that time to proceed with the build. The expenditure on the projects was incurred for the purpose of enabling Trustpower to extend or expand its electricity generation business. That investment was inherently capital in nature and, on balance, there was not a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the deriving of income.

It followed that Trustpower would be entitled to make deductions for the depreciation value of its assets under subpart EE of the ITA, but not under the general permission in s DA 1.

Even though it was not necessary for the determination of the case, for the sake of completeness, the Court went on to assess the _BP Australia_ factors and concluded that it would assess the expenditure as capital in nature having regard also to the principles in that case.

Accordingly, the Court of Appeal confirmed the Commissioner's re-assessments disallowing the respondent's deductions and quashed the order for costs awarded to Trustpower in the High Court. Orders for costs in the High Court and Court of Appeal were also awarded in favour of the Commissioner.

An issue about the classification of expenditure incurred by Trustpower after the dates it was committed to acquiring the resource consents was remitted back to the High Court for determination.

Trustpower has sought leave to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. Until the appeal process is completed, the Commissioner will continue to apply Interpretation Statement IS 08/02.

Costs on a joint and severable basis
====================================

2015 case note – High Court declined respondents' application to apportion costs severally between each respondent - joint, severable, liability, costs.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Muir & Anors

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The High Court declined the respondents' application to depart from r 14.14 of the High Court Rules ("HCR") and to apportion costs severally between each respondent. The High Court held that given the background to the application, and the unified opposition efficiently presented by all the respondents, there is no arguable basis for departing from the default principle under the rule.

### Impact

An application to the High Court to transfer and consolidate multiple tax challenges filed by different taxpayers in the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") may be by a single application. Separate applications for each taxpayer or each tax challenge are not required.

Liability to pay court costs is joint and several unless the Court directs otherwise.

### Facts

The respondents in this matter were investors in the Trinity tax avoidance scheme. In October 2013, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") was granted leave to bring an application for transfer and consolidation of proceedings by way of an originating application under Part 19 of the HCR. This is a costs judgment addressing a submission that the Court should make a costs order, which departs from the usual rule that liability of each of two or more parties ordered to pay costs is joint and several (as per r 14.14 of the HCR).

The Commissioner filed a costs memorandum in November 2013 seeking an order for costs in a sum that had been agreed. Counsel for the Commissioner noted that the respondents had been unable to agree that the liability for costs should be on a joint and several basis.

In a memorandum dated 4 December 2013, counsel for some of the respondents argued that the costs burden should be divided equally amongst the 13 responding parties.

The Commissioner argued that there is no reason for the Court not to apply the default position in r 14.14 of the HCR, of joint and several liability for costs.

GJ Judd QC (on behalf of a number of the respondents) argued that although the Commissioner sought consolidation of proceedings in the application considered by the Court, the Commissioner was not entitled to file a single application without leave of the Court. Furthermore, a separate application should have been made for each challenge to the assessments.

### Decision

Justice Toogood dismissed the argument that costs should be apportioned equally between the respondents. The Court relied on the fact that the proceeding was commenced as a single application against the respondents. The Court further noted that the respondents' claim was a highly technical afterthought and it was in any event far too late to raise it.

The Court stated that the single application was administratively efficient for the Court, and also provided a convenient and cost-saving approach for the parties.

Rule 14.14 of the HCR provides that liability for each of two or more parties ordered to pay costs is joint and several, unless the Court otherwise directs.

The Court further noted that the respondents must have realised this when proceedings were transferred from the TRA to the High Court. The effect of r 14.4 would mean that any liability of the respondents to pay costs would be joint and several unless the Court considered it unjust.

The Court relied on the observations of Lord Neuberger, President of the UK Supreme Court who stated in _Re Nortel GmbH_ \[2013\] UKSC 52, \[2014\] AC 209 at \[89\]:

*   … by becoming party to legal proceedings in this jurisdiction, a person is brought within a system governed by the rules of the court, which carry with them the potential for being rendered legally liable for costs, subject to the discretion of the court.

Given the background of the application, there was no arguable basis for departing from the default principle under r 14.14 and this was consistent with the approach to costs taken by other Courts in related Trinity matters.

Justice Toogood ordered the respondents to pay the Commissioner costs, jointly and severally, on a category 2B basis.
