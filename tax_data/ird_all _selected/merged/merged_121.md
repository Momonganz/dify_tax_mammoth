It provides us with direction and keeps us focused. The six interconnected strands of the strategy are described below. We keep our customers at the centre of everything we do. We are making tax simpler and more seamless so our customers can meet their obligations and receive the payments they are entitled to. Collaboration is at the heart of this. We work with partners in the private sector and across government to ensure Inland Revenue delivers on its purpose. CUSTOMER Putting the customer at the centre of everything we do. PEOPLE Working as part of Inland Revenue is unique, exciting, fulfilling and career enhancing.

INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE Our decisions and actions—for delivering today and shaping our future—are intelligence-led. POLICY AGILITY Policy change is faster, cheaper and better —fit for a changing world. DIGITAL We fully embrace our place in the digitally connected world. What we want to achieve Ko tā mātou e whai nei kia tutuki Inland Revenue plays a critical role in improving the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders We do this by collecting and distributing money—we collect over 80% of the Crown’s revenue and collect and distribute social support payments. We are the principal steward of New Zealand’s revenue system. We play a critical role in maintaining and enhancing the integrity of the tax system by making sure it is clear, consistent and simple. With the Treasury, we provide advice to the Government on tax policy and the social policies we administer. We advise the Government on international tax issues and are involved in the development and implementation of New Zealand’s international tax legislation. 80 % WE COLLECT OVER of the Crown’s revenue 2Annual Report 2019 This logo represents the way that we want to work with our customers to achieve our primary outcome of improving the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders. The strands that form the base of the koru represent our work and the interwoven strands reflect the way we deliver our services through developing strong relationships, resources, knowledge, skills and capability. The larger koru element reflects the environment and the support and guidance that we provide to our customers.

Building on previous releases, policy changes and our earlier organisational design changes, we have fundamentally changed the way in which our revenue system operates. Our revenue system is now operating close to real time. Individual customers experienced the biggest change made to the revenue system in more than 20 years. Our changes enabled us to automatically calculate income tax assessments for almost 2.5 million customers and put around half a billion dollars back into New Zealanders’ pockets. That’s just one of the positive differences we are making. You will find many more throughout our Annual Report. We supported employers to successfully switch to payday filing, working with approximately 200,000 employers before and after April to ensure they and their business systems were ready for this huge change. Receiving employment income information more frequently means we are able to pre-populate individual customers’ accounts. This makes tax and entitlements simpler and more certain for millions of salary and wage earners, and is particularly helpful for our Working for Families customers. In this release, we migrated 19.7 million customer information records into our new system. Migrating all customer information successfully is a huge milestone for our business transformation as we are now operating from a technology platform that is more resilient and agile. This is one of the key benefits of the transformation. We are also demonstrating that the new system will allow us to make policy changes more quickly and effectively. Through business transformation to date, we have released $60 million in administrative savings, reduced effort for small to medium-sized businesses by nine hours a year and improved compliance outcomes, including additional revenue of $90 million.

Working together to transform the revenue system Inland Revenue maintains a strong focus on ensuring that the transformation programme is on track to complete as expected, and to deliver value to our customers and to government. We recognise the important role many different groups play in the revenue system. This year, we have worked even more closely with employers and intermediaries, involving them in co-designing our processes, to ensure that our changes are implemented in the best possible ways. Given the scale and complexity of what Inland Revenue does, there will be times when we fall short of what is expected of us. This year has been no exception. At each point, we have been open and honest, apologised to those affected, reflected on what happened and learned from our actions to improve our services.

Supporting our people We have asked a lot of our staff this year and I’m really proud of the way our people have remained focused on delivering great work to benefit New Zealanders. You can read about our extended support programme, Pou Whirinaki, through which we have been able to successfully help our people to support customers through the most challenging period following this year’s changes.

Transforming ourselves Our transformation is supporting us to create an organisation that collaborates to improve outcomes for customers. This year, we have continued our organisation design programme, building on the changes we made to our customer-facing business groups last year. We are investing in the skills and capabilities of our people to support them to work in new, agile and intelligence-led ways. To truly put our customers at the heart of everything we do, we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive 6Annual Report 2019 workforce where people from all walks of life can achieve their full potential, and one which reflects the communities we serve. Our people currently represent around 130 different ethnicities. This year, we have developed a new organisational approach to how we think about, and work with, Māori as customers and partners. Our Māhutonga approach helps us to have a greater organisational understanding of our te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations. We are using that knowledge to improve outcomes for Māori. We value our relationships with our unions and have recently signed relationship agreements which set out our commitment to working together in positive ways. Te huri i ā mātou anō Kei te tautoko tā mātou huringa i a mātou kia whakatū i tētahi whakahaere ka mahi tahi kia whai hua ake ā mātou kiritaki. I tēnei tau, kua ū tonu mātou ki tā mātou hōtaka whakahoahoa ā-whakahaere, kia whakapakari ake i ngā panonitanga i mahia i tērā tau ki ā mātou rōpū pakihi aronga-kiritaki.

I tēnei tau, kua whakaahua e mātou tētahi aronga ā-whakahaere hou kia rerekē ō mātou whakaaro me ā mātou mahi tahi ki te iwi Māori hei kiritaki, hei hoa mahi tahi. Nā tā mātou whainga Māhutonga mātou i tautoko kia mārama pai ake ai ā mātou kawenga ā-whakahaere i ahu mai i te Tiriti o Waiatangi. Kei te whakamahi mātou i aua mōhiotanga kia puta ai ngā hua ki te iwi Māori. Kei te whakapono mātou i tō mātou hononga ki ngā ūniana, ā, kua waitohua i ngā wā tata nei ētahi whakaaetanga hononga kia whakatau i tā mātou ū kia mahi ngātahi ki a rātou i runga i te tika. The big picture Implementing a transformation programme alongside our core business functions required us to make some priority calls. We have been able to balance those priorities to deliver positive performance results and have maintained good levels of customer satisfaction. We continue to provide strong support to communities in challenging times, being awarded a Distinguished Service Award from Multicultural New Zealand in recognition of our response to members of the community in the aftermath of the Ōtautahi Christchurch attacks. We have taken an active approach to tackling non- compliance, investigating people who deliberately try to avoid their obligations or claim payments they are not entitled to. This work is supported by additional capabilities in our new system and our new analytics platform. In the past year, we identified total tax differences of $985 million where customers did not get things right. We also maintained our focus on the hidden economy, addressing key risks to the integrity of the New Zealand tax system. New Zealand is an attractive place for people to do business and invest. Tax from significant enterprises remains a large portion of our revenue base. With the increasing complexities of globalisation, we actively participate in international solutions to facilitate compliance. We share this work with you in our Annual Report. We take our role as stewards of the tax system seriously. We have continued to develop policy, administrative processes and legislation that protects and sustains the tax system. We have supported the Tax Working Group and Welfare Expert Advisory Group, alongside colleagues from government agencies including the Treasury and the Ministry of Social Development. Te tirohanga whānui Nā te whakarite i tētahi hōtaka huringa i a mātou e aro tonu ana ki ā mātou mahi pakihi matua o ia rā, me āta whiriwhiri i ētahi wā he aha te aronga matua. He pai ngā hua o ā mātou mahi nā ā mātou whakaritenga i ēnei aronga matua, ā, kua mau tonu ki ngā taumata e tika ana i ō ngā kiritaki whakaaro. He kaha tonu tā mātou tautoko i ngā hapori ahakoa ngā aupēhi o te wā. Kua whakawhiwhia mātou ki te Distinguished Service Award i Multicultural New Zealand hei tohu i tā mātou taunaki i ngā tāngata nō te hapori i muri mai i ngā huakitanga i Ōtautahi Christchurch. Kua kaha tā mātou wero atu ki ngāi aro kore mai, ki te mātai i ngā tāngata e turi nei, e karo nei i ngā whakaritenga, ka tono rātou i ngā pūtea e kore rātou e whai pānga atu. Kua tautokona ēnei mahi e ngā āheinga kua puta mai i tā mātou pūnaha hou, i tā mātou pae tātari hou. I te tau kua pāhemo nei, kua kitea e mātou he rerekēnga tāke $985 miriona te katoa, kāore i tika tā te kiritaki mahi mai. Kei te aro nui tonu mātou ki te ōhanga huna, kia aro hoki ki ērā o ngā tūraru ki te 7 tūtahitanga o te pūnaha tāke o Aotearoa whānui. Ko Aotearoa tētahi wāhi whakamanea ki te tangata, pakihi mai, pena pūtea mai. Ko te tāke mai i ngā hinonga whakaharahara tētahi wāhi nui o tā mātou pūtea whiwhi motuhake. I te whīwhiwhi haere o te ao me tōna whakakotahitanga, kei te kaha whai wāhi mātou i ngā rongoā ā-ao kia ngāwari ake te aronga tika mai. Ka whakaatuhia ēnei mahi ki a koutou i tā mātou Pūrongo ā-Tau. Ka ū mārika mātou ki tā mātou mahi hei kaitiaki o te pūnaha tāke. Kua whakawhanake tonu mātou i ngā tikanga here, i ngā tukanga whakahaere, i ngā ture hoki kia tiaki, kia tautīnei tonu i te pūnaha tāke. Kua tautoko mātou i te Tax Working Group me te Welfare Expert Advisory Group, i te taha o ō mātou hoa mahi i ngā ratonga kāwanatanga tae ake ana ki Te Pūtea Matua me Te Manatū Whakahiato Ora. Looking ahead This year we have made huge steps forward in successfully transforming the revenue system, but we are not finished yet. We will continue our transformation to become a world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence — the kind of revenue organisation that all New Zealanders deserve. Tirohanga whakamua I tēnei tau kua nui ake ā mātou kokenga whakamua kia huri pai ai te pūnaha pūtea whiwhi, engari kāore anō kia oti i a mātou. Ka whai tonu mātou i tā mātou huringa kia tū hei whakahaere pūtea whiwhi toa o te ao, i whakanuia whānuitia mō ō matou ratonga, mō tō mātou kounga — te momo whakahaere pūtea whiwhi e tika anō mō Ngāi Aotearoa katoa.

Our highlights Ā mātou mahi whakahirahira 15 16Annual Report 2019 We are operating in a changing environment Kei te mahi mātou i tētahi taiao hurihuri We continually evaluate our operating environment to identify existing and emerging trends, risks and opportunities. This allows us to be responsive and build resilience. It ensures we sustainably and successfully deliver our services and achieve our mission, vision and outcomes. Our deep knowledge of the wider operating environment influences the development of Inland Revenue’s strategic direction. We consider the effects of ongoing change on the New Zealand economy and society, and any potential impacts on our products, services or operations. We focus on eight global drivers of change: EMPOWERED INDIVIDUALS People connecting directly with each other instead of through institutions. MATURING DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM The cloud, social networks, mobile, big data. DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION Ageing populations in many countries and the challenges this poses, along with ethnicity and cultural changes. CLIMATE CHANGE Disruptions through drought, flood or extreme weather events and increases in pests and diseases. DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY Advances in technology that are changing business models and how whole sectors operate. POPULATION GROWTH Global population growth and distribution of people, and increasing competition for food, water, energy and land. POWER SHIFT Global economic power shifts, and effects on trade and the economy. URBANISATION Cities driving economic growth and how urban centres are evolving. Our research and analysis indicate that these drivers of change continue to be the most relevant. We continually check what is likely to drive change in the future. 17 Kirikiriroa Hamilton, New Zealand. 18Annual Report 2019 Our story 2019 Ā mātou kōrero 2019 We have had another busy year, the most significant in our transformation of New Zealand’s revenue system. We took a key step that will allow us to deliver the full value of our transformation in the years ahead. Throughout the year, we continued to ensure we managed the integrity of the revenue system, served customers with differing needs, responded to events in the community and intervened to manage non-compliance. A major milestone We successfully completed the third release of our transformation. Building on the changes that have gone before, we made a fundamental shift to a real-time, customer-centred, agile and intelligence-led revenue system. The changes we have made are already delivering some of the benefits that will flow from our transformation. We supported approximately 200,000 employers to successfully transition to payday filing, ensuring that they were able to meet their new obligations. We introduced automatic refunds and bills for individual customers — the biggest changes to the revenue system for individuals in more than 20 years. The changes are making it easier for people whose income are from salary, wages, dividends or interest to pay and receive the right amounts during the year. Over time, most customers will finish the year without large bills to pay or refunds, as they might have in the past. To support this and other improvements, we delivered the third major rollout of changes to the revenue system (Release 3). Release 3 was far larger and more complex than the first two. We successfully moved every single taxpayer account for income tax and Working for Families into our new tax and revenue technology system, START. All tax products are now in START and we have new online services for customers. We invested in building the knowledge and capability of our people, so they are confident using our information and systems to help our customers meet their obligations and receive their entitlements. We are helping our people adapt to changes in customer needs and the environment we work in, while maintaining our specialist technical knowledge. We expected challenges with a change of this scale Overall, we performed strongly, prioritising our work to put ourselves in the best possible position before the changes under Release 3 went live. We collaborated across the organisation and allocated work differently. Many of our people took on new activities so that our customers were well supported through the change. We made sure we had the right people and skills in the right place at the right time to deliver training, respond to customer queries and clear work on-hand by the go-live in April. This collaborative effort did affect our performance. Because a stronger focus needed to go on some areas than others to deliver Release 3, we did not achieve some of our performance measures. The volume of contacts we received after we went live with the new system made it difficult for us to respond to customers quickly. This affected our customer satisfaction performance measures. Balanced against this, customers' satisfaction with the quality of our services improved from last year. Some issues with the new services did affect our customers, and we had processes in place to deal with these quickly, including working with tax agents. There was confusion with some of our communications with customers. Letters were sent that referred to young children or pensioners as salary and wage earners. When things have not quite gone to plan, our approach has been to acknowledge any problems, fix them, learn from them and make improvements. An unforeseen challenge that we were quickly required to adjust to was in June, when we had to evacuate our building in Te Papaioea Palmerston North because it was declared earthquake prone. As one of our contact centres is located here, this reduced our capacity to answer calls at a critical time. 19 On track to deliver the benefits of transformation Our multi-year business transformation programme remains on track and under budget. Even with two more years of work ahead, we are already delivering benefits. Our systems are now more resilient because our infrastructure is more robust and secure. We can make some policy changes more quickly and cost-effectively than previously as our new systems are configurable. Since transformation began, we have delivered $60 million of administrative savings and $90 million of assessed additional revenue. However, the biggest benefits are those for our customers. The new online services are easy to use and we have seen an increase in the number of customers using them. For the year ended 30 June 2019, 88.8% of returns filed were electronic, an increase of 5.8% since last year. Businesses can interact with us through their software. The majority of employers (98%) are filing digitally, with around 48% of payday returns filed through software. These changes make it easy for customers to do what they need to do, with 80% saying they find it easy to comply. Small to medium-sized businesses say they are spending nine fewer hours a year meeting their tax obligations and that new digital services are making a real difference. Since the first changes were made in early 2017, the value of the time saved by these business owners is $280 million. We continued to serve our customers and the Government We are achieving our outcomes and making the impacts we seek. Performance against our outcome and impact measures has remained steady. We continued to provide customers with timely refunds and social policy payments and collaborated with other government agencies to make it easier for customers. Results from our impact measures show that our customers are using our new services, responding to our communications, and are increasingly using our online services. We achieved 36 out of 48 of our output performance measures and came in under budget, which are considerable achievements in a year of significant change. While we did not achieve all performance measures, we exceeded targets for some core processing activities, including issuing Working for Families and paid parental leave payments, GST returns and assessments for child support. Some measures had higher targets than the previous year. We have kept these goals for next year as we want to keep challenging ourselves. Over time, we expect our performance and customers’ experiences to improve as a result of the transformation. Throughout this year of preparation and change, we continued a range of activities targeted at helping people to meet their tax obligations. This included a focus to reduce the level of new debt, collect it sooner and get unfiled returns filed. We also began a targeted approach to increase the collection of company tax returns not filed by the due date. In 2019, the Tax Working Group and the Welfare Expert Advisory Group released major reports. As the principal steward of New Zealand’s tax system, we provided advice and support to both these groups. We will continue to work on any policy changes that the Government chooses to make based on their recommendations. Looking forward Next year we will implement Release 4 in our transformation, moving student loans and KiwiSaver to new systems and processes. These changes will make it easier for customers to manage their student loans and/or KiwiSaver accounts. We will also improve Working for Families services, implement research and development tax incentives and finish moving content to our new www.ird.govt.nz website. We will launch the second release of Ātea, our new enterprise support services system, which will make it easier for us to do our day-to-day administrative work. Inland Revenue’s support services, policy and organisation- wide tax technical business groups will go through a change process to make sure they are fit for the future. Supporting people through this change process is important. 20Annual Report 2019 Customers know what to do Customers find it easy Customers do what they need to We use intelligence and insight to improve customer outcomes and revenue WE ACHIEVE THIS BY DELIVERING OUR OUTCOMES: THE LONG-TERM RESULTS WE WANT TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE ARE HERE FORWHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE Our Mission We contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money Our Strategy Our long-term approach to creating value and better outcomes for New Zealanders Digital We fully embrace our place in the digitally connected world.

This funding is called an appropriation. Our total funding for 2018–19 was $847.5 million. An appropriation is a parliamentary authorisation for the Government or an Office of Parliament to incur expenses or capital expenditure. Expenditure can only be incurred under an appropriation or other statutory authority. We managed our finances well He pai ā mātou whakahaerenga pūtea In 2018–19, our total spend against our operating appropriations was $828 million. Some transformation activities and the associated funding have been shifted to future years to align with our delivery approach. This allows us to change the way we deliver our services and minimises the impact on our customers. 2018–19 EXPENDITURE AGAINST BUDGET 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Services to Other Agencies Policy AdviceServices for Customers multi-category appropriation Appropriation Expenditure 6 Transformation multi-year appropriation $ million 5 203 11 616 610 10 215 Services for Customers $616m Transformation $215m Services to Other Agencies $6m Policy Advice $11m We were funded through four appropriations in 2018–19 ($ million) 24Annual Report 2019 OPERATING EXPENDITURE FROM 2014–15 TO 2018–19 INCURRED AGAINST OPERATING APPROPRIATIONS 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Services for Customers multi-category appropriation Transformation Policy Advice Services to Other Agencies $ million 2014–15 704 Over the past five years, our total spend has increased by $124 million as we transform our business.

Changes made in 2018–19 were a major milestone. Customers have better online services and will get the information they need to feel certain they are getting things right. We are making it easier for customers Kua ngāwari ake ā mātou mahi mō ā mātou kiritaki 26Annual Report 2019 MAKING IT EASIER Transformation is delivering major changes that are modernising New Zealand’s revenue system and future proofing it for generations to come Customers now have online services for all taxes We implemented the third release of our transformation on 26 April 2019 Information sharing with other agencies helps to improve results for customers and government We automatically issued $392 million in refunds to more than 868,000 New Zealanders 180,000 employers have filed 1.7 million payday returns since April 2019 A law change allows customers to keep tax records in te reo Māori Your refund or tax to pay is worked out for you If you only earn income that is reported to us, you no longer have to do anything at the end of the year We helped implement research and development tax credits We supported the Tax Working Group and Welfare Expert Advisory Group At a glance Hei rarapa noa te reo 27 We are improving services for customers Inland Revenue is making changes that are transforming New Zealand’s revenue system and helping us deliver on our outcomes. Once our transformation is completed, it will be easier for customers to manage their tax obligations and receive their entitlements with speed and certainty. The Government will be able to make policy changes faster and more cost-effectively. ...as we continue our transformation journey We are transforming New Zealand’s revenue system in four stages in a series of five major releases (see the diagram below). We are part way through. The fundamental changes we have made over the last three years have delivered significant value to New Zealanders. Policy and legislative settings have changed. Customers and partners interact with us in a completely different way. Our organisation design and capabilities are organised around customers. Supporting all of this are new systems and processes. While these significant changes have at times put pressure on participants in the revenue system, they are making paying tax and receiving payments simpler and more certain for many New Zealanders. Release 3 of transformation made some major changes The changes we made in April with Release 3 affect all tax-paying New Zealanders and people receiving Working for Families payments, and all employers. The scope and complexity of the changes was significant and included: >migrating income tax and Working for Families to new systems >introducing a new, automatic year-end process so that people who only earn income which is reported to Inland Revenue no longer need to do anything at the end of the tax year >new reporting requirements for payday filing and investment income information >implementing and operating a data and intelligence platform so services are tailored and targeted to customers >replacing our website and revamping digital channels and services >implementing and embedding new tool sets and equipment so we can work differently, including networked teams and more remote working. As a result, more than 868,000 New Zealanders were automatically issued with their tax refunds totalling $392 million as at 30 June 2019. About 180,000 taxpayers received a bill and have until 7 February 2020 to pay it. Release 3 implemented changes to our online services so that customers can now file and pay all their taxes online, including setting up instalment arrangements. The release also enabled Working for Families customers to do a lot more online. While there have been some issues, overall the new systems and processes are working well. Customers are using the new myIR service and accessing it from their mobile devices. From 26 April to the end of June 2019, there were 16.9 million logins, an increase of 90% from the same period in 2018, with more than 500,000 logins on the busiest day. FIGURE 1: WE PLAN TO TRANSFORM NEW ZEALAND’S REVENUE SYSTEM IN FIVE RELEASES Release 1Release 2Release 3Release 4Release 5 Delivered 7 February 2017 Delivered 17 April 2018 Delivered 26 April 2019 Design underway April 2020 Scoping underway April 2021 GSTAIM, AEOI, payday reporting, withholding tax, gaming machine duty, fringe benefit tax Income tax, Working for Families, new year-end process for individuals, investment income reporting KiwiSaver, Student LoansChild Support 28Annual Report 2019 MAKING IT EASIER >Two million customers, including 93,000 small-to-medium and micro businesses, were contacted in the lead-up to Release 3 >3,600 of our people received training in the new systems and processes >92,300 system tests were completed >19.7 million accounts were migrated to our new system, START >records of 100 million transactions were migrated >8.3 million web account logons were updated >more than 1,100 separate tasks were completed to move to START >a core team of 271 people worked over the Easter holiday weekend, with support from a further 50 people as required. As part of Release 3, a number of significant legislative changes were implemented. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act was enacted on 18 March 2019. The Act introduced a new year-end process for individual customers: >Automatic refunds and bills: from 1 April 2019, we automatically issue refunds, or bills for tax to pay of more than $50, to individuals whose only income is from salary, wages and investments. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act was enacted on 29 March 2018. This enabled employment income and investment income reporting changes: >Payday reporting: from 1 April 2019, employers have been required to provide employee information to Inland Revenue every payday. >Investment income: from 1 April 2019, payers of investment income can provide Inland Revenue with detailed recipient information on a more frequent basis if they choose to. This becomes mandatory on 1 April 2020. >More businesses are now required to file electronically: from 1 April 2019, businesses that withheld more than $50,000 of PAYE and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) in the previous tax year are required to file online. To achieve this change: Legislative changes We are already delivering the benefits of transformation Less effort for customers With online services available for all taxes, customers can keep track of everything online. More and more customers are using our online services, with 88.8% of returns filed electronically for the year ending 30 June, an increase of 5.8% over the last year. Individuals can see their personal details and all the income we pre-populate for them in their online account (myIR). Salary and wage earners now automatically get a refund or bill for tax to pay at the end of the year. Businesses can interact with us through their software and all of their information is in one place, in myIR. 98% of employers are filing digitally, with around 48% of payday returns filed through software. A wider range of intermediaries can act on their clients’ behalf, see the same information as their clients, and do everything online that their clients can do. These changes make it easy for customers to do what they need to do, with 80% saying they find it easy to comply. Customers who make charitable donations during the year can upload their receipts to their myIR account at any time. This means they do not need to wait until the end of the tax year. Tax agents will also be able to submit donation claims on behalf of their clients in myIR. Small to medium-sized businesses say they are spending nine fewer hours a year meeting their tax obligations and say new digital services are making a real difference. Since the first changes were made in early 2017, the value of the time saved by these business owners is $280 million. We are working more efficiently to collect and distribute money New analytical capabilities mean we can more easily identify areas that require attention and better prioritise our efforts. This is enabling us to be more responsive in providing support where customers need it and to act more quickly when obligations are being deliberately avoided. Customers can be automatically screened and selected for a targeted, cost-effective intervention based on their compliance profile. Broader, capability-based roles with more decision-making abilities mean that, increasingly, customers only have to talk to one person to get a query resolved. 29 New workplace tools and internal systems and processes are enabling our people to do more for themselves and work more flexibly and efficiently. Since transformation began, we have made savings of $60 million from improved administration. Further efficiencies will follow as a result of increased automation, customers’ uptake of digital services and as the legislative changes implemented as part of Release 3 are embedded. The revenue system is more agile and resilient It is easier for us to make changes and deliver the outcomes policy-makers are looking for as our new systems are configurable. The new infrastructure is more robust and secure, with customer-facing online services available 99.4% of the time. More solutions are being provided as-a-service or off-the- shelf, meaning we can scale up quickly when needed. Greater integration of systems Employers, government agencies, software developers, business partners and service providers are benefiting from modernised information sharing processes and greater integration between their business systems and our systems. Making things simpler and more certain for customers Payday filing benefits all customers Payday filing has been available since 1 April 2018 and became compulsory on 1 April 2019. It means employers and payroll intermediaries send us information on employees’ incomes every payday instead of monthly. This is designed to fit in with an employer’s regular payroll process and is even more seamless when they use an integrated software package. ...the way employers interact with us has changed To meet their payday filing obligations, employers can send information through their software, and upload files or complete an onscreen form in myIR. They can now change any incorrect information through their software or online instead of having to contact us. Employers only need to include new or changed information as the information we hold is pre-populated. They are also able to pay their deductions each payday. New employers, employers with small payrolls and those with an exemption can still file paper forms. Over time, payday filing will better integrate the tax system into businesses’ processes. This will save employers time by helping to ensure that tax is a by-product of their normal operations. ...there are many benefits to payday filing Receiving information more frequently allows us to proactively monitor customers’ circumstances during the year. This has many benefits. For example, we will suggest a tailored tax code to customers who have more than one job to help them pay the right amount of tax as they get paid. Working for Families payments will be adjusted more quickly as customers’ circumstances change. Customers who are not contributing to their KiwiSaver funds will be able to be identified more quickly. ...we supported employers through the changes Payday filing is one of the biggest changes to the PAYE system since it was introduced in 1958 and was a significant change for employers. We supported them to make the change successfully. Through 2018 and early 2019, employers were supported through several direct marketing campaigns. We ran approximately 500 seminars, made hundreds of visits, emailed, wrote to or phoned employers — sometimes all three — and made a lot of information available on our website and in our offices. Advertising helped to build awareness and let them know what they needed to do and when. To let employers and intermediaries know about their payday filing obligations: >we visited hundreds of large businesses, industry associations and community associations, and more than 1,800 tax agents >we contacted approximately 93,000 small to medium- sized businesses and micro-businesses >we produced webinars, ‘how to’ videos and step-by- step guides. Over 4,000 tax agents and bookkeepers attended webinars and more than 2,200 tax agents and bookkeepers attended 180 seminars. 30Annual Report 2019 MAKING IT EASIER Between 20 May and 30 June 2019, we automatically issued income tax assessments to around two million customers. The assessments advised customers whether more information was required or if they had a tax refund or bill to pay for the previous tax year. Over this eight-week period, we automatically issued refunds or bills to pay to approximately 1.6 million people. Around: >868,000 people were issued with refunds totalling $392 million >118,000 customers had very small refunds (less than $1) held on their account to be paid out once the refund amount is greater than $1 >180,000 bills for tax to pay were issued totalling $70 million >431,000 bills for tax to pay were written off as they were under $50. A further 356,000 customers have been asked to provide more information so that their assessment can be finalised. Our changes mean customers will receive faster refunds ...98% of employers are filing electronically We surveyed approximately 6,000 employers from mid-April to May 2019. Overall, they found payday filing more difficult the first time they did it, with 80% saying they found it easy after that. Employers using software found it easiest. By the end of February 2019, approximately 41,000 employers had chosen to start payday filing prior to it becoming compulsory on 1 April 2019. All these employers used software or myIR to file during this time. During March 2019, approximately 30,000 employers enrolled to ensure they were ready. As at 30 June, approximately 180,000 employers have filed 1.7 million payday returns since 1 April 2019. 98% of employers are filing digitally, with around 48% of payday returns filed through software. Many employers successfully transitioned and thought that they spent less time on providing information through using payroll software. They find the various systems easy to use. Some smaller businesses with more manual payroll processes found the changes challenging—particularly finding what information needed to be filed and when. They also reported that the changes were time- consuming and meant extra effort was needed. We continue to support these employers by providing how to guides and support. Working for Families customers now have enhanced online services Online services for Working for Families customers have been significantly enhanced. Customers can now apply for a myIR account at the same time as applying for Working for Families Tax Credits and give a partner access to their myIR account. Information is pre-populated as much as possible, including income and employment details for the customer and their partner. New customers can register online and all customers can update any change in circumstance through myIR. Payday filing will also give Inland Revenue more timely and up-to-date income information for many families. We can help customers to update their income estimates during the year. Some financial institutions are providing investment income information From 1 April 2019, banks and financial institutions have been able to voluntarily provide investment income information. This will become mandatory from 1 April 2020. We are working with financial institutions to make sure this goes smoothly. Over time, we will receive more timely and more detailed investment income data. Receiving this will allow us to pre-populate tax returns with investment income information, reducing the effort required by customers. For individual customers, it is simpler to pay and receive the right amount Legislative changes to the collection of employment and investment income information mean that for the 2018–19 tax year, most people who earn salary and wages, or interest from a financial institution, will be able to see it in their account in myIR. From 2020–21, these customers will be able to see a full year of pre-populated income information for all their relevant income. The changes mean people whose incomes are from salary, wages, dividends or interest do not need to do anything to pay the right amount of tax. The system will work it out for them, and most customers will finish the year without large bills to pay or refunds. This means we can quickly identify inconsistencies and errors, and work with customers to help them get things right before the amounts involved get too big. Helping customers get it right during the year also means less errors for employers to deal with. 31 We let our customers know about changes to tax From November 2018 to July 2019, we advertised and sent 5.7 million emails and 2.1 million letters to customers. We let customers know about the new tax refund process and what to expect between May and July. We encouraged them to update their details, resulting in over 504,000 bank account details being updated in myIR and over 1.77 million visits to www.changingforyou.ird.govt.nz START allows us to store a person’s income information in one place, which makes it easier for us to associate Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) income information with individual customers. PIEs are entities such as superannuation funds that invest contributions from their investors. After Release 3, we learned that a lot of people were unaware they were on the wrong prescribed investor rate (PIR). A PIR is the rate used to work out tax on income earned from investments in PIEs. We estimate that approximately 950,000 people are on a PIR that is too high, which means they have overpaid tax by approximately $42 million for the year ended 31 March 2019. The average amount of overpaid tax is $44. Under current legislation these overpayments cannot be refunded. We estimate that approximately 550,000 people are on a PIR that is too low and have underpaid their tax by between $45 million and $50 million for the year ended 31 March 2019. The average amount owing is between $82 and $91. We can now identify people using an incorrect PIR and suggest a more appropriate rate so that they pay the right amount of tax. Prescribed investor rates % Pou Whirinaki — how we supported our customers and our people after go-live Implementing Release 3 meant we needed to close our systems for a week. This included all our contact centres, parts of our website and our customer service counters. Every single taxpayer account for income tax and Working for Families was migrated from our existing system to our new system, START. We reopened as planned on 26 April 2019. Building on what we learned from previous releases, the size and scale of Release 3 meant we needed to provide a different level of support after the system went live. We put in place an extended support period, Pou Whirinaki, during which issues identified by customers or our people were quickly prioritised and resolved. We faced some challenges after go-live Because many customers have not had any contact with Inland Revenue for some time, we expected they would contact us for advice or reassurance after go-live. We received 41% of all calls for the year between April and June 2019. This is over 1.6 million calls compared to 1.4 million for the same period last year. Our capacity to answer calls was reduced by approximately 10% in June when we unexpectedly had to evacuate our building in Te Papaioea Palmerston North because it was found to be earthquake prone. Some of our contact centre people are located in Te Papaioea Palmerston North. Our priority was to ensure their safety. We received feedback from customers that they were frustrated with delays in their calls being answered, issues they had when registering and logging into myIR, changes to Working for Families payment dates and issues submitting donation tax credit receipts online. Some customers who could not get through on the phone visited our offices. Our Manukau office had more than 1,000 customer visits on some days. We extended our office hours in anticipation of the high level of customer demand following go-live. 32Annual Report 2019 MAKING IT EASIER Supporting our customers In the lead-up to Release 3, our top priority was to support customers, reduce any impacts on them and ensure go-live went as smoothly as possible. More than1,500 people from across Inland Revenue worked on customer correspondence and processing to ensure it was as up to date as possible before go-live. We also reduced our target times significantly. After go-live, when we knew demand would be high and many of our customers were likely to contact us, we prioritised supporting customers and our people as they became familiar with the new system and processes. We extended opening hours at 14 of our sites and asked an extra 743 of our people to help meet demand in our contact centres. Our standard time targets Targets preparing for Release 3 Targets in the week leading up to go-live Respond to customer emails and letters 5 days2 days1 day Action income tax account reviews 20 days10 days6 days Action income tax assessment reviews 20 days2 days2 days Process child support applications 85% within 10 days2 days2 days Process family support applications 85% within 10 days2 days2 days We worked with tax agents to resolve issues Since go-live we have continued to work closely with the tax agent community to address things that are making it more difficult or time consuming for them. A dedicated team has worked with tax professional bodies to identify and agreed the top priorities for resolution. We provided help through our account managers, our contact centres, new website pages for our tax agents and our engagement with professional bodies. We are using these channels to get insights from tax agents so that we can put quick fixes in place for them where appropriate. With Release 3 changes affecting all New Zealand taxpayers, use of the myIR service increased significantly, with most logins taking less than two seconds. Initially, there were some issues with how balances displayed in myIR, which were quickly adjusted based on customer feedback. We now realise that some of our communications after Release 3 could have been clearer. For example, superannuitants were referred to as salary and wage earners and we sent some letters and notices to children under the age of 17. These letters also referred to the children as salary and wage earners, which caused confusion. FIGURE 2: TARGET TIMES FOR PRIORITY WORK 33 We helped customers in times of need We were recognised for our response to the Ōtautahi Christchurch terror attacks We were awarded a Distinguished Service Award from Multicultural New Zealand at its Annual Community Awards Gala, in recognition of our response to members of the community in the aftermath of the Ōtautahi Christchurch terror attacks. The awards recognise individuals and organisations who have made a positive impact on New Zealand's ethnic migrant and refugee communities. Some of the actions we put in place to support our customers included: >setting up a dedicated 0800 number to make sure we were easily accessible to affected customers, and dedicated liaison officers for victims and families >making sure all contact with our customers was carefully considered, and suspending all proactive compliance and enforcement activity around the Canterbury region for two weeks. We supported the community during the Nelson fires We supported the emergency response to the Pigeon Valley wildfire in February 2019. Five of our people assisted the Nelson-Tasman Civil Defence Emergency Management team in keeping track of people affected and evacuated from their homes. We also worked at the Whakatū Marae, which was a Civil Defence evacuation centre. Our Community Compliance people worked with other agencies to identify what support could be provided to the community during and after this event. We also allowed late deposits to, and early refunds from, the income equalisation scheme. The scheme allows people to deposit income from farming, fishing or forestry with us. This was also available to customers affected by the droughts in Tasman, Marlborough, Buller and Nelson. Honouring commitments to te Tiriti o Waitangi In 1995, a Waitangi Tribunal claim (WAI477) was made against Inland Revenue. The claim sought a change to legislation to remove the requirement to ask the Commissioner’s permission to keep tax records in te reo Māori. The Inland Revenue Acts allowed the Commissioner to exercise discretion and permit tax records to be kept in other languages, but on request. The primary contention in the WAI477 claim was that te reo Māori is an official language and people should not have to seek permission to keep records in te reo Māori. The Inland Revenue Acts were also out of step with the intent of the Te Ture mō Te Reo Māori Act 2016 and other similar legislation that require accounting documents to be held. Amendments made by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill allow, from 26 June 2019, tax records to be kept in either English or te reo Māori on the condition that the English terms used in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Act 1985 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 are still used to support communications between taxpayers, such as on tax invoices or donation receipts. We work with others across government One of our outcomes is that New Zealanders benefit economically and socially through Inland Revenue working collaboratively across our external environment. Over the year, we worked with a number of organisations to improve public services and to contribute to the Government’s goals. We are the principal steward of New Zealand’s tax system We play a crucial role in maintaining and enhancing the integrity of the tax system by making sure the system is clear, consistent and simple. With the Treasury, we develop policy and administer legislation for products including income tax and GST, Working for Families, child support, KiwiSaver and student loans. We are focused on taking a proactive, collaborative approach to the monitoring and care of the legislation, systems and products that we administer. 34Annual Report 2019 MAKING IT EASIER We supported the Government by providing policy advice The policy advice we provide is critical to making sure that the tax and social policy systems operate as intended. Our work is guided by the Tax Policy Work Programme that sets out what we will focus on, and which is agreed with Ministers. In 2018–19 we supported the enactment of the following Bills: >Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters), enacted on 18 March 2019 >Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits), enacted on 7 May 2019 >Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters), enacted on 26 June 2019. Research and development tax credits In October 2017, the Government announced its intention to introduce a research and development tax incentive in the form of a tax credit. The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill was enacted on 7 May 2019. We worked with Callaghan Innovation and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to design and deliver the tax credits. Businesses are able to claim tax credits from 1 April 2019. Tax Working Group Treasury and Inland Revenue created a cross-agency team that provided a significant amount of advice and support for the Tax Working Group. Specifically, over 100 advice papers were produced for the Group. The papers covered topics the Group wished to consider for its interim report in September 2018 and final report in January 2019. In some instances, this involved collaboration with other agencies such as Ministry for the Environment for environmental taxes. The papers are available online at: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/key-documents Before the publication of the Tax Working Group’s final report, and in the months afterwards, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials also provided advice to the Government as it considered the Group’s recommendations. This advice can be found at: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2019-ir-tax- working-group/overview Welfare Expert Advisory Group We provided information, advice and support to the Welfare Expert Advisory Group, which made recommendations to the Government about the reform of New Zealand’s social welfare system. Papers that were prepared for the Group are available online at: http://weag.govt.nz/weag-report/background-papers/ The Group’s report was released in May 2019 and recommended wide-ranging changes to the welfare system. Some of the changes refer to our role in reporting information, debt collection and payment of child support and tax credits. Our contribution to All-of-Government priorities Alignment with the Government’s economic strategy The Tax Policy Work Programme for 2019–20 was designed to support the Government’s economic strategy. For instance, topics that will be worked on include land, business tax, infrastructure, information collection and use, social policy, the environment and international taxation. These will support the Government’s objectives to support: >productive investment and innovative industries >long-term sustainability and productivity >the transformation of institutions and regulatory systems >a skilled and inclusive society >a sustainable economy in the context of international connections. Sometimes provisions in the Inland Revenue Acts seem to contain errors, do not achieve their intended purpose, are inconsistent with other provisions or are ambiguous. From 26 June 2019, the Minister of Revenue or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can suspend or modify a section of an Inland Revenue Act for a limited time. Modifications are aimed at helping customers comply with their tax obligations or ensuring that the law has the intended effect while a formal amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 is made. New legislative modification powers 35 We responded to customers’ feedback on applying for Best Start Best Start is a weekly payment of $60 per child, available to eligible parents who have a baby due on or after 1 July 2018. Initially, around 17% of eligible customers were not applying for Best Start. Taking feedback from customers into account, we worked with the Department of Internal Affairs to improve the content on the SmartStart website to make it clear that Best Start is a universal payment in the first year. We also simplified the application form, making it easier for people to apply. More information on Best Start can be found on page 75. Better understanding Māori customers and their needs We recognise our responsibility under te Tiriti o Waitangi to work in partnership with Māori and provide services in ways that suit their needs. This year, we created a Māori Economy Network to help us understand and focus on the needs of our Māori customers. Different parts of our organisation have come together to learn more about our Māori customers and how to better design and provide services for them. We are also working with other agencies such as Te Arawhiti (the Office for Māori Crown Relations) and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. We did some initial research and learned about Māori views of the economy and what issues Māori customers face. This research took a kaupapa Māori approach that is informed by tikanga Māori. Through listening to our customers, we were able to recognise knowledge gaps and the need to look at how we interact with Māori individuals, whānau and Māori business. In February we had a stall at Te Matatini, the largest Kapa Haka festival in the world. Held in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, Te Matatini was attended by more than 60,000 people over four days. We were there to promote Release 3 of our transformation programme. We also supported Te Mita Tini, a strategy promoting the use and normalisation of te reo Māori. Stallholders worked together to create a reo rua (bilingual) experience at the festival. While we met people from around the world and throughout New Zealand, the biggest value was in strengthening our local networks in Te Whanganui- a-Tara. A member of the Te Whanganui-a-Tara Māori Cultural Network, a sponsor of the festival, thanked us for being there and supporting Māori culture because, ’It was not about taxes but being seen and making ourselves available for face-to-face conversations’. Te Matatini 36Annual Report 2019 MAKING IT EASIER We are sharing information with other agencies Under our Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), we share information to help administer social benefit and superannuation programmes. This year, we continued to work with MSD to improve services including: >simplifying the child support application process for MSD customers (see the case study on page 79) and ensuring the information sharing agreement is aligned with our Families Strategy and Government Outcomes >prototyping new ways of working together to make it easier for customers who have debt with both agencies >developing information sharing processes to make it easy for refugees who have newly settled in New Zealand to get IRD numbers. In 2018–19, we continued to get good results from AISAs that are already in place: >Our proactive sharing with MSD identified an estimated $42.8 million in benefit overpayments and arrears. >Information we shared with the Ministry of Justice enabled collection of more than $6.9 million in overdue fines. >We shared information three times in response to four requests for information from WorkSafe New Zealand and 58 times in response to 60 requests from the Labour Inspectorate in the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. This is helping these agencies to investigate breaches in workplace legislation. More information on the results of some of our other AISAs is available on pages 176 to 181. New information sharing agreements are in place An AISA with New Zealand Police and 10 other agencies came into effect in January 2019. It helps facilitate information sharing in the Gang Intelligence Centre to help reduce the harm caused by gangs. We completed new agreements with the Department of Internal Affairs and New Zealand Police for sharing information from the Foreign Trust Register to enforce compliance with anti-money-laundering laws. The year ahead Ko te tau kei te heke mai >We are planning for Release 4 of our transformation programme to go live in April 2020. It will include: >moving student loans and KiwiSaver products and the end-to-end processing of employer obligations (PAYE) into START >implementing a number of income tax and Working for Families enhancements >making changes to our digital services, giving customers more self-service options and a better experience in e-services. >A new short process rulings service will be available from 1 October 2019. This service will provide more certainty for any individual or business with an annual gross income below $20 million and a question involving tax below $1 million. Customers will be able to apply, pay and track progress online. >A memorandum of understanding for us to share information with Veterans’ Affairs will be completed in 2019–20, making it easier for injured veterans to get financial support. It will be the first agreement entered into following changes made in April 2019 to the Tax Administration Act 1994 that allow us to share information with customer consent. >We will provide advice to Ministers to support the Government’s response to the Tax Working Group recommendations and contribute to the Government’s welfare overhaul work programme. Paying tax helps pay for the public services we all rely on, like education, roads and healthcare. One of our responsibilities is to make sure government has funding for these essential services. We do this by helping our customers to get it right from the start, taking fast and fair action when they do not meet their obligations by themselves, and managing overdue debt. We encourage customers to get it right themselves by providing easy access to information, support and tools. Sometimes people do not meet their obligations or receive the right entitlements. We take an intelligence-led approach to focus our efforts in areas where we know people are more likely to get it wrong or where people knowingly do not pay the right amount of tax. Helping people meet their obligations Kia āwhinatia te tangata kia oti pai i āna herenga 38Annual Report 2019 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS At a glance Hei rarapa noa Our new technology gives us improved analytical abilities We identified $985 million in tax position differences Child support debt has reduced by $50 million We completed our first exchange of information with other tax agencies We assessed additional tax revenue of $109 million in property compliance 39 Helping people meet their obligations It is important for our customers to pay their taxes and get the correct entitlements. As we transform, we are changing how we work with customers. We make paying tax simpler and give people more certainty around their obligations. We know most customers want to get it right, and we want to help them get it right from the start, rather than correcting them when they get it wrong. Understanding our customers lets us tailor our services and our information. Over their lifetimes, our customers may experience life and business events that may affect their finances. This can mean they need to have different types of interactions with us. By thinking about these different needs, we can give them the support they need in challenging times. We use the compliance model in figure 3 to help understand customers’ behaviour. It has principles to help us tailor our activities to encourage customers to want to get it right themselves. FIGURE 3: OUR COMPLIANCE MODEL Reducing debt and unfiled returns Working with customers to prevent debt and overdue returns We take a proactive approach to help customers to file and pay on time. This helps them get it right from the start and prevents them getting into debt and having penalties and interest added to what they owe. We contact customers through a variety of channels. We may call, text, email or meet people in person. We also give priority to returns with social policy elements so we can accurately work out these entitlements. Since Release 3, customers who meet some criteria have been able to set up their own instalment arrangements for all taxes and Working for Families to pay what they owe. Customers using instalment arrangements they set up themselves are more likely to meet their obligations compared to those we set up arrangements for. This year, 85.2% of people filed their returns on time, similar to last year, and 86.8% of people paid on time against a target of 85%. For more information on our performance, refer to pages 70 to 98. OUR MODEL FOR facilitating compliance Customer centred: Customers are at the centre of our thinking surrounded by context that affects their b ehaviour. Behaviour wheel: we consider the three factors that form customer behaviour so we can tailor our approaches to facilitate compliance. Principles wheel: five key principles guide how we work with customers to build compliance. We apply a mix of these in different ways, depending on our role and the customers we work with. Activity wheel: whatever our job in IR, we have a role in making sure people pay the taxes and get the entitlements they should. We use different activities to facilitate compliance depending on our customers. E D U C A T E D E S I G N L E G IS L A T E C O L L A B O R A T E A N A L Y S E S E R V I C E E N F O R C E Make it easy to comply and difficult not to C A P A B I L I T Y M O T I V A T I O N O P P O R T U N I T Y Understand and involve the customer and stakeholders CUSTOMER Build compliance right from the start Influence norms Provide certainty The movable wheels show we use a range of approaches that change depending on our customers. The more we understand customer needs and behaviours, the better we can tailor our actions so people pay the taxes and get the entitlements they should. 40Annual Report 2019 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS Managing returns not filed by the due date Two important dates in the tax year are 7 February and 7 April. They are key payment dates for customers with bills for their income tax, Working for Families Tax Credits or student loans. Between July 2018 and April 2019, we focused on IR3 individual tax returns not filed by the due dates. In 2018–19, we finalised 885,265 unfiled returns. At the end of June 2019, we had 833,006 returns remaining unfiled after the due date, a 10.3% increase from last year. This growth is influenced by returns that were due in previous tax years that have not been filed. This year, we used predictive modelling, which applies statistical techniques to predict future behaviour, to gain insights that allowed us to focus on higher-value returns, although the total number of returns finalised was lower than last year. Budget-funded initiatives to reduce unfiled returns have been very successful. Funding from Budgets 2012, 2014 and 2015 for the collection of returns not filed by the due date has helped us achieve additional assessments to date since 2012 totalling $1,030 million. In November 2018, we began a targeted approach to increase the collection of unfiled company tax returns as well as the returns of associated shareholders. The initiative has resulted in $43.2 million of assessed revenue against a target of $43.4 million in 2018–19. We are on track to achieve our cumulative target of $239 million by 2022. Refer to page 93 in How we performed for more details. Focusing on tax debt At 30 June 2019, our tax debt, excluding student loans and child support, was $3.5 billion, up from $3.1 billion at 30 June 2018. We wrote off $532.6 million of overdue debt in 2018–19. This compares to $613 million written off in 2017–18. Tax debt is written off for a number of reasons, including (but not limited to) serious hardship, bankruptcy, liquidation and the cost of collecting the debt. The increase in overall debt has been caused by a range of factors including late filing penalties and late payment penalties, interest and default assessments. In preparation for each major transformation release, we also focus on specific areas of debt to make conversion from our old system into START manageable. Before Release 3, we focused on reducing the amount of debt for income tax and Working for Families so that conversion into START was as successful as possible. As a result, income tax and Working for Families debt reduced in 2018-19. This had an effect on debt in several other tax types. For example, where a customer had a payment arrangement for PAYE/KiwiSaver or GST as well as income tax leading up to April 2019, we applied many instalment payments received to that customer's income tax and/or Working for Families debt first. As a result, there has been growth in debt for other tax types. 20152016201720182019Change since 2018 Working for Families Tax Credits334.8 224.6193.4140.1128.8(8%) GST1,527.5 1,387.0825.6814.91,180.645% Income tax 2,653.0 2,568.51,556.21,651.31,609.8(3%) KiwiSaver29.4 24.926.542.451.221% Other tax115.9 69.780.079.885.07% PAY E492.4 428.9309.7374.9465.924% Total debt5,153.0 4,703.62,991.33,103.43,521.313% TABLE 1: TAX DEBT AS AT 30 JUNE ($ MILLION) 41 Child support Helping child support customers meet their obligations We help parents to pay child support on time by contacting them early, talking to them when they are first assessed and sending a reminder text for their first due date. We worked with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to make our child support application form shorter and more customer-friendly. More detail is provided on this in the How we performed section on page 79, along with information on our pilot of a new engagement approach for new child support customers. Permanent exemptions under the Child Support Act The Child Support Act was amended in June 2019 to assist victims of a sex offence who have, as a result of the offence, conceived a child who they may be liable to pay child support for. This normally happens when the child is placed in the care of a third party who then applies for child support from the parents. The law now allows us to consider a wider range of information when considering an exemption, and it no longer requires a conviction for the offence. Faster payments for child support customers We implemented an option for customers who receive child support payments to be paid their entitlements by the 23rd of the month, rather than waiting until the 7th of the following month. This has proven popular, with around 5,200 of our customers opting to get their payments earlier. Managing child support debt At 30 June 2019, child support debt was $2.2 billion, a reduction of 2.3% from this time last year. If a parent falls into debt, early intervention is a priority. We will try to contact the parent as soon as possible after their payment is missed. We set up regular repayments with parents who cannot pay the full amount. We can reduce or write off penalties for parents who work with us to make payments. We wrote off $244 million in 2018–19 to help parents to get on top of their payments for child support. This trend is down from the $594 million written off in 2017–18, but will increase again in 2020 and 2021 as we focus more on resolving historical debt cases to minimise the impacts of converting data to go into our new system, START. With our continued focus on addressing debt early, the total value of new debt cases has reduced by 5.5% from July 2018 to June 2019. The value of new debt cases for parents who live overseas reduced by 17% in this same period.

To date, these have resulted in lump sums totalling $11,000 and one continuing arrangement. >Fourteen summonses for examination of financial means were granted. >Twenty charging orders against property and warrants to seize property were granted by the courts. Finding overseas parents who owe child support About 15,700 parents with a child support debt live overseas, with 11,520 in Australia. Under a reciprocal agreement, New Zealand collects child support for Australia and vice versa. We received $46.4 million from Australia in 2018–19 compared to $51 million last year. We sent $14.7 million to Australia this year compared to $14.6 million in 2017–18. Working with the New Zealand Customs Service means we can match people entering or leaving New Zealand who have not made arrangements to pay their child support debt. In 2018–19, there were 10,259 matches made compared to 11,947 in the prior year. We have a passport information-sharing programme with the Department of Internal Affairs. This resulted in 1,409 contact records matched for parents who had a child support debt in 2018–19 and 669 successful contacts. These contacts resulted in 120 customers making payments totalling $234,541. 42Annual Report 2019 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS Exchanging information with the Australian Taxation Office Student loan customers living overseas make up 15% of the total student loan population, but owe 91% of the total overdue debt. About 70% of all overseas-based customers with overdue repayments are based in Australia. We have an information- sharing agreement with the Australian Taxation Office, which continues to identify those customers who have had no contact with us for several years. In 2018–19, we sent records for 149,031 customers for matching. Of these, a form of contact information was found for 81,875 customers. We work with these customers to get payment in full or repayment over time. Collecting student loan repayments and managing debt As at 30 June 2019, overdue student loan debt was $1.48 billion. This is a 12.1% increase from the previous year, driven by overseas-based customers. Overseas-based customers’ overdue debt continues to grow due to interest on overall loan balances and late payment interest charges. We continue to contact defaulting overseas-based customers to negotiate repayment and let them know what their obligations are. New Zealand-based customers’ overdue debt is also increasing. This increase is driven by overseas-based customers who return to New Zealand with overdue debt. When these customers remain in New Zealand for more than 183 days, their overdue amount is recorded as New Zealand-based. Arrest warrants In 2018–19, we sought two arrest warrants for unpaid student loan default. Both warrants resulted in the customer being arrested. Each arrest resulted in a lump sum payment or instalment arrangement. We negotiate payment amounts or arrangements with the customer based on their personal and financial circumstances. Student loans Helping student loan customers meet their obligations We jointly administer the student loan scheme with the Ministries of Education and Social Development. We are responsible for collecting student loan repayments and making sure customers meet their repayment obligations. Customers can make payments through their PAYE deductions or directly to us. As at 30 June 2019, we had: • 708,518 student loan customers • collected $1.37 billion in repayments during the year, up 1.7% from last year. Of the total repayments, $996.2 million came through PAYE, up 3.7% from last year, and $374.5 million directly from customers, down 3.3% from last year. During the year, student loan repayments increased by 1.7% ($22.6 million) compared to 2017–18. Repayments from New Zealand-based customers via their employers were up by 3.7% ($35.5 million) and direct repayments from New Zealand-based customers increased by 1.3% ($2.1 million). Repayments directly from overseas-based customers were 6.8% down ($15.0 million) compared to last year. TABLE 3: OVERSEAS–BASED CUSTOMER NET REPAYMENTS ($ MILLION) 2014–152015–162016–172017–182018–19 184.7 216.1214.8221.3206.3 Throughout September and March when repayments were due, we sent specific emails and texts to customers based on their previous payment history. This approach will continue next year. A representative control group is used to measure the effectiveness of these communications. We saw good results from the campaign in September 2018: >44.8% of customers who received our messages made a repayment compared to 36.0% of the control group >average repayments from customers who received the messages were 22% higher than the control group >5% more student loan customers living overseas made repayments than in the same period last year, with payments from these customers increasing to $35.9 million from $32.7 million. 43 Our investigations activity plays an important part in protecting the integrity of the tax system and is one of the ways we address non-compliant activities. When customers take a tax position, sometimes our investigations find they have not got things right. When this happens, we issue a new assessment and may charge penalties and interest. By using intelligence-led insight and analysis and managing our investigations well, we provide assurance to New Zealanders that we will take appropriate action to address non-compliant activities. For 2018–19, our overall return on investment for our investigations activity was $7.54:$1 against the performance measure target of $7.00:$1. We identified $985 million in tax position differences this year and closed 12,305 cases. Our Budget-funded initiatives contributed $200.4 million to the total tax differences identified. These initiatives focus on additional investigations into complex technical issues, property compliance, fraud and the hidden economy. For more information on our performance for the year, refer to page 94. New analytical capabilities help get it right from the start Release 3 moved income tax and donation tax credits into our new system, START, which has analytical capabilities. Our new technologies enable us to: >review 100% of the returns we have received and identify potentially inaccurate information including customers on incorrect tax codes. This helped us find that many customers were on the wrong Prescribed Investor Rate for their income from Portfolio Investment Entities. Refer to page 31 for more information on this. >stop assessments and refunds where there is a high likelihood they are wrong or fraudulent. These new processes and systems have helped us to identify customers who do not meet their obligations—either deliberately or through genuine mistakes. Our new technology has stopped a large number of returns where customers had claimed false non-business expenses or manipulated their income. More sophisticated analytical capabilities let us identify errors earlier and tailor our approach to customers. We can track customers’ movements through myIR, and alerts are built in to let us know when anyone is trying to do anything untoward. How we respond depends on what we find. For example, in early June 2019, we were able to quickly shut down a scam where bank accounts appeared to have been misused to create fraudulent transactions. We continue to investigate people who deliberately try to avoid their obligations or claim payments to which they are not entitled. Our work also includes identifying ineligible and potentially fraudulent refunds and claims, as well as attempts to inappropriately access entitlements. Examples of this include claims for false business expenses or private expenses, false receipts used to support a donation tax credit rebate, or claims made for Working for Families Tax Credits for a child that has not been in care. GST is an example of how we are blending technologies, START and our Data and Intelligence Platform (DIP), into a single analytics capability that delivers results for us and our customers. Currently, a number of GST refund requests are identified as risky by START and flagged for a review by our staff. Reviews can take up to 15 days and will result in a refund or referral for further investigation or audit. We can now use the DIP to analyse patterns of low- risk cases that may mistakenly end up in the ‘manual intervention’ queue. Using these insights, we can refine the risk rules in START and reduce the number of manual interventions. As a result, we can focus on higher-impact cases and make faster GST refunds to customers. Addressing integrity risks and non-compliant activities 44Annual Report 2019 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS Complex technical issues including aggressive tax planning Some people try to reduce the amount of tax they should pay or increase their entitlement to social benefits. They may do this by structuring their tax affairs inappropriately or adopting aggressive tax positions or interpretations. Investigations of aggressive tax positions have often resulted in large tax adjustments. In this financial year, complex technical issues contributed around 30% of the total tax position differences identified. Much of this was from a small number of long-term cases. Our investigations into aggressive tax planning and other complex technical issues resulted in tax position differences of $298 million in 2018–19. Of this, $87.8 million came from work funded through Budget-specific initiatives. Helping and ensuring high-wealth individual customers comply with their obligations High-wealth individual customers and their respective groups pay more than $700 million income tax and collect in excess of $1 billion PAYE each year. Because their activities and tax affairs are complex in nature, we have a dedicated team who provide tailored services to help them get it right from the start. The majority of these customers meet their tax obligations. We analyse information including international investments, financing arrangements and wealth gains that are currently untaxed, for example capital gains from start-up ventures or land banking. We use intelligence in real time so that we can follow up and work along-side customers to help them pay the right amount of tax. When customers get it wrong, we take action. Our investigations in this area resulted in tax position differences of $44.1 million in 2018–19. High-wealth individuals are classified as having assets of more than $50 million, and on average have more than 30 associated entities. Some are significant shareholders in public companies. We have developed close working relationships with New Zealand’s major tax treaty partners and exchange information in relation to high-wealth individual customers who are operating internationally. International partnerships provide earlier insight into schemes that are developed abroad and subsequently marketed in New Zealand. Targeting New Zealand’s hidden economy Sometimes people intentionally choose to participate in the hidden economy or commit fraud by operating totally or partially outside the tax system. This includes not declaring or accurately reporting all their income or attempting to receive refunds and entitlements they are not eligible for. Where we find this, we take appropriate action. Our work on the hidden economy focuses on: >specific parts of the hospitality and construction sectors >those operating partially or totally outside the tax system >emerging risk areas, including the sharing and digital economies that include new business models such as Uber and Airbnb, and alternative payment methods and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. To June 2019, our work has assessed additional tax revenue of $108.8 million. Of this, $34.8 million relates to work funded by the Government through Budget initiatives. The return on investment has been $5.65:$1 against a target of $4.59:$1. Our work to identify and prevent fraudulent refunds and entitlements assessed additional tax revenue of $30.0 million. Of this, $10.1 million relates to work funded by the Government through Budget initiatives. We have also continued to work with partner agencies to support enhanced information sharing as part of a wider Government focus on reducing fraud and organised criminal activity. 45 Improving compliance in the hospitality sector In our experience, the hospitality sector has many complex compliance issues including high volumes of cash transactions and poor record-keeping. Our primary focus is on restaurants, cafes and bakeries, takeaways and liquor outlets. We can now match information we already hold with data from payment intermediaries. This has improved our ability to provide support to new businesses, accurately identify non-compliance and increase revenue through audit outcomes. Our ‘SLEEP:EASY’ communication campaign from May to late July 2018 encouraged hospitality businesses to meet their GST obligations. We contacted over 22,000 customers, and visited over 3,150 businesses in July 2018. Over 41% of the customers who were contacted increased their declared income by more than 3%. Almost 32% of these customers also increased the GST they have to pay by a similar amount. Helping customers in the construction industry comply We have continued our focus on residential building, electrical and plumbing services to improve compliance with registration, reporting, filing and payment. In 2018–19, we received the results from surveys conducted in November 2017 and May 2018 on our earlier ‘No grey areas—it’s tax crime’ and ‘Every undeclared cash job leaves a trail’ campaigns. These noted: >the proportion of people saying they participated in cash jobs is relatively consistent with previous years (27%), and is below the initial measure in 2011 of 34% >fewer people said they were likely to ask for a cash price knowing that tax is less likely to be paid on it—from 27% in 2011 to 16% in 2018 >the proportion of people who report themselves as being likely to participate in cash jobs (19%) remained consistent with 2018 >49% of people agreed in 2018 that cash jobs are acceptable (it was 72% in 2011). Helping and ensuring customers comply with property obligations We have continued to work on addressing risks posed by the incorrect tax treatment of property transactions. We are also assisting the implementation of property-related law changes. The bright-line period has been extended from two years to five years. This means that customers selling a house other than their main home within five years of buying it have to pay income tax on any profits they make. Residential rental losses are now ring-fenced, which means they cannot be used to offset other income. We have focused our property compliance work in four key areas: property speculation and bright-line compliance, GST, developers and builders, and emerging risks. In 2018–19, we assessed additional tax revenue of $109 million. Our Budget-funded work on property tax compliance had a return on investment of $9.58:$1 against a target of $6.42:$1. We are working with other government agencies to raise awareness of property tax compliance and better help customers get it right from the start. We worked with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) and Statistics New Zealand to make the LINZ tax statement more user-friendly and provided clearer information to rental property owners through the www.business.govt.nz portal. We also provided feedback to the Tax Working Group and the Government on potential property tax measures. 46Annual Report 2019 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS Helping customers to meet their bright-line obligations We have worked to help our customers meet their bright- line obligations. The actions we take include reminder letters, customer visits and audit activities. This year, we called or visited over 1,000 customers with possible bright-line sales in the 2017 income tax year to determine if bright-line applied and to help them understand their obligations and comply with the legislation. Where necessary we follow up with those who choose not to comply. Before audit activity begins, we send a letter to the customer as a last prompt for voluntary compliance. The first of these letters were sent in March 2019 to customers who were previously contacted, but who have not taken action to meet their obligations. We will continue to audit and follow up with customers who remain non-compliant. Through our Data Intelligence Platform, we continue to develop and improve our ability to identify whether an individual property transaction is taxable under the bright- line rules for a customer. We provide certainty and clarify tax law When interpretation of the law is not clear, we provide certainty by providing public rulings, interpretation statements and disputes reviews. This year, we developed guidance covering the tax aspects of providing short-stay accommodation through platforms such as Airbnb. Because of the topic we tried a slightly different approach and tailored the information and guidance to people providing the accommodation. We published guidance for employers that pay their employees’ salary, wages or bonuses in cryptocurrency. We also clarified when sales of lifestyle blocks and subdivided sections were excluded from the five-year bright-line test. We give certainty to businesses through taxpayer rulings. These rulings give our interpretation of how the law applies in specific circumstances. This year, we ruled on $6.4 billion worth of arrangements, where the associated tax at issue was more than $1.02 billion. Compared to last year, the total headline value in tax at stake was lower. This was primarily due to a ruling on a significant one-off transaction in a previous year. The demand for rulings was still high this year, with significant transactions ruled on involving insurance, infrastructure and housing. A larger proportion of our applications than usual concerned GST and we have started to receive requests for rulings on the new base erosion and profit shifting provisions. In 2018–19, 100% of customers who returned surveys were very satisfied with our rulings service, with customers generally very happy with the timing and the quality of our work. We prosecute when necessary We completed 68 prosecutions for tax evasion, knowledge and Crimes Act 1961 offences. This compares with 94 in 2017–18. As at 30 June 2019, there were 92 prosecution cases before the courts compared with 121 at 30 June la st year. 47 Facilitating international tax compliance Tax from significant enterprises makes up a large portion of our revenue base. With the increasing complexities of globalisation, we need to actively participate in international solutions that facilitate compliance. Facilitating international tax transparency through effective exchange of information The Common Reporting Standard (CRS), also known as automatic exchange of information (AEOI), is an initiative to address offshore tax evasion led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We have implemented the CRS, completing our first exchanges in 2018. We were one of 85 jurisdictions that exchanged financial account information. We sent more than 600,000 account reports and received over 700,000 in return. We started to analyse this information in order to be able to match these reports with individual customer records. Inland Revenue continues to play an important part in raising international standards on tax transparency. In June 2019, our Manager of International Revenue Strategy was appointed Chair of the Co-ordinating Body of the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. International engagement—our contribution to international capacity building We facilitated training on the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) In January 2019, we helped facilitate the first ever CRS Appreciation Workshop, hosted by the OECD and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. There were 40 participants from the Study Group on Asian Tax Administration and Research and Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators jurisdictions, and a range of experiences with implementation. We also delivered a tailored exchange of information training programme in Kuala Lumpur, which has helped strengthen our standing in Asia and our relationships with Singapore and Malaysia. In October 2018 and May 2019, we presented on tax to developing countries as part of the OECD Global Relations Programme. We also took part in the development of the Asia Region Funds Passport. This is an arrangement between New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Korea and Thailand that allows a managed fund based in one country to be offered more easily to investors in other participating countries. Providing training on tax avoidance and evasion In June 2019, we helped lead a workshop for members of the Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association and Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators (CATA). We presented on a wide range of topics such as the differences between avoidance and evasion, base erosion and profit shifting minimum standards and all forms of exchange of information. Some of the training was aimed at raising awareness given the varying levels of development. We also gave one-on-one training on more complex matters. International tax and the digital economy Implementation of base erosion and profit shifting initiatives The OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project arose out of significant global media and political concern about evidence suggesting that some multinationals paid little or no tax anywhere in the world. This problem is referred to as base erosion and profit shifting or ‘BEPS’. BEPS tax-planning strategies exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. The recently enacted Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 prevents multinationals from using: >artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties to shift profits out of New Zealand >hybrid mismatch arrangements that exploit differences between countries’ tax rules to achieve an advantageous tax position >artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence (a permanent establishment) in New Zealand >related-party transactions (transfer pricing) to shift profits into offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore >certain tactics to stymie an Inland Revenue investigation, such as withholding relevant information that is held by an offshore group member. 48Annual Report 2019 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS The BEPS legislation is effective from 1 July 2018. The impact of the measures will emerge in 2020 and 2021 following filing of affected returns. However, there is evidence that taxpayers are responding to the new legislation by reducing related-party debt, removing hybrid instruments (and entities) and restructuring their business operations in New Zealand. There is also some evidence of enterprises booking sales in New Zealand instead of offshore. Overall, it is moving in the right direction. We take a comprehensive risk-based approach to BEPS, with one-to-one compliance management of our top 58 corporate groups and a strong focus on all foreign-owned multinationals with group turnover above $30m per annum. Enhanced disclosure requirements, combined with an annual international questionnaire issued to over 600 groups supplemented by additional intelligence derived from treaty partners, support our compliance approach. In addition, we will continue to provide guidance and binding rulings/advance pricing agreements where requested to support compliance with the new law. Taxing the digital economy There has also been concern with the taxation of the digital economy in New Zealand and globally. The BEPS measures described above do not directly address the problem of taxing the digital economy. These measures only prevent multinationals from avoiding the current international tax rules. However, taxing the digital economy requires a fundamental change to those rules. It is possible for internet-based companies to derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax there. The OECD is trying to achieve an internationally agreed solution to the problem, which would involve changing the current international income tax framework. Some countries have adopted a separate digital services tax to address the problem in the interim. New Zealand is taking part in the OECD discussions on this issue. The Government supports an internationally agreed solution, if one can be reached. As a small, open economy, New Zealand generally tries to keep its tax policy settings within international norms to provide a stable and certain environment for cross-border investment. However, the Government will consider a digital services tax if an international solution cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe. Double tax agreements Our general approach to double tax agreements (DTA) is to maintain a targeted and up-to-date network with key investment and trading partners, with the flexibility to negotiate new treaties as appropriate. New Zealand has 40 current DTAs. A new DTA with China, replacing the 1986 agreement, was concluded in 2017 and signed in April 2019. Other key updates in progress are with Korea, Hungary, Portugal and Austria. The year ahead Ko te tau kei te heke mai • We are working towards ratifying the Hague Convention for Child Support for April 2021, which will improve our ability to collect child support from parents living abroad. We will also work to resolve older child support debt cases before child support moves into START in 2021. • We will continue to focus on unfiled returns. • We will continue with our multi-year programmes of work on complex technical issues, the hidden economy, fraud and property compliance. • We are working with the Ministry of Justice and other agencies to prepare for the upcoming Financial Action Task Force mutual evaluation. This review will look at New Zealand’s approach to reducing the likelihood and impact of money laundering activities. The review is planned to start in September 2019. • We will issue rulings on the tax treatment of crypto- assets, including the implications for customers who receive their regular wages or salary in crypto-assets. 49 Our organisation is changing and we are supporting our people through this process. Inland Revenue is working together better, so we can ensure we really do contribute to improving all New Zealanders’ economic and social wellbeing. We invest in our workforce to build knowledge and capability in areas such as tax technical expertise and digital skills so that we can meet customers’ current and future needs. There is a strong focus on having a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture. Managing ourselves well Kia tika ā mātou mahi whakahaere i ā mātou anō 50Annual Report 2019 MANAGING OURSELVES WELL We invested in building our people’s capability and supporting them to work differently Te K o - hure, our approach to leadership development, won an international award We refreshed how we recognise the great work our people do We developed the Ma - hutonga approach setting out the changes we will make in how we work with and for Māori We launched our new Diversity and Inclusion Implementation Plan We improved our support for people’s wellbeing during organisational change We refreshed and progressed our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan At a glance Hei rarapa noa 1 51 Supporting our people to be successful We recognised in 2015 that transforming the revenue system required a change in how we work, as well as updating our technologies and processes. Lifting our capability as an organisation is essential to the success of transforming Inland Revenue for the future as an agile, intelligence-led organisation. The significant investment we have made in our people over the past three years has continued this year. This year, we supported our people through significant change, implementing lessons learned from last year. We developed a new approach for how we will engage with te Tiriti o Waitangi and how we work with Māori. We shaped plans for a more diverse and inclusive organisation, and focused on our people’s health and safety. Since 2015, we have focused on developing 12 people capabilities. These represent the mix of skills, experience, knowledge and attitudes our people need. They were developed with the digital world in mind. This year, we have continued to move to capability-based roles focused on delivering to customers and on outcomes rather than tasks and processes. We are maintaining our specialist technical knowledge while at the same time supporting our people to adapt to changes in customer needs and a changing environment. We are making a substantial investment in capability development via our transformation programme. This includes leadership, coaching, decision making, training in the START systems, and Agile and design thinking. Agile and design thinking help our people to support design, deliver and integrate solutions for our customers. Our performance approach, Whanake (meaning to grow/develop), is another example of our continuing focus on building capability across Inland Revenue. Whanake encourages regular, high-quality development conversations between our people and their leaders. Supporting this is an online MyCapabilities tool which helps our people to assess their own career needs and develop plans to build their capabilities.

The Christian Dahmen Memorial Award for HR Innovation or Technology recognises organisations that have introduced a new product, service, human resources practice or technology not previously seen in New Zealand. We are proud to be recognised as a workplace where people can grow, adapt and evolve. International award for leadership development approach Inland Revenue has put a strong focus on leadership development enabling our leaders to coach their people through change and to lift capability. Our leadership development approach, Te Kōhure, won gold in the Best Advance in Leadership Development category of the Brandon Hall Human Capital Management Excellence Awards in the United States. Developed with our design partners Inspire Group, Te Kōhure received an overall rating of extraordinary for blending different types of learning, experiences and modes. It includes leadership coaching, accelerated leadership programmes, and tools for leading teams through organisational change. Each release of our transformation is driving new skills and capabilities Ahead of Release 3, our people completed training programmes that focused on learning new tools, systems and processes. Between July 2018 and June 2019, our people attended over 10,000 face-to-face learning sessions and completed over 90,000 online learning modules in areas such as tax technical and social policy training. We value our people’s technical skills and experience We have stayed focused on retaining tax technical expertise as well as lifting technical capability while we transform. Our Technical Specialist Network has provided regular training across the organisation on a broad range of tax technical subjects, social policy and emerging issues via internal roadshows, conferences, videos, e-learning, partnering and one-to-one coaching. Our people maintain appropriately high standards of continuing professional development as part of their memberships of professional associations. This year, the proportion of the organisation that has tax technical experience has remained relatively stable. Turnover for this area (7.4%) is lower than the overall Inland Revenue average (9.6%). We support the Aotearoa New Zealand Skills Pledge On 7 May 2019, the Prime Minister announced the Aotearoa New Zealand Skills Pledge, inviting New Zealand employers to commit to doubling their training and re-skilling hours by 2025 and to publicly disclose this investment in their annual reports. We worked closely with the State Services Commission and other agencies to explore how the Aotearoa New Zealand Skills Pledge could be implemented consistently in the public sector. We have pledged to continue investing in lifting our people’s skills and capabilities as part of our People Strategy and transformation programme. New tools and technology are helping us work smarter We have been rolling out technology and tools such as Office 365 and our knowledge management system, STAX. These tools help to modernise how we work and enable us to work in a more collaborative and joined-up way, so we can better support our customers. Making Inland Revenue a great place to work We want to make working at Inland Revenue unique, exciting, fulfilling and career-enhancing, and we want to support our people through this period of significant change. Supporting our people through change In July 2018, we received the results of a review we commissioned into the change process that set up three new business groups in February 2018. The review found that we could have supported our people better. We have learned from this and have: >made our communications more timely and transparent >involved our people as we develop the future operating model 53 Focused on engagement We measure employee engagement and perceptions of our culture through our culture and engagement surveys Kōrero Mai. We run full surveys every two years. This year, we ran three short Kōrero Mai surveys, which resulted in engagement scores of 28%, 31% and 29%. We are seeing the high level of change continue to impact on levels of employee engagement. We know our success depends on our people and we are committed to improving employee engagement. This includes continuing our focus on: >listening to, and connecting with, our people >embedding our performance approach, coaching and recognition >learning and development and building capability >supporting leaders and teams to work differently. The next survey will run in October 2019. >increased opportunities for senior leaders to talk with people about the changes >held networking events to enable our leaders to connect and work cohesively towards our desired culture. Our desired culture Inland Revenue’s culture shapes our relationships with each other, our work with customers, the decisions we make and the actions we take. We want an inclusive culture that is customer-centric, agile and intelligence-led. FIGURE 5: OUR CULTURE ANCHORS FIGURE 6: OUR DESIRED ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE Customer centric Together we understand the many influences on each customer, and decide how we will work with them to get the best outcomes for New Zealand. Intelligence-led We’re confident that we make good decisions based on quality information and analysis. We continually test and learn to know what the best approaches will be. Agile We work at pace, pulling together the right people to make good decisions quickly, focusing on the things that matter most. Inclusive We have an inclusive culture where people from all walks of life can achieve their full potential. As a truly inclusive organisation, our people and customers will feel valued and respected, and they will see themselves reflected in our people, our processes, our values and behaviours.

We have a range of options for recognising our people. This year we updated our Commissioner’s Awards. The awards acknowledge people who embrace our culture, values and behaviours and make Inland Revenue a great place to work. The Awards recognise people who: >consistently strive to make a difference for our customers (Toitū te Tangata—Spirit of Service award) >demonstrate exceptional ability to collaborate and role model new approaches or ways of working (Mahi Tahi—Collaboration award) >motivate and inspire others to succeed (Tū Rangatira— Leadership award) >help build an inclusive culture (He Waka Eke Noa— Diversity and Inclusion award) >make our working environment a better, happier and a more welcoming place to work (Tū Tangata—Our People award). We are preparing ourselves for the future In February 2018, we established three new business groups (Customer and Compliance Services—Individuals, Customer and Compliance Services—Business, and Information and Intelligence Services). Since then, we have been looking at the future operating model for the rest of the organisation, starting with a focus on how we do our policy and organisation-wide tax technical work. Learning from the review of our earlier phase of organisational change, we are including our people in thinking about what the future operating model is going to be. Our people, unions and other key stakeholders are involved as we progress this work. We are working with our unions Our three unions—the Public Service Association (PSA), Taxpro and the National Union of Public Employees—play an important role representing their members' voices and we are committed to working with them. During the 2018 negotiations with the PSA for the new collective agreement, the union’s members took industrial action in support of their claims, which included a significant pay claim. We reached an agreement on 16 August 2018, which was ratified by PSA members. Inland Revenue and each union have been jointly developing relationship agreements in 2019. The agreement with Taxpro was signed in May. Relationship agreements establish the agreed relationship principles and provide practical guidelines on how we will work together to provide a positive workplace for our people. The three collective agreements negotiated in 2018 are due to expire on 30 September 2019. We will continue to work alongside our three unions as we work on our future operating model. We are committed to our responsibilities under te Tiriti o Waitangi, the Treaty of Waitangi We understand the importance of meeting our Tiriti o Waitangi obligations as a government agency. This year, we introduced a new approach to how we engage with te Tiriti o Waitangi and how we work with Māori. Our approach is called Māhutonga (the Southern Cross constellation). Under Māhutonga, we are looking at how we can integrate the Principles of the Treaty and Māori perspectives, processes and practices into everything that we do. In addition to a focus on the Principles of te Tiriti o Waitangi, we have also taken opportunities to form stronger relationships with several hapū and iwi. This has occurred primarily in those areas where we have changed our accommodation, including Kirikiriroa Hamilton and Ngāmotu New Plymouth. In doing so, we have created new opportunities for engaging and working with those Māori groups. This in part recognises the Treaty partnership in practice and is helping to build our cultural integrity and capabilities. Māhutonga, our approach to our Tiriti o Waitangi obligations The decision to introduce the Māhutonga approach is aligned with our broader transformational goals and the changing nature of the external operating environment. Traditionally, our focus on Māori has been through the delivery of generic services, supplemented by tailored services delivered through our community compliance area. We also focus on building our internal Māori cultural capability, mostly te reo Māori and support for cultural events. Māhutonga is a long-term approach. It focuses on building and maintaining our: >Māori cultural integrity, which is important if we want to work credibly with Māori as a Tiriti partner >Māori cultural capability, which is necessary to deliver services to Māori customers and improve their outcomes. 55 TABLE 4: ETHNICITIES AT INLAND REVENUE New Zealand (2013 Census) Inland Revenue (Human Resource Capability Report 2019) Public sector (Human Resource Capability Report 2018) European74.0%63.3%69.2% Māori15.0%12.3%16.0% Asian12.0%16.0%10.1% Pasifika 7.0%8.2%9.2% This year, Māhutonga activities focused on our people and included: >Reviewing our Māori Language Plan We continued to review our Māori Language Plan with the assistance of Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori. We are aligning our organisational focus with the direction set out in Maihi Karauna, the Government’s Māori language strategy. Our focus will be tailored to deliver services to Māori customers, while also contributing to the overall goals sought by Maihi Karauna. We will finalise our review of the Māori Language Plan in 2019–20. >Developing senior leader capability During 2018–19, our senior leaders invested time to engage with Māori concepts and perspectives in recognition that leadership is critical to the development of our Māori cultural integrity and capability. This work contributes to a Māori conceptual frame to help our senior leaders think differently about making decisions. We value diversity and inclusion in our workforce Naomi Ferguson, our Commissioner, co-leads Papa Pounamu, a steering group of 12 public sector chief executives who are driving a collaborative programme of diversity and inclusion across the public service. In addition to the work we do to support the public sector’s programme, Inland Revenue’s Diversity and Inclusion strategy and programme of work is designed to address our specific diversity and inclusion goals. To best serve and reflect our communities, diversity across our workforce is critical. We aim to have an inclusive culture where people from all walks of life achieve their full potential. We value diversity of thought, beliefs, backgrounds and capabilities. Diverse perspectives help us understand our customers' challenges. Understanding our customers, how they see the world and the life events they are experiencing, means we can help customers get their interactions with us right from the start. To support this, we have introduced initiatives such as ‘Every Story Matters’ and ‘This is Us’, which encourage our people to use empathy and help them recognise unconscious bias. As at 30 June 2019, our people represented 131 different ethnicities, broadly in line with the ethnic make-up of New Zealand. However, our diversity decreases as job complexity increases. The main goals of our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and three-year Implementation Plan are: >Create a safer and more open working environment where all people feel able to grow and do their best work without fear of embarrassment or retaliation. >Break down barriers to inclusion, and celebrate, retain, develop and attract a truly diverse workforce that is representative of the communities we serve. >Actively demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive culture through our leadership and hold ourselves accountable for our progress. During 2018–19, we: >focused on inclusion in the design of our office facilities by starting to introduce parenting rooms, reflection rooms, gender-neutral bathrooms and visual design elements that reflect our people’s diversity >sought advice and diverse perspectives from our advisory group, Te Manu Korihi, which has internal and external membership. The group provided advice on things such as our diversity and inclusion strategy and implementation plan, inclusive learning and the diversity and inclusion maturity assessment. >supported public sector initiatives such as committing to the All-of-Government Accessibility Charter, the public sector LGBTQIA+ WeCount survey and the He Taurangi Panel Pledge for balanced representation at conferences and on panels >became a support partner of Tu p u To a, the internship programme for Māori and Pasifika students Table 4 below summarises the ethnic make-up of Inland Revenue. Because each employee can identify with up to three ethnicities, figures may add up to over 100%. 56Annual Report 2019 MANAGING OURSELVES WELL All numbers are at 30 June except turnover, which is annualised.

Our diversity networks support and develop our people We support our people to create and nurture a sense of belonging through a range of diversity networks, including Māori, Pasifika, multi- cultural, LGBTQIA+ and Women’s networks. This year, we established a new organisation- wide Rainbow/LGBTQIA+ network, two new multi-cultural networks in two of our Ōtautahi Christchurch offices, and a new disability network is being developed. During the year, our people organised cultural events, invited guest speakers, made videos and shared food and languages to raise awareness about their cultures. We actively participated in Gumboot Friday, a nationwide fundraising event to raise awareness of mental health. Our workforce profile Our workforce profile is changing as we transform. During the year, the number of permanent full-time equivalent (FTE) staff reduced by 307, and the number of fixed-term staff and contractors increased. The demographic makeup of our people has stayed relatively stable over the past five years. Turnover is decreasing, reflecting the period of significant organisational change that occurred in 2017–18. As we work through further changes to reach our future operating model, we expect turnover is likely to increase. 57 We provide Equal Employment Opportunities for everyone We are committed to treating our people fairly and properly in all aspects of their employment, including valuing diversity and providing equal employment opportunities. Our Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) policy and practices ensure equality in the workplace. We work to remove barriers so our people have opportunities to develop and progress. We apply our EEO policy in all our people processes including recruitment and development. We are addressing the gender pay gap We are committed to eliminating the gender pay gap—the difference between women’s and men’s salaries. In early 2019, we refreshed our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan and engaged with unions on this. Between 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2019, our average gender pay gap decreased from 20.3% to 18.0%. When we compare salaries of men and women in the same roles, most roles have a 0% pay gap. Our gender pay gap is largely explained by there being fewer women in higher- paid roles and more women in lower-paid roles. Women make up 46% of the people who earn over $100,000, while they make up 69% of the people who earn under $100,000. Representation of women in management and senior management has increased in recent years. Management increased from 51% to 52% and senior management from 22% to 40% between June 2016 and June 2019. We will continue to build on this success through implementing the Gender Pay Gap Action Plan. We are achieving our goal of having a minimum of 40% women and 40% men in senior leadership roles. We are supporting gender balance in tax administrations globally Our Commissioner Naomi Ferguson is leading a Gender Balance Network, which was launched at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Forum on Tax Administration in March 2019. The aim of the network is to create positive change and improve the gender balance in leadership positions across tax administrations. They will also provide a support network to look at how to help people through areas such as mentoring and short-term secondments between administrations. Keeping our people healthy, safe and well We believe our workplace and culture should promote safe work practices and encourage wellbeing. We encourage everyone to show manaakitanga (care and respect) and kaitiakitanga (guardianship), and we integrate health and safety into all of our work activities. We focus on keeping our people safe at our sites and during visits in the community This year, we upgraded the security aspects of front-of- house service areas in six of our sites and set up self-reporting for contractors doing physical works. We have a number of activities planned or underway in 2019 to improve how we manage risks to our people, including: >roll out of ‘lone worker duress’ alarms >training for people leaders to help them to create great working environments and support those experiencing mental health challenges >training for all our people to help them understand mental health and mental illness >risk assessment for people who often drive our vehicles >working with areas going through change to encourage them to design roles for healthy and satisfying work. Empowering our Health and Safety Representatives We continued to invest in training and resources to help our Health and Safety Representatives support our leaders to manage health and safety risks to their people. This year, around 80 Health and Safety Representatives completed external training, and 30 attended the All-of- Government Health and Safety Representatives conference. We introduced updated tools to help our representatives ask the right questions when they are talking with our people about risk. The data includes fixed-term and permanent employees.

Our policies and frameworks ensure we act appropriately and meet public expectations. Independent groups regularly review how we are doing, and we use this advice to improve. Effective risk management ensures our operations are adaptive and resilient. We also ensure our technology systems are current and that our property portfolio provides the work spaces and facilities we need. We focus on getting the best value possible from goods and services. Our governance and management Ko ā mātou mahi mana whakahaere, whakahaere mahi hoki 60Annual Report 2019 OUR GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT Our governance structure continues to serve us well Independent reviews of our transformation and performance confirm our organisation is well-managed We completed three significant property projects with new sites in Kirikiriroa Hamilton, Ahuriri Napier and Ngāmotu New Plymouth We reduced our general waste by 31% We established a social procurement strategy to increase our focus on achieving better social outcomes when we buy goods and services At a glance Hei rarapa noa 61 Our governance system guides us Our governance system ensures we are doing the right things in the right way to achieve our strategic direction, manage risks and meet Government expectations. The system is made up of the Strategic Governance Board and five committees. The Board is chaired by the Commissioner and the members are our Executive Leadership Team. Membership of the other committees is based on having the right expertise from across the organisation. It is a mix of executive leaders, senior leaders and external advisors. We regularly review our governance structure to make sure it is fit for purpose. FIGURE 7: OUR GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE Strategic Governance Board Commissioner Minister of Revenue Finance and Expenditure Committee Audit New Zealand State Services Commission Risk and Assurance Committee The Treasury Organisation Development Committee Customer- centric Committee Technical Governance Committee Portfolio Governance Committee Performance and Investment Committee INLAND REVENUE The Strategic Governance Board provides our overall strategic direction and approach to risk management. The Board ensures all the elements of our transformation come together and decides where we need to speed up or slow down. The Performance and Investment Committee governs our organisational health and performance and investment decisions. The Committee’s role is to understand and balance investment choices and trade-offs, make sure we meet investment objectives, govern benefits realisation, and make sure organisational performance is in line with our strategic direction. The Portfolio Governance Committee governs the projects and programmes in our investment portfolio, ensuring they deliver as intended and stay within parameters set by the Performance and Investment Committee, including scope, schedule and budget. Significant issues are escalated to the Performance and Investment Committee. The Customer-centric Committee helps to shape the way we think about putting the customer at the centre of everything we do and how we can help them to get it right from the start. The Technical Governance Committee ensures there is effective coordination and management of our legal/ technical business and significant tax technical issues. The Organisation Development Committee governs the development of our organisation and workforce, ensuring there is alignment with our overall strategic direction. 62Annual Report 2019 OUR GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT Governing our transformation Our transformation is large, complex and challenging. Our operating environment is dynamic. Given the broad impact of Inland Revenue’s transformation, oversight of it is integrated into the wider governance system shown in figure 7 on page 61. This means decisions made within the transformation programme are right for our customers and New Zealand’s revenue system. The Portfolio Governance Committee, along with the duties described above, has governance oversight of the programme driving the transformation changes. It ensures milestones are delivered and monitors the general health of programme finances, schedule and quality. The Commissioner, in her role as Senior Responsible Owner of the programme, ensures the programme meets its investment objectives and is reviewed at appropriate stages. The Deputy Commissioner Transformation is responsible for ensuring transformation is introduced successfully, and that robust change management processes are in place to meet customers' and stakeholders' needs. Regular reviews provide assurance that our transformation is well managed and governed Regular independent reviews are essential to our governance and provide us with useful information and comfort that we are on track. The assurance management plan for the transformation programme incorporates Independent Quality Assurance (IQA), Technical Quality Assurance (TQA) and Gateway reviews. KPMG completed two IQA and TQA reviews this year, which assessed our governance and management practices for the programme. KMPG also reviewed our progress towards goals. In its December 2018 review, KPMG noted ‘overall the Programme is consistently among the best performing in our team’s global IQA experience’. Two Gateway reviews have been done, focusing on our readiness for Release 3 of our transformation. Gateway is an independent and confidential peer review process facilitated by the Treasury. The review team noted in its March 2019 review that ’...the Inland Revenue Business Transformation Programme continues to be strongly led and is firmly embraced by the leadership as the new normal’. The Ministers of Finance and Revenue met with the independent reviewers and were briefed on the results. Ministers receive regular monthly briefings on the transformation programme, and progress is reported to Cabinet twice during the year. More information on these reviews is available on our website: www.ird.govt.nz Independent assurance Our Risk and Assurance Committee provides impartial oversight and advice The role of the Risk and Assurance Committee is to provide independent advice and insight to the Commissioner on risk oversight and management as well as the system of internal control. All five members are independent external experts, with a mixture of skills in assurance, financial management, risk management and organisational change. The Committee met five times in 2018–19. The members are: Steven Fyfe (Chair) | Steven worked in the banking industry with National Bank and ANZ until 2011. Steven brings governance, large change programme and commercial experience to the Committee. Michael Ahie | Michael is an experienced director and senior executive with diverse domestic and international experience in the private and public sectors. Michael has a strong background in strategic planning and change management. Sandi Beatie QSO | Sandi brings wide experience as an executive to governance roles. Before retiring in 2015, she was the statutory Deputy State Services Commissioner. Sandi has undertaken a number of Performance Improvement Framework reviews within the public sector. Fiona Oliver | Fiona is an experienced independent director with a governance portfolio in the commercial (listed and private) and public sectors across a diverse range of sectors, including renewable energy, utilities billing systems and airports software, risk management and intelligence software, financial services and commercial property. Melanie Templeton | Melanie has been an Executive Director with agtech company Regen, Group Executive for Rabobank Group and General Manager for RaboDirect New Zealand and Australia. She is an independent director working in the technology, data products and financial services sectors. 63 Our performance and finances have external review and regulation We continue to manage our assets and investments well Treasury leads the Investor Confidence Rating (ICR) process. The rating provides an indication of the level of confidence that investors such as Cabinet and Ministers can have in an agency’s ability to manage investments and assets. Following the A rating we received in 2016, we were assessed for a second time in 2018–19 and have retained the A rating. Treasury acknowledges that maintaining an A rating is difficult and demonstrates our leadership in investment management among investment-intensive agencies. Our annual reporting and performance is audited and reviewed In keeping with the Public Finance Act 1989, the financial statements and performance information in our Annual Report are audited by the Office of the Auditor-General or an auditor acting on their behalf, in our case typically Audit New Zealand. In June 2018, the Finance and Expenditure Committee reviewed and accepted our planned spending and goals for the 2018–19 financial year. In February 2019, the Committee reviewed our performance for 2017–18. The outcomes of these hearings are published on the Parliament website: https://www.parliament.nz We manage risks and keep our business running Risk management is an integral part of our governance and management We aim for a risk management approach that integrates strategic planning, performance and risk management and assurance practices. This approach relies on the support and participation of all of our people. Each business unit is responsible for identifying, monitoring and mitigating risks in their area. We keep our risk management focused on our objectives, and with our values in mind, which helps ensure: >risk management and assurance efforts are effective and efficient >we can achieve our objectives while preserving our values such as being customer-centric and maintaining trust and integrity. We have strengthened our risk management capability While we have strong risk management practices in place, there is more to do to ensure we keep pace with our increasingly complex and volatile environment. This year, we progressed a refresh of our risk management approach across Inland Revenue. Our aim is to improve the visibility of key risks across Inland Revenue, clarify ownership and strengthen the accountability for remediation or mitigation plans. Our Internal Assurance and Advice team provides independent assurance to the Commissioner and the Risk and Assurance Committee that our risks are being managed effectively. They reviewed a number of areas this year, including how well we are monitoring and providing support for our people’s mental health or meeting the Privacy Commissioner’s expectations for information matching and sharing. The Internal Assurance and Advice team won the Team Excellence Award at the 2018 Institute of Internal Auditors New Zealand Awards. Enterprise risks Our seven enterprise risks have assigned risk stewards, all members of the Executive Leadership Team. These risks are reviewed on an ongoing basis including reassessing their overall triggers, consequences and ratings. TABLE 8: OUR SEVEN ENTERPRISE RISKS Enterprise risk Failure to meet expectations of Government, delivering: core business, Government Priorities, business transformation Failure to provide appropriate stewardship of the tax and social policy system The levels of voluntary compliance are reduced to the point of having a material impact on revenue collection for the Crown Unexpected negative customer reaction to the transformation changes Unable to ensure continuity of business services Insufficient people capability and capacity to deliver outcomes Inland Revenue’s approach to data and information governance is sub-optimal 64Annual Report 2019 OUR GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT Preserving our values of integrity, honesty and professionalism is essential We aim to ensure issues and complaints relating to our integrity and conduct are properly examined and resolved through independent and fair processes. Minimising the risk of any coverup or collusion is critical so New Zealanders can remain confident in our management of wrongdoing in the workplace. This year, we reviewed our fraud and corruption control policy and guidelines to make sure they keep pace with transformation and changing business practices. We also enhanced how we audit high-risk fraud areas such as discretionary expenditure. We take our customers’ privacy seriously We are committed to looking after customers’ information. However, occasionally mistakes happen that can result in privacy breaches. This year, 112 privacy breaches were reported, compared to 160 in 2017–18. Most breaches happen when emails or letters are sent to the wrong customer with information about another person. None of the breaches this year resulted in harm to any individual. When things do go wrong, our approach is to fix the issue and learn from it. Having an organisational culture that is focused on being able to work through issues, and is able to adapt and improve, is key to this. Keeping information safe is important We hold a large amount of information and it is important we keep it secure. We continue to improve our technology and processes to safeguard the integrity of information systems and lift the security awareness culture within Inland Revenue. Improvements this year included: >increasing our ability to detect security events >continued improvement of our incident response processes to meet good practice >new security tools to improve our capability in the prevention of vulnerabilities to our systems >more than 20 compliance reviews of our cybersecurity, including the compliance of the third stage in our transformation changes. Independent review of survey questions As part of a research project into the key factors that influenced New Zealanders’ trust in Inland Revenue and the tax system, we published an online survey containing a question about the political leanings of respondents. We accepted that the question was inappropriate. We commissioned an independent review of the survey by Martin Jenkins. It found no evidence of political motivation at any point. Martin Jenkins also found that we had all the policies and procedures related to ethics, internal control, risk management and project management that they expected to see. However, on this occasion the application of the checks and balances to the process did not happen in the way it should. We accepted all of the review’s recommendations and are implementing them. Effective business continuity and emergency response is in place To meet our commitments to the Government and our customers, we must be able to maintain core services during disruptive events such as earthquakes or technology outages. To achieve this, we follow international best practice in planning for, and practising our responses to, business disruptions. In June 2019, we evacuated our 220 Inland Revenue people at our Te Papaioea Palmerston North site after investigations found the building was earthquake prone. Our people worked from different locations, including sharing offices with the Ministry of Social Development. Before the evacuation, work had begun on a new building. We will share it with Palmerston North City Council and Horizons Regional Council. We plan to move in September 2019. Artist impression of our new premises in Te Papaioea Palmerston North 65 Our systems and assets are well managed We have completed the third of five major releases of new systems and processes under our transformation programme. Our infrastructure has been significantly strengthened through our investment in two new data centres and a leading-edge security and identity access management system, among other improvements. We are simplifying our technology environment by retiring historical applications, databases and intranet sites and archiving old files. This year, we completed the move from our old workplace technology and management arrangements to a new environment that is less complex, significantly more secure, and which lets our people work more flexibly. We are managing key technology risks as we transform While our new infrastructure has been implemented, the old infrastructure is still in place and supports some services. Running multiple systems in parallel adds complexity. We will continue to manage this until our transformation is complete. Our secure online service for customers, myIR, is now running in START. As outlined on page 32, some customers experienced issues with myIR after the go-live for Release 3. However, these were primarily teething issues that were quickly resolved. Overall, myIR has coped well with the significantly increased load of customer logins since go-live in April. We tested our ability to work in a disaster Inland Revenue has two data centres holding all customer records and online channel information. When customer information is updated in the primary data centre in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland, it is also updated in realtime in our backup centre in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington. Two identical data centres mean extra security and greater resilience if a disaster happens. To check the resilience of our base technology and the START system, we did a full disaster recovery test in November 2018. This test involved switching to the backup data centre in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington and operating from there for a week before switching back to the primary centre in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland. We also moved our systems between data centres as part of this test. The switchovers went well and customers were not affected. Ātea is our new enterprise support services system Ātea is a set of tools that will make it easier for us to do our day-to-day administrative work. It covers our support systems and business processes for human resources, procurement, finance and asset management. The long- term goal is to help simplify, streamline and—in some cases—automate a number of internal business processes. We moved our budgeting and forecasting into Ātea in February 2019 and are now focused on human resources, asset management, finance and procurement. We are working with other government agencies to determine how the underlying business process model for Ātea can be shared across government. Ātea will also help us to meet the requirement that we include New Zealand Business Numbers (NZBN) in our financial systems. NZBN is a globally unique identifier available to all New Zealand businesses. Managing our property portfolio By 2021, we will be a smaller organisation. We are building greater flexibility into our property leases so that we can give up space we do not need. We are also looking for opportunities to sublease or co-locate with other agencies to ensure efficiency within the Crown’s property portfolio. Working with other government agencies on office accommodation Our accommodation decisions take into account the Government Office Accommodation Programme set up in 2018. The programme focuses on regional growth, enabling co-location and collaboration, improving workplaces and providing value to customers. The programme is overseen by the Government Property Group within the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and is governed by a group of public sector chief executives, including Inland Revenue’s Commissioner. We already co-locate with other agencies at several sites across New Zealand. Under the programme, we are looking for more opportunities to co-locate or sub-lease properties. Significant property projects in 2018-19 We completed three significant property projects this year. In October 2018, we opened the new Home Straight building in Te Rapa, Kirikiriroa Hamilton. In June 2017, we evacuated 75 staff from our building in Ahuriri Napier when we were advised it was earthquake prone. Our people worked from home and then moved 66Annual Report 2019 OUR GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT into temporary accommodation while we completed the fit-out of the new office. We moved into the new building in late October 2018. The expiry of our lease in Ngāmotu New Plymouth provided an opportunity to refresh the working environment. We moved into our new building in June 2019. Kirikiriroa Hamilton Our taonga, Te Kai Ārahi, was reawakened by iwi representatives and welcomed to its new home in Ngāmotu New Plymouth in June 2019. Ahuriri Napier Bringing tikanga Māori into managing our spaces This year, we worked with local iwi and hapū on some of the design elements of our new buildings and to ensure we observed appropriate tikanga at their opening ceremonies. This included providing blessings for the removal and reinstatement of our taonga and opening ceremonies. The new building in Kirikiriroa Hamilton was blessed by local iwi, Ngāti Māhanga. Kaumātua from the Ngāti Te Whiti hapū of Te Āti Awa and Taranaki whānui opened the new building in Ngāmotu New Plymouth. Kaumātua from Ngāti Kahungunu blessed the new building in Ahuriri Napier. Involving local iwi in ceremonial aspects adds value to these events and builds important relationships with our community. We are working to incorporate te reo Māori and tikanga Māori into our work and organisational culture. It is part of Māhutonga, our approach to weaving te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori perspectives, processes and practices into everything we do, including our property work programme. More detail on Māhutonga is outlined on page 54. 67 We are focused on environmental sustainability Improving energy performance and reducing waste We apply the Government Property Group’s principles, standards and guidelines for office design, which include options for managing and reducing energy consumption. We also leverage modern standards to reduce energy to heat, light and operate our buildings. In 2018-19, our energy consumption dropped by 10% compared to the previous year. We saved more than $110,000 in annual energy costs from moving into more energy efficient buildings in Kirikiriroa Hamilton, Tauranga and Ahuriri Napier. We also saved approximately $58,000 through changing our fixed monthly charges and other savings initiatives. Compared to the previous year, we achieved a 47% reduction in the tonnes of recycling waste disposed of and a 31% reduction in the tonnes of general waste. We will be targeting initiatives to further reduce waste through an improved recycling programme, which includes rolling out user education and awareness to increase the level of recycling and providing a better range of bins. Reducing print and looking at alternatives to air travel We provide laptops and tablets to many of our people, reducing the need to print. Printing levels reduced by 25% in 2018–19, saving approximately $427,000 in paper and photocopier costs. This contributes to the Government priority to build a clean, sustainable, low-carbon economy. As an alternative to air travel, we are looking at how we can better use our workplace tools and technology, including Office 365, to meet and work together virtually. We are rolling out a Working Smarter initiative to make better use of these tools. Our procurement approach We focus on getting better value for money by looking for improvements and efficiencies in our procurement processes and market engagement. We have an established supplier management framework for our key transformation partners to strengthen our relationships, monitor performance and encourage continuous improvement. We are part of more than 20 All-of- Government, syndicated and common capability contract arrangements. This year, we assessed our capability using the Government Procurement Capability Index tool, with moderation from an outside reviewer. Our overall score is ahead of the generally expected capability level. This evaluation was part of the Investor Confidence Rating assessment completed in 2018-19 (outlined on page 84). Audit New Zealand followed up on previous recommendations it has made on our procurement practices and confirmed that we have implemented some changes to improve compliance and effectiveness. These changes include increasing our people’s awareness of our procurement policy and improving record-keeping. Buying for better outcomes This year we established our Buying for Better Outcomes social procurement strategy. The strategy aligns with the changes in the Government Procurement Rules that followed the Government’s ‘Broader Outcomes’ policy shift for procurement. 3.78/4 GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT CAPABILITY INDEX SCORE FIGURE 8: OUR ROADMAP FOR BUYING BETTER OUTCOMES Establish current state of Inland Revenue's existing supply chain for delivery of social outcomes (accidental social procurement) and identify opportunities. Measure impact and benefit Realise opportunities for delivery of social outcomes through existing suppliers and remove barriers to participation for social enterprise. Create new opportunities for delivery of social outcomes through procurement activity (intentional or indirect social procurement). Partner with social enterprise for delivery of social outcomes (intentional social procurement). 68Annual Report 2019 OUR GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT The strategy aims to get better public value by focusing our suppliers—existing and future—on delivering social, environmental and cultural outcomes at the same time as they supply us with goods and services. Under the strategy, we will be: >structuring our future procurement to encourage and enable social enterprises to take part >highlighting the social outcomes already being delivered via our partners, such as sustainable employment opportunities or buy-one-give-one contributions. The year ahead Ko te tau kei te heke mai >We will continue to evolve our governance and risk management so that it stays fit for purpose >Release 2 of Ātea, our new enterprise support services system, will be implemented >We will roll out new software that helps us continue to improve our business continuity and disaster recovery planning and management >We will move into new premises in Te Papaioea Palmerston North and finish security upgrades of our front-of-house facilities at two other sites >We will bring in new performance measures to monitor printing, and emissions from air travel, vehicles and energy use in our premises >We will look to incorporate broader outcomes such as sustainability into our new contracts and key areas covered by existing contracts. We track our progress towards achieving our mission and vision through our performance measures. The diagram on pages 20–21 shows the connection between what we are here for, what we want to be, how we achieve this and how we measure it. We use outcome, impact and output measures to tell our performance story. We track the performance of our outcome and impact measures over time. These measures do not have targets. We include commentary where appropriate to help explain our results. In most cases our performance in 2018–19 is measured by comparing our actual achievements against the results from previous years. Our output measures have performance targets, which we either achieve or do not achieve. Our measures are either percentages, values or case studies. Our case studies allow us to provide background and additional context around a result. We evaluate our case study measures by comparing results to previous years where available, and by highlighting the differences we made. Our financial and asset performance and organisational health measures show how effectively and efficiently we managed our resources to deliver our services. How we performed Ko ā mātou whakatutukinga 70Annual Report 2019 HOW WE PERFORMED Our outcome performance has remained steady in a year of significant change. We continued to provide customers with timely refunds and social policy payments. Our collaboration with other government agencies helped to make it easier for customers to apply for Best Start payments and Working for Families Tax Credits. Results from our impact measures show us that our customers are using our new services, responding to our communications, and are increasingly using our online services. The measures also show that while our customers have adapted to the changes from Release 3, they are still getting used to our new systems and processes. We achieved 36 out of 48 of our output performance targets, exceeding some targets in core processing activities, debt management and returns and investigations, while successfully delivering Release 3 of our transformation. Working with external partners allowed us to respond quickly to ensure research and development tax credits could be claimed by businesses from 1 April 2019. We maintained our ‘A’ Investor Confidence Rating, demonstrating our leadership in investment management among investment-intensive agencies. Working collaboratively ensured we had the right people and skills in the right place at the right time to deliver during a year in which the third major release of changes to the revenue system affected all taxpaying New Zealanders. We managed our finances well during 2018–19, finishing the year within budget. We continue to manage our assets, achieving 6 out of 10 asset performance measures. Statement of responsibility Our performance in 2018–19 I am responsible, as Chief Executive of Inland Revenue, for the preparation of the department’s financial statements, appropriation statements and end-of-year performance information and for the judgements made in them. The end-of-year performance information on each appropriation administered by the department is provided in accordance with sections 19A to 19C of the Public Finance Act 1989. I am responsible for the accuracy of any end-of-year performance information prepared by the department whether or not this information is included in this Annual Report. I am also responsible for the preparation of the department’s forecast financial statements, including the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions and all other required disclosures. I have the responsibility for establishing a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the integrity and reliability of financial reporting and the accuracy of our end-of-year performance information. In my opinion, these financial statements fairly reflect the financial position and operations of the department for the year ended 30 June 2019 and the forecast financial statements reflect the financial position and operations of the department for the year ending 30 June 2020.

Our outcome measures help us to track our performance in delivering our outcomes, which allows us to achieve our mission. Our three outcomes and the measures for each are discussed below. Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord The tax revenue we collect is used by the government to help pay for the public services, like education, roads and healthcare, that all New Zealanders benefit from. We have two measures for this outcome. Percentage of tax payments made by customers on time This measure relates to timely and cooperative behaviour of our customers, resulting in tax obligations being paid. This in turn contributes to revenue being collected to fund government programmes. The percentage of tax payments for income tax, PAYE and GST made by customers in full and on time has decreased slightly. We expect performance to return to previous levels next year as customers become familiar with our new systems and processes. This is also an output measure within our Services for Customers multi-category appropriation, and we have exceeded the target of 85%. 86.8 % 2015 86.3% 87.0%87.9%87.9%86.8% 2016201720182019 of tax payments were made by customers in full on time Total revenue assessed and forecast This is the amount of revenue assessed compared with the total revenue the Government expects to receive.

Percentage of tax refunds which are accurate We have an indicator for the accuracy of GST refunds, and we are developing an indicator for the accuracy of income tax refunds. We will continue work to develop accuracy indicators for social policy payments, using information from our new system starting from April 2019. 98.8 % of GST refunds had no amendment after the initial refund\* The result is for the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. \* Result for 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 was 98.1%.

Our customer experience index score of 66 in December 2018 was an increase from 63 in December 2017. The overall score for the public sector is 57. The customer experience index score measures how businesses rate their experience of dealing with government services. Results from working with others to deliver services for New Zealanders Best Start is a weekly payment of $60 per child, available to eligible parents with a baby due on or after 1 July 2018, no matter what their household income. Over $52 million has been paid to New Zealand families supporting over 47,000 children. Approximately 91% of customers are applying for Best Start through the SmartStart site, managed by the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA). We carried out a case study on the implementation of Best Start. Initially, around 17% of eligible customers were not applying for Best Start. A survey was sent to these customers to understand their reasons for not applying. The survey found that the majority were eligible for the payment, but they either thought their income was too high or did not understand the information provided to them and were concerned it may affect their other entitlements or benefits. We worked with DIA to improve the content on the SmartStart website to make it clear that Best Start is a universal payment in the first year, and to simplify the application form wording, making it easier for people to apply. We have seen the number of Working for Families Tax Credit registrations more than double as more customers applied for the Best Start payment. This outcome has two measures. The first is how customers view their experience when dealing with Inland Revenue and the second is how we worked with others to make applying for Best Start easier. 76Annual Report 2019 HOW WE PERFORMED Our impact measures show the difference we have made Our impact statements outline the difference we want to make to help achieve our mission. Our impact measures help us to understand our performance against these impacts. Making a difference in these areas helps us achieve our mission. We also have integrity measures to help us understand the level of trust and confidence people have in us. These measures have improved over the last year, which means more customers have trust and confidence in us. We have been supporting our customers to help them understand what the changes from Release 3 mean for them. Customers are using our new services, are responding to our communications and are increasingly using our online services. While our customers have adapted to these changes, they are still getting used to our new systems and processes. We aim to support our customers so they know what to do, find it easy and do what they need to. Our performance for each impact statement is discussed below. Customers know what to do We report on two measures for this impact. Percentage of customers who feel that they know what to do 87.8 % of customers feel they know what to do Results of campaigns, events and new products designed to improve customer awareness Helping customers understand payday filing Payday filing became mandatory for businesses from April 2019. We have been talking to our customers about the changes and what they need to do. As a result of our communications, by May 2019, 92% of businesses were aware of the changes we were making. Approximately 180,000 employers have filed 1.7 million payday returns since 1 April 2019. By 30 June 2019 around 90% of employers had filed a payday return. In February, we restarted our communication campaign to encourage individuals to find out what the changes in Release 3 meant for them. This was a continuation of the Changing for You campaign activity which began in November 2018. Over the course of the campaign, our Changing for You website had over 1.77 million visits, and customers updated over 500,000 bank accounts in myIR. A survey in July 2019 found that 84% of people were aware that any tax refunds would be paid automatically. Customers setting up their own instalment arrangements We completed a case study to look at the behaviour of customers who have set up instalment arrangements themselves compared to customers who have arrangements set up for them by Inland Revenue. From February 2017, customers could set up an instalment arrangement themselves online and have it automatically accepted. Customers who set up their own arrangements are more likely to comply with their obligations than customers who have had arrangements set up for them. From implementation to October 2018, 54% of customers who set up an instalment arrangement themselves had paid their debt in full, compared to 27% of customers who had an arrangement set up for them. 77 Customer time spent on tax compliance 27 hours is the median time small and medium-sized businesses spent on tax compliance activities 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 2004 55 hours 48 hours 36 hours 27 hours27 hours 2009201320162018 In late 2018 we conducted an online survey of 6,003 small businesses to estimate the time and cost of complying with tax requirements. Reducing compliance costs is one of the benefits of transformation that Inland Revenue has committed to delivering. Small to medium-sized businesses estimated they spent 27 hours each year meeting their tax obligations in 2018. This is unchanged since 2016 and is nine hours fewer than the estimate these businesses made in 2013, which is the baseline for measuring progress against. Percentage of customers satisfied with Inland Revenue’s overall accessibility and convenience 85.9 % of customers were satisfied with our overall accessibility and convenience 60 80 00 2015 88.2% 89.8% 87.3% 86.6% 85.9% 2016201720182019 Customers’ satisfaction with the overall accessibility and convenience remains high. Our customers are adapting to the changes under Release 3 and we have experienced high demand for our services across all channels. While there have been some issues, overall the new systems and processes are working well. Customers are using the new myIR service. From 26 April to the end of June 2019, there were 16.9 million logins to myIR, an increase of 90% from the same period in 2018, with more than 500,000 on the busiest day. We received 41% of all calls for the year between April and June. To manage the high volume of customer calls, we increased our temporary resources, worked overtime and moved as many people as possible from across our Customer and Compliance Services group to help answer phones. Customers find it easy We report on four measures for this impact. Percentage of customers that find it easy to deal with Inland Revenue 82.4 % of customers find it easy to deal with Inland Revenue 80 00 2015 83.1% 85.2% 81.8% 82.1%82.4% 2016201720182019 This result has increased in 2018–19 as customers become more familiar with our new online processes. 78Annual Report 2019 HOW WE PERFORMED Digital uptake In 2018–19 we introduced new digital uptake indicators to track if customers were shifting from paper to completing their activities online. As well as filing and paying online, customers can now set up payment plans and include attachments online. 88.8% of returns were filed electronically (income tax, GST and employer monthly schedules) 60 80 00 2015 67.4% 73.4% 78.5% 83.0% 88.8% 2016201720182019 As at 30 June 2019, 108,321 small to medium-sized enterprises and tax agents have used business accounting or payroll software to manage their obligations. Customers do what they need to We report on two measures for this impact. Percentage of tax payments made by customers on time 86.8% of tax payments were made by customers on time 60 80 100 2015 86.3% 87.0% 87.9%87.9% 86.8% 2016201720182019 The percentage of tax payments for income tax, PAYE and GST made by customers in full and on time has decreased slightly. We expect performance to return to previous levels next year as customers become familiar with our new systems and processes. This is also an output measure within our Services for Customers multi-category appropriation, and we have exceeded the target of 85%. Percentage of customers that provide information on time 85.2% of customers filed on time 80 100 2015 84.2% 85.1% 85.0% 85.4% 85.2% 2016201720182019 This year’s result is similar to last year as we continue to take a proactive approach to help customers file on time. This is also an output measure within our Services for Customers multi-category appropriation, and we have met the target of 85%. 79 We use intelligence and insight to improve customer outcomes and revenue We report on two measures for this impact. Improved customer outcomes Child support proactive engagement pilot From December 2017, we piloted a proactive approach to help new child support customers during their first four months. Our customer service officers provided information and advice to new child support customers, including follow-up calls before their first payment was due and referrals to other government services. Customers who helped us test this new service reported less effort, less emotional and financial stress and better attitudes towards paying child support. As a result of the pilot, there was a: 16% improvement in payments per assessment; 5% improvement in compliance; and a 40% improvement in our cost-effectiveness. We have now rolled out this proactive approach to all new child support customers. Reducing the stress of applying for child support During the year, we worked with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to help make applying for child support easier for MSD customers. We reduced our application form from eight pages to two. This means that parents applying for child support when they apply for a benefit now provide us with less information. Our original form asked for details that we already held through our information sharing agreement with MSD. Working with MSD, our project team piloted the new two-page form with customers from the Tauranga region. A new scanning process was implemented so that applications no longer need to be posted to us. We also updated the Child Support Administration Match agreement, which allows us to share and validate ad hoc information. We made the form easier for customers to complete by removing questions that asked for information which was already available. Our processing time has reduced by up to ten minutes. The shortened form will be released nationwide from late July 2019. Customer maturity score In 2016, we used the Forrester maturity framework to benchmark the extent to which we have put the customer at the centre of our plans (how customer-centric we were). We reassessed our customer-centric maturity score in 2018. We maintained an overall score of 3 out of 5 (‘understood’) on the Forrester scale. The Forrester scale for customer-centric maturity ranges from ‘ignored’ (a score of 1) to ‘passionate’ (a score of 5). The assessment is based on an internal survey. While this is the same score as in 2016, we know more about what it means to be customer-centric so our current score is a more accurate reflection of our maturity. 80Annual Report 2019 HOW WE PERFORMED We deliver evidence-based policy that is innovative and responsive to customer needs We report on two measures for this impact. Increased policy capability This year, we used the Policy Maturity Matrix developed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to assess our policy capability. Based on our recent self-assessment, we have a capability level of 2.3 out of 4.0. We have identified key capabilities that we aspire to have. We will focus on improving: • engagement with other agencies and stakeholders • the quality of policy advice with enhanced planning and project management and quality assurance • policy outcomes and building capability for the future. Reduction in time and costs to implement policy Research and Development Tax Credits In October 2018, the Government announced a research and development tax incentive to encourage businesses to invest in more research and development. Legislation for this was introduced in February 2019 and was enacted on 7 May 2019, with businesses able to claim tax credits from 1 April 2019. Implementation needed to begin before the legislation was passed so that agencies could support potential applicants. We worked in an agile and collaborative way with Callaghan Innovation and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to achieve the outcomes in the timeframe required. Implementing the accounting income method From April 2018, small businesses with a turnover of less than $5 million a year can work out their provisional tax using the accounting income method (AIM). AIM is a method for calculating provisional tax that was introduced in 2017. We adopted a pragmatic approach to developing and implementing AIM. By working closely with the accounting software providers who develop software for AIM, and by using a variety of communication channels to reach the widest number of people, we were able to implement AIM at a low cost to us. Because this was implemented in START, which is configurable, changes could be made later in the process than has previously been the case. We work with others to create better results for customers and government We report on two measures for this impact. Results are presented as case studies to demonstrate the outcomes from information sharing to improve results for customers and government. Results achieved through information sharing Since 2014, we have had an approved information sharing agreement (AISA) with New Zealand Police. It allows information to be shared about people or organisations such as companies or trusts. The information shared is used for the prevention, detection, investigation and providing evidence of, serious crimes. Approximately 67% of the information shared relates to individual people and 33% to others. For the 2019 financial year, information shared from the AISA resulted in 54 prosecutions, 73 ongoing investigations and 21 instances where no offence was found to be committed. The Gang Intelligence Centre AISA came into effect on 4 January 2019. It enables information and intelligence to be shared to reduce the harm caused by gangs, both to the public and within gang families. We are participating with 11 other agencies. 81 Results of international collaboration Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) with international tax treaty partners We have implemented the Common Reporting Standard, completing our first exchanges in 2018. We were one of 85 jurisdictions who exchanged financial account information. We sent financial account information to 52 jurisdictions and received information from 61 jurisdictions. The jurisdictions exchanging information in 2018 were required to ensure that all high-value and new accounts were reported on. We sent more than 600,000 account reports and received over 700,000 in return. We expect the number of accounts to increase significantly in 2019 when jurisdictions are required to report on pre-existing accounts. The account information we have received relates mainly to the 2017 calendar year. We are matching it with tax returns received for the 2018 fiscal year and to inform the design of compliance activities during 2019–20. Following Release 3, information about customers’ incomes, whether earned in New Zealand or overseas, is now held in one place. This will enable us to more effectively match the data received through AEOIs with information already held by us about customers. For more information on how we have contributed towards international capacity building, refer to page 47. Our integrity measures show how we protect the integrity of the tax and social policy system We protect the integrity of the tax and social policy system, and our stakeholders and the public have trust and confidence in us We report on two measures for integrity. Percentage of customers that have trust and confidence in us 88.1% of customers have trust and confidence in Inland Revenue 60 80 100 2015 87.0% 87.6% 87.7% 88.6% 88.1% 2016201720182019 The percentage of customers who have trust and confidence in us continues to stay steady. Comparative results and benchmarking Our RepZ score is 98 80 100 93 96 97 98 2016201720182019 The Public Sector Reputation Index (RepZ) measures the reputation of public sector organisations across four areas: trust, fairness, social responsibility and leadership. Our latest result of 98 is an increase by one point from the previous year. Our score has consistently improved from 93 in 2016. A score of 100 is average. A score of 95 and below is considered weak, while a score of 105 or higher is strong. 82Annual Report 2019 HOW WE PERFORMED Our organisational health measures show how we use our resources to deliver for our customers Engagement Staff engagement is 29% We measure employee engagement and perceptions of our culture through our culture and engagement surveys known as Kōrero Mai. We ran three short surveys this year, which went to a sample of people across the organisation. We are seeing the high level of change continue to impact on levels of employee engagement. Engagement is not where we want it to be. We know our success depends on our people, and we are committed to improving employee engagement. This includes continuing our focus on: • listening to, and connecting with, our people • embedding our performance approach, coaching and recognition • learning and development and capability uplift • supporting leaders and teams to work differently. The next full survey will run in October 2019. Diversity and inclusion We use two measures, representation and pay equity, to track our progress for diversity and inclusion at Inland Revenue. We intended to measure representation by comparing Inland Revenue’s ethnicities to the New Zealand working population. In the absence of New Zealand working population statistics we have compared our results against the public s e c tor. Ethnicities at Inland Revenue New Zealand (2013 Census) Inland Revenue (Human Resource Capability Report 2019) Public sector (Human Resource Capability Report 2018) European74.0%63.3%69.2% Māori 15.0%12.3%16.0% Asian12.0%16.0%10.1% Pasifika7.0%8.2%9.2% 83 Pay equity: the pay gap for gender at Inland Revenue Between 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2019, our average gender pay gap decreased from 20.3% to 18.0%. Our gender pay gap is largely explained by there being fewer women in higher-paid roles and more women in lower-paid roles. Women only make up 46% of the people who earn over $100,000, while they make up 69% of the people who earn under $100,000. Expenditure incurred against departmental appropriations Our work is funded through operating appropriations.

The ICR process is led by the Treasury. The assessment looks at several elements, including how we manage assets, projects, long-term investment planning, procurement and change. The results are scored A to E (high to low). The rating provides an indication of the level of confidence that investors (such as Cabinet and Ministers) can have in an agency’s ability to manage investments and assets. Following the A rating we received in 2016, we were assessed for the second time during 2018–19 and have retained the A rating. There were improvements to the assessment process between rounds which made it more rigorous. The Treasury acknowledged that maintaining an A rating is difficult and demonstrates our leadership in investment management amongst investment-intensive agencies. 85 Our output measures show how well we performed against the services we deliver This section reports on our performance against our targets, as included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2019 https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-05/est18-v5-reven.pdf Full details can be found on the Treasury’s website. We have included comparison of our performance information against the performance measures and results for 2017–18. Our performance targets for 2019–20 are also included to provide context to the 2018–19 results. We explain measures where we have not met the target or have achieved a result that was 15% greater than the target. Some performance measures are calculated using a sample of the customer population. We have marked these performance measures with a hash mark (#). All target and forecast figures in pages 86 to 98 are not subject to audit. Review of 2018–19 output performance measures and targets We have two categories of performance measures: primary and supporting. Our primary measures have a greater focus on what we are intending to achieve and show progress towards achieving our outcomes. The supporting measures are more operational in nature, providing additional information. We review our output measures each year to update or create new measures to reflect changes in our operating environment. In February 2018, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue approved a multi-category appropriation for our customer-centric services. This took effect from 1 July 2018 and reduced the number of departmental appropriations to four. We have lifted two of our customer satisfaction and perception measures as overarching measures within the Services for Customers multi-category appropriation because they reflect our overall performance, not just our performance in any one category. We retired one debt measure and updated our transformation programme milestones to reflect the agreed key programme milestones for 2018–19. This reduced the overall number of output measures from 50 in 2017–18 to 48 in 2018–19. 86Annual Report 2019 HOW WE PERFORMED Our services for customers The services we offer customers are covered by four categories within a multi-category appropriation: • Services to Inform the Public about Entitlements and Meeting Obligations • Services to Process Obligations and Entitlements • Management of Debt and Outstanding Returns • Investigations. 01. Services for Customers The single overarching purpose of this appropriation is to deliver a customer-centric, integrated tax and entitlement service experience for New Zealanders that is agile and intelligence-led. What we intend to achieve This appropriation is intended to ensure customers find it easy to meet their tax and social policy obligations and receive the payments they are entitled to.

There are four categories within the appropriation and the individual results are shown separately on pages 89, 91, 94 and 95. Services to Inform the Public About Entitlements and Meeting Obligations This category covers the provision of information and assistance to the public to make them aware of their obligations and entitlements. This also includes the provision of services to help Ministers fulfil their responsibilities to Parliament and the New Zealand public, other than policy decision-making responsibilities. 5.7 million customer service contacts 4 5 6 2015 5.7m 5.6m 5.5m 4.8m 5.7m 2016201720182019 35.7 million self-help service contacts 4 5 6 2015 23.2 29.3 32.6 32.7 35.7 2016201720182019 ActualActualUnauditedUnauditedUnaudited revisedbudgetforecast budget 20182019201920192020 $000$000$000$000$000 Revenue 605,547Revenue from the Crown590,740590,740623,240598,562 23,423Other revenue24,06925,63924,41924,639 628,970Total revenue614,809616,379647,659623,201 591,586Total expenses610,097616,379647,659623,201 37,384Net surplus/(deficit)4,712––– What it cost For the year ended 30 June 2019 88Annual Report 2019 HOW WE PERFORMED How we performed 2017–182018–192018–192019–20 ActualTa r g e tActualTa r g e t Primary measures 82.2%Percentage of customers who perceive that Inland Revenue does enough to inform them of their rights and obligations# 85%82.0%85% Not achieved—Our performance decreased slightly from last year.

To help our customers through Release 3 changes, we hired additional staff and worked overtime to ease the transition. We have seen an increase in customers using our self-help channels for their more straightforward transactions and contacting us directly for complex and comprehensive issues. Self-help customer contacts are not included in this measure. We are also focused on resolving customers’ issues at their first contact with us and being proactive in discussing customers’ broader business with them. Because of this, the calls we are receiving take longer and this is contributing to an increase in the average time and cost of each contact. 63.5%Percentage of telephone calls answered within two minutes75%57.2%Measure retired Not achieved— Call volumes were very high throughout the year and at times we were not able to answer all calls received.

Additional funding received from the Government for initiatives We used funds allocated in Budget 2012, Budget 2014 and Budget 2015 to carry out additional work in specific areas. Some of our work on Budget-specific initiatives focused on ageing debt, returns not filed by the due date and child support debt. The table below shows our return on investment (ROI) in these three areas. We have exceeded the ageing debt cash collected and unfiled returns revenue assessed targets for these programmes of work. This funding will end in 2020. Funding for the collection of unfiled returns received in Budget 2012, 2014 and 2015 has helped us achieve additional assessments to date totalling $1,030 million. As expected, the revenue collected in 2018–19 through the unfiled returns initiative was less than last year. We have been using a predictive model to select high-value unfiled returns. Our success with this has meant that we now have fewer of these high-value returns to target. Extra funding for child support aims to progressively increase the amount of debt repaid over a five-year period. The total cash target for this period is $130 million to $218 million. We collected $119 million. 94Annual Report 2019 HOW WE PERFORMED What it cost Output statement For the year ended 30 June 2019 ActualActualUnauditedUnauditedUnaudited revisedbudgetforecast budget 20182019201920192020 $000$000$000$000$000 Revenue 137,922Revenue from the Crown127,433127,433150,233129,197 1,298Other revenue1,7732,3132,0222,074 139,220Total revenue129,206129,746152,255131,271 131,625Total expenses119,258129,746152,255131,271 7,595Net surplus/(deficit)9,948––– Investigations This category covers undertaking investigation, audit and litigation activities administered by Inland Revenue.

Operating expenditure In 2018–19, we spent $830.9 million to operate our organisation. This was $14.8 million lower than our Government funding and other income. The lower spend is mainly due to the change in both the phasing and the delivery of the transformation programme and the organisational change required to deliver the transformation outcomes. Operating funding of $11.3 million in our Transformation multi-year appropriation will be transferred to 2019–20. Operating expenditure by cost categories Our expenditure includes personnel, operating, depreciation and amortisation, and capital charge and finance costs. Our total personnel costs for 2018–19 were $548.0 million. Approximately 76% of these costs were directly related to our employees’ remuneration costs. Operating costs for the year were $204.5 million. Approximately 76% of these operating costs relate to information technology, rental, communications and printing and postage. Comparing 2018–19 to 2017–18 Our personnel and operating costs were $20.3 million higher in 2018–19 than in 2017–18, mostly driven by increased activities for Release 3 of our transformation. $ million BREAKDOWN OF EXPENDITURE BY COST CATEGORY 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Capital charge and finance costs Depreciation and amortisation OperatingPersonnel 548 204 59 20 545 187 55 15 2017–18 2018–19 7% Depreciation and amortisation 25% Operating 66% Personnel 2% Capital charge and finance costs BREAKDOWN OF 2018–19 EXPENDITURE BY COST CATEGORY 104Annual Report 2019 HOW WE PERFORMED Capital expenditure We spent $107.8 million in capital investment in 2018–19. This was lower than our revised capital budget of $111.8 million, mainly due to savings in the delivery of our transformation programme. Also contributing to the lower spend are information technology initiatives now planned for 2019–20, savings in construction of our new sites in Ahuriri Napier and Kirikiriroa Hamilton, and the re-phasing of the construction of our new Te Papaioea Palmerston North site and our Manukau front-of-house service area. Unused capital funding will be carried forward into our 2019–20 capital reserve. Future outlook Our operating and capital expenditure are forecast to increase in 2019–20 to align with the phasing and delivery of our business transformation. Operating expenditure for 2019–20 is forecast to be $876.8 million, an increase of $46.0 million from 2018–19. Capital expenditure for 2019–20 is forecast to be $150.0 million, an increase of $42.1 million. The capital investment contributes to the growth of our net assets to $483.5 million from $382.3 million in 2018–19, and is mostly driven by more intangible assets as we further transform the organisation. 105 Appropriation statements The following statements report information about the expenses and capital expenditure incurred against each appropriation administered by Inland Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2019.

Capital commitments Capital commitments are the aggregate amount of capital expenditure contracted for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that has not been paid for or recognised as a liability at balance date. Cancellable capital commitments that have early exit or penalty costs explicit in the agreement are reported at the lower of the remaining contractual commitment and the value of those penalty or exit costs (i.e. the minimum future payments). Non-cancellable operating lease commitments Inland Revenue leases property, plant and equipment in the normal course of business. The majority of these commitments are long-term non-cancellable accommodation leases for Inland Revenue’s premises at locations throughout New Zealand. The annual lease payments are reviewed regularly, and the amounts disclosed as future commitments are based on current rental rates. The total minimum future sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases at balance date is $3.261 million (2018: $6.310 million). Inland Revenue’s non-cancellable operating leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. There are no restrictions placed on Inland Revenue by any of its leasing arrangements. 117 Statement of contingent liabilities and contingent assets As at 30 June 2019 ActualActual 20182019 $000 $000 Contingent liabilities 70Employee grievances147 560Legal proceedings and disputes-taxpayer465 630Total contingent liabilities612 Contingent assets 2,238Legal proceedings and disputes-taxpayer1,860 2,238Total contingent assets1,860 The accompanying accounting policies and notes form part of these financial statements. Contingent liabilities Employee grievances These contingent liabilities represent amounts that may be claimed by employees as a result of alleged grievances against Inland Revenue. Legal proceedings and disputes—taxpayer These contingent liabilities relate to potential claims against Inland Revenue for court costs associated with tax disputes and other legal proceedings being taken through the courts against taxpayers. They only relate to court costs. The actual revenue (tax) under dispute is recognised as a non-departmental contingency (refer to the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets on page 152). The expected value of the contingent liabilities is calculated using an outcome probability model that considers both the total potential liability and the probability of that outcome. Contingent assets Legal proceedings and disputes—taxpayer These contingent assets relate to potential amounts recoverable by Inland Revenue for court costs associated with tax disputes and other legal proceedings being taken through the courts against taxpayers. They only relate to court costs. The actual revenue (tax) under dispute is recognised as a non-departmental contingency (refer to the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets on page 152). The expected value of the contingent assets is calculated using an outcome probability model that considers both the total potential court costs recoverable and the probability of that outcome. 118Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2019 These financial statements are for the year ended 30 June 2019 and include forecast financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2020.

Basis of preparation Reporting entity Inland Revenue is a government department as defined by section 2 of the Public Finance Act 1989 and is domiciled and operates in New Zealand. The relevant legislation governing Inland Revenue’s operations is the Public Finance Act 1989. Inland Revenue is a wholly owned entity of the Crown whose primary objective is to provide services to the public rather than to make a financial return. Accordingly, Inland Revenue has designated itself as a Public Benefit Entity (PBE) for financial reporting purposes. Reporting period The reporting period for these financial statements is for the year ended 30 June 2019. The forecast financial statements are for the year ending 30 June 2020. The Chief Executive and Commissioner of Inland Revenue authorised these financial statements on 30 September 2019. Statement of compliance The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989, which includes the requirement to comply with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice (NZ GAAP), and the Treasury instructions. Inland Revenue has applied the Tier 1 Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PBE IPSAS) in preparing the 30 June 2019 financial statements. Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and the accounting policies set out below and in the notes to the financial statements have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless otherwise stated. The accrual basis of accounting has been used. Functional and presentation currency These financial statements are presented in New Zealand dollars, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000). The functional currency of Inland Revenue is New Zealand dollars. Accounting standards adopted early In line with the Financial Statements of the Government, Inland Revenue has elected to adopt PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments early. PBE IFRS 9 replaces PBE IPSAS 29 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Information about the adoption of PBE IFRS 9 is provided in note 20. Accounting standards issued and not yet effective Standards and amendments, issued but not yet effective, that have not been adopted early are: PBE IPSAS 2 Statement of Cash Flows The amendments to PBE IPSAS 2 require entities to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, with early application permitted. Inland Revenue does not intend to adopt the amendments early. PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments The External Reporting Board issued PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments in March 2019. This standard supersedes PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which was issued as an interim standard. It is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Inland Revenue does not intend to adopt PBE IPSAS 41 early. When this standard is adopted, Inland Revenue does not expect any significant changes as the requirements are similar to PBE IFRS 9. PBE FRS 48 Service Performance Reporting PBE FRS 48 replaces the service performance reporting requirements of PBE IPSAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. Inland Revenue has not yet determined how the application of PBE FRS 48 will affect its statement of performance and does not intend to adopt PBE FRS 48 early. 120Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Estimations and judgements In preparing these financial statements, judgements, estimates and assumptions have been made concerning the future. These judgements, estimates, and their associated assumptions may differ from the subsequent actual results. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and other factors. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The main estimations and judgements that are relevant to Inland Revenue’s financial statements are disclosed in note 9 (Property, plant and equipment), note 10 (Intangible assets) and note 13 (Employee entitlements). Accounting policies Significant accounting policies are included in the notes to which they relate. Significant accounting policies that do not relate to a specific note and which materially affect the measurement of financial results, the financial position and output statements within the How we performed section are outlined below. Goods and services tax All amounts in the financial statements and appropriation and output statements are exclusive of goods and services tax (GST), except for debtor Crown, net debtors and accounts payable, which are stated on a GST-inclusive basis. Where GST is not recoverable as input tax, it is recognised as part of the related asset or expense. The net amount of GST owing or due at balance date, being the difference between output GST and input GST, is included in creditors and other payables in the Statement of financial position. The net GST paid or received, including the GST relating to investing and financing activities, is classified as an operating cash flow in the Statement of cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed exclusive of GST. Income tax Government departments are exempt from income tax as public authorities. No charge for income tax has been provided for. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in transit, and funds held in the bank accounts. All cash held in bank accounts is held in on demand accounts and no interest is payable to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue is only permitted to spend its cash and cash equivalents within the scope and limits of its appropriations. Foreign currency transactions Inland Revenue’s activities expose it to the risks of changes in foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency transactions (including those for which forward exchange contracts are held) are translated into New Zealand dollars using the spot exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the financial results. Cost allocations Inland Revenue uses an integrated cost allocation process to derive the cost of its outputs. This process involves the initial costing of business processes followed by the full costing of outputs. Business processes represent Inland Revenue’s key functional activities. These business processes are used to capture direct costs. Direct personnel costs are charged to business processes based on actual hours and standard activity rates. Other related direct costs, including depreciation, are allocated to business processes based on planned hours or relevant activity drivers. Accommodation lease costs are charged to business processes based on headcount and relevant activities. Other indirect costs and corporate overheads that cannot be attributed directly to a business process are apportioned to outputs based on the weighted planned hours per relevant business process, with different drivers in place where appropriate. There have been no material changes in cost allocation policies since the date of the last audited financial statements. 121 Comparatives When the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements are amended or accounting policies are changed, comparative figures are restated to ensure consistency with the current period, unless it is impractical to do so. Changes in accounting policies There is a change to the accounting policy relating to the estimate of the allowance for credit losses as set out in note 11. Budget and forecast figures The budget, revised budget, and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP, using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing these financial statements. The budget and forecast figures are not subject to audit. The budget figures for 2018–19 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2019. The revised budget figures for 2018–19 (refer to the Statements of budgeted and actual expenses and capital expenditure incurred against appropriations on page 105) are those included in The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2019. The forecast figures for 2019–20 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2020. The forecast financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989 to communicate forecast financial information for accountability purposes. They are compliant with PBE Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements. Forecast policies The forecasts have been compiled on the basis of existing government policies and ministerial expectations at the time the statements were finalised and reflect all government decisions up to 1 May 2019. While Inland Revenue regularly updates its forecasts, updated forecast financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2020 will not be published. The main assumptions are as follows: • Other than the work to progress the Business Transformation programme, Inland Revenue’s main activities will remain substantially the same as for the previous year. • Operating costs are based on historical information and Inland Revenue’s best estimates of future costs to be incurred for the delivery of our services and the Business Transformation programme. • Estimated year-end information for 2018–19 is used as the opening position for the 2019–20 forecasts. Any changes to budgets during 2019–20 will be incorporated into The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2020. Variations to forecast The actual financial results for the forecast period covered are likely to vary from the information presented in these forecasts. Factors that may lead to a material difference between information in these forecast financial statements and the actual reported results include: • changes due to initiatives approved by Cabinet • technical adjustments to the budget including transfers between financial years • the timing of expenditure relating to significant programmes and projects. 122Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Where our income came from Note 2. Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable. Revenue is recognised as follows: Revenue from the Crown Revenue from the Crown transactions are considered to be non-exchange transactions. Revenue from the Crown is measured based on Inland Revenue’s funding entitlement for the reporting period. The funding entitlement is established by Parliament when it passes the Appropriation Acts for the financial year. The amount of revenue recognised takes into account any amendments to appropriations approved in the Appropriation (Supplementary Estimates) Act for the year and certain other unconditional funding adjustments formally approved prior to balance date. Inland Revenue can incur expenses only within the scope and limits of its appropriations. The fair value of revenue from the Crown is considered equivalent to the funding entitlement. Explanation of major variance from budget Revenue from the Crown was lower than budget by $138.711 million. The variance is due to the changes in the phasing and delivery of both the Business Transformation programme and the organisational change required to deliver the programme outcomes. Other revenue Other revenue transactions as outlined below are considered to be exchange transactions. Revenue from recoveries Revenue from recoveries is recognised as revenue when earned. Sale of services The sale of services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are provided. Rental revenue from sub-leases Rental revenue from sub-leased property is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Operating Operating expenses are recognised as an expense in the period to which they relate. Operating leases A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset. Accommodation lease rentals payable under operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Lease incentives received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognised evenly over the term of the lease as a reduction in the rental expense. 125 Note 5. Contractors and consultants Inland Revenue uses contractors and consultants to provide backfill for vacant positions or cover short-term demand, where specialist skills or independent external advice are needed (such as specialist skills needed for our Business Transformation programme), and in periods of peak demand. A contractor is a person who is not considered an employee, providing backfill or extra capacity in a role that exists within Inland Revenue, or acts as an additional resource for a time-limited piece of work. A consultant is a person or firm who is not considered a contractor or employee, engaged to perform a piece of work with a clearly defined scope and provide expertise, in a particular field, not readily available from within Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue has elected to disclose contractors and consultants information separately as below in accordance with the State Services Commission (SSC) guidance: The difference between the amounts in the table above, and the contractors and consultants expense in notes 3 and 4 respectively, is because the financial statement definitions vary slightly to the SSC definitions. For example, fees paid for legal services and amounts paid to other government agencies are excluded for SSC purposes. Note 6. Capital charge Inland Revenue pays a capital charge to the Crown on taxpayers’ funds as at 30 June and 31 December each year. This is recognised as an expense in the period to which the charge relates. The capital charge rate for the year ended 30 June 2019 was 6.0% (2018: 6.0%).

Taxpayers’ funds Taxpayers’ funds are the Crown’s net investment in Inland Revenue. Taxpayers’ funds are divided and categorised into a number of components: • total comprehensive revenue and expense • repayment of surplus to the Crown • capital injections • capital withdrawals. Capital management Inland Revenue’s capital is its taxpayers’ funds and is represented by net assets. Inland Revenue manages its revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and general financial dealings prudently. Inland Revenue’s taxpayers’ funds are largely managed as a by-product of managing revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and compliance with the Government Budget processes, the Treasury instructions and the Public Finance Act 1989. The objective of managing Inland Revenue’s taxpayers’ funds is to ensure that Inland Revenue effectively achieves its agreed outcomes, and remains a going concern. Note 8. Surplus payable to the Crown The surplus is required to be paid to the Crown by 31 October of each year. 127 Assets used to deliver our services Note 9. Property, plant and equipment Inland Revenue has operational assets that include IT equipment, furniture and office equipment, motor vehicles and leasehold improvements. The capitalisation thresholds are: • IT equipment$500 and over (excluding pooled assets) • FurnitureNo threshold • Office equipment$500 and over (excluding pooled assets) • Motor vehicles$500 and over • Leasehold improvements No threshold Certain items of IT equipment, furniture and office equipment, which are low value and high quantity, such as chairs and IT monitors, are pooled together. All pooled assets are capitalised. Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost is the value of consideration given to acquire or create the asset and includes any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. Additions The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to Inland Revenue beyond one year, and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. In most instances an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised at its cost. Where an asset is acquired through a non-exchange transaction, it is recognised at fair value as at the date of acquisition. Subsequent costs Subsequent costs are capitalised when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to Inland Revenue beyond one year and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance are expensed. Depreciation Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all property, plant and equipment, other than assets under construction. The rate of depreciation will reduce the value of the asset to the estimated residual value over the useful life of the asset. The useful lives of major classes of assets have been estimated as: • IT equipment3 to 5 years • Furniture3 to 10 years • Office equipment5 to 10 years • Motor vehicles5 years • Leasehold improvements 3 to 10 years All property, plant and equipment other than motor vehicles are assumed to have no residual value. Motor vehicles are assumed to have a 20% residual value. The cost of leasehold improvements is capitalised and depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated remaining useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter, up to a maximum of 10 years. Assets under construction are recognised at cost less impairment and are not depreciated. The total cost of a capital project is transferred to the appropriate asset class on its completion and then depreciated. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance date. Disposals Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are recognised on a net basis in the surplus or deficit. 128Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL IT equipmentFurniture and office equipment Motor vehicles Leasehold improvements Assets under construction —leasehold Total tangible assets 2019$000$000$000$000$000$000 Cost Opening balance as at 1 July 201837,82722,9053,44058,9242,384125,480 Additions by purchase6,4232,247–4,9872,42016,077 Transfers between category–––2,006(2,006)– Disposals(11,341)(219)(125)(2,600)–(14,285) Closing balance as at 30 June 201932,90924,9333,31563,3172,798127,272 Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses Opening balance as at 1 July 201829,34118,4972,24039,0082089,106 Depreciation expense5,3141,4343766,315–13,439 Depreciation capitalised 1 (46)––(2)–(48) Disposals(11,312)(216)(90)(2,508)–(14,126) Closing balance as at 30 June 201923,29719,7152,52642,8132088,371 Carrying amount as at 30 June 20199,6125,218789 20,5042,77838,901 2018 Cost Opening balance as at 1 July 201743,66423,0953,44054,5214,447129,167 Additions by purchase4,039291–5071,9076,744 Transfers between category19––3,970(3,970)19 Disposals(9,895)(481)–(74)–(10,450) Closing balance as at 30 June 201837,82722,9053,44058,9242,384125,480 Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses Opening balance as at 1 July 201735,39517,5411,85532,7452087,556 Depreciation expense3,8291,3863856,291–11,891 Depreciation capitalised¹12––2–14 Disposals(9,895)(430)–(30)–(10,355) Closing balance as at 30 June 201829,34118,4972,24039,0082089,106 Carrying amount as at 30 June 20188,4864,4081,20019,9162,36436,374 1 Refers to the depreciation expense for existing assets that are used in the development of intangible assets. 129 Impairment Property, plant and equipment that have a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Property, plant and equipment are also reviewed annually for indicators of impairment at each balance date. Assets under construction are tested for impairment at each balance date. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable service amount. The recoverable service amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. Value in use is the present value of the asset’s remaining service potential. Value in use is determined based on either the depreciated replacement cost or the restoration cost, depending on the nature of the impairment and the availability of information. If an asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable service amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable service amount. The impairment loss and any reversal of impairment loss are recognised in the surplus or deficit. Note 10. Intangible assets Inland Revenue has intangible assets in the form of internally generated software and business process design assets and software licences. All intangible assets have finite useful lives. Internally generated intangible assets There are two types of internally generated intangible assets: computer software and processes. The cost of internally developed computer software and processes comprises direct labour, materials purchased and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. These costs are associated with the development of identifiable and unique software controlled by Inland Revenue, which will generate future economic benefits beyond one year. Expenditure on development activities where research findings are applied to a plan or design for new or substantially improved processes is capitalised if the processes are technically and commercially feasible. Any other development costs are expensed. Costs incurred on research of an internally generated intangible asset are expensed. Where the research phase cannot be distinguished from the development phase, the total cost is expensed. Costs associated with maintaining internally generated computer software are expensed. Costs of configuring and customising commercial off- the-shelf software are capitalised. Costs associated with the ongoing development and maintenance of Inland Revenue’s existing websites are expensed. Staff training costs are expensed. Software licences Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and be able to use the specific software. Costs associated with supporting and maintaining computer software licences are expensed. The capitalisation thresholds for intangible assets are: • Internally generated intangible assets$50,000 and over • Software licences $5,000 and over Additions Intangible assets are initially recorded at cost and subsequently recorded at historical cost less amortisation and impairment losses. 130Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Amortisation The carrying value of an intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Amortisation begins when the asset is available for use and ceases when the asset no longer has a recognisable value. The amortisation charge is expensed. The useful lives of major classes of intangible assets have been estimated as: • Internally generated intangible assets 3 to 15 years • Software licences 3 to 15 years Assets under construction are recognised at cost less impairment and are not amortised. The total cost of a capital project is transferred to the appropriate asset class on its completion and then amortised. The assets’ useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance date. The gain or loss arising from the disposal of an intangible asset forms part of the surplus or deficit. Impairment Intangible assets that have a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are also reviewed annually for indicators of impairment at each balance date. Assets under construction are tested for impairment at each balance date. For further details refer to the policy for impairment of property, plant and equipment in note 9. The same approach applies to the impairment of intangible assets. Estimating the useful lives of intangible assets The useful lives of intangible assets are based on: • management’s view of the expected period over which Inland Revenue will receive benefits • historical experience with similar assets • anticipation of future events, which may impact their useful lives, such as changes in technology. 131 Internally generated intangible assets Software licences Assets under construction —intangibles Total intangible assets 2019$000$000$000$000 Cost Opening balance as at 1 July 2018654,969106,61144,112805,692 Additions by purchase59,40584221,27481,521 Additions internally developed7,316–2,87410,190 Transfers between category34,899–(34,899)– Disposals(53,741)(5,976)–(59,717) Closing balance as at 30 June 2019702,848101,47733,361837,686 Accumulated amortisation and impairment losses Opening balance as at 1 July 2018489,29981,6223,617574,538 Amortisation expense39,0964,973–44,069 Amortisation capitalised 1 6––6 Impairment losses1,304––1,304 Disposals(53,650)(5,954)–(59,604) Closing balance as at 30 June 2019476,05580,6413,617560,313 Carrying amount as at 30 June 2019226,793 20,83629,744277,373 2018 Cost Opening balance as at 1 July 2017584,639108,30936,112729,060 Additions by purchase48,3218,106–56,427 Additions internally developed9,099–31,42240,521 Transfers between category24,040(637)(23,422)(19) Disposals(11,130)(9,167)–(20,297) Closing balance as at 30 June 2018654,969106,61144,112805,692 Accumulated amortisation and impairment losses Opening balance as at 1 July 2017462,30385,8803,617551,800 Amortisation expense36,2756,045–42,320 Impairment losses391––391 Transfers between category1,218(1,218)–– Disposals(10,888)(9,085)–(19,973) Closing balance as at 30 June 2018489,29981,6223,617574,538 Carrying amount as at 30 June 2018165,67024,98940,495231,154 1 Refers to the amortisation expense for existing assets that are used in the development of intangible assets. There is no restriction over the title of Inland Revenue’s intangible assets nor are any intangible assets pledged as security for liabilities. Our intangible assets are mainly related to the START core revenue system and supporting infrastructure. Of the $277.373 million carrying value for intangibles $229.012 million relates to the development of the START tax and social policy management system and supporting infrastructure assets. The estimated remaining period for the START assets is 13 years. 132Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Explanation of major variances against budget Intangible assets are $43.060 million lower than budget due to the re-phasing of the capital plan for the Business Transformation programme to align with the updated delivery approach. Note 11. Debtors and prepayments Accounts receivable and other debtors transactions are considered to be exchange transactions. Allowance for credit losses Debtors and receivables are recorded at their face value, less an allowance for credit losses. Inland Revenue applies the simplified expected credit loss model of recognising lifetime expected credit losses for receivables. In measuring credit losses, receivables have been assessed on a collective basis as they possess shared credit risk characteristics. They have been grouped based on the days past due. Short-term receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include the debtor being in liquidation. Previous accounting for allowance for credit losses In the previous year, the allowance for credit losses was based on the incurred credit loss model. An allowance for credit losses was recognised only when there was objective evidence that the amount due would not be fully collected.

The expected credit loss rates for accounts receivable at 30 June 2019 and 1 July 2018 are based on the payment profile of receivables over the previous periods and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced for that period. The historical loss rates are adjusted for current and forward-looking economic factors that might affect the recoverability of receivables. There have been no changes during the reporting period in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions used in measuring the expected credit loss allowance. No adjustments were made to the prior year allowance for credit losses. Movements in the allowance for credit losses are as follows: Expected credit loss rate Gross carrying amount Lifetime expected credit loss 2019 $000$000 Not past due0.08%2,5352 Past due 1 to 30 days–72– Past due 31 to 60 days–64– Past due 61 to 90 days–89– Past due > 90 days8.52%1,442123 To t a ln/a4,202125 1 July 2018 Not past due–3,002– Past due 1 to 30 days–78– Past due 31 to 60 days–99– Past due 61 to 90 days–120– Past due > 90 days0.40%1,0174 To t a ln/a4,3164 The allowance for credit losses at 30 June 2019 and 1 July 2018 was determined as follows: 134Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL ActualActual 20182019 $000 $000 Creditors and other payables—exchange transactions 10,294Accounts payable11,582 44,260Accrued expenses—other40,810 54,554Total creditors and other payables—exchange transactions52,392 Creditors and other payables—non-exchange transactions 12,849GST payable8,031 12,849Total creditors and other payables—non-exchange transactions8,031 67,403Total creditors and other payables60,423 Creditors and other payables are normally settled on 30-day terms, therefore the carrying value of creditors and other payables approximates their fair value. Explanation of major variances against budget Creditors and other payables were $9.823 million above budget due to the timing of suppliers’ payments for the Business Transformation programme. Liabilities incurred by Inland Revenue Note 12. Creditors and other payables Creditors and other payables due within 12 months are recognised at their nominal value, unless the effect of discounting is material. Creditors and other payables due beyond 12 months are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, where applicable. Note 13. Employee entitlements Current entitlements Employee entitlements that Inland Revenue expects to be settled within 12 months of balance date are measured at nominal value based on accrued entitlements at current rates of pay. These include salaries and wages accrued up to balance date, annual leave and time off in lieu earned up to but not yet taken at balance date, and retiring and long-service leave entitlements expected to be settled within 12 months. Inland Revenue recognises a liability for sick leave to the extent that absences in the coming year are expected to be greater than the sick leave entitlements earned in the coming year. The amount is calculated based on the unused sick leave entitlement that can be carried forward at balance date, to the extent that Inland Revenue anticipates it will be used by staff to cover those future absences. Inland Revenue recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where it is contractually obliged to pay them or where a past practice has created a constructive obligation and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Non-current entitlements Employee entitlements that are payable beyond 12 months, such as long-service leave and retiring leave, have been calculated on an actuarial basis. Other provisions include an allowance to meet requirements of the Holidays Act 2003 and other operational employee matters. 135 ActualActual 20182019 $000 $000 Current liabilities—exchange transactions 27,128Annual leave28,066 8,677Accrued salaries and wages8,774 3,565Retiring leave3,830 2,018Other provision2,571 4,178Termination benefits2,487 1,339Sick leave1,539 1,478Long-service leave1,440 2Time off in lieu2 48,385Total current liabilities—exchange transactions48,709 Non-current liabilities—exchange transactions 20,948Retiring leave22,530 6,021Long-service leave6,570 1,424Other provision1,584 28,393Total non-current liabilities—exchange transactions30,684 76,778Total employee entitlements79,393 Explanation of major variances against budget Provisions for employee entitlements were $5.044 million lower than budget. The decrease is mainly due to the forecast reduction in our workforce as we transform our business, offset by the market changes to valuation assumptions. Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when an employee’s employment contract is terminated before their normal retirement or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Inland Revenue recognises the expense when it is demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees, according to a detailed formal plan without the possibility of withdrawal, or as a result of an offer for voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits to be settled within 12 months are reported at the amount expected to be paid. Otherwise they are reported as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows, where applicable. 136Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL ActualActual 20182019 $000 $000 Termination benefits 119Opening balance as at 1 July4,178 14,641Additional provisions made853 (10,463)Amounts used(2,443) (119)Unused amounts reversed(101) 4,178Closing balance as at 30 June 20192,487 ActualActual 20182019 $000 $000 Other employee entitlements provision 3,442Opening balance as at 1 July3,442 –Additional provisions made713 3,442Closing balance as at 30 June 20194,155 Measuring retiring and long-service leave liabilities The actuarial calculations for long-service leave and retiring leave liabilities are based on: • employee contractual entitlements • years of service accrued to balance date and years remaining to entitlement • the present value of the estimated future cash outflows using an applicable discount rate and salary inflation rate. Sick leave, annual leave and vested long-service leave are classified as a current liability. Non-vested long-service leave and retiring leave liabilities expected to be settled within 12 months of balance date are also classified as a current liability. All other long-service leave and retiring leave is classified as a non-current liability. The present value of retiring and long-service leave obligations depend on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis by an independent actuary. Key assumptions used in calculating liabilities are the discount rate and salary inflation. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of the liabilities. The discount rates used by the independent actuary for the retiring and long-service leave valuations are based on the Treasury published forward rates at 30 June 2019. The forward rates are derived from New Zealand government bonds. The long-term salary inflation assumption is based on the Treasury published rates at 30 June 2019 and after obtaining advice from the independent actuary. The long-term salary inflation assumption used was 2.34% (2018: 2.50%).

Other liabilities Provision for other liabilities Inland Revenue recognises a provision for future payments of uncertain amounts or timing where there is a present obligation (either legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable that a payment will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are not recognised for net deficits from future operating activities. Provisions are recorded at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions to be settled beyond 12 months are recorded at their present value and are discounted using market yields on government bonds at balance date with terms to maturity that match, as closely as possible, the estimated timing of the future cash flows, where applicable. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense and is included in finance expense.

Other financial liabilities greater than 12 months are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, where applicable. Other financial liabilities relate to unexpired lease incentives with a carrying amount of $0.701 million at 30 June 2019 (2018: $1.085 million). Refer to note 4 for the accounting policy on lease incentives. Other disclosures Note 15. Related party transactions and key management personnel Inland Revenue is a wholly owned entity of the Crown. The government significantly influences the role of Inland Revenue, as well as being its major source of revenue. Related party disclosures have not been made for transactions with related parties that are within a normal supplier or client/recipient relationship on terms and conditions no more or less favourable than those where it is reasonable to expect that Inland Revenue would have adopted in dealing with the party at arm’s length in the same circumstances. Further, transactions with other government agencies (for example, government departments and Crown entities) are not disclosed as related party transactions when they are consistent with the normal operating arrangements between government agencies and undertaken on the normal terms and conditions for such transactions. Inland Revenue has no related party transactions that are required to be disclosed in 2019 (2018: nil). Remuneration to key management personnel The remuneration of key management personnel during the year was as follows: RemunerationRemunerationFull-time EquivalentsFull-time Equivalents 2019201820192018 $000$000 Leadership team, including 4,742 the Chief Executive (Commissioner)4,6731111.3 The key management personnel remuneration disclosure includes the Chief Executive (Commissioner), six Deputy Commissioners, Chief Tax Counsel, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief People Officer and those formally acting in those positions during the financial year. The Commissioner’s remuneration is determined and paid by the State Services Commission. The remuneration disclosure excludes the Minister of Revenue. The Minister’s remuneration and other benefits are set out by the Remuneration Authority, are not received only for their role as a member of key management personnel of Inland Revenue and are not paid by Inland Revenue. 139 Note 16.

Derivative financial instruments For certain foreign currency transactions Inland Revenue uses derivative financial instruments (foreign currency forward exchange contracts) to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are entered into with the New Zealand Debt Management Office (NZDMO). The use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is governed by Inland Revenue’s foreign exchange policy, which provides principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with Inland Revenue’s risk management strategy. Inland Revenue does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. It has not adopted hedge accounting. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently restated at fair value at each balance date. They are reported as either assets or liabilities, depending on whether the derivative is in a net gain or net loss position, respectively. Movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the financial result. Derivative financial instruments are classified as current if the contract is due for settlement within 12 months of balance date. Otherwise the full fair value is classified as non-current. The net fair value of derivative financial instruments is $1.492 million as at 30 June 2019 (2018: $2.658 million). 140Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL The notional principal amount of outstanding forward exchange contract derivatives as at 30 June 2019 was NZ $23.819 million (2018: NZ $49.877 million). The contracts consisted of the purchase of US $14.979 million (2018: US $31.858 million). The unrealised gain on the forward exchange contract derivatives was NZ $1.166 million at 30 June 2019 (2018: unrealised gain of $5.601 million). The majority of the forward exchange contracts relate to future expenditure requirements for the Business Transformation programme. Note 18. Financial instruments—fair value hierarchy disclosures For those instruments recognised at fair value in the Statement of financial position, fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy: • quoted market price (level 1)—financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets • valuation technique using observable inputs (level 2)—financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable • valuation techniques with significant non-observable inputs (level 3)—financial instruments valued using models where one or more significant inputs is not observable. The following table analyses the basis of the valuation of classes of financial instruments measured at fair value. The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been determined using discounted cash flows based on quoted market prices. ActualActual 2018Valuation technique2019 $000Level 2—observable inputs $000 Financial liabilities 2,658Forward foreign exchange contracts (net)1,492 Note 19. Financial instruments—financial instrument risks Inland Revenue’s activities expose it to a variety of financial instrument risks, including market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. Inland Revenue has policies to manage the risks associated with financial instruments and seeks to minimise exposure from financial instruments. These policies do not allow Inland Revenue to enter into any transactions that are speculative in nature. Market risk Currency risk The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is called currency risk. Inland Revenue purchases fixed assets and services from overseas suppliers and it is therefore exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily for United States and Australian dollars. Under its foreign exchange policy, Inland Revenue enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures when single foreign exchange transactions exceed NZ $100,000 or the transaction exposure for an individual currency exceeds NZ $100,000. This policy has been approved by the Treasury and is in line with the requirements of the Treasury’s Guidelines for the Management of Crown and Departmental Foreign-Exchange Exposure. Sensitivity analysis Assuming that all other variables remained constant, the impact on the surplus of a 5% increase/decrease in the New Zealand dollar against various other currencies held by Inland Revenue in its foreign currency account at 30 June 2019 would be a $1.448 million decrease and a $1.601 million increase respectively. 141 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate, or the cash flows from a financial instrument will fluctuate, due to changes in market interest rates. Inland Revenue has no interest-bearing financial instruments, so it has no exposure to interest rate risk. Credit risk The risk that a third party will default on its obligations to Inland Revenue, causing a loss to be incurred is called credit risk. In the normal course of its business, credit risk from receivables is concentrated with the Crown and other government agencies but not with any individual agencies. The carrying amount of financial assets recognised in the Statement of financial position best represents Inland Revenue’s maximum exposure to credit risk at balance date. Inland Revenue does not require any collateral, security or other credit enhancements to support financial instruments with financial institutions that it deals with, because these entities have high credit ratings. Westpac is Inland Revenue’s main bank and has a Standard and Poor’s credit rating of AA–. Inland Revenue enters into foreign currency transactions with the New Zealand Debt Management Office (Standard and Poor’s credit rating of AA). For its other financial instruments, Inland Revenue does not have significant concentrations of credit risk. The carrying amount of financial assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated is not material. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Inland Revenue will encounter difficulty raising liquid funds to meet commitments as they fall due. As all but an insignificant proportion of funds come from the New Zealand Government and cash is drawn down on a fortnightly basis, Inland Revenue does not have significant liquidity risk. In meeting its liquidity requirements, Inland Revenue closely monitors its forecast cash requirements with expected cash drawdowns from the New Zealand Debt Management Office. Inland Revenue maintains a target level of available cash to meet liquidity requirements.

Adoption of PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Accounting policies have been updated to comply with PBE IFRS 9. The main change is described in note 11, debtors and prepayments to reflect that the impairment of receivables is now determined by applying an expected credit loss model. Prior year amounts remain unchanged. Note 21. Events after balance date There have been no significant events after balance date. 143 IMAGE TBC Financial Schedules Non-departmental Hōtaka pūtea Wāhi kē 144Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL Why we include non-departmental schedules Inland Revenue collects and distributes money on behalf of the Crown and the following non-departmental schedules provide information on the financial extent of these activities. The Commissioner is accountable for the financial management of these activities. In 2018–19 we collected $79.5 billion of revenue on behalf of New Zealand to fund government programmes. We paid $5.5 billion in non- departmental expenses including Working for Families Tax Credits, KiwiSaver member tax credits, interest and other expenses. What non-departmental schedules are and are not The non-departmental schedules are prepared in accordance with relevant accounting policies and Treasury instructions to disclose non- departmental activities. The non-departmental schedules do not, and are not intended to, constitute a set of financial statements and therefore do not include elements that would normally be expected to be found in financial statements, such as details of a surplus or deficit, or a balance sheet. For a full understanding of the Crown’s financial position and the results of its operation and cash flows, refer to the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2019. 145 Contents 146Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL Schedule of non-departmental revenue For the year ended 30 June 2019 ActualNoteActualUnaudited Budget Unaudited Forecast 2018201920192020 $000 2$000$000$000 Direct taxation Income tax Individuals 29,921,838Source deductions (PAYE)32,022,65731,388,00033,766,000 6,819,205Other persons7,663,1496,968,0007,149,000 (2,102,414)Refunds(2,428,720)(1,764,000)(1,937,000) 558,531Fringe benefit tax 585,498572,000585,000 35,197,160Total individuals 37,842,58437,164,00039,563,000 Corporate tax 13,779,246Gross companies tax16,067,49214,660,00015,538,000 (157,050)Refunds(343,017)(207,000)(218,000) 626,561Non-resident withholding tax650,367669,000648,000 3,159Foreign-source dividend withholding payments (252)–– 14,251,916Total corporate tax 16,374,59015,122,00015,968,000 Other direct income tax 1,530,871Resident withholding tax on interest income1,659,2391,737,0001,675,000 752,790Resident withholding tax on dividend income838,149769,000796,000 1,295,906Employer superannuation contribution tax 1,351,2031,360,0001,430,000 3,579,567Total other direct income tax 3,848,5913,866,0003,901,000 53,028,643Total direct taxation 58,065,76556,152,00059,432,000 147 Schedule of non-departmental revenue (continued) For the year ended 30 June 2019 ActualNoteActualUnaudited Budget Unaudited Forecast 2018201920192020 $000 2$000$000$000 Indirect taxation Goods and services tax 31,774,795Gross goods and services tax33,397,96933,360,00035,256,000 (13,086,351)Refunds(14,004,865)(13,370,000)(14,334,000) 18,688,444Total goods and services tax 19,393,10419,990,00020,922,000 Other indirect taxation 107,255Approved issuer levy105,09798,000101,000 317,007Gaming duties313,579312,000307,000 1,341Other indirect taxation 2,1087,0005,000 425,603Total other indirect taxation 420,784417,000413,000 19,114,047Total indirect taxation 19,813,88820,407,00021,335,000 72,142,690Total taxation 77,879,65376,559,00080,767,000 Other revenue 181,466Child support179,337181,000180,000 –Fair value remeasurement—student loans 1 981,000–34,000 603,685Interest unwind—student loans393,900584,000415,000 49,796Other revenue 45,39046,00044,500 834,947Total other revenue 1,599,627811,000673,500 72,977,637Total revenue 79,479,28077,370,00081,440,500 The accompanying accounting policies and notes form part of these financial schedules.

Basis of preparation Reporting entity Inland Revenue is a government department as defined by section 2 of the Public Finance Act 1989 and is domiciled and operates in New Zealand. The relevant legislation governing Inland Revenue’s operations is the Public Finance Act 1989. Inland Revenue is a wholly owned entity of the Crown whose primary objective is to provide services to the public rather than to make a financial return. Accordingly, Inland Revenue has designated itself as a Public Benefit Entity (PBE) for financial reporting purposes. These non-departmental financial schedules present financial information on funds managed by Inland Revenue on behalf of the Crown. These non-departmental balances are consolidated into the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2019. For a full understanding of the Crown’s financial position and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year refer to the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2019. Reporting period The reporting period for these financial schedules is for the year ended 30 June 2019. The forecast financial schedules are for the year ending 30 June 2020. The Chief Executive and Commissioner of Inland Revenue authorised these financial schedules on 30 September 2019. Statement of compliance The financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989, which includes the requirement to comply with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice (NZ GAAP), and the Treasury instructions. Inland Revenue has applied the Tier 1 Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PBE IPSAS) in preparing the 30 June 2019 financial schedules. Basis of preparation The financial schedules have been prepared on a going concern basis, and the accounting policies set out below and in the notes to the financial schedules have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial schedules. These financial schedules have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless otherwise stated. The accrual basis of accounting has been used. Functional and presentation currency These financial schedules are presented in New Zealand dollars, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000). The functional currency of Inland Revenue is New Zealand dollars. Accounting standard adopted early In line with the Financial Statements of the Government, Inland Revenue has elected to adopt PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments early. PBE IFRS 9 replaces PBE IPSAS 29 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Information about the adoption of PBE IFRS 9 is provided in note 5. How we have prepared these schedules 156Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL Accounting standard issued and not yet effective The standard issued but not yet effective, that has not been adopted early is: PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments The External Reporting Board issued PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments in March 2019. This standard supersedes PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which was issued as an interim standard. It is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Inland Revenue does not intend to adopt PBE IPSAS 41 early. When this standard is adopted, Inland Revenue does not expect any significant changes as the requirements are similar to PBE IFRS 9. Estimations and judgements In preparing these financial schedules, judgements, estimates and assumptions have been made concerning the future. These judgements, estimates and their associated assumptions may differ from the subsequent actual results. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and other factors. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The estimates and assumptions around income tax, PAYE and GST that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to revenue and the carrying amounts of receivables and payables within the next financial year, are referred to in the notes. Changes in estimations Income tax Further refinements have been achieved as a result of the business transformation programme. This year Inland Revenue has applied a new process for the estimation of income tax. The improvements include that income tax is now recognised for all taxpayers every month based on current year provisional tax assessments, prior year assessments and payments in excess of assessments. Previously income tax was recognised based on provisional tax due and forecast provisional tax payments. The process change has had the effect of bringing forward the recognition of some tax revenue for the 2018–19 fiscal year. Due to the fundamental differences between the models, it is not practical to estimate the effect of the change on current and future years. The current process to estimate income tax is disclosed in note 2. Accounting policies Significant accounting policies are included in the notes to which they relate. Significant accounting policies that do not relate to a specific note and which materially affect the measurement of financial results and the financial position are outlined below. Expenses Expenses are recognised in the period to which they relate. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in transit and funds held in bank accounts administered by Inland Revenue. All cash held in bank accounts is held in on demand accounts and no interest is payable to Inland Revenue. Comparatives When presentation or classification of items in the financial schedules is amended or accounting policies are changed, comparative figures are restated to ensure consistency with the current period, unless it is impracticable to do so. Change in accounting policies There have been no changes in accounting policies since the date of the last audited financial schedules. The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year. The process to estimate the value of student loans is disclosed in note 5. 157 Budget and forecast figures The budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing these financial schedules. The budget and forecast financial schedules are not subject to audit. The budget figures for 2018–19 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2019. The revised budget figures for 2018–19 (refer to the Statement of non-departmental budgeted and actual expenditure incurred against appropriations on page 107) are those included in The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2019. The forecast figures for 2019–20 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2020. The forecast financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989 to communicate forecast financial information for accountability purposes. They are compliant with PBE Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements. Forecast policies The forecasts have been compiled on the basis of existing government policies and ministerial expectations at the time the schedules were finalised and reflect all government decisions up to 1 May 2019. While Inland Revenue regularly updates forecasts, updated forecast schedules for the year ending 30 June 2020 will not be published. The key assumptions in the preparation of the forecasts include: • Tax revenue: tax policy changes enacted and announced by the Government will take place as planned and will affect tax revenue and receipts as calculated and agreed between Inland Revenue and the Treasury. • Student loans: the fair value of student loans is based on a valuation model adapted to reflect current student loans policy. As such, the fair value over the forecast period is sensitive to changes in a number of underlying assumptions, including future income levels, repayment behaviour and macroeconomic factors, such as wages inflation and discount rates. Any change in these assumptions would affect the present fiscal forecast. • Estimated year-end information for 2018–19 is used as the opening position for the 2019–20 forecasts. For other key fiscal forecast assumptions, refer to the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2019 (https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/efu/budget- economic-and-fiscal-update-2019-html) 1 . Any changes to budgets during 2019–20 will be incorporated into The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2020. Variations to forecast The actual financial results for the forecast period covered are likely to vary from the information presented in these forecasts. Factors that may lead to a material difference between information in these forecast financial schedules and the actual reported results include: • changes due to initiatives or legislation approved by Cabinet • macroeconomic changes impacting revenue, expenditure and debt levels • the timing of customers' filing of returns and related payments • the timing of customer refund and credit claims • the outcome of disputes, including litigation. 1 This link leads to information not covered by the audit opinion on page 172. 158Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL How we have recognised revenue Note 2. Revenue Tax revenue is a non-exchange transaction. This means the payment of tax in itself does not entitle a customer to an equivalent value of services or benefits, because there is no direct relationship between paying tax and receiving Crown services and benefits. Tax revenue is recognised when a taxable event has occurred, the tax revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Crown. Tax is recognised at face value as the fair value is not materially different from the face value. The New Zealand tax system is based on self-assessment where customers are expected to understand the tax laws and comply with them. Inland Revenue helps customers comply and addresses non-compliant activities. Most people pay their fair share of tax. For the minority who do not, Inland Revenue intervenes and encourages them to do the right thing. However, such procedures cannot be expected to identify all sources of unreported income or other cases of non-compliance with tax laws. Inland Revenue is unable to reliably estimate the amount of unreported tax. Income tax Income tax is recognised on an accrual basis in the period the taxable event occurs. It is deemed to accrue evenly over the period to which it relates. Where income tax returns have not been filed for the relevant period, accrued income tax revenue receivable or payable has been estimated based on current provisional assessments or prior year provisional or terminal assessments. Tax revenue is recognised proportionally based on the balance date of the taxpayer. The amount of income tax receivable or refundable is not known with certainty until income tax returns for the period have been filed. This is usually sometime after the publication of the annual report. The measurement of income tax accruals requires significant estimates, judgements and assumptions and have a number of uncertainties. These include: • Where customers subject to the provisional tax regime have not yet filed a terminal tax assessment for the period, provisional tax assessments are recognised as revenue based on the provisional tax method adopted by the taxpayer. Provisional assessments are based on 105% of the prior year terminal tax. • Where taxpayers have chosen to estimate their provisional tax, income tax revenue is recognised based on the most recent estimate provided to Inland Revenue. • Where the taxpayers have made payments for more than the provisional tax assessment submitted, their credit balance is also accrued as revenue. • Where taxpayers have made payments to Inland Revenue but have not submitted a provisional tax assessment for the period, an estimate is made based on the payments. • For taxpayers not subject to provisional tax, an estimate is made of the tax revenues receivable and refundable at year end based on prior year terminal assessments. • For taxpayers subject to provisional tax who have not filed their tax return for the previous period, an estimate is made of the tax revenues receivable and refundable at year end based on prior year provisional tax assessments. Goods and services tax (GST) GST returns are assessed on a one, two, three or six-monthly basis and are due the month after the end of the period. At year end Inland Revenue estimates the amount of GST outstanding as follows: • for customers who file a return of GST for the June period, the actual amounts filed are used • for customers who have not filed a return, the estimate is based on the most recently assessed GST return. 159 Pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) PAYE returns are currently assessed either monthly or for a pay period. At year end the amount outstanding is estimated as follows: • for customers who file a PAYE return for June, the actual amounts filed by customers in July are used • for all other customers the estimate is based on the most recently assessed PAYE return. Child support Child support revenue is the penalties levied on child support debts owed to both custodial persons and the Crown by parents who pay child support as well as child support due to the Crown. This revenue is recognised initially at fair value and subsequently tested for impairment at year end. Fair value remeasurement—student loans Fair value remeasurement is the change in the value in the student loan portfolio over the year. Student loans are initially measured at fair value. The changes to fair value between periods are recognised as a gain or loss in the net surplus or deficit. More information is provided in note 5. Interest unwind—student loans Student loans are initially discounted to fair value. This predominantly reflects the time value of money. As time moves on, student loans become closer to being repaid and are therefore worth more. This increase in value, is recognised as interest unwind. The valuation of student loans changed with the adoption of PBE IFRS 9. Effective from 1 July 2018, the interest unwind has been calculated using the official cash rate plus a risk premium calculated by the consulting actuaries. Prior to this, the interest unwind was calculated using the effective interest method based on the interest rates allocated in the year loans were drawn down. 160Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL Crown assets we are managing Note 3. Receivables Receivables include general taxes, Working for Families Tax Credits, KiwiSaver and any penalties and interest associated with these activities. These are non-contractual sovereign receivables. The interest and penalties charged on receivables are presented as revenue in the Schedule of non- departmental revenue. Receivables for child support and student loans are reported separately in notes 4 and 5 respectively. Receivables are initially recognised at face value as the fair value is not materially different from the face value and are subsequently tested for impairment at year end. Allowances for amounts Inland Revenue does not expect to recover are recognised when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Impairments are included in the Schedule of non-departmental expenditure. Impairment losses can be reversed where there is evidence that the impaired value of the asset has increased. To calculate the impairment of receivables, assumptions are applied to future repayment behaviour, as well as economic factors such as the discount rate and inflation. Key assumptions are explained below: • The recoverable amount of receivables is calculated by forecasting the expected repayments based on analysis of historical debt data, deducting an estimate of collection costs and then discounting using an appropriate rate. If the recoverable amount of the portfolio is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. Alternatively, if the recoverable amount is more, the carrying amount is increased. • Tax pooling funds held in Crown bank accounts have been netted off against receivables. These funds have been deposited by commercial intermediaries and allow customers to pool tax payments to reduce their exposure to use-of-money-interest. Underpayments and overpayments are offset within the same pool. 161 ActualActual 20182019 $000 $000 Receivables 12,745,990Gross receivables16,321,058 (2,013,977)Impairment(2,310,000) 10,732,013Carrying value receivables14,011,058 Current and non-current apportionment 10,419,313Receivables—current13,466,127 312,700Receivables—non-current544,931 10,732,013Carrying value receivables14,011,058 Ageing profile of gross receivables 9,642,555Not due 1 12,799,796 Past due 2 812,507Less than 6 months951,796 331,2356–12 months419,501 710,0981–2 years631,809 1,249,595Greater than 2 years1,518,156 3,103,435Total past due3,521,262 12,745,990Total gross receivables16,321,058 24%% Past due22% Receivables—impairment 2,011,169Opening balance2,013,977 616,221Impairment losses recognised828,664 (613,413)Amounts written off as uncollectable(532,641) 2,013,977Closing balance2,310,000 1 Not due receivables comprise estimations for tax where the tax has been earned but is not yet due to be paid. 2 Receivables are classified as past due when they are not received from customers by their due date. Due dates will vary, depending on the type of revenue owing (for example, income tax, GST, KiwiSaver) and the customer’s balance date. Past due debt includes debts collected under instalment, debts under dispute, default assessments and debts of customers who are bankrupt, in receivership or in liquidation. Inland Revenue has debt management policies and procedures in place to actively manage the collection of past due debt. 162Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL ActualActual 20182019 9,621,070Recoverable amount of receivables not due ($000)12,763,914 1,110,943Recoverable amount of receivables past due ($000)1,247,144 10,732,013Total carrying value ($000)14,011,058 8.22%Use-of-money-interest rate8.22% 5.00%Discount rate5.00% (21,508)Impact on the recoverable amount of a 2% increase in discount rate ($000)(27,988) 27,859Impact on the recoverable amount of a 2% decrease in discount rate ($000)30,027 The fair value of receivables is not materially different from the carrying value. Credit risk In determining the recoverability of receivables, Inland Revenue uses information about disputes and past experience of the outcomes of such disputes, together with trends of payment timeliness and other information obtained from credit collection. Under the Tax Administration Act 1994, Inland Revenue has broad powers to ensure that people meet their obligations. Part 10 of the Act sets out the powers of the Commissioner to recover unpaid tax. The Crown does not hold any collateral or any other credit enhancements over receivables which are past due. Receivables are widely dispersed over a number of customers and as a result the Crown does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk. The estimated recoverable amount of this portfolio and the significant assumptions underpinning the valuation of carrying value receivables are shown below: 163 Note 4. Receivables—child support The Crown collects monies from parents who pay child support and passes this to custodial persons. The child support receivable represents penalties which in the main relates to penalties imposed on parents who default on their child support payments. Child support penalties grow exponentially due to their compounding nature. The recovery of debt is challenging and 97% of child support debt is written down at initial recognition as we do not expect to collect it. The non-recoverability of penalties has been allowed for in the initial fair value write-down figure. At year end the fair value of the outstanding debt is also tested for impairment. Historically, there have been limited provisions under child support legislation to write off penalties. However, legislative changes to the Child Support Act 1991, effective from 1 April 2016, increased the Commissioner’s ability to write off child support penalty debt. As a result of these legislative changes, the nominal value of child support debt will reduce over time. Credit risk The Crown does not hold any collateral or any other credit enhancements over receivables for child support which are past due. Receivables for child support are widely dispersed over a number of customers and as a result the Crown does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk.

Student loans (References to surplus and deficit in this note refer to the surplus and deficit of the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand). StudyLink (Ministry of Social Development) administers the initial capital lending and issues student loans which are then transferred to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue holds the total nominal debt, administers the initial fair value write-down expense and any subsequent fair value adjustments, and is also responsible for the collection of debt. Student loans are designated at fair value through surplus or deficit under PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The difference between the amount of the student loan and the fair value on initial recognition is recognised as an expense. The initial fair value is lower than the amount of the initial student loan for a number of reasons including that: • some borrowers will never earn enough to repay their loans • some overseas borrowers will default on their payment obligations • because there is no interest charged on New Zealand-based borrowers’ balances, the time value of money will erode the value of future repayments. At the end of the year, actuarial models are used to compare the carrying value to the fair value of the student loan portfolio and the difference is recognised in the surplus and deficit of the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand. Details of the models are provided later in this note. Previous accounting policy under PBE IPSAS 29 Financial Instruments Student loans are designated as loans and receivables under PBE IPSAS 29 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Student loans are recognised initially at fair value, plus transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, and are adjusted for impairments. Fair value on initial recognition of student loans is determined by projecting forward expected repayments and discounting them back at an appropriate discount rate. The difference between the amount of the loan and the fair value on initial recognition is expensed. The subsequent measurement at amortised cost is determined using the same effective interest rate as at initial recognition. This rate is used to spread the Crown’s interest income across the life of the loan and determines the loan’s carrying value at each reporting date. An effective interest rate of 6.77% was used in 2018. We use the following key terms to help us define student loan values: Fair valueThe market value of student loans if they could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s-length transaction. Nominal valueThe total amount owed by borrowers at a point in time, including loan principal, interest, fees and penalties. 165 The nominal and fair values of student loans are shown below.

Student loan valuation model At the end of the year, the student loan portfolio is revalued to fair value using actuarial models. Statistics New Zealand collates most of the data for the actuarial valuation model from Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Social Development. The data is made up of borrowings, repayments, income, educational factors and socio-economic factors. It is current up to 31 March 2018. In addition supplementary data from Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service, about loan transactions and borrowers’ cross-border movements for the period up to 31 March 2019 is also included. The fair value movement, recognised in the surplus and deficit, relates to changes in discount rate and a reassessment of the expected repayments of loans. In 2019 the discount rate adjustment has increased the value of the student loan portfolio by $734 million (2018: $190 million). The discount rates used for determining the fair value are equal to Treasury’s prescribed risk free rates for accounting valuations plus a risk premium. Since 30 June 2018, risk free rates have fallen significantly, which has increased the fair value of the student loan portfolio. The 2.34% risk premium has not been changed for 2019 in line with market data. In 2019, the expected repayment adjustment has increased the value of the student loan portfolio by $211 million (2018: $102 million). The main factors that contributed to this increase in value include: • Updated modelling assumptions increased the value overall by $230 million. This was driven by four main significant movements and a number of small changes: • Definitions for ethnicity data used for the valuation have been updated, increasing the number of borrowers projected to return to New Zealand. When borrowers return to New Zealand, they tend to make significant repayments. This data change has increased the fair value by $71 million. • Continuing positive net migration trends is seeing more borrowers return to New Zealand. Transition assumptions have been updated to increase domestic repayments, increase repayments on return to New Zealand and decrease overseas repayments. This data change increased the fair value by $69 million. • Increasing trends in overseas-based borrowers’ making repayments increased the fair value by $41 million. • Other modelling changes, including the roll forward of data, increased the impaired value by $49 million. • The 2018 provision for write offs is no longer required as at 30 June 2019. This increased the fair value by $50 million. • Macroeconomic effects: updated future loan interest rate assumptions, wages inflation assumptions and repayment threshold inflation assumptions decreased the fair value by $37 million. • This year there has been a 40% increase in assumed bankruptcy rates, in line with recent experience. This has decreased the fair value by $30 million. A breakdown of the fair value remeasurement—student loans reported in the Schedule of non-departmental revenue is set out on the next page. The 2018 comparative information in the table is provided for information only and does not align to the Schedule of non-departmental revenue for that year. 167 PBE IFRS 9 Equivalent Actual Actual 20182019 $000 $000 36,000Repayment collection allowance36,000 284,000Risk free rates734,000 (94,000)Risk premium– 190,000Discount rate adjustment734,000 Expected repayment adjustment 106,000Data and modelling changes230,000 80,000Macroeconomic effects(37,000) 11,000Experience variance5,000 (50,000)Provision for write offs50,000 (34,000)Policy changes(37,000) (11,000)Adjustments for improvements– 328,000Total fair value remeasurement—student loans981,000 20182019 9,929,623Fair value ($000)10,730,696 5.56%Discount rate4.40% 3.7%–5.5%Interest rate applied to loans for overseas-based borrowers2.6%–5.0% 1.0%–2.0%Consumer Price Index1.4%–2.1% 2.9%–3.3%Future salary inflation3.0%–3.5% Not availableImpact on fair value of a 1% increase in average wage earnings inflation over five years ($000)91,000 Not availableImpact on fair value of a 1% decrease in average wage earnings inflation over five years ($000)(110,000) Not availableImpact on fair value of a 2.5% increase in overseas-based borrowers making repayments ($000)140,000 Not availableImpact on fair value of a 2.5% decrease in overseas-based borrowers making repayments ($000)(147,000) (520,000)Impact on fair value of a 1% increase in discount rate ($000)(580,000) 579,000Impact on fair value of a 1% decrease in discount rate ($000)648,000 The student loan valuation model reflects current student loan policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The fair value is sensitive to changes in a number of underlying assumptions, including future income levels, repayment behaviour and macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and discount rates. For these reasons, the valuation has a high degree of inherent uncertainty and there is a significant risk of material adjustment to the fair value in future accounting periods. The key risks are as follows: • If the recent improvements in overseas compliance are short-lived and repayment behaviour returns to the lower levels experienced in the past then a decrease in fair value may result. • Since 2005 the proportion of borrowers becoming low earners (that is, earning below $25,000 per annum) has been steadily increasing for those studying lower-level certificates. If the proportion of borrowers becoming low earners continues to increase, then a decrease in fair value may result. • The model assumes that low-earner borrowers will remain low earners for the same duration in the future as they do currently. If the lengths of time borrowers remain low earners increases then a decrease in fair value may result. • The model assumes an increase in the projected number of borrowers returning to New Zealand and a considerable number of them making large repayments on their return. If the number of borrowers returning to New Zealand decreases then a decrease in fair value may result. The significant assumptions and sensitivities behind the fair value are: 168Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on their obligation to repay their loans or die before their loan is repaid, causing the scheme to incur a loss. The risk of death or default can not be quantified. The student loan scheme does not require borrowers to provide any collateral or security to support advances made. As the total sum advanced is widely dispersed over a large number of borrowers, the student loan scheme does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk. The credit risk is reduced by the collection of compulsory repayments through the tax system. This is less effective with overseas-based borrowers. Many New Zealand-based borrowers earning over the income threshold have compulsory deductions from salary and wages to repay their loans. Overseas-based borrowers are required to make repayments twice a year based on their loan balance. Inland Revenue uses a variety of communications and campaigns to reduce the risk of non-payment of obligations. Loans are written off on death, for hardship, bankruptcies and in other special circumstances. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates impact discount rates. The risk is that if interest rates rise the value of the scheme will significantly decrease as the discount rates applied to the expected future repayments will be higher, decreasing their value. Changes in interest rates could also impact on the Government’s return on loans advanced. The interest rate and the interest write-off provisions attached to student loans are set by the Government. Adoption of PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In accordance with the transitional provisions of PBE IFRS 9 and Treasury instructions, Inland Revenue has elected not to restate the information from previous years to comply with PBE IFRS 9. Adjustments rising from the adoption of PBE IFRS 9 are recognised in the Schedule of movements between other government departments at 1 July 2018. Accounting policies have been updated to comply with PBE IFRS 9. The main update is: • Note 5 Student loans: This has been updated to explain that after initial recognition, loans are subsequently measured at fair value through surplus and deficit using the appropriate discount rate. This policy has been updated to remove references to subsequent measurement of loans being at amortised cost being calculated using the effective interest method. On the date of initial application of PBE IFRS 9 (1 July 2018) the classification of financial instruments under PBE IPSAS 29 and PBE IFRS 9 is as follows: Measurement categoryCarrying amount Original PBE IPSAS 29 category New PBE IPSAS 29 category Closing balance 30 June 2018 (PBE IPSAS 29) Adoption of PBE IFRS 9 adjustments Opening balance 1 July 2018 (PBE IFRS 9) $000$000$000 Student Loans—current assetsAmortised costFair value through surplus or deficit 1,310,000–1,310,000 Student Loans—non-current assetsAmortised costFair value through surplus or deficit 7,991,623628,0008,619,623 Total financial assets9,301,623628,0009,929,623 When adopting PBE IFRS 9, Inland Revenue has determined that the characteristics of student loans did not fully meet the requirements of PBE IFRS 9 for financial assets designated at amortised cost. Therefore, from 1 July 2018, the classification of this financial asset has been changed from amortised cost to fair value through surplus or deficit. The student loan portfolio is exposed to a variety of financial instrument risks, including credit risk and interest rate risk. 169 ActualActual 20182019 $000 $000 4,109,206Taxes refundable5,096,387 1,077,929KiwiSaver payable1,167,366 4,793Paid parental leave payable7,574 5,191,928Total refundables and payables6,271,327 Note 7.

Interest is paid at a rate of 3% per annum if a deposit is left in the scheme for a period of more than 12 months. The environmental restoration account allows businesses to set aside money to cover costs for monitoring, avoiding, remedying or mitigating any detrimental environmental effects which may occur in later years. Interest is calculated at a rate of 3% per annum and is payable from the day after the deposit is made until the day before a refund is made. Refunds will be made when the environmental restoration costs are incurred. The adverse event income equalisation scheme operates in addition to the income equalisation scheme. Deposits earn interest at a rate of 6.5% per annum from the date of receipt until the deposit is refunded. Deposits can be withdrawn but are transferred to the main income equalisation account if not withdrawn within 12 months of the deposit. Crown liabilities we are managing Note 6. Refundables and payables Refundables and payables are financial liabilities and are recognised at their nominal value as they are due within 12 months. The nominal value is considered to approximate their fair value. Taxes refundable represent refunds due to customers. KiwiSaver payable represents contributions to be forwarded to scheme providers at balance date. 170Annual Report 2019 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL Crown contingencies we are managing Note 9. Contingencies Contingent liabilities and assets are recorded in the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets at the point at which the contingency is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Contingent liabilities are disclosed if it is probable that they will occur. Contingent assets are disclosed if it is probable that the benefits will be realised. Contingent liabilities Legal proceedings and disputes—assessed If a legal case is still not resolved at the end of the disputes process, Inland Revenue will issue an amended assessment to the customer and recognise revenue and a contingent liability. The customer is then able to file proceedings with the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court disputing the assessment. Unclaimed monies Unclaimed monies are repaid to the entitled owner on proof of identity. Based on trends from prior years, the estimated likely amount of unclaimed monies that will be paid is recorded as a liability in the Schedule of non-departmental liabilities and the remainder is recorded as a contingent liability in the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets. Contingent assets Disputes—non-assessed Contingent assets arise as part of the tax dispute process, for example, when Inland Revenue has advised a customer of a proposed adjustment to their tax assessment through a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). At this point, Inland Revenue has not issued an amended assessment and no revenue has been recognised so these adjustments are recorded in the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets as disputes—non-assessed. The customer has the right to dispute this adjustment and a disputes resolution process is entered into. Inland Revenue records a contingent asset based on the cash likely to be received from the disputes process, based on experience and similar prior cases, net of losses carried forward. Contingent assets can also arise where the customer has not filed an assessment but Inland Revenue believes they are liable for tax. In this situation Inland Revenue will issue an assessment. Where the customer chooses to dispute the Inland Revenue initiated assessment, the assessment is not recognised as revenue and a contingent asset is recorded in the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets. The value of the asset is based on the likely collectable portion of the default assessment, net of losses carried forward. Other disclosures Note 10. Collection of earner levy Inland Revenue collects these levies on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and passes the monies directly to them. The levies are not recognised as revenue or expenditure in the non-departmental schedules. ACC pays Inland Revenue for these services. Note 11.

Our audit was completed on 30 September 2019. This is the date at which our opinion is expressed. The basis for our opinion is explained below. In addition, we outline the responsibilities of the Commissioner and our responsibilities relating to the information to be audited, we comment on other information, and we explain our independence. 173 Basis for our opinion We carried out our audit in accordance with the Auditor-General’s Auditing Standards, which incorporate the Professional and Ethical Standards and the International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Responsibilities of the auditor section of our report. We have fulfilled our responsibilities in accordance with the Auditor-General’s Auditing Standards. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Responsibilities of the Commissioner for the information to be audited The Commissioner is responsible on behalf of Inland Revenue for preparing: • financial statements that present fairly Inland Revenue’s financial position, financial performance, and its cash flows, and that comply with generally accepted accounting practice in New Zealand; • performance information that presents fairly what has been achieved with each appropriation, the expenditure incurred as compared with expenditure expected to be incurred, and that complies with generally accepted accounting practice in New Zealand; • statements of expenses and capital expenditure of Inland Revenue, that are presented fairly, in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989; and • schedules of non-departmental activities, in accordance with the Treasury Instructions, that present fairly those activities managed by Inland Revenue on behalf of the Crown. The Commissioner is responsible for such internal control as is determined is necessary to enable the preparation of the information to be audited that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the information to be audited, the Commissioner is responsible on behalf of Inland Revenue for assessing Inland Revenue’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Commissioner is also responsible for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to merge or to terminate the activities of Inland Revenue, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. The Commissioner’s responsibilities arise from the Public Finance Act 1989. Responsibilities of the auditor for the information to be audited Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information we audited, as a whole, is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit carried out in accordance with the Auditor-General’s Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements are differences or omissions of amounts or disclosures, and can arise from fraud or error. Misstatements are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of readers, taken on the basis of the information we audited. For the budget information reported in the information we audited, our procedures were limited to checking that the information agreed to Inland Revenue’s Statement of Intent 2018-2022, the relevant Estimates and Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations 2018/19, and the 2018/19 forecast financial figures included in Inland Revenue’s 2017/18 Annual Report. We did not evaluate the security and controls over the electronic publication of the information we audited. As part of an audit in accordance with the Auditor-General’s Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. Also: • We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the information we audited, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • We obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Inland Revenue’s internal control. • We evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Commissioner. 174Annual Report 2019 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT • We evaluate the appropriateness of the reported performance information within Inland Revenue’s framework for reporting its performance. • We conclude on the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis of accounting by the Commissioner and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on Inland Revenue’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the information we audited or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause Inland Revenue to cease to continue as a going concern. • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the information we audited, including the disclosures, and whether the information we audited represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with the Commissioner regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. Our responsibilities arise from the Public Audit Act 2001. Other information The Commissioner is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included on pages 1 to 70, 99 to 110, and 176 to 191, but does not include the information we audited, and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the information we audited does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of audit opinion or assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information. In doing so, we consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the information we audited or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on our work, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Independence We are independent of Inland Revenue in accordance with the independence requirements of the Auditor-General’s Auditing Standards, which incorporate the independence requirements of Professional and Ethical Standard 1 (Revised): Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Other than in our capacity as auditor, we have no relationship with, or interests, in Inland Revenue. Kelly Rushton Audit New Zealand On behalf of the Auditor-General Wellington, New Zealand Additional information Taipitopito anō 176Annual Report 2019 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Information sharing with the Department of Internal Affairs Under information sharing regulations, Inland Revenue must report annually, for this approved information sharing agreement (AISA), on actions taken during the financial year. In July 2019, the operation of this AISA was reviewed. The review assessed the adequacy of controls in place to ensure compliance with section 11 of the most current AISA. The review found that Inland Revenue had not implemented measures to ensure Department of Internal Affairs data was made inaccessible to our staff as agreed in the 2018 amendments to the AISA. This has now been addressed. In all other respects the review confirmed that we are operating in accordance with the terms and conditions of the current AISA and the Memorandum of Understanding. A copy of the approved AISA is available to view at: https://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/agreements/agreement-dia/ Information sharing with the Department of Internal Affairs Financial year ending 30 June 2019 Contact records received from DIA429,174 Contact records not matched to a corresponding Inland Revenue record for: • overseas-based child support debtors • overseas-based child support non-debtors who do not appear to have up-to-date contact information • overseas-based student loan defaulters 418,048 Contact records matched to corresponding Inland Revenue records for: • overseas-based child support debtors • overseas-based child support non-debtors who do not appear to have up-to-date contact information • overseas-based student loan defaulters • overseas-based student loan non-debtors who do not appear to have up-to-date contact information 1,409 71 7,578 1,978 Ongoing programme operating costs$1,728 Individuals successfully contacted 1 using contact records matched to: • overseas-based child support debtors (47%) • overseas-based child support non-debtors who do not appear to the up-to-date contact information (15%) • overseas-based student loan defaulters (37%) • overseas-based student loan non-debtors who do not appear to the up-to-date contact information (38%) 669 11 2,788 756 Payments received from individuals as a result of successful contact with: • overseas-based child support debtors (120 payments) • overseas-based student loan defaulters (2,261 payments) $234,541 $4.8 million Percentage of individuals who have addressed 2 their debt as a result of being successfully contacted by Inland Revenue: • overseas-based child support debtors (504) • overseas-based student loan defaulters (2,174) 36% 29% 1 We have made attempts to contact all 11,036 matched individuals. 4,224 have passed our identity verification process. 2 Individual no longer has payments overdue or has made a payment arrangement with us. 177 Information sharing with New Zealand Police Our approved information sharing agreement (AISA) with New Zealand Police sets out key activities that we need to report on each year in our annual report. Under sections 96S(1)(b), 96T and 96U of the Privacy Act 1993, and clause 9 of the Privacy Regulations 1993, the Privacy Commissioner has specified the following reporting in respect of the AISA for: supply of information for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation or providing evidence of serious crime. A copy of the AISA is available to view at: https://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/agreements/agreement-police/ Information shared DescriptionTotal Number of requests for information made by New Zealand Police to Inland Revenue170 Number of responses with information provided by Inland Revenue to New Zealand Police150 Number of occasions Inland Revenue proactively provided information to New Zealand Police5 Costs The estimated cost of the sharing agreement with New Zealand Police is $8,495 for the year ended 30 June 2019. Benefits The number of times information provided by Inland Revenue has been used in a case with a resolution of: No offence21 Prosecution54 Warning0 Still under investigation73 No response received2 To t a l150 Warning, diversion and youth case action do not apply as the AISA focuses on serious offending and these possible resolutions are for lower-level offending which fall below the serious crime threshold. In all instances where we proactively provided information to New Zealand Police, the information was used in an investigation. Assurance An internal Critical Task Assurance review is applied across a selection of information requests and proposed responses. There have been no instances identified of information being shared contrary to the AISA. Amendments No amendments have been made in the reporting period. 178Annual Report 2019 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Information sharing with the Ministry of Social Development Under sections 96S(1)(b), 96T and 96U of the Privacy Act 1993, and clause 9 of the Privacy Regulations 1993, the Privacy Commissioner has specified the following reporting in respect of the approved information sharing agreement listed in schedule 2A of the Privacy Act between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to facilitate the following public services: (a) The accurate and efficient assessment of eligibility for, and entitlement to, benefits and subsidies; (b) The accurate and efficient assessment and enforcement of tax obligations, including recovering any associated debt; and (c) The accurate and efficient assessment and enforcement of obligations relating to benefits and subsidies, including recovering any associated debt. Inland Revenue will collate the following information annually (for the period between 1 July and 30 June) and report the information in its annual report for that year: Scale MetricShares derived from: 2018–19 Administration of shared services: Number of records disclosed (MSD to Inland Revenue)Commencement/cessation benefits/students2,610 Housing ShareNote 1 Child support administration94,378 2 Student Loan Programme7,041,500 2 Administration of social assistance: Number of records disclosed (Inland Revenue to MSD)Community Service Card1,787,371 Commencement/cessation benefits/students2,610 Proactive Information Share—benefits and students556,683 Housing ShareNote 1 Child support administration402,047 2 Student Loan Programme15,700 2 179 Benefits (Qualitative) • The information sharing under this AISA effectively helps MSD to assess eligibility for Community Services Cards and benefits and identify overpayments. It is also the most effective way for Inland Revenue and MSD to ensure customers receive their correct Working for Families Tax Credit entitlements. • There have been no data breaches under the AISA. • Note that results are down for the Proactive Information Share—benefits and students and Commencement/cessation benefits/students share. These reduced volumes can be attributed to the introduction of a Winter Energy Payment in June 2018 and again in May 2019. This meant MSD results from the Customs Arrivals and Departures share increased dramatically and FTE resources were reprioritised across the business to manage this spike. The net effect of this means that a reduced number of overall records were processed throughout the year impacting overpayment numbers and values. • Following Release 3 of Inland Revenue’s transformation in April 2019, MSD has been unable to process the Inland Revenue data from the Proactive Information Share, which reflects in the number of records disclosed to MSD from Inland Revenue. We expect this issue will be resolved early in 2019–20. • There were no other difficulties sharing information under the AISA.

Assurance In 2018–19: • MSD and Inland Revenue have received no privacy complaints about the operation of the information sharing under the AISA. • In accordance with clause 9(e) of the AISA, which requires an annual audit of the operation of the agreement, an audit was completed after the AISA had been in operation for a year. There were no significant findings. • Since the Order in Council came into force there have been minor amendments made to the AISA in September 2018. These changes introduced flexibility to the extent of audit carried out annually. Also, to accommodate the new Best Start Tax Credit introduced as part of MSD’s Families Package, a reference to the Income Tax Act 2007 was added. As these changes were minor in nature, it was agreed by all parties that public consultation was not required, and no change was required to the Order in Council.

B–23 Annual Report Pūrongo ā-Tau 2020 ird.govt.nz We contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. OUR MISSION A world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence. OUR VISION Trust and integrity, innovating to make a difference, valuing people, working together. OUR VALUES 1 Inland Revenue plays a critical role in improving the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders We do this by collecting and distributing money—we collect over 80% of the Cro w n’s revenue and collect and distribute social support payments. We are the principal steward of New Zealand’s revenue system. We play a critical role in maintaining and enhancing the integrity of the tax system by making sure it is clear, consistent and simple. With the Treasury, we provide advice to the Government on tax policy and the social policies we administer. We advise the Government on international tax issues and are involved in the development and implementation of New Zealand’s international tax legislation. This is the Annual Report 2020 for Inland Revenue Ko tēnei te Pūrongo ā-Tau 2020 a Te Tari Taake 80% WE COLLECT OVER of the Crown’s revenue 2Annual Report 2020 This logo represents the way that we want to work with our customers to achieve our primary outcome of improving the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders.

He tangata, he tangata, he tangata. What is the most important thing in the world? It is people, it is people, it is people. E ngā mana, e ngā reo, tēnā koutou katoa This whakataukī reminds us of the importance of people. This year, more than any other, has reinforced all the reasons I am proud to lead the people of Inland Revenue. Improving the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders through collecting and distributing money is at the heart of what we do. Earlier this year, when New Zealand went into its first lockdown due to COVID-19, Inland Revenue played a key role in supporting the Government’s response, introducing new legislation and initiatives under incredibly tight timeframes to support New Zealanders when they needed it most. Not only that but we also delivered the next release of our transformation, with the majority of our people working remotely. Our people across the organisation worked long hours and went above and beyond to deliver extraordinary service in an unpredictable and constantly shifting environment. They worked tirelessly with their colleagues across the public sector, remaining focused under pressure and demonstrating agility and commitment to delivering the best possible outcomes for New Zealanders. In short, Inland Revenue could not have achieved what we have this year without our hugely talented, committed and knowledgeable people. Hei whakamaharatanga tēnei whakatauākī mō tēnei mea te tangata. I tēnei tau kē i whakaūngia ai ngā take e whakahīhī ana ahau ki te ārahi i Te Tari Taake. Ko te pūtake o ā mātou mahi ko te whakapakari i te ohanga me te hauora ā-iwi o ngā tāngata o Aotearoa mā te kohikohi me te tuari moni. I mua atu, i tēnei tau tonu, i te nohoanga mohoao tuatahi o Aotearoa nā te mate urutā COVID-19, hei pou toko Te Tari Taake i te whakautu a te Kāwanatanga, mā te whakarite ture hou, kaupapa hou hoki i roto i te wā iti, hei tautoko ake i ngā tāngata o Aotearoa i te wā o te taumaha. I tua atu i tēnā kua tutuki hoki te wāhanga hou o tō mātou hurihanga, inā hoki mahi kē mai ai te nuinga o ngā kaimahi i mamao kē. He kaha kē ō mātou tāngata puta noa i te tari ki te mahi roa kē ki tua atu i ō ia rā hei hāpai tāuke i ngā ratonga i roto i te wā hurihuri. Ka pukumahi rātou ki ō rātou hoa puta noa i ngā tari kāwanatanga, ka tau tonu ngā whakaaro ahakoa te taumaha, ka kitea hoki te raka me te ū kia puta ngā hua mō Aotearoa. Kāti rā, mei kore ake ngā tāngata pūkenga, tāngata mātau, tāngata ū hoki i tutuki ai ngā mahi a te Tari Taake i tēnei tau. We implemented further changes as part of our transformation Last year we delivered the biggest change to the revenue system for individuals in more than 20 years. We moved every single taxpayer account for income tax and Working for Families into our new tax and revenue technology system, START. We have already seen the benefits of this change. Receiving more detailed and timely data has enabled us to proactively contact customers during the year to ensure they are paying and receiving the right amounts. We have also been able to complete the process for issuing automatic income tax assessments for individual earners quicker this year and have returned $688 million in refunds to over 1 million New Zealanders. In April 2020, we continued our transformation with Release 4, which brought KiwiSaver, student loans and the end-to-end processing of PAYE into our new system, as well as some improvements to digital services. The changes gave New Zealanders more information and options to manage their taxes and social policy entitlements. Naomi Ferguson Commissioner and Chief Executive of Inland Revenue 5 Each new release is a huge undertaking and involves people from across the organisation. Choosing to go ahead with Release 4 during the Alert Level 4 lockdown period meant the vast majority of the go-live process was completed remotely for the first time. This is a significant achievement made possible by the investment in our transformation to date, which has given us the tools, knowledge and skills needed to work in new ways and respond quickly and flexibly. We are already seeing the benefits of this new release for our customers. They have told us, for example, that the changes will make filing easier for employers, over 80% of student loan customers find it easy to understand and do what they need to do in myIR, and KiwiSaver customers are finding myIR easy to navigate. This year was the first full year of income tax and Working for Families in START. It’s important to acknowledge that we are still learning to work in our new systems and our customers are still adapting. We made prioritisation decisions to manage the large and complex requirements to successfully deliver Release 4 and support our customers as they continue to familiarise themselves with our new systems and processes. We also experienced disruptions to both our services and our customers from COVID-19. COVID-19 created new challenges for our customers, our people and for how we managed our work. We responded rapidly, temporarily reprioritising and adapting our services to support the Government and our customers in the immediate response to COVID-19. It was important that we continued to deliver critical services to our customers. As a result, we achieved 30 out of 45 performance measures.

We supported the Government’s COVID-19 response Our transformation has meant we were able to respond to changes in Government policy and introduce new internal systems and processes, to deliver a range of support for New Zealanders in response to COVID-19. Working with our new systems and tools, we were able to introduce the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme 6Annual Report 2020 within two weeks of Cabinet signing off on the initiative. Using our online portal, myIR, businesses were able to easily apply for loans, with more than $1.4 billion being paid out to over 85,000 businesses. We also introduced a range of changes to help businesses with cash flow, and introduced the temporary loss carry-back scheme, which has seen $87 million in refunds to customers. New Zealanders were also supported through their employers being able to access the wage subsidy, administered by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). We helped with this through initially taking around 380,000 calls from our MSD colleagues, to verify business details. In order to automate this process, we developed a portal for MSD to securely access this data themselves, while still ensuring safeguards to information were in place.

Helping people to get it right Maintaining the integrity of the tax system and helping people to meet their tax obligations underpins our work. This is central to the way we work with businesses and individuals who are experiencing challenges in every day or exceptional circumstances. Our approach to compliance is multi-layered and based on our commitment to making it as easy as possible for customers to get it right from the start, and hard for them to get it wrong. We know most individuals and businesses want to do the right thing, and we want them to understand that, if they get in touch with us when they are struggling, they will get the help they need. We also want the vast majority of New Zealanders who are making the effort to meet their tax obligations to know that we will identify the few who aren’t and take enforcement action. As a result of our transformation, we now have more tools at our disposal to make smarter decisions about where to focus resources to take a more proactive approach to helping people get it right. We know that compliance activity is better targeted through cost-effective early interventions such as advice and information, giving customers the opportunity to review their tax affairs and either confirm they are in order or submit a voluntary disclosure. Through our intelligence-led approach, we are now also able to identify customers who are not receiving correct entitlements or paying the right amount, and can take early action to help them. We use our analytical tools to detect and prevent revenue loss by helping customers to get it right and using our enforcement powers to deal with fraudulent activity. Voluntary compliance is important and the challenging times brought about by COVID-19 have helped reinforce New Zealanders’ understanding that Inland Revenue will help them when they are struggling.

Working in partnership We work closely with our partner agencies across government. As well as sharing information to help MSD deliver the wage subsidy and the COVID-19 Income Relief Payment, we worked with other agencies to bring in a new All-of-Government language assistance service. This means our customers who do not speak English as their first language can now more easily access our services. Our stakeholders across the tax system are also integral to our work. We have kept tax agents and bookkeepers informed about the changes we have made. Tax agents gave us positive feeback about our COVID-19 response. We are part of the global tax community. Our work includes participating in the OECD-led effort to develop an agreed solution on cross-border tax policy, including options for taxing the digital economy. We also exchange information with other jurisdictions to improve compliance across international borders. Ko te mahitahitanga Ka mahi tahi mātou ki ō mātou hoa tari puta noa i te kāwanatanga.

We continue to develop an organisational culture which is customer-centric, intelligence-led, agile and inclusive, to create an environment where people are comfortable being themselves within our workplace. Te Tiriti o Waitangi (Treaty of Waitangi) commitments matter to us, and one of the ways we are working to meet these is through our Māhutonga work programme. Māhutonga weaves Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori principles, concepts and practices into the way everyone at Inland Revenue works every day. We are progressing elements of both our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan. This year we refreshed our diversity networks.

We have continued on our transformation journey while adapting during the COVID-19 response. We have shown our commitment to being agile and customer- focused. Supporting the Government’s response to COVID-19 will continue to be a focus in the coming year. I am so proud of what we have achieved.

The most significant environmental change and challenge faced by Inland Revenue this year has been responding to, and supporting the Government’s response to, the current global COVID-19 pandemic.

We have shared our approach and analysis with public sector agencies to support New Zealand’s collective response to COVID-19. We use our eight global drivers of change to assess trends, opportunities and risks and improve our ability to respond: EMPOWERED INDIVIDUALS People connecting directly with each other instead of through institutions. MATURING DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM The cloud, social networks, mobile, big data. DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION Ageing populations in many countries and the challenges this poses, along with ethnicity and cultural changes.

This funding is called an appropriation. Our total funding for 2019–20 was $879.1 million. An appropriation is a parliamentary authorisation for the Government or an Office of Parliament to incur expenses or capital expenditure. Expenditure can only be incurred under an appropriation or other statutory authority. We managed our finances well He pai ā mātou whakahaerenga pūtea In 2019–20, our total spend against our operating appropriations was $823 million. This was $55 million lower than our Government funding and other income. The lower spend is mainly due to the change in both the phasing and the delivery of the transformation programme and the timing of the organisational change required to deliver the transformation outcomes. Operating funding of $39 million in our Transformation multi-year appropriation will be transferred to 2020–21. 2019–20 EXPENDITURE AGAINST OPERATING APPROPRIATIONS 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Services to Other Agencies Policy AdviceServices for Customers multi-category appropriation Appropriation Expenditure Transformation multi-year appropriation $ million 167 6 41 10 Transformation multi-year appropriation $206m Services for Customers multi-category appropriation $656m Services to Other Agencies $6m Policy Advice $11m We were funded through four appropriations in 2019–20 656 1166 206 22Annual Report 2020 OPERATING EXPENDITURE FROM 2015–16 TO 2019–20 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Services for Customers multi-category appropriation Transformation Policy Advice Services to Other Agencies $ million 2015–16 738 Over the past five years, our total spend has increased by $85 million as we transform our organisation.

Improved online services that provide customers with better information are an important part of this. In 2019–20, we ran the first full tax year in START, our new tax and revenue system, making improvements as we progressed. We delivered Release 4 of our transformation programme, which moved student loans and KiwiSaver into our new systems and processes. Our new technology and ways of working enabled us to support the Government’s response to COVID-19 while most of our people worked remotely. We are making it easier for customers Kua ngāwari ake ā mātou mahi mō ā mātou kiritaki 24Annual Report 2020 MAKING IT EASIER Release 4 transformed how we administer KiwiSaver, student loans and end-to-end PAYE processing KiwiSaver members now have better information about their contributions in myIR and can do more online for themselves We automatically issued 3.1 million tax assessments, resulting in customers receiving over $688 million in refunds and $140 million in tax to pay Student loan customers are finding the new services easy to understand and they can do what they need to in myIR In response to COVID-19, we implemented a number of policy changes to support the people of New Zealand We implemented the Small Business Cashflow Scheme which paid out $1.4 billion by 30 June We supported the Ministry of Social Development with the wage subsidy scheme which paid out $12.7 billion by 30 June At a glance Hei rarapa noa 25 We are improving services for customers Inland Revenue is making changes that are transforming New Zealand’s revenue system and helping us deliver on our outcomes. Our transformation is making it easier for customers to manage their tax obligations and receive their entitlements with speed and certainty. The Government is now able to make policy changes faster and more cost-effectively.

This release was the biggest change to the revenue system for individuals in more than 20 years and moved every taxpayer account for income tax and Working for Families into START. More information lets us provide better services to our customers The year ended 31 March 2020 was the first full year that we received employment income information every pay day. It was also the first year we received information about people who receive investment income more often, from payers who chose to provide it. This became mandatory for payers of investment income from 1 April 2020. More detailed and timely data means we can proactively contact customers during the year to ensure they are paying and receiving the right amounts. We improved our process for automatically issuing income tax assessments Our second year of issuing automatic income tax assessments included a number of improvements, based on customer feedback. The things we did differently in 2020 included: >sending the assessments out over a shorter time period so customers had certainty earlier >using analytical capability to select customers so that refunds were made early to the customer groups who were likely to need it the most >ensuring that we ran assessments for Working for Families customers as early as possible, so Working for Families customers would have certainty sooner and would not need to call us. We started to automatically issue income tax assessments on 18 May 2020. As at 30 June 2020, 3.1 million assessments had been issued, with around 90,000 still to go, resulting in over $688 million in refunds and $140 million in tax to pay. At the same time in 2019, we released 1.6 million out of the total of 3.0 million assessments, resulting in $395 million in refunds and $67 million in tax to pay. The increase in refunds and tax to pay, from the same time in 2019, is a result of more customers receiving automatically calculated assessments this year. We want to decrease the amounts of refunds and tax to pay from the automatic assessment process in future years. To do this, we will continue to support our customers to pay the right amount from the start, for instance by making sure they are on the correct tax code or prescribed investor rate. The threshold for writing off debt from automatic assessments temporarily increased for this year in response to COVID-19. This means fewer people have bills to pay. We implemented Release 4 of our transformation programme on 16 April 2020, during COVID-19 Alert Level 4. This release moved KiwiSaver, student loans and the end-to-end processing of PAYE to new systems and processes. Release 4 also made improvements to digital services, income tax and Working for Families. These changes give New Zealanders more information and options to manage their taxes and social policy entitlements, and make sure their payment obligations reflect their current income. Customers who are experiencing financial difficulties can apply for relief through a new myIR service. Employers can set up their own instalment arrangements online for any debt they owe. Student loan borrowers who are struggling to make repayments can now apply for a special deduction rate We implemented Release 4 of our transformation in 2020 online. Previously, customers had to phone or write to us to access these services, which could take several days. After Release 4 was implemented, we put in place an extended support period, Pou Whirinaki, to ensure issues identified by customers or our people were quickly prioritised and resolved. Release 4 is helping customers The benefits of the changes made in Release 4 are already evident. New processes are more efficient, meaning customers’ accounts are far more up-to-date and accurate. This is particularly important in the current environment as we help support the recovery from COVID-19. Since go-live, we have been able to transfer contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers more quickly. In the weeks 2727 In the weeks immediately after Release 4 and when the 2020 automatic income tax assessments process was underway, we ran a series of surveys to understand customers’ experiences. The key findings were: >Most employers believe the Release 4 changes will make filing easier, especially centralising employer information in myIR and combining the KiwiSaver and new employee forms. >Changes have been well received by student loan customers, with over 80% finding it easy to understand and do what they need to do in myIR. >KiwiSaver customers are finding myIR easy to navigate. >The vast majority of customers like the automatic income tax assessment process because it is straightforward and minimises actions required from them. More than 80% generally trust Inland Revenue to calculate their tax correctly. Customer feedback on Release 4 The vast majority of the go-live process for Release 4 was completed remotely for the first time during the lockdown for COVID-19. This was made possible by the investment in tools and technology in recent years, and through building on the good release and change management processes used for previous releases. During lockdown, when Release 4 products were being moved to new systems and processes, there were a maximum of eight people from the transformation team on site at our offices at any time, compared to a peak of approximately 100 people for previous releases. We implemented Release 4 remotely immediately after go-live, around three-quarters of members’ contributions were transferred to scheme providers within three to seven working days and 99% were transferred within 14 days. Before this, it took, on average, 20 to 23 working days to transfer contributions. KiwiSaver members now have better information about their contributions in myIR and they can do more online for themselves. We can also identify where a KiwiSaver deduction from an employer is not received into a member’s KiwiSaver account. New Zealanders now have their contributions invested far more quickly which, over time, should help their retirement savings. There have also been significant improvements in the administration of student loans. Loans can now be closed overnight. Before Release 4, closing an account could take up to 42 days due to the amount of manual work involved. Customers often had deductions made from their salary and wages throughout this time. Since Release 4, around 31,000 borrowers have been advised that their loans have been paid off, with $5.9 million refunded to them. Around 270 people worked on the Release 4 cutover remotely, compared to fewer than 10 people for Release 3 in April 2019. 3,800 staff trained 76,000 tests completed 1 million items of data corrected 168 hours to cut over 54 hours to load data into START More than 1,250 cutover tasks We migrated: 7 million accounts 38 million returns 172 million transactions 767 million KiwiSaver contributions 28 MAKING IT EASIER Annual Report 2020 Our policy work supports transformation In March 2020, Parliament passed the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020. The new Act contains measures to simplify and modernise the administration of KiwiSaver and student loans repayments. The changes enabled Release 4. The Child Support Amendment Bill was introduced to Parliament in March 2020. The proposals in the Bill are aimed at removing obstacles to child support compliance and making it simpler to comply, and cover four important aspects of the child support scheme: >simplifying the penalty rules >introducing compulsory employer deductions >limiting retrospective reassessments by introducing a time bar >amending the definition of 'income'. Moving child support to our new systems and processes will happen in the next stage of our transformation. We played a significant role in helping to deliver the Government’s response to COVID-19. The capabilities we gained through our transformation—technology and our people’s skills—were crucial to our ability to do this quickly. The flexibility and new functionality in START enabled us to implement the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme and help the Ministry of Social Development to deliver the wage subsidy. Our analytics tools helped us to detect risk and reduce the likelihood of incorrect claims or payments under the initiatives. New workplace technology let our people work more flexibly and collaboratively, which meant that we could respond to COVID-19 and support our customers while working remotely. Our new ways of working enabled us to work across teams and departments in an agile way. We supported our customers through COVID-19 In September 2019, we announced, with ACC, that we would not accept cheques after 1 March 2020. The technology we use to process cheques is no longer being supported, so any cheques we receive will have to be processed manually, which takes longer. We worked with customers to let them know about this change and give them time to adopt other payment options. Though changing to other payment options required some effort from our customers, they benefit through having a faster and more secure way to pay. We also introduced a self-service phone payment service for credit and debit card payments as part of Release 4. Where customers had no other option than paying by cheque, we granted exceptions. As at 30 June 2020 we have made 520 exceptions. In 2013–14, cheque volumes were approximately 2 million, which reduced to 425,000 in 2018–19. Cheque volumes have decreased significantly each month. From 1 March 2020, when we stopped accepting cheques, to 30 June 2020, we received around 9,000 cheques, compared to 150,000 over the same period last year. We helped customers move to other payment options from cheques We introduced new approaches to support customers The national response to COVID-19 required us to adapt and innovate. It created new challenges for our customers, our people and in how we managed our workload. We know there will also be changing circumstances for us to respond to in the future, with the risk of further lockdowns and an uncertain economic environment. We used analytics to quickly identify essential customer contacts, including those related to COVID-19, and to provide timely responses. We also adjusted our priorities to focus on supporting customers through COVID-19, preparing for Release 4, and critical services, particularly payments and disbursements to customers. As part of this approach, we closed some phone lines on 26 March 2020. The lines that remained open were primarily 29 for social policy customers and employers. Customers who called the lines that were closed were directed to self-service or webmail. Encouraging customers to use these options also allowed us to efficiently respond to customer requests during periods of high customer demand. We also started trialling some outbound calling where customers were able to ask for a ‘call back’. Our ability to answer phone calls reduced by approximately 25% due to the challenges associated with lockdown, such as some of our people being unable to work in our offices. We implemented the Government’s Small Business Cashflow Scheme The Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme was introduced to provide businesses with cashflow support to cover their non-wage costs. The scheme went live on 12 May 2020, two weeks after Cabinet made the decision to introduce it. As at 30 June 2020, 89,461 applications have been received, 85,248 have been approved and more than $1.4 billion has been paid. Almost all applications—99.9%—were received through myIR. Customers found it easy to use myIR to apply for the scheme, and most did not need to call us to do this. Working with other agencies to support customers In response to COVID-19, the Government introduced the wage subsidy to ensure businesses were able to keep employing their staff. We provided support to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) in policy development for the wage subsidy, and to administer the scheme by verifying the eligibility of applications. This has helped MSD to put in place and then extend the Government’s wage subsidy scheme, which paid out $12.7 billion in wage subsidies and leave payment scheme payments to 30 June 2020. When the subsidy was first introduced, MSD people had to call us to confirm a business’s details such as business IRD number and name, and employee IRD numbers. The up-to-date employment information we now get enables us to provide this information. As at 30 June 2020, we had answered more than 380,000 calls from MSD to verify wage subsidy eligibility. A new information sharing portal delivered by a team made up of key people from across Inland Revenue and MSD streamlined that process. The flexibility of our START system helped us to create the portal so that we could implement government policy quickly. We implemented other changes to help businesses Business tax changes to free up cashflow, including an increase to the provisional tax threshold, the reinstatement of building depreciation and writing off interest on the late payment of tax in certain circumstances, have been implemented. The Government introduced a temporary loss carry-back scheme to support customers in the current uncertain economic environment. The temporary loss carry-back measure provides cashflow relief for businesses in loss during the period affected by COVID-19 and was aimed at businesses that had previously been profitable. Businesses expecting to make a loss in either the 2019–20 or the 2020–21 tax year can use some or all of that loss to offset profits they made the year before. As at 30 June 2020, customers had received refunds or amendments of $87 million through the scheme. Our new The Commissioner’s Care and Management powers were used to help customers The approach Inland Revenue has taken in response to COVID-19 has had the wider aim of providing, where possible, flexibility in our responses regarding tax issues to assist our customers to continue to meet their obligations. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is responsible for the care and management of the tax system, as outlined in the Tax Administration Act 1994. These responsibilities include deciding how to best use her resources to maximise the amount of tax collected, to promote voluntary compliance, and to protect the integrity of the tax system. To the extent possible under the law, the Commissioner has used her existing powers relating to the care and management of the tax system to provide for more flexibility and certainty for customers. Recent legislation passed to respond to the COVID-19 crisis also provided the Commissioner with temporary powers to vary timeframes, procedures and administrative requirements, and the ability to remit interest on tax paid late under certain circumstances. These are covered on page 30 along with other measures implemented to assist customers. 30 MAKING IT EASIER Annual Report 2020 The two new Acts included the following measures: >The provisional tax threshold increased from $2,500 to $5,000. This means customers who expect to have a tax bill of less than $5,000 in the 2020–21 income year do not have to pay instalments through the year. We estimate that 95,000 taxpayers will now not have to pay provisional tax. >The low-value asset write-off threshold was raised from $500 to $5,000 for property purchased in the period 17 March 2020 to 17 March 2021, and to $1,000 for property purchased from 18 March 2021, to provide cashflow. This measure also aims to encourage investment. >Depreciation on commercial and industrial buildings is now allowed for the 2020–21 and later tax years. This could reduce this year’s tax bill. This permanent measure is intended to support businesses’ cashflow in the near term and assist with the broader economic recovery by stimulating business investment in new and existing buildings. >Broader refundability rules for Research and Development tax credits were brought forward by one year to apply from 2019–20, to provide cashflow for businesses conducting research and development from the start of the scheme. >For people significantly adversely affected by the crisis, the Government increased Inland Revenue’s powers to remit interest on late paid tax due on or after 14 February 2020. >The Government introduced a new temporary power for the Commissioner to vary a due date, deadline, time period or timeframe, or to modify a procedural or administrative requirement. >The new legislation also contained an amendment to the In-Work Tax Credit to remove the requirement for recipient families to normally be working at least 20 hours per week as a sole parent, or a combined 30 hours per week as a couple, to receive the In-Work Tax Credit. >Separately to these two bills, the Tax Administration (Write Off Amount) Order 2020 increased the threshold for the write-off of small amounts of tax owing by taxpayers subject to the auto-calculation process from $50 to $200. This is to provide taxpayers with more funds during the COVID-19 affected period. analytical capabilities are helping us administer the scheme by identifying customer errors, both inadvertent and deliberate. From 8 June 2020, people who lost their job could apply for the COVID-19 Income Relief Payment. Sharing data with MSD through a new information sharing agreement supported 13,904 applicants to receive this payment. Other information sharing agreements were put in place with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Treasury for COVID-19 purposes. We also created a secure site to share unstructured information with our agency partners, the External Collaboration Hub Online. More information on the results of our approved information sharing agreements is available on pages 188 to 193. We led and implemented policy changes in response to COVID-19 On 25 March 2020, the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Bill was passed through all stages under urgency. A second urgent Bill, the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Bill was introduced and passed on 30 April 2020. The new Acts contained measures to provide cashflow in the near term and to encourage investment. Inland Revenue was the lead agency for these Bills. We also contributed a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP No.488) to the COVID-19 Response (Further Management Measures) Bill. 31 The policy advice we provide is critical to making sure that the tax and social policy systems operate as intended. In August 2019, the Government unveiled its updated Tax Policy Work Programme. The refreshed work programme reflects the Government’s priorities for the tax system and aims to encourage productive investment and ensure the tax system remains sound. The work programme incorporates some recommendations from the Tax Working Group. Our work is guided by the Tax Policy Work Programme. Our policy effort this year included support for bills to enable Release 4 of our transformation, and as part of the Government’s response to COVID-19. One of our three outcomes is to work collaboratively across our external environment to benefit New Zealanders. New information sharing agreements are in place In 2019–20, we implemented new information sharing agreements with other agencies to enable more efficient public services and better customer experience. We started sharing information with: >the Ministry of Health, to supply information relating to the determination of the problem gambling levy rate, which promotes public health by preventing and minimising harm from gambling Bills worked on in 2019–20 Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Bill COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Bill Child Support Amendment Bill COVID-19 Response (Further Management Measures) Legislation Bill (we contributed a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP No. 488) to this Bill) Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Tax agents told us they were impressed with our response to COVID-19. A May 2020 Tax Agent Voice of the Customer Survey showed 57% of tax agents were satisfied with our service, up 18% from February–March 2020. They were pleased with our quick responses to web messages and Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme applications, handling of MSD subsidies and our responses to instalment arrangement requests. We also provided clear information on the tax agents pages on our website, especially the frequently asked questions section and related examples. We closed our tax agents phone line during lockdown, which made it more important to respond quickly and appropriately to online communications. Tax agents appreciate our response to COVID-19 We provided policy advice throughout the year We collaborate with other agencies >the Ministry of Social Development, to facilitate providing IRD numbers to former refugees so their benefits are not suspended >Veterans' Affairs New Zealand, for disclosure of information when consent has been obtained, enabling access to veteran’s compensation for qualifying claimants >Callaghan Innovation, for provision of services and capability to assist with providing the Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive and the R&D Tax Losses Scheme to qualifying businesses. You can find out more about our information sharing agreements on pages 188 to 193. 32 MAKING IT EASIER Annual Report 2020 The year ahead Ko te tau kei te heke mai >We will continue to transform as we build our understanding of working in our new systems, such as START, the data and intelligence platform and Ātea, our enterprise support system. >Our initial thinking on our approach to the final stage of our transformation has changed. We will progressively move the remaining products to new systems and processes in a series of smaller changes over a longer period, rather than as a single, large block of change. >Paid parental leave, unclaimed monies, duties and foreign trusts will move to new systems and processes in March 2021, and child support will likely move in October 2021. >We will focus on helping customers to get their taxes and social policy entitlements right from the start, and continue with changes to our organisation to help us deliver this. >We will continue to support the Government's COVID-19 response. We worked with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Department of Internal Affairs to replace the old All-of-Government language line service with a better, cheaper service, which went live on 1 October 2019. The number of languages and dialects available has increased from 44 to 180. The service offers near real-time access to over 2,000 certified translators, enabling us to resolve more customer enquiries the first time they contact us. A translator is now available on average within 30 seconds from the time we connect to the new language translation service. Previously, appointments had to be booked in advance to ensure a translator was available, resulting in double handling of the call. Our Policy and Strategy team were finalists in the 2019 Spirit of Service Awards in September. The awards celebrate outstanding public sector leadership that delivers exceptional outcomes for New Zealanders. Inland Revenue was nominated for the Māori Crown Relationships Award—Te Tohu mō te Tūhonotanga a Ngāi Māori me te Karauna—in recognition of the work we did with the Treasury on Māori engagement with the Tax Working Group. The partnership between the Treasury and Inland Revenue focused on enhancing tax policy through kaitiakitanga (stewardship), manaakitanga (care), ōhanga (prosperity) and whanaungatanga (relationships). We helped to create a new All-of-Government translation language line service Finalists in the 2019 Spirit of Service Awards Tax helps pay for the public services we all rely on such as education, roads and healthcare. One of our responsibilities is to make sure government has funding for these and other essential services. Inland Revenue does this by helping our customers to get it right from the start. We provide easy access to information and support. We use new tools and capabilities to focus on where we know people are more likely to get it wrong and act quickly when customers are not meeting their obligations. Helping people meet their obligations Kia āwhinatia te tangata kia oti pai i āna herenga 34Annual Report 2020 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS At a glance Hei rarapa noa 86% of customers agreed Inland Revenue helps people who are trying to get things right We set up 146,557 instalment arrangements so customers can make repayments over time We located 11,728 hard-to-find child support customers who had credits and refunded money to them A streamlined donation tax credit process stopped $23 million in ineligible claims We identified $959 million in total tax differences from our investigations We assessed additional tax revenue of $87 million as a result of investigations into property tax compliance We gave taxpayer rulings on $11.9 billion worth of arrangements, where the associated tax was more than $1.18 billion Our updated compliance approach for multinationals provides certainty and transparency around their tax obligations 35 Inland Revenue is the regulatory steward of New Zealand’s tax system. We protect its integrity through helping our customers to meet their obligations voluntarily. We know there are three fundamental beliefs that underpin voluntary compliance and that are vital to the integrity of the tax system. It is important that New Zealanders believe that: • when I pay my tax, I'm doing a good thing (and that's what people like me do) • when I'm trying to do the right things, Inland Revenue will help me • when someone else is trying to do the wrong thing, Inland Revenue will find them. We carry out a range of compliance activities to make it easy for customers to get things right and hard for them to get it wrong. These activities range across informing, assisting, enabling and enforcing compliance. Compliance is about making sure all customers pay the right amounts, accurately file the right information and correctly receive the right amounts or entitlements. It covers everything we do from helping customers get things right from the start through to enforcement where necessary. Taking a ‘right from the start’ approach means supporting customers before issues arise. We: >act early >make it easy to meet obligations and difficult not to >make our processes easy for customers >actively involve and engage customers and other stakeholders. Our new systems enable us to design processes to make it easier for our customers to meet their obligations. We also build in automatic risk indicators and rules that protect the integrity of the tax system and help us to better detect potential fraud across all customer groups. New analytical tools and capabilities allow us to make smarter decisions and approach compliance in a more strategic way. We can understand our customers better and their reasons for not getting it right, develop more tailored and efficient interventions and respond faster when we see deliberate non-compliance. We take firm action to address deliberate non-compliance through a range of enforcement activities, including audit, litigation and prosecution activity. We protect the tax system by helping customers to get it right from the start 36Annual Report 2020 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS Supporting customers impacted by COVID-19 is a priority Inland Revenue has been helping customers to manage their obligations and understand the options available to them. Since New Zealand went into lockdown under COVID-19 Alert Level 4 in March 2020, we have: >set up more than 76,056 instalment arrangements to help customers pay their tax or child support over time >located 8,535 parents who had made overpayments in child support, or carers with money owed to them, and refunded over $4.3 million >adjusted the income levels for 8,500 customers whose yearly income decreased by 15% to reduce child support assessments and help with payment plans >advised customers of a number of relief measures as outlined on pages 28 to 30. During this period, we focused on supporting customers, providing relief where appropriate and, therefore, deferred or delayed some audits, disputes and debt activities. This ultimately helps to maintain people’s voluntary compliance over time. We did progress fraud cases, court proceedings and voluntary disclosures that were important to maintaining the integrity of the tax system. Our approach has impacted some performance results for the year in our management of unfiled returns and debt, cash collection, investigations and tax technical measures. More information is available in the Our performance section from page 68. We let our customers know, through a number of ways, how we can help them get it right from the start. It is easier to get tax right and harder to get it wrong Our new systems, processes and analytical capabilities all help to make tax simpler and more certain for our customers. During the year, we informed customers about their obligations, helped resolve issues early on and improved the efficiency of processes such as the issuing of automatic income tax assessments. Information is tailored for new customers An important focus in our 'right from the start' compliance approach is informing customers about their obligations. Transformation has made it much easier to tailor our information to their needs. For instance, we used our analytics and information tools to identify the best way to support the 54,529 customers who registered for GST and 22,128 customers who registered for the employer deduction code this year. We determined that many did not need help, while others would benefit from attending a seminar or receiving a visit from us. As part of Release 4, all processing of PAYE moved into STA RT, our new tax and revenue technology system, so we can now take the same tailored approach with customers new to PAYE. Our systems are designed to help customers get it right from the start Our systems and processes are designed to minimise the ability for customers to make mistakes and to help us intervene early to ensure they pay and receive the right amounts. Increased automation of our processes means we can do this a lot more efficiently, and are better able to prevent fraud. This allows our people to focus on more complex work to help our customers who need it. For example, we recently streamlined the donation tax credit process to reduce the volume of donation receipts requiring manual review. We built a number of risk indicators into START so that most receipts can now be automatically approved. This results in customers getting their refunds sooner. Automated risk indicators also mean that we are more efficient at stopping refunds that look incorrect. For the year ending 30 June 2020, we reviewed 480,000 donation tax credit claims and disallowed 6% of them, valued at over $23 million. 37 What our customers are saying This year: >77% of customers said they found it easy to deal with us >86% agreed Inland Revenue helps people who are trying to get things right Checks are built into our new COVID-19 initiatives We also built checks and balances into our systems to reduce the likelihood of incorrect claims or payments under the new COVID-19 initiatives. For the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme, we built in up-front checks to prevent people who were not entitled from obtaining a loan. By 30 June 2020, we had carried out 9,630 manual reviews resulting in us declining 4,097 applications (totalling $67.67 million). A further 556 applications were declined based on the automated system checks. We have also been using the analytics and discovery tools to review all loans that were paid out. As at 30 June, we had 51 open audits and 232 more cases requiring audit and any associated collection of loans. Customers who opted into the new loss carry-back scheme could get refunds within 48 hours. Our systems carried out a range of checks and we reviewed any cases where the system identified an error or potential fraud. This resulted in us helping customers, correcting customer records or taking further action where potential fraud was identified. Active monitoring reduces opportunities for getting it wrong We actively monitor customer behaviour and risks to the integrity of the tax system. When a customer makes an error, we review what they have done and sometimes contact them to determine if we can change something to make it easier for them. This could be a change to myIR or to the help provided on our website. We evaluated 3,130,790 GST returns automatically this year. After risk-based checks, 40,992 returns were identified for further review, and of these: >84.6% were released with no action required >5.2% were identified for audit action >5.9% required an adjustment >4.3% remained under review at 30 June 2020. These further actions stopped $106.8 million in refunds from 3,432 GST returns. We monitor the activity of customers who have attempted to obtain fraudulent refunds. Our ability to monitor and take action early increases with each transformation release of improvements to systems, processes and our people's capabilities. We act quickly to address issues We aim to make customers’ experiences easier. For instance, in the lead-up to this year’s automatic income tax assessments, we contacted 15,000 business customers who had unfiled employer information returns. We supported them to file or update their details even if they were unable to make payments because of the impacts of COVID-19 on their businesses. We contacted employers with the largest number of employees first, because we wanted to get correct information for as many individuals as possible before issuing automatic income tax assessments. We engaged early on GST on low-value imported goods Offshore suppliers are now required to register, collect and return GST on goods valued at or below $1,000 that are supplied to New Zealand consumers. This helps to ensure offshore suppliers are on a level playing field with domestic retailers. We engaged early with offshore suppliers to help them meet their obligations and ensure processes will work for them. More than 590 offshore suppliers registered by 30 June 2020 and $62.8 million in GST was returned. Connecting information to better support customers Making better use of SMS text capabilities to contact customers is an area where we have strengthened our support options via technology. In a pilot, we identified customers who needed support, for example those who had an outstanding debt. Typically, one of our people would contact a customer in this situation. By combining our analytics tools, we could send a group of customers a text, and track their subsequent actions such as whether they had contacted us back or logged onto myIR. This capability means we can help more customers without a one-on-one contact and free up time for our people to focus on those who need more support or are choosing not to comply. 38Annual Report 2020 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS Under the hood with our data and intelligence tools Data and analytics are helping Inland Revenue to improve our services, act early so people pay the right amount of tax, target our activities more effectively and make better informed decisions. Within START, the Discovery Manager tool looks at returns received and other information we hold to ‘discover’ errors and issues requiring action. START’s Integrity Manager tool stops assessments and refunds from being issued if there is a high likelihood they are wrong or fraudulent, based on risk indicators built into the system. We have also implemented a data and intelligence platform that complements START’s analytical capabilities. It brings together multiple data sets, both ours and external ones, to identify patterns, understand more about our customers and prioritise areas where they may need help or guidance. Our end-to-end capabilities that will maximise the value from these tools are still maturing. However, we have made big advances in integrating tools and systems to trial interventions and develop insights. For example, we used these capabilities to help the 2020 process for automatic issuing of assessments run faster and with less customer contact. The process took three months in 2019 and two months this year. As outlined on page 41, analytics are also driving innovations in our property compliance activities. We manage debt and unfiled returns Inland Revenue’s approach is to prevent customers getting into debt and having penalties and interest added to what they owe. In response to COVID-19, we increased our support to ensure customers knew what help and options were available. During 2019–20, 146,557 instalment arrangements were set up for customers to repay debt. In particular, we have encouraged customers experiencing a sudden and significant drop in income as a result of COVID-19 to set up an arrangement to pay amounts owing. Instalment arrangements are very effective in helping people to meet their tax obligations. Customers can set up their own arrangements through myIR for all products except child support. This year in START, 37.5% of instalment arrangements (excluding child support) were created by customers. We find those who do so are more likely to meet payments. This year, 93.2% of returns were filed on time, compared to 85.2% last year. This reflects the high volume of payday filing returns we now receive from employers, which provides us with more timely and accurate information. 85.9% of tax payments were made on time against a target of 85%. Budget initiatives targeted aged debt and unfiled returns Inland Revenue concluded highly successful initiatives that used specific Budget funding: >We collected $345 million in aged debt over five years against a five-year target of $191 million. >We assessed over $770 million over five years through work on unfiled returns against a five-year target of $539 million. You can read more about the results we achieved from additional Budget funding on page 97. Focusing on tax debt Excluding debts owed by student loans and child support customers, tax debt at 30 June 2020 was $4.2 billion, up from $3.5 billion at 30 June 2019. Inland Revenue wrote off $411.6 million of overdue debt in 2019–20, compared to $532.6 million in 2018–19. Tax debt is written off for several legislative reasons, including (but not limited to) serious hardship, bankruptcy, liquidation and the cost of collecting the debt when it is uneconomic to do so. The increase in overall debt has been caused by a range of factors: >The last quarter of 2019–20 saw a significant increase in debt growth, as customers experienced the effects of COVID-19. 72% of the GST debt increase this year occurred between April and June 2020. >This year we prioritised ensuring that payday filing of employment information was accurate and timely rather than collecting associated debt. >Our new 2019 automatic assessments for individual income tax brought more customers with debt into the system, including those receiving Working for Families Tax Credits. This has contributed to growth in both income tax and, in particular, Working for Families Tax Credit debt. >Our focus since 2019 on supporting customers through the largest and most complex of our transformation changes, and COVID-19, meant less proactive follow-up on unfiled returns and outstanding debt. 39 Transformation changes implemented in April 2020 mean our systems consolidated all employer deductions—such as KiwiSaver contributions or PAYE—into a single employer account. This makes it easier for employers to track transactions and payments and allows for a single payment covering all their deduction types. As shown in Table 1, this consolidation into an 'employment activities' account does change how we group tax debt. The lines marked with an asterisk are those tax types where we are unable to compare debt with previous years.

We have been preparing for changes in 2021 that will move child support services into START. We located 11,728 customers with historical credits they did not know about. Feedback from customers was of financial relief and a sense of closure—a few customers had given up hope of ever getting the money. We also resolved historical debt for 81,950 customers through collection of their child support liabilities and writing off penalties where appropriate. We set up 84,320 arrangements for customers to pay their child support in instalments. New Zealand and Australia continued to collect child support for each other under a reciprocal agreement. We received $43.2 million and sent $14.2 million. We are also working to ratify the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance, which will make it easier to collect child support from parents living overseas. Managing child support debt At 30 June 2020, child support debt was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 2.6% from this time last year. We wrote off $249 million to encourage payments from customers and resolve historical debt. This compares to $244 million in 2018–19.

This year, the courts granted four arrest warrants, two people were arrested and two chose not to leave the country. These resulted in lump sum payments and one payment arrangement to ensure they comply with future obligations. The courts also granted nine summons for the examination of a liable parent’s financial means, six charging orders against property and five warrants to seize property. 40Annual Report 2020 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS Making student loan repayments is easier Moving student loans into START makes it easy for customers to make repayments online, and identify their loan balance, overdue amounts and upcoming obligations. Customers who are struggling to make repayments can also easily apply online for special deduction rates and interest exemptions. This year, we continued to send targeted emails and SMS text messages to overseas-based borrowers. From March 2020, we assured customers that we are aware of the impact COVID-19 may be having on them and let them know how we could assist if they are struggling.  We collected $1.48 billion in repayments this year, up 7.8% from last year. Of the total repayments, $1.09 billion came through PAYE, up 9.7% from last year, and $384.4 million directly from customers, up 2.7% from last year. Inland Revenue’s investigation activities play an important part in protecting the integrity of the tax system. This assures the vast majority of New Zealanders who do the right thing that we will catch those few who don't. We use intelligence and data tools to identify customers who are not getting it right, to better focus interventions such as audits and reduce their duration. From March 2020, we contacted customers and tax agents to assure them we would support them through any current audits or disputes. We recognised many customers would be under pressure and feeling uncertain because of COVID-19, and we let people know we would consider delaying an audit or dispute for a time. We did progress work on cases that put the integrity of the tax system at risk. We also continued our focus on increasing compliance in the hidden economy and on property transactions, while at the same time ensuring the validity of refunds and claims. Overall, investigations this year identified $959 million differences in tax positions, a return on investment (ROI) of $8.75:$1 against a target of $7:$1. Fourteen audits with tax adjustments over $10 million were closed. Refer to page 99 in Our performance for more details. Our investigations protect the tax system At 30 June 2020, overdue debt was $1.58 billion, compared to $1.48 billion in 2018–19. This increase was driven by overseas-based customers.

Two borrowers were arrested this year, resulting in them making lump sum payments and payment arrangements to ensure they comply with future obligations. We helped customers buying and selling property to meet their obligations Inland Revenue has continued to address risks related to the incorrect tax treatment of property transactions. We assessed additional tax revenue of $87 million in 2019–20 as a result of investigations into property tax compliance. Helping customers to meet their bright-line obligations Under the bright-line rule, customers are required to pay income tax on any profits made from selling a house other than their main home within five years of purchase. We have been working to improve compliance, starting with ensuring that customers have every opportunity to meet 41 their obligations. This is followed up with enforcement for those that choose not to. Using information generated by our intelligence tools, we contacted 3,204 customers about their potential tax obligations. 569 customers were referred for audit and 231 people provided a voluntary disclosure. Voluntary disclosures totalling $1.01 million in additional income tax were assessed during 2019–20. IRD numbers are now required when buying and selling property From 1 January 2020, most people who buy and sell properties have been required to supply their IRD number on land transfer documentation. We have been communicating this change with customer groups such as conveyancers and have updated our website. Before this, up to one third of land transfers were made without a record of the IRD number of the buyer or seller. The change provides us with a more complete picture of property transactions to ensure compliance with tax rules. Data and analytics drive innovations in property tax compliance Our analytics and intelligence tools are helping drive innovations and efficiencies in activities around bright-line obligations. As noted above, our customer teams contacted 3,204 people related to bright-line obligations and could quickly feed back to us on whether a property sale they looked into is subject to this rule or not. Our data and intelligence platform (DIP) was used to bring together multiple data sets to analyse property sales and better target our efforts. The analytics improved our ability to identify sales that are indeed subject to the bright-line rule. A sample set of 100 potential bright-line cases were selected by the DIP and provided to our audit teams. Of the 100, 54 were recommended for audit, a significantly better success rate compared to using our previous systems and processes. The DIP also shortens the time we need to review bright-line cases before an audit from hours to minutes. The intelligence gathered from these 3,204 customers has been used to enhance the code in the DIP to better identify non-compliance at early stages. Our aim is to automate this process of ‘test and learn’ so that we can develop and deliver targeted interventions at scale for other compliance areas. We provide certainty and clarify tax law When interpretation of the law is not clear, we provide certainty by providing public rulings, interpretation statements and by answering specific, discrete questions we have been asked. This year, we provided guidance on a range of income tax and GST matters and several issues related to the impact of and response to COVID-19, including: >the tax implications of providing short-stay accommodation in a property owned by a family trust Residential rental losses can no longer be used to offset other income From 1 April 2019, landlords can no longer generally offset residential property deductions against their other income. We redesigned income tax returns so customers can provide residential income and deduction information and work out excess deductions that are ring-fenced. We reviewed tax returns filed by customers that claimed residential rental losses. As a result, we protected tax revenue of $2.15 million this year. Complex technical issues Some people deliberately try to reduce the amount of tax they should pay or increase their entitlement to social benefits. They may do this by structuring their tax affairs inappropriately or adopting aggressive tax positions or interpretations. Our investigations this year into aggressive tax planning and other technical issues resulted in tax position differences of $295 million. >the implications of receiving an amount from a foreign trust >what are business premises for the purposes of the land tax rules.  Inland Revenue issued a determination to assist employers with the tax treatment of allowances paid to employees to cover their costs of working from home due to COVID-19. We also issued advice about the new loss carry-back rules. 42Annual Report 2020 HELPING PEOPLE MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS Rulings help customers interpret the law Taxpayer rulings give Inland Revenue’s interpretation of how the law applies in specific circumstances. This year, we ruled on $11.9 billion worth of arrangements, where the associated tax at issue was more than $1.18 billion. Significant transactions ruled on included company group restructures, insurance and the new base erosion and profit shifting provisions, which concern tax avoidance strategies exploiting gaps and mismatches in tax rules to minimise tax. We prosecute when necessary For exceptional cases involving a clear and material risk to the integrity of the revenue system, we continued to take enforcement action. We completed 58 prosecutions this year for tax evasion, knowledge and Crimes Act 1961 offences. This compares with 68 in 2018–19. As at 30 June 2020, there were 85 prosecutions before the courts compared with 92 at 30 June 2019. A number of the prosecutions were high profile, reflecting the public’s concern about appropriate action being taken when customers break the law. For example, two co-owners of a restaurant chain were jailed in February 2020 for hiding $6.5 million in cash and laundering the proceeds of their offending. Their offending spanned six years beginning in 2008. We assist significant enterprises to help make interactions easier and faster Inland Revenue continues to work with organisations whose turnover is more than $30 million—we call these customers significant enterprises. This group paid $7.4 billion in income tax for the 2019 tax year and billions more in GST and PAYE collected on behalf of employees and the Crown. We provided dedicated compliance and account management to the top 59 customers in this group, as well as account management to some other enterprises with turnover over $100 million. We reviewed the tax returns of approximately 1,100 significant enterprise groups. This provides assurance to customers that the Commissioner is generally satisfied with their returns or is the basis for determining if any customers need further risk review. A big focus earlier this year was to help significant enterprises prepare for the Release 4 changes implemented to employer information filings, KiwiSaver and student loans, which impacted on them as large employers and financial intermediaries. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 meant we shifted from compliance activities to providing a greater amount of assistance. Feedback from these customers has been positive, especially about the speed of our responses. We are helping and assuring high-wealth customers meet their obligations High-wealth customers and their respective groups paid more than $1.1 billion income tax in the 2019 tax year and collected in excess of $1.925 billion in PAYE. They include individuals or family groups who control more than $50 million in wealth. Because their activities and tax affairs are complex in nature, we have a dedicated team who provide tailored Inland Revenue’s Rochelle Bouterey honoured for frontline excellence In November 2019, Customer Compliance Specialist Rochelle Bouterey received a commendation for frontline excellence from the Public Service Commissioner Peter Hughes. The commendation comes under the Te Tohu Amorangi a Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Day Awards, which honour the great work public servants do to make a difference for New Zealanders. Rochelle's award recognised her work to investigate suspected income suppression by a chain of 28 restaurants, which led to one of the most significant prosecutions taken by us in the past decade. Rochelle (on the left) received her commendation from the Minister of State Services Chris Hipkins (middle) and Public Service Commissioner Peter Hughes (right) at an awards ceremony in November 2019. Our new tax technical website makes it easy to find all our technical publications www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz 43 services for them. Our aim is to help customers pay the right amount of tax, which most do. Sometimes customers get it wrong, whether deliberately or by genuine mistake. In 2019–20, we identified tax position differences of $143.2 million. The amounts identified from year to year can vary significantly due to the timing for the conclusion of long-running cases. We work proactively to help multinational enterprises get it right from the start. Working together provides assurance to us and greater certainty for multinationals, which also makes New Zealand an attractive place to do business. Increased transparency and certainty for multinationals Multinationals are a significant group in New Zealand’s economic environment. Protecting tax revenue means we need to look at compliance internationally as well as domestically. In November 2019, Inland Revenue published an updated compliance focus for multinationals. It reinforces the importance we place on transparency and providing greater certainty for the corporate sector. It also provides assurance to the public that significant enterprises are paying the right amount of tax, and we will take action if that is not the case. The update outlines the objective of our international compliance approach, which is to collect ‘the right amount of tax at the right time through the right channels’. It also includes New Zealand’s response to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan and our forward programme of work. Providing certainty upfront Inland Revenue operates a programme of advance pricing agreements. These agreements provide customers with certainty on tax for specific transfer pricing arrangements, typically for an agreed period of five years. The programme provides us with a level of certainty that these businesses are paying the right tax over a period of time and potential future revenue benefits, with less time required than adversarial audits. 46% of the customers have been in this programme for more than 10 years, and 20% for more than 15 years. As at 30 June 2020, we had 65 customers with active advance pricing agreements, representing tax assured of approximately $200 million a year. All the customers within the programme are required to file an annual compliance report to confirm their tax position. Our 'right from the start' approach to international tax compliance We actively monitor multinationals As part of our increased move to a 'right from the start' approach, we operate several active monitoring programmes. We annually monitor and review significant enterprise customers as outlined on the opposite page and collect further intelligence on all multinationals. For the last five years we have assured over $6 billion of New Zealand's tax base through this monitoring programme. We commenced targeted enforcement campaigns this year, the first one focused on 375 wholesaler/distributor corporates. The campaign reinforced our view of a strong compliance culture in New Zealand, with most corporates performing within expectations. Only 7% warranted a further review. An additional 5% require ongoing monitoring. This approach provides us with further assurance on almost $500 million of the $6 billion tax base noted above. We facilitate international tax transparency through effective exchange of information Inland Revenue takes part in Automatic Exchange of Information with other jurisdictions, an initiative led by the OECD to address offshore tax evasion. In our second year of these exchanges, 74 jurisdictions sent us almost one million account records on New Zealand residents with offshore investments. We matched all the records with our information and risk assessed these against a set of criteria.

In recognition, the women’s network of the International Fiscal Association announced the leading women in the tax community worldwide. Inland Revenue Strategic Policy Advisor Carmel Peters was recognised for her considerable contribution to international and domestic tax policy in New Zealand. She has managed the delivery of a range of domestic reforms such as our response to base erosion and profit shifting and the digital economy, and has negotiated double tax agreements. Carmel co-chairs the United Nations (UN) Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters and OECD’s Working Party No. 1 on Tax Conventions and Related Questions. She is the Convenor of the UN's subcommittee on an update to the United Nations Model Taxation Convention. The year ahead Ko te tau kei te heke mai >In 2020–21, Inland Revenue will continue to support and assist customers to meet their tax obligations and help those adversely affected by COVID-19 to understand the relief options available. >We will continue to mature our analytics and information capabilities to: >identify potential and actual non-compliance earlier >take more effective action through informing, assisting, enabling and enforcement activities >prevent customers getting into debt and having penalties and interest added to what they owe, and increase repayments towards debt. >We will maximise the improvements implemented through our transformation to match more information with customers and identify errors and inconsistencies. >We will also continue to prepare for child support processing to move into START. >We will keep working with multinational enterprises to gain a clearer view of the impact of the new anti- base erosion and profit shifting measures and any pockets of potential non-compliance. >We will continue to run compliance campaigns as we exchange more financial account data on New Zealand tax residents and build on what we and our tax treaty partners have learned. we piloted compliance campaigns ranging from education to enforcement. More than 3,500 customers with multiple offshore accounts were contacted and by 30 June 2020, we had received and processed 307 voluntary disclosures. These voluntary disclosures resulted in a total tax shortfall of almost $6 million and led to greater customer awareness about their obligations. If all of these customers continue to meet their obligations, and there is no negative change in their circumstances, we expect to collect an approximate $2 million in additional tax a year. Contributing to international tax policy This year, we worked on a number of aspects of cross-border tax policy, including options for taxing the digital economy. New Zealand continued to take part in an OECD-led effort to develop an internationally agreed solution in this area. We also maintain a network of double tax agreements (DTAs) and tax information exchange agreements, which are important for trade relations and help to ensure the integrity of the tax system. This year, a new DTA with China came into force. It contains provisions to ensure people doing business between China and New Zealand do not have to pay tax in both countries for the same transaction. 45 We are investing in our people by building their knowledge and capability in areas such as policy agility, tax technical expertise and digital skills, so that we can more quickly meet our customers’ current and future needs. Our continued move to capability-based roles, combined with new tools and technology, is enabling us to be more agile, more resilient and to work more efficiently. Our people were able to develop and implement initiatives quickly, while working remotely to support the Government’s response to COVID-19. We are focused on creating a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture to best serve our communities.

It is about creating an organisation that works better together to improve outcomes for our customers. We are continuing to create an agile, resilient, intelligence-led organisation built around the needs of our customers. This year, we made changes to our operating model for our Policy, Information Technology and Change, and Tax Counsel groups. We created new capability-based roles, larger and more flexible teams, fewer leadership roles and new leadership models. Changes this year aimed to: >ensure our policy advice achieves the intended results and improves overall outcomes across government, by supporting the Government’s broader economic and social objectives >maintain our high standards of tax technical work while enabling greater flexibility and integration of work across our organisation >simplify our information technology services and drive business innovation to deliver improved experiences and outcomes for our customers. We are progressing the design of the rest of our organisation, focusing on the capabilities needed in the future. New Deputy Commissioner roles have been established within the Executive Leadership Team to lead two new groups—Enterprise Design and Integrity, and Enterprise Services. These groups will cover functions such as finance, facilities, technology, people, integrity and assurance, and change. Our people, unions and other key stakeholders are involved as we progress this work.

Our performance approach, Whanake (meaning to grow/ develop), focuses on building capability across Inland Revenue through regular coaching conversations with all of our people. We invest in our people’s development We are focused on developing our people’s capabilities in twelve key areas that represent the mix of skills, experience, knowledge and attitudes we believe we need to better serve our customers. We have made significant investment in our people by supporting them to apply and grow their capabilities in different work situations and environments. For example, in April and May this year, around 20 of our people helped other agencies at the COVID-19 Operations Command Centre and National Crisis Management Centre. Our leadership development programmes include a combination of workshops, peer-to-peer learning, networking and opportunities to work through real life leadership challenges. This year, 75 leaders and aspiring leaders took part in these programmes. Our ‘Working Smarter’ learning pathways strengthen our people’s digital literacy skills, helping them to get the best from our new tools and technology. This enabled them to effectively work remotely during the lockdown period of COVID-19. Customer Advisory Data, Analytics and Insights Design and Integration Leadership 48Annual Report 2020 SUPPORTING OUR PEOPLE Investment in training Between July 2019 and June 2020, our people attended over 13,000 face-to-face learning sessions and completed over 120,000 online learning modules. Over 3,000 people completed over 40,000 training hours in total to learn how to use our new processes in STA RT, our new tax and revenue technology system. We continue to provide high-quality professional development for our tax professionals at all levels. Our people have completed 35,000 training hours in tax and social policy learning this year, through internal roadshows, conferences, videos, e-learning, partnering and one-on-one coaching. Using data and analytics to support our decision-making will enable Inland Revenue to deliver greater value for our customers and the wider public sector. We are building our people’s data and analytical skills as we teach them how to use the customer insights provided through our new data and intelligence platform. We support the public sector Skills Pledge In May 2019, Inland Revenue signed up to the public sector Skills Pledge. The Skills Pledge is a commitment to significantly increase investment in upskilling our people, to prepare for the rapidly changing future of work. Inland Revenue pledged to continue investment in training to build the capability of all our people. This year, we spent $10.8 million on our business-as- usual upskilling, and $8.1 million on upskilling through our transformation programme. This covers all costs relating to upskilling, including procurement and administrative costs and our people’s time. 49 Making Inland Revenue a great place to work We want working at Inland Revenue to be challenging and rewarding, and we want to support our people through this period of significant change.  Our desired culture We are building a culture around the needs of our customers in an intelligence-led, agile and inclusive way. We contribute to this through the way we work, the decisions we make and the actions we take. This is also influenced through our beliefs, behaviours and the relationships we have with each other. FIGURE 3: OUR CULTURE ANCHORS FIGURE 4: OUR DESIRED ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE Customer-centric Together we understand the many influences on each customer, and decide how we will work with them to get the best outcomes for New Zealand. Intelligence-led We’re confident that we make good decisions based on quality information and analysis. We continually test and learn to know what the best approaches will be. Agile We work at pace, pulling together the right people to make good decisions quickly, focusing on the things that matter most. Inclusive We have an inclusive culture where people from all walks of life can achieve their full potential. As a truly inclusive organisation, our people and customers will feel valued and respected, and they will see themselves reflected in our people, our processes, our values and behaviours.

This is an opportunity for our people to say ‘what it’s like to work here’ and how well we are moving towards the type of culture we need to support our transformation goals. The results showed that the gap between our current and desired culture is closing, with positive shifts in the areas of diversity and inclusion, people leadership and collaboration. Despite this, levels of engagement continued to be low (25%). Through the survey, our people indicated that the main driver for this is where we are in our transformation journey. This included going through organisation structural changes, dealing with co-existence of systems and processes as we implement new ways of doing things, and a desire for more open and transparent communication. We know Inland Revenue’s success depends on our people, and we remain committed to improving engagement. We will continue to explore and implement new ways to ensure we are actively listening and responding to our people. The rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation in early 2020 created new challenges for our people and in how we managed our workload. Approximately 77% of our people worked from home during the lockdown period. We explored new ways of working and staying connected to ensure our people were keeping well and engaged. Our investment in technology helped our people to manage their work alongside other commitments. From early April, we ran regular wellbeing surveys to see how our people were feeling and provide the support they needed. As we got used to working differently our people increasingly reported a good or very good experience of doing their work (78% by June, up from 61% in early April). We will continue to run these surveys to get feedback from our people as part of our engagement approach. Keeping our people healthy, safe and well We believe our workplace and culture should promote safe work practices and encourage wellbeing. We integrate health and safety into all of our activities and encourage everyone to show manaakitanga (care and respect) and kaitiakitanga (guardianship). Our National Health and Safety Steering Committee includes representatives from our senior management and unions. We have active participation in health and safety at all of our sites, through elected and trained Health and Safety Representatives. Our focus on health and safety engagement helps ensure we are working effectively to manage risks to our people. In February, we launched a mental health training programme. Its aim is to support our people in looking after their own, and their team’s, mental health. By the end of June, over half of our people had accessed the training. This year, we also updated our front of house design in several sites to better protect our people and customers, and provided Lone Worker Device training for over 400 of our people.

Leaders accessed the results through near real-time dashboards, enabling them to follow up quickly with people who felt that their wellbeing was ‘not good at all’. Our people increasingly reported a good or very good experience of doing their work (78% by June, up from 61% in early April). The Ria McBride Public Service Management Award – Theresse Ioaba The Ria McBride Public Service Management Award, sponsored by Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission, supports women to study as part of their development towards senior management positions in the Public Service. The 2019 award went to Theresse Ioaba, a Team Leader in our Significant Enterprises team, who Inland Revenue nominated for her incredible resilience and determination to achieve. We recognise the great work our people do Our recognition approach focuses on our people’s contributions, the great work they do every day and how they do it. We know that different people value different things. Our Commissioner’s Awards celebrate our people who do a great job and embrace our culture, values and behaviours, making Inland Revenue a better place to work. At the end of each year we recognise the best of the best from our Commissioner’s Award winners with our Stellar Achievement Awards. We also recognise our people in other ways, including sending eCards, printed cards and digital Praise badges. We continue to proactively engage with our unions Our three unions—the Public Service Association (PSA), Taxpro and the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE)—play an important role representing their members’ voices and we are committed to working with them. Engagement with our unions extends across business groups, the transformation programme, health and safety and a range of organisational initiatives. Unions are involved at local, national and programme levels and we regularly share information with them. This year, we negotiated collective agreements with each of our three unions. Each agreement is for three years. We will continue to work with our three unions as we design and implement our future operating model. 52Annual Report 2020 SUPPORTING OUR PEOPLE Diversity and inclusion across our organisation is critical to helping us understand and meet the needs of our communities. We want diversity of thought, beliefs, background and capabilities. Understanding how our customers see the world and the life events they are experiencing, helps us to put them at the centre of how we design our services and interactions so they can get it right from the start. Our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy is designed to: >break down barriers to inclusion, and celebrate, retain, develop and attract a truly diverse workforce that is representative of the communities we serve >actively demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive culture through our leadership and hold ourselves accountable for our progress >create a safer and more open working environment where all people feel able to grow and do their best work without fear of embarrassment or retaliation. Over the last year, we achieved key elements of our strategy, progressing from a ‘reactive’ to a ‘proactive’ organisation against the Global Diversity and Inclusion Benchmarks. Diversity and inclusion is a priority Our new tukutuku panels show our journey with te Tiriti o Waitangi - Treaty of Waitangi In September, we unveiled six new tukutuku panels which will be permanently displayed in the Asteron Centre in Wellington. They tell the story of our journey with te Tiriti o Waitangi. The tukutuku panels were made by Inland Revenue people, past and present, and are a visible commitment to our bicultural heritage and history. We are committed to our responsibilities under te Tiriti o Waitangi - Treaty of Waitangi We understand the importance of meeting our te Tiriti o Waitangi (Treaty of Waitangi) commitments as a government agency. Our Māhutonga approach is designed to help Inland Revenue achieve its Treaty commitments by integrating te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori principles, concepts and practices into the way we work. Our approach aligns with work happening across the public service to improve the Māori Crown relationship. This year we: >continued to develop our Māhutonga approach and the refresh of our te reo Māori language plan. As part of this, we held a series of hui around the country, attended by 150 of our people, to talk about the Treaty principles (Partnership, Participation and Protection) and how to ensure that Inland Revenue maintains the cultural integrity of any tikanga Māori it practices. >began developing a Māori customer strategy, Mauri Ora Te Whānau. This strategy builds on the research work undertaken for our Māori customer landscape, which was developed using kaupapa Māori research principles. Mauri Ora Te Whānau focuses on building a customer environment that is mana enhancing, mauri inducing and whānau focused. Through these, we will develop our people’s capability to understand Māori and improve the way we deliver services to Māori customers. >created a workstream focused on outcomes for our Māori customers, developing self-help resources for Māori and supporting our national Kaitakawaenga Māori team to deliver services in a whānau, hapū and iwi-centric way. We worked with Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development to develop a webinar for the Māori Business Collab. The webinar was aimed at helping businesses and individuals impacted by COVID-19 so they knew what help was available. Where alert levels allowed, we continued Marae visits to help communities with their taxes. >worked with the PSA to introduce a new te reo Māori allowance which recognises Māori language ability. The allowance is accessible to all our employees who have the appropriate certified proficiency. It encourages them to upskill in, and actively use, te reo Māori. 53 This year we: >participated in the TupuToa Internship Programme, hosting interns in our Policy and People and Culture groups. The programme is designed to grow the future generation of Māori and Pasifika leaders by creating pathways for students into careers in corporate and professional sectors >empowered our diversity networks to lead ambitious work programmes, supported by executive sponsors and funding, to raise awareness and encourage everyone to value and embrace our diversity. Our networks help us leverage the rich diversity of our people to improve our services and deliver great outcomes for our customers >established two new diversity networks, Multi-Cultural and Diversability (supporting the diverse needs of disabled people), and recognised and celebrated more than 55 diversity and inclusion events >ran regular awareness campaigns and training on accessibility, and developed toolkits to create content (for example documents, emails, videos) which is accessible for everyone, including disabled people >continued to support our leaders to embed inclusive approaches into their work practices and behaviours, through regular communications, resources and training >completed stage 1 of Rainbow Tick accreditation, to show our commitment to being an inclusive and supportive workplace >continued to introduce more diverse facilities and visual designs into our workplaces around the country. This included parenting and reflection rooms, gender- neutral bathrooms, Māori cultural designs and a rainbow wall >designed our new online modules for mental health training to ensure that there was a strong diversity element, with the use of them/their pronouns and diversity of situations and characters for the storylines. Our diversity networks are helping us to improve our services to customers Our Tagata Pasifika Network has helped teams across our organisation to understand the challenges and opportunities for the Pasifika community when interacting with Inland Revenue. The network is working with our customer-facing teams to help Pasifika customers who are claiming donations tax credits, by developing resources and content for community radio to support digital self-service. Our Diversability Network is helping to raise awareness of opportunities to make it easier for our customers with disabilities (such as vision, hearing or cognitive impairments) to get what they need from Inland Revenue. Our Rainbow Network led the development of a guide to support our people in navigating the process of gender transitioning at work. They also created an LGBTQIA+ Inclusive Language Guide which aims to improve conversations and build respectful relationships between our people and with our customers. “We serve diverse communities in New Zealand so it's important that we take every opportunity to learn as much as we can and make sure we're communicating well with our customers." Sharon Thompson, Deputy Commissioner, Customer and Compliance Services—Individuals and ELT sponsor for the Rainbow Network. The network is part of the Cross Agency Rainbow Network (CARN), and led a cross-agency initiative promoting the use of pronouns throughout the Public Service. Pronouns are words used to refer to people (for example, she/her, he/him, or they/them) and getting them right is critical to inclusion in our workplaces and delivery of services. 54Annual Report 2020 SUPPORTING OUR PEOPLE We are addressing the gender pay gap We are committed to eliminating the gender pay gap— the difference between women’s and men’s salaries. Our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan is published on our website. It describes our current pay gaps, the drivers behind them and the actions we are taking to close them. As part of the plan, this year we: >analysed employee profiles from the point of gender and ethnicity >examined pay and career movements from 2015 to 2020 >looked at the ethnicity and gender breakdown of roles across business areas >identified job segments with a gender imbalance >engaged an external provider to run workshops on unconscious bias and how to remove bias from the recruitment process >monitored interview outcomes using documented panel summaries. Between 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2020, our average gender pay gap decreased from 20.6% to 18.0%. Inland Revenue has changed the way in which the gender pay gap is calculated to align with sector guidance. The pay gap calculation is based on a person’s substantive role. Previously the calculation was based on a person’s current position including temporary role changes. When we compare salaries of men and women in the same roles, on average there is a close to 0% pay gap. Our gender pay gap is largely explained by the over-representation of women in less complex roles, and under-representation of women in senior and highly complex roles. Across our organisation, women currently make up 49% of the people who earn over $100,000, while they make up 70% of the people who earn under $100,000. Representation of women in senior management has increased in recent years, from 22% to 45% between June 2016 and June 2020. We are achieving our goal of having a minimum of 40% of senior leadership roles held by women. We promote diversity and inclusion in the public service Our Commissioner, Naomi Ferguson, is Functional Co-Lead for Diversity and Inclusion in the Public Service, and co- leads Papa Pounamu, a steering group of 12 public sector chief executives driving a programme of diversity and inclusion across the public service. She also sponsors the Government Women’s Network and leads the Advisory Group for the OECD Forum on Tax Administration gender balance network. The Network was established in 2019 to help improve gender balance in leadership positions across tax administrations. Inland Revenue is committed to a number of public sector diversity and inclusion initiatives, including: >the All-of-Government Accessibility Charter >Lead toolkit for employing and retaining disabled people within the State Sector >the He Taurangi Panel Pledge for balanced representation on panels at conferences >publishing our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan and reporting on progress against it. Our flexible working practices support diversity and inclusion We support flexible working. This is reflected in our capability-based approach, investment in workplace tools and technology, and performance approach (Whanake). Flexible working helps us create a more diverse and inclusive workplace where everyone can contribute to Inland Revenue’s success. In 2019, we began working with Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission (formerly the State Services Commission) on guidance for flexible-by-default working practices. ‘Flexible-by-default’ means treating all roles as flexible unless there is good reason for any role not to be, and ensuring flexible options are equally available to everyone without undermining career progression or pay. Flexibility includes the ability to work from home, differing start and finish times, part-time work and job sharing, and phased retirement. We have incorporated Te Kawa Mataaho flexible-by-default milestones into our approach to flexible working. 55 We are addressing the imbalance in ethnic representation We are committed to addressing the imbalance in ethnic representation at Inland Revenue. Across the public sector, Māori, Pacific and Asian women experience bigger pay gaps than European women. As at 30 June 2020, our people represented 130 different ethnicities, broadly in line with the ethnic make-up of New Zealand. However, our diversity decreases as job complexity increases. Our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan aims to reduce ethnic pay gaps and includes strategies to attract, develop and retain people and create a more flexible and whānau- friendly workplace. We will continue to analyse our gender and ethnic pay gaps and work with our people and unions to understand the barriers to career movement and how we can address them. The tables to the right summarise the ethnicity of Inland Revenue’s people. Because they can identify with multiple ethnicities, figures may add up to over 100%. The data includes fixed-term and permanent employees.

During the year, the number of permanent full-time equivalent (FTE) staff reduced by 301, and the number of fixed-term staff and contractors increased. The demographic makeup of our people has stayed relatively stable over the past five years. 57 Our governance system is well-established. It guides us as we work to achieve our outcomes. Our policies and frameworks ensure we act appropriately and meet public expectations. Independent groups regularly review how we are doing, and we use this advice to improve. Effective risk management ensures our operations are adaptive and resilient. We also ensure our technology systems are current and that our property portfolio provides the work spaces and facilities we need. We focus on getting the best value possible from goods and services. How we govern and manage Ko ō mātou mana whakahaere me ā mātou mahi whakahaere 58Annual Report 2020 HOW WE GOVERN AND MANAGE We streamlined our governance system We adopted a new intelligence-led risk management strategy We governed and led successfully through COVID-19 We used technology to adapt to the changing environment We are optimising our physical and environmental footprint At a glance Hei rarapa noa 59 Our governance system guides us At the centre of this system is the Strategic Governance Board. The Board is chaired by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the members are our Executive Leadership Team. Between July 2019 and January 2020, the Board was supported by five committees. Early in February 2020, the Performance and Investment Committee, the Organisation Development Committee and the Customer-centric Committee were placed on hiatus. This was done to streamline our governance system so that we could make the best use of our executive leaders’ time and ensure timely, agile decision-making. The governance decisions that were made at these committees were redistributed to the remaining committees, and a newly formed He Kōtuitui Executive Governance Committee. In June 2020 these changes were made permanent. Membership of our governance committees is based on having the right expertise from across the organisation. It is a mix of executive leaders, senior leaders and external advisors. We will continue to learn from and adjust our governance structure, as we consider what our future governance system will be. The Strategic Governance Board provides our overall strategic direction and approach and determines our enterprise risks and our strategic approach to risk management. The Board ensures all the elements of our transformation come together and decides where we need to speed up or slow down. The He Kōtuitui Executive Governance Committee is responsible for approving the detailed design for our future operating model and for monitoring the implementation of that design, ensuring alignment with the strategic direction set by the Strategic Governance Board. The Technical Governance Committee ensures there is effective coordination and management of our legal and technical business and significant tax technical issues. The Portfolio Governance Committee governs the projects and programmes in our investment portfolio, ensuring they deliver as intended and stay within parameters set, including scope, schedule and budget. Significant issues are escalated to the Strategic Governance Board or the He Kōtuitui Executive Governance Committee. The Performance and Investment Committee governed our organisational health and performance and investment decisions until January 2020. The Committee’s role was to understand and balance investment choices and trade-offs, make sure we met investment objectives, govern benefits realisation, and make sure organisational performance was in line with our strategic direction. From February 2020, these responsibilities passed to the He Kōtuitui Executive Governance Committee. The Organisation Development Committee governed the development of our organisation and workforce until January 2020, ensuring there was alignment with our overall strategic direction. From February 2020, these responsibilities passed to the He Kōtuitui Executive Governance Committee. The Customer-centric Committee helped to shape the way we think about putting the customer at the centre of everything we do and how we can help them to get it right from the start. From February 2020, these responsibilities passed to the He Kōtuitui Executive Governance Committee. The following page has a diagram of our governance and accountability structure as at 30 June 2020. Our governance system ensures we do the right things in the right way to deliver our transformation programme, manage enterprise risks and meet Government expectations. 60 HOW WE GOVERN AND MANAGE Annual Report 2020 FIGURE 5: OUR GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE Strategic Governance Board Commissioner Minister of Revenue Finance and Expenditure Committee Audit New Zealand Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission Risk and Assurance Committee The Treasury As at 30 June 2020 Independent reviews are essential to good governance of our transformation Inland Revenue continues to make good progress in realising the benefits of transformation. In particular, the non-financial benefits, agility, resilience and making things easier for customers, are well-advanced as has been demonstrated by our response to COVID-19. To date we are also under budget for transformation. Four independent assurance reviews were carried out on the transformation programme throughout the year. We provide responses to each recommendation the reviewers suggested. The outcomes of these reviews are reported to Ministers and information about them is published on Inland Revenue’s website. www.ird.govt.nz In addition to these reviews, the Auditor-General conducted a review into the benefit management practices of the Business Transformation programme. The report found we have made good progress to date towards realising the programme’s benefits and are well placed to manage, measure and monitor these in the future. It noted, however, that we must continue to monitor risks and put in place mitigations to ensure benefits are fully realised. More information about this review can be found on website of the Office of the Auditor-General. www.oag.parliament.nz He Kōtuitui Executive Governance Committee Technical Governance Committee Portfolio Governance Committee We manage risks and keep our business running Risk management is integral to governance and management Our risk management approach helps ensure we maintain a current, accurate and comprehensive understanding of our risks and the measures in place to treat and mitigate them. Business groups are responsible for identifying, monitoring and mitigating risks in their area, with support and advice from centralised risk services and internal assurance teams. This year, we adopted a strategy to refresh our approach to risk management across the organisation, promoting an intelligence-led risk culture and upgrading our tools and guidance. Business groups began a refresh of their individual risks, linking these into the enterprise risks in Table 8. This work will continue into 2020–21. Our Internal Assurance and Advice team provides independent assurance to the Commissioner and the Risk and Assurance Committee that our risks are being managed effectively. 61 We manage key risks that could impact on our mission, outcomes and values Inland Revenue has seven enterprise risks, which are discussed regularly by our Executive Leadership Team and periodically reviewed at our Strategic Governance Board and Risk and Assurance Committee meetings. The possibility of a pandemic or natural disaster was included in our enterprise risk assessments and we were prepared, with suitable mitigating controls in place such as our Crisis Management Team and incident response process. These were activated and effective in response to COVID-19. TABLE 8: A SUMMARY OF OUR ENTERPRISE RISKS Risk 1Failure to meet expectations of Government, delivering: core business, Government priorities, Business Transformation Risk 2The levels of voluntary compliance are reduced to the point of having a material impact on revenue collection for the Crown Risk 3Unable to ensure continuity of business services Risk 4Insufficient people capability and capacity to deliver outcomes Risk 5Inland Revenue’s approach to data and information governance is sub-optimal Risk 6Unexpected negative customer reaction to the transformation changes Risk 7Failure to provide appropriate stewardship of the tax and social policy system Good governance and business continuity planning pays off in the COVID-19 crisis Our strong governance and business continuity planning means we can respond effectively during a crisis. We activated the Crisis Management Team (CMT) in mid-March 2020 to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team prioritised activities and resources to ensure the health and safety of our people as we maintained services, contributed to the Government’s COVID-19 response initiatives and delivered Release 4 of our transformation. The CMT used our crisis management plan and ensured we had protocols in place to respond to each change in COVID-19 alert levels. As the pandemic escalated, we reviewed our business continuity plans to ensure teams could manage their work with reduced personnel or site access. We temporarily closed nine of our offices during the Alert Level 4 and 3 lockdowns and floors in our other buildings. Independent review of how we managed our COVID-19 response In May, we commissioned an independent review of our response to COVID-19 to help us learn what had gone well and what improvements we could make in managing any future crises. The review commended our response for several reasons, including: >leadership shown by the Crisis Management Team resulted in a well-managed response >our ability to adapt to different methods of working quickly and under stressful conditions meant we were able to respond to COVID-19, continue delivering on our transformation and deliver services to customers effectively >we had the technology and infrastructure for most people to work from home effectively >our communications with customers, and wellness checks with our people, were frequent across a range of platforms and channels >the use of ‘site leads’ was identified as a significant difference in ensuring the response at each of the sites was centrally managed and provided a single point of contact >engagement with unions was open, frequent and enabled immediate issues to be managed. The review noted that while the areas for improvement were “...mostly attributed to the unprecedented nature of the event and the requirements for the majority of staff to work from home”, these were not of a substantive nature and did not result in any failure of Inland Revenue to meet its obligations to the Government and customers. 62 HOW WE GOVERN AND MANAGE Annual Report 2020 Our Risk and Assurance Committee provides an independent view Inland Revenue benefits from our Risk and Assurance Committee, which provides independent advice and insight to the Commissioner on risk oversight and management as well as our system of internal controls. Committee members, who met seven times in 2019–20, are independent external experts, with a mixture of skills in assurance, financial management, risk management and organisational change. The following are members of the Risk and Assurance Committee: Steven Fyfe worked in the banking industry with National Bank and ANZ until 2011. He brings governance, large change programme and commercial experience to the Committee. His current governance roles include Chair of Cigna Life Insurance NZ Ltd and the Red Cross Foundation, and Trustee of the Victoria University of Wellington Foundation and Sky Stadium. Steven is a member of the Risk and Assurance Committee at the Ministry for Primary Industries and the FMA’s Auditor Oversight Group. Michael Ahie is an experienced director with diverse domestic and international experience in both the private and state sectors. He has a strong background in strategic planning and change management. He is Chancellor of Massey University, Chair of the Board of Spring Sheep Milk, Chair of the Plant Market Access Council and is a director of FMG. Sandi Beatie chairs the Board of Education Payroll Ltd, is a member of the Risk and Assurance Committee for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and is an independent member of the Department of Internal Affairs' Te Ara Manaaki Programme Board. Sandi also undertakes review and advisory work within the public sector. She previously chaired the Archives Council, was a Director for IQANZ Ltd and was a member of a Ministerial Advisory Group on Public Media.

Cath Atkins is also a formal member of the Committee representing Inland Revenue's Executive Leadership Team. 63 We act with integrity, honesty and professionalism Inland Revenue plays a unique role in administering New Zealand’s tax and social policy and specific obligations under the Tax Administration Act 1994. This includes the requirement to protect the integrity of the tax system and keep information confidential. We have strict rules and restrictions on integrity matters such as accessing customer information or assisting friends or family. Routine monitoring is in place to look for potential wrongdoing and ensure incidents are properly and fairly investigated. Our Code of Conduct helps us make the right decisions every time We launched a refreshed Code of Conduct Tikanga Whanonga in late 2019, to reflect the changes in workplace culture, technology and ways of working. The Code has the State Service Standards of Integrity and Conduct at its core, and reinforces the importance of high standards of integrity and conduct. It provides an ethical decision-making checklist that helps our people make the right decision every time. We also revamped our fraud and corruption control policy and guidelines to better reflect the changing environment we now work in. Privacy breaches are minimised There were 118 privacy breaches reported this year, compared to 112 in 2018–19 and 160 in 2017–18. We attribute the lower numbers for the last two years to better quality assurance processes and controls in STA RT, our new tax and revenue technology system, that prevent unauthorised actions and access. None of the breaches resulted in harm to any individual. We completed the annual self-assessment against the Government Chief Privacy Officer’s 10 core expectations for privacy management. We met seven of 10 expectations and continue to report strong maturity in culture, breach and incident management. We aim to minimise threats to cyber security Inland Revenue is seeing increased cyber security threats but has not found any overt unauthorised hacking attempts resulting in a loss of customer data or systems breach. Our assessment of cyber threats has remained at high, which is in line with New Zealand’s national threat level. We monitor our systems and assets for vulnerabilities and risks and continuously improve our detective controls for unauthorised activity such as hacking or non-compliance with our Code of Conduct. During the year we grew the capacity of the Cyber Operations team and continue to invest in them and in our processes to detect and act on potential malicious activity. We detect and block multiple attempts daily, and there have continued to be numerous ‘spam’ and ‘phishing’ attempts to elicit customers’ details. We communicate with customers about the safety and security of their information so they can protect themselves, and we do what we can to mitigate such attempts. We are continually reviewing and improving our cyber processes and procedures. Between Mid-May and July we automatically process and pay out tax refunds. It’s also when scammers may try to scam you. Beware of Tax Refund Scams We communicate with our customers around protecting their information. 64 HOW WE GOVERN AND MANAGE Annual Report 2020 Our systems and assets are well managed Transformation has improved our agility to make changes to the tax system quickly Before implementing START, our heritage systems and processes were the greatest constraint on our agility to improve services to customers and Government. They were complex, time-consuming and expensive to change. Business transformation has introduced new technologies including: >a new workplace technology environment that is less complex, significantly more secure and lets our people work more flexibly and collaboratively >a new leading-edge security and identity access management system >migrating all our tax products and some social policies into START, which has greatly improved the resilience of our systems >creating self-service digital channels and high levels of automation and improved voice capability to serve our customers >a new information knowledge management system that has modernised how we work and that enables us to work in a more collaborative, joined-up way so we can better support customers >moving to an IT operating model that is as-a-service and cloud-based >investments in new data centres, greatly improved disaster recovery, and in data analytics and capability. The result of these changes is that system constraints are no longer an issue, provided exceptions are minimised, requirements are clear and a good fit with our capabilities, and data sources are well understood. Ātea is helping us to work more efficiently and productively As part of our transformation, Ātea is a set of tools that is making it easier for us to do our day-to-day administrative work. It is a modern cloud-based platform used for performing enterprise support services (ESS or back-office). In October 2019, we rolled out functionality for carrying out core transactions in human resources, finance and purchasing. Ātea provides greater self-service to our people You can find more information on our technology asset performance on page 105 in areas such as travel booking and financial management. It also provides a single source of truth for data and makes business information more visible and available to our teams. Ātea supports a common process model that we adapted to be fit for New Zealand’s public sector and which gives us international best-practice processes. Using cloud technology has enabled our teams to continue providing day-to-day enterprise support services including annual budgeting and forecasting remotely during the lockdown. We also successfully released a new set of Ātea tools remotely. These included workforce compensation, which helps to manage the pay review process, and a financial control module to help identify fraud and errors. Over the year, we provided 32 other agencies with access to the New Zealand common process model. We are also supporting several agencies that have chosen to implement the same cloud-based technology as we use. We reached the Government’s target for paying our suppliers On the back of our investment in more efficient services, we reached a target set by Government to pay 95% of domestic invoices within 10 working days from March 2020. Our teams are working hard to sustain this performance because we understand how essential cashflow is to New Zealand businesses, especially now. We introduced e-Invoicing This year we introduced e-Invoicing, the first New Zealand government agency to do so. We are ready to pay invoices this way with any suppliers that have also set up this capability.  E-Invoicing is the direct exchange of invoice data between suppliers’ and buyers’ financial systems. We pay approximately 20,000 invoices to suppliers each year. With e-Invoicing, businesses no longer need to generate paper or PDF invoices that have to be printed, posted or emailed, and buyers no longer need to manually enter or scan these into their financial systems. This results in fewer errors in re-keying information, time savings for both suppliers and buyers and, ultimately, faster payments. We are meeting the Government target of paying 95% of domestic invoices within 10 working days 65 The amount of air travel was 35% lower this year than in 2018–19, and related CO 2 emissions dropped by 34%. Overall travel costs (including flights, accommodation and other costs) were $3.5 million less than budgeted for 2019–20. We are right-sizing our vehicle fleet As part of our continuing programme to right-size our vehicle fleet, we reduced it from 138 to 110 vehicles this year. We are currently looking at the future ways of working for our teams who use our vehicles to interact with customers in their communities. We are launching a phased programme to replace our fleet with electric vehicles to support the Government’s aim of having an emissions-free light vehicle fleet by 2025–26. CO 2 emissions from our vehicle fleet are now being measured. Emissions dropped 85% in 2019–20 compared to the year before, although this result was significantly affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns. Energy consumption for 2019–20 was 16% lower and costs were 8% lower. Printer use for 2019–20 was 43% less than the year before. Costs were down 37%. Air travel was 35% lower (over 5 million kms) and related CO 2 emissions fell by 34% or 1.4 tonnes. CO 2 emissions from our vehicles dropped by 85%. We travelled 281,000 fewer kilometres. We are focused on efficiency and environmental sustainability Inland Revenue is transforming into a smaller and more efficient organisation, with a workforce that we expect to be 25% to 30% smaller by 2023–24 than in 2014–15. The space we occupy, our vehicle fleet and use of environmental resources are changing to reflect this. We are optimising our property portfolio Over the past few years, we have completed several major property projects to optimise space and reduce our accommodation footprint. We have built greater flexibility into our leases to be able to give up space we do not need. We have also relocated, where opportunities have allowed, to buildings that take less energy to operate. We moved to a new site—Te Ao Nui—in Te Papaioea Palmerston North, exited two of our three sites in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington and consolidated office space in Takapuna. We also moved out of one location in Ōtautahi Christchurch to support the Ministry of Social Development’s urgent need for office space as a result of COVID-19. The Government Office Accommodation Programme involves securing commercial accommodation that meets the current and future needs of a number of government agencies and guides our property decisions. As part of the programme, we are leading the Manukau Hub project on behalf of Government. As a result of the changes during 2019–20, our energy consumption was 16% lower than the year before and our costs were 8% lower. We are now measuring the trend in CO 2 reductions from energy use—we reduced this by 16% compared to 2018–19. Printing and travel have decreased We have been printing and travelling less, partly due to COVID-19, but also because more of our people can take their work devices anywhere and collaborate virtually. This contributes to the Government priority of a clean, sustainable, low-carbon economy. As at 30 June 2020, printing was 43% less than at 30 June 2019 (and as a result, paper use was less too). We saved approximately 37% in printing costs. Mail between our offices was also down by 25%, saving $64,000 in courier costs. 66 HOW WE GOVERN AND MANAGE Annual Report 2020 We focus on getting the best value in our procurement Our Buying for Better Outcomes procurement strategy ensures that we consider not only the whole-of-life cost of a procurement, but also the wider benefits to society, the environment and the economy. This year, we incorporated broader outcomes questions into our tender documents and subsequent agreements. We have also been engaging with our major suppliers to understand the broader outcomes they are delivering through their work. To get the best value for money, we look for innovative efficiencies and improvements in our procurement processes and market engagement. We also take part in a number of All-of-Government, syndicated and common capability contract arrangements. We continue to share our insights and learnings related to commercial practices with other government agencies. For example, we have developed a simple software application for more efficient management of conflicts of interests in procurement. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment is now remodelling this application to enable its use by all public sector agencies. The year ahead Ko te tau kei te heke mai >In line with our wider organisational change, we will review our governance system to ensure the boards and committees in place are fit for purpose and able to support our requirements. >We will roll out more information and functionality through Ātea, and leverage what we have to help other agencies improve their enterprise support services. >We will continue to complete optimisation of our technology landscape and decommission data centres and systems that are no longer needed. >We will continue to realign our property portfolio through exiting leases, and we will update our national property plan to take into account reducing people numbers, options for co-locating with other agencies and flexible working. >We will go to market for a replacement payroll solution. We track our progress towards achieving our mission and vision through our performance measures. The diagram on page 19 shows the connection between what we are here for, what we want to be, how we achieve this and how we measure it. We use outcome, impact and output measures to tell our performance story. We track the performance of our outcome and impact measures over time. These measures do not have targets. We include commentary where appropriate to help explain our results. In most cases, our performance in 2019–20 is measured by comparing our achievements against the results from previous years. Our output measures have performance targets, which we either achieve or do not achieve. Our measures are either percentages, values or case studies. Case studies allow us to provide background and additional context around a result. We evaluate our case study measures by comparing results to previous years where available, and by highlighting the differences we made. Our financial and asset performance and organisational health measures show how effectively and efficiently we managed our resources to deliver our services. Our performance Ko tā mātou mahi 68Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE This year, we continued our transformation programme while adapting and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown. The challenges we faced this year tested our resilience as we showed our commitment to our customers. We delivered the 2020 automatic individual income tax assessments and Release 4 of our transformation programme, and supported our customers through COVID-19 and other national adverse events. We ensured our customers received their social policy entitlements and tax refunds and supported customers to meet their tax obligations. Our outcome performance has remained steady in a year of significant events. We continued to provide customers with timely refunds and social policy payments, achieving all of our timeliness targets. The timeliness of tax payments made by customers dropped slightly this year, and assessed revenue was 3.9% lower than forecast. Results from our impact measures show that customers are increasingly using our online services, with a significant increase in the number of returns being filed and correspondence being sent digitally. We also have a number of case studies that demonstrate that we are realising the benefits of our transformation through how we are using START, new analytical tools and capabilities. As a result of prioritisation decisions in the context of a large and complex transformation programme, and disruptions to our services and to our customers from COVID-19, we achieved 30 out of 45 of our output performance measures in 2019–20. We achieved most of our primary output measures. The vast majority of our customers filed returns and made payments on time. This was also the first year that we met the target for percentage of child support assessments paid on time after increasing this target by 5% in 2018–19. We exceeded our policy advice targets and met our transformation milestones. While our customer satisfaction results remained high throughout the year, three out of four measures narrowly missed our targets. Customers continued to familiarise themselves with our processes during the year, putting our phone services under pressure. This impacted on a number of our core customer service measures. Some of our output measure results reflect the impacts from our approach to supporting customers through COVID-19. We deferred or delayed audits, disputes and debt activities where customers needed a different kind of support from us. This ultimately protects the integrity of the tax system and means people are more likely to voluntarily comply over time. Performance measures impacted include management of unfiled returns and debt, cash collection, investigations and tax technical measures. Our facilities asset performance results have also been affected by COVID-19 and the lockdown. We have been unable to complete some of the required checks on our buildings and vehicles. Our levels of CO 2 emissions and printer use dropped significantly this year, with limited travel as people worked from home. How we performed Ko ā mātou whakatutukinga 69 Statement of responsibility I am responsible, as Chief Executive for Inland Revenue, for: • the preparation of the department’s financial statements, and statements of expenses and capital expenditure, and for the judgements expressed in them; • having in place a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the integrity and reliability of financial reporting; • ensuring that end-of-year performance information on each appropriation administered by the department is provided in accordance with sections 19A to 19C of the Public Finance Act 1989, whether or not that information is included in this annual report; and • the accuracy of any end-of-year performance information prepared by the department, whether or not that information is included in this annual report. In my opinion: • the financial statements fairly reflect the financial position of the department as at 30 June 2020 and its operations for the year ended on that date; and • the forecast financial statements fairly reflect the forecast financial position of the department as at 30 June 2021 and its operations for the year ending on that date.

Our outcome measures help us to track our performance in delivering our outcomes, which allows us to achieve our mission. Our three outcomes and the measures for each are discussed below. Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord The tax revenue we collect is used by the Government to benefit all New Zealanders. It helps pay for public services, like education, roads and healthcare. We have three measures for this outcome. Percentage of tax payments made by customers on time This measure relates to timely and cooperative behaviour of our customers, resulting in tax obligations being paid. This in turn contributes to revenue being collected to fund government programmes. The percentage of tax payments for income tax, PAYE and GST made by customers in full and on time has decreased. As part of our support for our customers affected by Release 3, we did not run our usual 7 February and 7 April payment reminders. These are personalised communications we provide in addition to our START reminder messages that are sent automatically. We expect performance to return to previous levels as customers become familiar with our new systems and processes. This is also an output measure within our Services for Customers multi-category appropriation, and we have exceeded the target of 85%. 85.9 % 2016 87.0% 87.9% 87.9% 86.8% 85.9% 2017201820192020 of tax payments were made by customers on time Total revenue assessed and forecast This is the amount of revenue assessed compared with the total revenue the Government expects to receive. COVID-19 has contributed to tax revenue being lower than forecast. There were lower business profits, consumption of goods and services weakened, and interest rates dropped, lowering withholding taxes. A new process for estimating income tax was introduced in 2018–19, resulting in some revenue that would have been recorded as 2019–20 revenue being recorded as 2018–19 revenue. Refer to pages 150 and 151 in our financial schedules for a breakdown of total revenue. 3.9 % less 2016 2.0%2.0% 6.4% 2.7% -3.9 % 2017201820192020 revenue was assessed compared to forecast 72Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE Total cash forecast and received This is the total tax receipts the Government received for tax returns filed (current year and prior years), provisional tax payments, and deposits into tax pooling. Crown cash received to 30 June 2020 for tax payments was $76.3 billion, 2.8% over forecast and 2.3% higher than for this period last year. People receive payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society We are responsible for making sure people receive their payments in a timely manner, so they can participate in society. We have seven measures for this outcome. Percentage of tax disbursements paid to customers on time Income tax disbursements issued This measure looks at the time taken to issue income tax disbursements to customers once a return is received, ensuring that they receive the payments they are entitled to. The percentage of income tax disbursements paid to customers on time has decreased this year and reflects a new target we set for 2019–20. We changed the timeframe from six to five weeks to challenge ourselves to deliver a higher level of customer service and illustrate the benefits of our new system and processes. This is also an output measure within our Services for Customers multi-category appropriation. We have exceeded the output target of 85%. 86.2 % 2016 88.9%88.9% 89.7% 6 WEEKS 5 WEEKS 89.7% 86.2% 2017201820192020 of income tax disbursements were issued within five weeks GST disbursements issued This measure looks at the time taken to issue GST disbursements to customers, ensuring that people receive the payments they are entitled to. 96.5 % 2016 96.5%96.5%96.6% 96.1% 95.3% 2017201820192020 of GST disbursements were issued within four weeks This is also an output measure within our Services for Customers multi-category appropriation, and we have exceeded the target of 95%. 73 Percentage of social policy payments made to customers on time 70.0 % 2016 68.4% 69.0% 69.6% 69.8% 70.0% 2017201820192020 of child support assessments were paid on time This indicator is an output measure within our Services for Customers multi-category appropriation, and we have achieved the target of 70%. 99.4 % 2016 97.8% 98.7% 99.8% 99.5% 99.4% 2017201820192020 of paid parental leave payments were issued to customers on the first pay day following the agreed date of entitlement This indicator is an output measure within our Services for Customers multi-category appropriation, and we have exceeded the target of 97%. 99.3 % 2016 99.3%99.3%99.1%99.5% 96.3% 2017201820192020 of Working for Families Tax Credit payments were made on the first regular payment date following an application This indicator is an output measure within our Services for Customers multi-category appropriation, and we have exceeded the target of 95%.

We will be able to report on the accuracy of income tax refunds from the 2020 automatic income tax assessment process next year, as customers have until February 2021 to make any amendments. We will continue to develop accuracy indicators for our social policy payments. 74Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE New Zealanders benefit economically and socially through Inland Revenue working collaboratively across our external environment This outcome has two measures. The first is how business customers view their experience when dealing with Inland Revenue and the second is how many of our common transactions are completed digitally. Business customers gain value from easy and seamless dealings with Government 55 Jun 2017Dec 2017Jun 2018Dec 2018Jun 2019Dec 2019 Public SectorInland Revenue Pu blic Sect or and Inland Revenu e 60 66 66 62 55 6363 58 5757 55 52 Customer experience index score Better for Business The Better for Business programme runs ongoing research for 10 agencies including Inland Revenue, giving insights into how we can improve our dealings with business. The customer experience index score measures how businesses rate their experience of dealing with government services. Our customer experience index score of 55 in December 2019 was a decrease from 66 in December 2018. The overall score for the public sector also decreased to 52 in December 2019 from 57 in December 2018. We expected our score to decrease following Release 3 changes that significantly impacted businesses with payday filing. This year was the first full tax year where it was mandatory for customers to provide their employment income information every pay day. Our customers continue to familiarise themselves and adapt to our new processes. Percentage of customers who believe Inland Revenue takes appropriate action to ensure New Zealanders receive their social support entitlements 80 % 2016 72%72%72% 80% 78% 2017201820192020 of customers believe Inland Revenue takes appropriate action to ensure New Zealanders receive their social support entitlements 75 By 2021, 80% of the transactions for 20 common public services will be completed digitally Inland Revenue has three transactions in the top 20 common public services that we measure digitally: paying individual tax, claiming donation tax credits and filing individual tax returns (IR3s). Our results for two of these transactions have increased from last year. 94.8 % 71.9 % paying individual income tax digitally June 2019: 91.2% claiming donation tax credits digitally June 2019: 59.5% We were unable to report on IR3 return results in 2019–20. To make year-end income tax easier for our individual customers, we have started pre-populating their IR3 returns with information we already have. These returns appear in our system as ‘generated by Inland Revenue’ rather than reflecting the channels our customers used to provide their information. These changes mean the IR3 digital filing measure is no longer suitable for reporting. 76Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE Our impact measures show the difference we have made Our impact statements outline the difference we want to make to help achieve our mission. Our impact measures help us understand our performance against these impacts. Making a difference in these areas helps us achieve our mission. We also have integrity measures to help us understand the level of trust and confidence people have in us. These measures have improved over the last year. We have been supporting our customers to help them understand what the changes from Release 4 mean for them. Customers are using our new services, are responding to our communications and are increasingly using our online services. While our customers have adapted to these changes, they are still getting used to our new systems and processes. We aim to support our customers, so they know what to do, find it easy and do what they need to. Our performance for each impact statement is discussed below. Customers know what to do The following results show our customers’ perceptions of whether they know what to do. This comes from our new online Customer Experience and Perceptions survey that started in 2019–20. Results show ratings of 4 or more, out of 7. 84 % 90 % of customers agreed they knew what they needed to do next of customers agreed they felt confident that they were doing the right thing Customers find it easy The following results show our customers’ perceptions of ease.

We conduct our tax compliance survey every two years. However, to reduce the burden a survey places on businesses as they manage the impact of COVID-19, we delayed our 2020 survey until 2021. In late 2018, we conducted an online survey of 6,003 small businesses to estimate the time and cost of complying with tax requirements. Small to medium-sized businesses estimated they spent 27 hours each year meeting their tax obligations in 2018. This is unchanged since 2016 and is nine hours fewer than the estimate these businesses made in 2013, which is the baseline against which progress is measured. We continue to develop compliance effort indicators for our non-business individuals. Customers successfully using digital channels to undertake activities Returns filed digitally 96.0 % 2016 73.4% 78.5% 83.0% 88.8% 96.0% 2017201820192020 of returns were filed digitally (income tax, GST and employment information) Correspondence sent digitally 75.0 % 2018 57.2% 75.0% 52.3% 20192020 of correspondence sent in by customers was sent digitally Businesses using accounting or payroll software As at 30 June 2020, 136,936 small to medium-sized enterprises and tax agents used business accounting or payroll software to manage their GST obligations.

We include income tax, GST and employment information returns. With the introduction of mandatory payday filing, we have seen an increased volume of employment information returns filed on time. This is also an output measure within our Services for Customers multi-category appropriation, and we have exceeded the target of 85%. Customers who had their income tax assessments and entitlements issued automatically 94 % of individual income tax customers had their 2020 income tax assessment issued automatically By automating the assessment process, we now can include customers who previously missed out on refunds they were entitled to or did not previously pay the right amount of tax. 79 Automatically issued income tax refunds and tax to pay get progressively smaller As customers have until February 2021 to make amendments to their 2020 assessment, we will compare finalised 2020 assessment results with 2019 to see if income tax refunds and tax to pay amounts are getting smaller. As at 30 June 2020, 3.1 million assessments were issued to customers for the 2020 automatic assessment process. Write off (under $200), $36.8m Refunds, $688.2m Tax to pay, $140.3m We use intelligence and insight to improve customer outcomes and revenue We report on two measures for this impact. Improved compliance and customer outcomes Case study—using our new analytical tools to support customers We have two analytical capabilities in STA RT, Discovery Manager and Integrity Manager, that make it easier for us to see if our customers are getting it right, or wrong. Discovery Manager enables us to look at returns received and other information held, to find errors and issues that require action. Integrity Manager stops assessments and refunds from being issued where there is a high likelihood they are wrong or fraudulent, based on the risk indicators built into the system. This ensures our customers receive the payments they are entitled to. Customer sentiment—tax morale The following results come from our new online Customer Experience and Perceptions survey that started in 2019-20. Results show ratings of 4 or more, out of 7. 84 % 86 % 93 % of customers agreed they feel good about paying their tax of customers agreed that Inland Revenue helps people who are trying to get things right of customers agreed that if someone tries to avoid paying the right amount, they will get into trouble with Inland Revenue. 80Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE Customer maturity score We use the Forrester maturity framework to benchmark the extent to which we have put the customer at the centre of our plans. The Forrester framework provides an assessment of customer-centric maturity, using a set of key strategic enablers such as leadership, culture, analytics and proactive services. In 2018, we completed an internal assessment of how customer-centric we are, and achieved a score of 3 out of a possible 5. We are planning to complete another assessment in 2021. We deliver evidence-based policy that is innovative and responsive to customer needs We report on two measures for this impact. Increased policy capability We use the Policy Maturity Matrix, developed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to assess our policy capability. Based on our recent self-assessment, we have a capability level of 2.5. This has increased from last year’s self-assessment level of 2.3. We will focus on improving: • People capability–by embedding robust training and development processes to build future capability • Engagement–by continuing to improve relationships with stakeholders and our customer-facing people • Policy quality systems–by enhancing our research and analysis to achieve the best intended policy outcomes • Stewardship–by embedding a culture change that focuses on our role in the regulatory system, while maintaining our leadership and direction. Reduction in time and costs to implement policy Case study—Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme We played a significant role in helping to deliver the Government’s response to COVID-19. The capabilities we gained through our transformation—technology and our people’s skills—were crucial to our ability to do this quickly. On 1 May 2020, the Government announced the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme to support small businesses affected by COVID-19. A number of key factors enabled the rapid design and implementation of the scheme. The most important factor was our early anticipation of the potential need for a payment capability. The scheme was shaped and implemented within six to seven weeks of a preliminary assessment of what the Government might need. Release 3 was a key milestone as we now have all income information in one place and can associate more of a person’s income with them. As a result, errors and inconsistencies across tax types can now be identified and acted on. These capabilities helped us to: • tailor information for customers registering for GST • identify and contact 200,000 customers to help them select the right tax codes • identify 1.5 million customers who were on the wrong prescribed investor rate so that we tax their investment income at the right rate • make correct Working for Families payments • provide support to our customers when needed, including paying and receiving the right amount • identify non-compliance by tax type. 81 Our preliminary work ensured that the requirements of the scheme were simple and used existing capabilities, information and processes. This was critical as one of the primary considerations was speed. Exceptions and rules were challenged as a risk to the Government’s desire for immediacy and the need to keep it simple to avoid unnecessary costs for both prospective loan applicants and for us. Delivery of the scheme in such a short timeframe also demonstrated how radically our technology and design environment has changed. We used the payment and collection functionality built within START, and unlike the timeframes required to code and test changes to our heritage systems, changes could be made during the day if necessary, instead of overnight. This allowed us to implement the scheme within two weeks of Cabinet signing off on the initiative. Our new ways of working and workplace technology enabled all the necessary expertise from across teams and departments to be brought together to design and implement the scheme from end-to-end quickly. As at 30 June 2020, 89,461 applications had been received, 85,248 had been approved and $1.429 billion had been disbursed. Small businesses with five or fewer employees accounted for 80% of applications and 63% of the value of loans issued. We work with others to create better results for customers and government We report on two measures for this impact. Results achieved through information sharing Key information sharing initiatives: COVID-19 wage subsidy and wage subsidy extension We supported the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) with the implementation of the wage subsidy and wage subsidy extension payments. We provided data to help them with assessments, verifications, audits and reviews. To support the wage subsidy extension and COVID-19 Income Relief Payment, we accelerated the deployment of a portal to allow MSD access to view employer and income data. Enabling MSD to self-serve for some applications and integrity checks reduced the impact on our people, with only exceptions for self- employed customers needing to be validated. Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme (SBCS) From 19 May 2020, we supplied MSD with wage subsidy data for the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme’s eligibility criteria. From June 2020, we shared key SBCS information with Stats NZ, which publishes aggregate information on their COVID-19 Data Portal. Stats NZ Integrated Data Infrastructure remote access We supported Stats NZ with a remote working policy for their staff and specified government researchers, permitting them to remotely access our data in the Integrated Data Infrastructure and Longitudinal Business Database. A joint agency group worked quickly to ensure that staff and researchers could seamlessly continue COVID-related projects and other government projects deemed essential to New Zealand. 82Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE Results of international collaboration As outlined on page 43, Inland Revenue’s collaboration with international tax treaty partners has included completing a second year of Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). AEOI is one of the activities we carried out this year, in addition to: • continuing to focus on strong engagement with multinational enterprises and providing effective upfront guidance to them • our annual international questionnaire and risk assessment process • managing requirements for multinationals to file an annual basic compliance package • an active programme of advance pricing agreements • efficient enforcement covering high-risk cases. New Zealand was subject to two peer reviews this year. These reviewed our compliance with base erosion and profit shifting minimum standards for the exchange of summaries of certain cross-border rulings and country-by-country reports. The reviews looked at the effectiveness of our implementation of these international initiatives. They found New Zealand fully compliant, with no recommendations for improvement required. Inland Revenue has also been collaborating with the Asian Development Bank to support Pacific developing countries. The aim is to increase these countries’ awareness of, and capacity to counter, tax evasion and avoidance. It will involve tailoring technical assistance that aligns with their national strategies and priorities. 83 We protect the integrity of the tax and social policy system, and our stakeholders and the public have trust and confidence in us Our integrity measures show how we protect the integrity of the tax and social policy system. We report on two measures. Percentage of customers who have trust in us 89 % 2016 88%88%88% 89% 89% 2017201820192020 of customers have trust and confidence in us This is derived from the Customer Satisfaction and Perceptions survey for ratings of 3 or more, out of 5. Comparative results and benchmarking—Public Sector Reputation Index (RepZ) score Our RepZ score is 2016 93 96 97 98 91 2017201820192020 91 The Public Sector Reputation Index (RepZ) measures the reputation of public sector organisations across four areas: trust, fairness, social responsibility and leadership. Our latest score has decreased seven points from the previous year from 98 to 91. Reputation scores are relative to other public sector agencies included in the index. This means that if there are new agencies that have a higher score, or other agencies have improved more than we have, our score will show a relative decrease—even if the public has not rated us any differently when answering the questions. There were a number of statements where our scores improved—most notably ‘uses taxpayer money responsibly’. A score of 100 is average. A score of 95 and below is considered weak, while a score of 105 or higher is strong. 84Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE EthnicityNew Zealand (2018 Census) Inland Revenue (as at 30 June 2020) Public sector (Human Resource Capability Report 2019) European70%68%67% Māori 17%12%16% Asian15%16%11% Pacific Peoples8%8%9% Ethnicities at Inland Revenue Staff engagement Our staff engagement is 25 % This is a 2% decrease from our previous full survey conducted in 2017 (27%). We measure employee engagement and perceptions of our culture through our Kōrero Mai survey. In October, we ran our full Kōrero Mai survey. The results showed that the gap between our current and desired culture is closing, with positive shifts in the areas of diversity and inclusion, people leadership and collaboration. Through the survey, our people indicated that the main driver for this result is where we are in our transformation journey. This included going through organisation structural changes, dealing with co-existence of systems and processes as we implement new ways of doing things, and a desire for more open and transparent communication. The rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation in early 2020 created new challenges for our people and how we managed our workload. From early April we ran regular wellbeing surveys to see how our people were feeling and provide the support they needed. As we got used to working differently, our people increasingly reported a good or very good experience of doing their work (78% by June, up from 61% in early April). We know Inland Revenue’s success depends on our people, and we remain committed to improving engagement. We will continue to explore and implement new ways to ensure we are actively listening and responding to our people. Diversity and inclusion We use two measures, representation and pay equity, to track our progress for diversity and inclusion at Inland Revenue. We intended to measure representation by comparing Inland Revenue’s ethnicities to the New Zealand working population. In the absence of New Zealand working population statistics, we have compared our results against the public sector. Our organisational health measures show how we use our resources to deliver for our customers 85 Pay equity: the pay gap for gender at Inland Revenue We are committed to eliminating the gender pay gap. Between 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2020, our average gender pay gap decreased from 20.6% to 18.0%. Inland Revenue has changed the way in which the gender pay gap is calculated to align with sector guidance. The pay gap calculation is based on a person’s substantive role. Previously the calculation was based on a person’s current position including temporary role changes. When we compare salaries of men and women in the same roles, on average there is a close to 0% pay gap. Our gender pay gap is largely explained by the over-representation of women in less complex roles, and under-representation of women in senior and highly complex roles. Across our organisation, women currently make up 49% of the people who earn over $100,000, while they make up 70% of the people who earn under $100,000. Representation of women in senior management has increased in recent years, from 22% to 45% between June 2016 and June 2020. We are achieving our goal of having a minimum of 40% of senior leadership roles held by women. 86Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE Expenditure incurred against departmental appropriations Our work is funded through operating appropriations. We finished the 2019–20 year within all departmental appropriations. 2019–20 OPERATING EXPENDITURE AGAINST OPERATING APPROPRIATIONS 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Services to Other Agencies Policy AdviceServices for Customers multi-category appropriation Transformation multi-year appropriation $ million 167 6 41 10 656 1166 206 BREAKDOWN OF 2019–20 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AGAINST CAPITAL APPROPRIATIONS 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Property, plant and equipment Intangibles $ million 98 107 6 8 In 2019–20, our total spend against our operating appropriations was $823 million. This was $55 million lower than our Government funding and other income. The lower spend is mainly due to the change in both the phasing and the delivery of the transformation programme and the organisational change required to deliver the transformation outcomes. Operating funding of $39 million in our Transformation multi-year appropriation will be transferred to 2020–21. Appropriation Expenditure Appropriation Expenditure 87 Overall Investor Confidence Rating The 2019 Investor Confidence Rating for Inland Revenue is: A The Investor Confidence Rating (ICR) is a three-yearly assessment of the performance of investment-intensive agencies managing investments and assets that are critical to the delivery of government services. The ICR process is led by the Treasury. The assessment looks at several elements, including how we manage assets, projects, long-term investment planning, procurement and change. The results are scored A to E (high to low). The rating provides an indication of the level of confidence that investors (such as Cabinet and Ministers) can have in an agency’s ability to manage investments and assets. Following the A rating we received in 2016, we were assessed for the second time during 2018–19 and retained the A rating. There were improvements to the assessment process between rounds which made it more rigorous. The Treasury acknowledged that maintaining an A rating is difficult and demonstrates our leadership in investment management amongst investment-intensive agencies. 88Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE Our output measures show how well we performed against the services we deliver This section reports on our performance against our targets, as included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2020. Full details can be found on the Treasury’s website: https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/estimates/vote-revenue-finance-and- government-administration-sector-estimates-2019-20 We have included comparison of our performance information against the performance measures and results for 2018–19. Our performance targets for 2020–21 are also included to provide context to the 2019–20 results. We explain measures where we have not met the target or have achieved a result that was 15% greater than the target. Some performance measures are calculated using a sample of the customer population. We have marked these performance measures with a hash (#). All target and forecast figures on pages 89 to 103 are not subject to audit. Review of 2019–20 output performance measures and targets We have two categories of performance measures: primary and supporting. Our primary measures have a greater focus on what we are intending to achieve and show progress towards achieving our outcomes. The supporting measures are more operational in nature, providing additional information. We review our output measures and targets each year to ensure they reflect the range of services we provide and our operating environment, and support the achievement of our outcomes. As we transform, we continue to be challenged with operating across two systems to support our customers. Our intent is to ensure that customer service levels are maintained during this time. Despite these challenges, we lifted targets or adjusted the timeframes for six of our measures for 2019–20, to reflect the benefits from transformation changes, increasing customer expectations and continuous improvement. Two measures were changed and one retired to reflect our new ways of working. The transformation milestones were also updated to reflect the agreed key programme milestones for 2019–20. These changes reduced the overall number of output measures from 48 in 2018–19 to 45 in 2019–20.

While our customers continued to familiarise themselves with our online processes, our phone services were under pressure. This influenced our customers’ perception of our services. Supporting measures $44.76$48.47Average cost of a customer-initiated contact$35.00 or less$35.00 or less Not achieved—The cost of a customer-initiated contact has decreased from last year. Customer-initiated contact includes all inbound calls, paper and digital correspondence and visits to our front of house offices. Self-help customer contacts are not included. The mix of contacts has been different this year, with more items of digital correspondence and visits to our front of house, and fewer phone calls and less paper correspondence. While digital interactions are more cost-effective to respond to, front of house visits are the most expensive. We had 300,000 fewer customer-initiated contacts overall than last year, a 7% decrease. Our focus to resolve customer queries on their first contact with us, being proactive in discussing their broader business with them, often results in interactions taking longer, increasing the cost per contact. This year’s result also reflects higher costs due to the large number of people focused on supporting customers through Releases 3 and 4, responding to additional customer contacts about automatically calculated income tax assessments, and providing support during the COVID-19 response period. New measureAverage speed to answer telephone calls4 minutes 30 seconds or less 4 minutes 58 seconds 4 minutes 30 seconds or less Not achieved—The average speed to answer telephone calls was a new measure this year. Results were impacted by significant customer demand in the first part of 2019–20 and our ability to answer calls as we balanced a broader set of priorities, including supporting customers through Release 3 and preparing for Release 4. Our focus to resolve customer queries on their first contact with us, and being proactive in discussing their broader business with them, often results in calls taking longer, impacting our ability to answer calls within our target timeframe. We answered 2.0 million calls this year compared to 2.6 million answered in 2018–19. We also responded rapidly to the impacts of COVID-19, temporarily reprioritising our services to support the Government and our customers. We answered 380,000 calls from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to verify wage subsidy customer details. These calls are not included in this measure. We have been actively encouraging customers to communicate with us online using myIR rather than calling our contact centres. We received 530,000 more items of digital correspondence in 2019–20 than in 2018–19. To help our customers during COVID-19, we focused on a 48-hour response service for digital correspondence. 100%Percentage of all rulings reports, adjudication reports and public items that meet the applicable purpose, logic, alternatives, consultation, and practicality standards 100% 100%100% 28Number of published or finalised public items that give the Commissioner’s interpretation of the law 25 2625 96.4%Percentage of public items (including relevant public consultation), completed within 18 months of allocation 85% 100%85% # Actual performance measured using a sample of the customer population.

Our year-end result reflects the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown where we had fewer people available to work on the cases with limited ability to access resources. Our usual peak time to process child support administrative reviews is between March and June. We prioritised our inbound child support phone calls and applications to ensure child support customers received their entitlements during this time.

This measure demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of our work to recover assessed revenue from returns not filed by the due date. The introduction of mandatory payday filing, and subsequent removal of employment information returns, has resulted in a decrease in the volume of returns and the value assessed. There was no corresponding decrease in our costs.

This measure demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of our debt collection activities. We set our 2019–20 target prior to income tax being administered in START, when we did not know the impact removing tax pooling customers would have on the measure. Since then, we have a better understanding and visibility of our tax pooling customers and as a result, we are increasing our 2020–21 target to $40.00. 69.8%Percentage of child support assessments paid on time70% 70.0%70% Supporting measures $24.04Average cost of finalising an unfiled return$18.00–$20.00 $50.83$30.00 or less Not achieved—The average cost of finalising an unfiled return increased from last year. This measure demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of our work on finalising returns not filed by the due date. With the introduction of mandatory payday filing, we have removed employment information returns from this measure. This removes a significant number of returns. There was no corresponding decrease in our costs. Now that all our tax products are being administered in START, this measure only includes returns that are filed by a customer following a compliance action. Previously this measure included returns that were not required to be filed. Results were also impacted by our decision to prioritise supporting customers in preparation for Release 4, and reducing our focus on these returns in response to COVID-19. We focused on helping our customers set up instalment arrangements and providing other relief options. We are changing our 2020–21 target to $30.00 or less.

With the introduction of mandatory payday filing, we have removed employment information returns from this measure. This removes a significant number of returns. We set our 2019–20 target prior to the introduction of mandatory payday filing. We now have a better understanding of the impact of payday filing and have removed employment information returns from the measure.

We are changing our 2020–21 target to 60%. 47.0%Percentage of collectable debt value over two years old50% or less 51.6%50% or less Not achieved—This measure looks at how much of our collectable debt is aging and therefore becoming harder to collect. The percentage of collectable debt value over two years old has increased from last year, but we came in just under our target. This includes student loan debt, which contributes to a high proportion of the overdue debt over two years old. A significant portion is owed by overseas-based borrowers, which is harder to collect. 81.3%Percentage of new customer debt resolved within six months80% 70.8%80% Not achieved—Percentage of new customer debt resolved within six months has decreased from last year.

Some of our work on Budget-specific initiatives focused on ageing debt and returns not filed by the due date. The funding for our Budget 2012 and Budget 2015 initiatives for aged debt and unfiled returns finished this year. Our aged debt and unfiled returns collections initiatives exceeded their five-year June 2020 targets. We collected $345 million in aged debt against a $191 million target, and assessed over $770 million through our unfiled returns against a target of $539 million, through Budget 2012, 2014 and 2015 funding. We completed the second year of our Budget 2018 unfiled company returns initiative. This continues through to June 2022. We assessed $87.5 million in returns against the target of $108.5 million for June 2020. Before the impact of COVID-19, we had been tracking well to achieve the year-end target. The decision to defer our campaign work and reprioritise our compliance activities to best support our customers during this period has influenced our results.

The funding for our Budget 2012 and Budget 2015 initiatives for investigations finished this year. Investigations this year identified a total of $959 million differences in tax positions, of which Budget-specific initiatives contributed $362 million to the total tax differences identified. We have achieved $1.374 billion in tax position differences, against a five-year target of $1.062 billion. Our work on the hidden economy assessed additional tax revenue of $50 million, of which $23 million came from our Budget 2015 funding. Investigations into aggressive tax planning and other complex technical issues resulted in tax position differences of $295 million in 2019–20.

Operating expenditure In 2019–20, we spent $824.8 million to operate our organisation. This was $54.9 million lower than our Government funding and other income. The lower spend was mainly due to the change in both the phasing and the delivery of the transformation programme and the organisational change required to deliver the transformation outcomes. Our operating expenditure against appropriations excluding remeasurements (expenditure that does not require an appropriation) was $823.3 million. Operating funding of $39.1 million in our Transformation multi-year appropriation will be transferred to 2020–21. Operating expenditure by cost categories Our expenditure includes personnel, operating, depreciation and amortisation, and capital charge and finance costs. Our total personnel costs for 2019–20 were $436.3 million. These costs were directly related to our employees’ remuneration and training and development costs. Operating costs for the year were $298.1 million. Approximately 90% of these operating costs related to contractors, information technology and telecommunications, rental, consultants and office expenses. Comparing 2019–20 to 2018–19 Our personnel costs were $13 million higher in 2019–20 than in 2018–19, mainly due to an increase in restructuring costs associated with transforming our organisaton. Our operating costs were $31 million lower in 2019–20 than in 2018–19, mostly driven by the phasing and savings realised from our transformation programme. Expenditure on depreciation and capital charge have increased due to assets created as part of our transformation programme. $ million BREAKDOWN OF EXPENDITURE BY COST CATEGORY 500 400 300 200 100 0 Capital charge and finance costs Depreciation and amortisation OperatingPersonnel 436 298 67 23 423 329 59 20 2018–19 2019–20 8% Depreciation and amortisation 36% Operating 53% Personnel 3% Capital charge and finance costs BREAKDOWN OF 2019–20 EXPENDITURE BY COST CATEGORY 108Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE Capital expenditure We spent $103.8 million in capital investment in 2019–20. This was lower than our revised capital budget of $114.6 million, mainly due to the re-phasing of the capital plan for the transformation programme to align with our updated delivery approach. Transformation expenditure Our expenditure on transformation to date is under budget. We spent $1,121.9 million (excluding depreciation and capital charge) on transformation between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2020. This expenditure includes $747.0 million in operating and $374.9 million in capital. Any under-spending to date has either been moved to later periods or returned to the Crown. Future outlook Operating expenditure for 2020–21 is forecast to be $899.5 million, an increase of $74.7 million from 2019–20. Capital expenditure for 2020–21 is forecast to be $213.1 million, an increase of $109.3 million. Our capital investment in 2019–20 was $103.8 million, contributing to the growth of our net assets. This is mostly driven by investing in more intangible assets as we further transform our organisation. 109 Appropriation statements The following statements report information about the expenses and capital expenditure incurred against each appropriation administered by Inland Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2020.

Expenditure in 2018–19 is for a partial year. 3 Impairment of debt and debt write-offs relates to general tax, Working for Families Tax Credits and KiwiSaver debt. 4 The Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme commenced on 12 May 2020. The budget figures for 2019–20 are based on forecasts prior to the commencement of the scheme. 112Annual Report 2020 OUR PERFORMANCE Statement of non-departmental unappropriated expenditure For the year ended 30 June 2020 In the 2019–20 financial year, there were: • no instances of expenditure incurred outside of appropriation (2018–19: $nil) • one instance of expenses incurred with Cabinet authority to use imprest supply but without appropriation prior to the end of the financial year (2018–19: $nil) • one instance of expenses incurred in excess of appropriation and without prior Cabinet authority to use imprest supply (2018–19: $nil). These forecasts have been updated for the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update 2020 to reflect loan uptake to date and the extension of the scheme to 31 December 2020. PLA refers to appropriations established under a permanent legislative authority. All of the non-departmental appropriations administered by the department are exempt from the requirements to report end-of-year performance information, under section 1D of the Public Finance Act 1989. The budget, revised budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP, using the same accounting policies as those adopted in preparing the non- departmental financial schedules. For a full understanding of the Crown’s financial position and the results of its operations for the year, refer to the consolidated Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2020.

However, these changes were not included in The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2020 and, therefore, have not yet been validated through legislation. Inland Revenue obtained joint Minister approval for forecast changes to appropriations relating to Vote Revenue. However, the documentation omitted authority for approval under imprest supply. Without imprest approval for the changes, Inland Revenue has incurred expenses in excess of appropriations.

Capital commitments Capital commitments are the aggregate amount of capital expenditure contracted for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that has not been paid for or recognised as a liability at balance date. Cancellable capital commitments that have early exit or penalty costs explicit in the agreement are reported at the lower of the remaining contractual commitment and the value of those penalty or exit costs (i.e. the minimum future payments). Non-cancellable operating lease commitments Inland Revenue leases property, plant and equipment in the normal course of business. The majority of these commitments are long-term non- cancellable accommodation leases for Inland Revenue’s premises at locations throughout New Zealand. The annual lease payments are reviewed regularly, and the amounts disclosed as future commitments are based on current rental rates. The total minimum future sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases at balance date is $2.318 million (2019: $3.261 million). Inland Revenue’s non-cancellable operating leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. There are no restrictions placed on Inland Revenue by any of its leasing arrangements. 121 Statement of contingent liabilities and contingent assets As at 30 June 2020 ActualActual 20192020 $000 $000 Contingent liabilities 147Employee grievances5 465Legal proceedings and disputes—taxpayer356 612Total contingent liabilities361 Contingent assets 1,860Legal proceedings and disputes—taxpayer1,433 1,860Total contingent assets1,433 The accompanying accounting policies and notes form part of these financial statements. Contingent liabilities Employee grievances These contingent liabilities represent amounts that may be claimed by employees as a result of alleged grievances against Inland Revenue. Legal proceedings and disputes—taxpayer These contingent liabilities relate to potential claims against Inland Revenue for court costs associated with tax disputes and other legal proceedings being taken through the courts against taxpayers. They only relate to court costs. The actual revenue (tax) under dispute is recognised as a non-departmental contingency (refer to the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets on page 157). The expected value of the contingent liabilities is calculated using an outcome probability model that considers both the total potential liability and the probability of that outcome. Other Inland Revenue is defending proceedings in the Employment Court. The Plaintiffs seek a declaration from the Court that they were employees of Inland Revenue, despite being employed by another employer at the material time. The outcome of these proceedings could lead to subsequent legal claims being raised by the Plaintiffs. Therefore, the extent of Inland Revenue’s financial liability is unquantifiable at this stage. Contingent assets Legal proceedings and disputes—taxpayer These contingent assets relate to potential amounts recoverable by Inland Revenue for court costs associated with tax disputes and other legal proceedings being taken through the courts against taxpayers. They only relate to court costs. The actual revenue (tax) under dispute is recognised as a non-departmental contingency (refer to the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets on page 157). The expected value of the contingent assets is calculated using an outcome probability model that considers both the total potential court costs recoverable and the probability of that outcome. 122Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2020 These financial statements are for the year ended 30 June 2020 and include forecast financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2021.

Basis of preparation Reporting entity Inland Revenue is a government department as defined by section 2 of the Public Finance Act 1989 and is domiciled and operates in New Zealand. The relevant legislation governing Inland Revenue’s operations is the Public Finance Act 1989. Inland Revenue is a wholly owned entity of the Crown whose primary objective is to provide services to the public rather than to make a financial return. Accordingly, Inland Revenue has designated itself as a Public Benefit Entity (PBE) for financial reporting purposes. Reporting period The reporting period for these financial statements is for the year ended 30 June 2020. The forecast financial statements are for the year ending 30 June 2021. The Chief Executive and Commissioner of Inland Revenue authorised these financial statements on 30 November 2020. Statement of compliance The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989, which includes the requirement to comply with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice (NZ GAAP), and the Treasury instructions. Inland Revenue has applied the Tier 1 Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PBE IPSAS) in preparing the 30 June 2020 financial statements. Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and the accounting policies set out below and in the notes to the financial statements have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless otherwise stated. The accrual basis of accounting has been used. Functional and presentation currency These financial statements are presented in New Zealand dollars, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000). The functional currency of Inland Revenue is New Zealand dollars. Accounting standards issued and not yet effective Standards and amendments, issued but not yet effective, that have not been adopted early are: PBE IPSAS 2 Statement of Cash Flows The amendments to PBE IPSAS 2 require entities to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, with early application permitted. Inland Revenue does not intend to adopt the amendments early. PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments The External Reporting Board issued PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments in March 2019. This standard supersedes PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which was issued as an interim standard. It is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Inland Revenue does not intend to adopt PBE IPSAS 41 early. When this standard is adopted, Inland Revenue does not expect any significant changes as the requirements are similar to PBE IFRS 9. PBE FRS 48 Service Performance Reporting PBE FRS 48 replaces the service performance reporting requirements of PBE IPSAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Inland Revenue has not yet determined how the application of PBE FRS 48 will affect its statement of performance and does not intend to adopt PBE FRS 48 early. Estimations and judgements In preparing these financial statements, judgements, estimates and assumptions have been made concerning the future. These judgements, estimates, and their associated assumptions may differ from the subsequent actual results. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and other factors. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The main estimations and judgements that are relevant to Inland Revenue’s financial statements are disclosed in note 9 (Property, plant and equipment), note 10 (Intangible assets), note 11 (Debtors and prepayments), note 13 (Employee entitlements) and note 14 (Other liabilities). These notes include disclosures relating to the impacts of COVID-19 in Inland Revenue’s financial statements. 124Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Accounting policies Significant accounting policies are included in the notes to which they relate. Significant accounting policies that do not relate to a specific note and which materially affect the measurement of financial results, the financial position and output statements within the Our performance section are outlined below. Goods and services tax All amounts in the financial statements and appropriation and output statements are exclusive of goods and services tax (GST), except for debtor Crown, net debtors and accounts payable, which are stated on a GST-inclusive basis. Where GST is not recoverable as input tax, it is recognised as part of the related asset or expense. The net amount of GST owing or due at balance date, being the difference between output GST and input GST, is included in creditors and other payables in the Statement of financial position. The net GST paid or received, including the GST relating to investing and financing activities, is classified as an operating cash flow in the Statement of cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed exclusive of GST. Income tax Government departments are exempt from income tax as public authorities. No charge for income tax has been provided for. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in transit, and funds held in the bank accounts. All cash held in bank accounts is held in on demand accounts and no interest is payable to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue is only permitted to spend its cash and cash equivalents within the scope and limits of its appropriations. Foreign currency transactions Inland Revenue’s activities expose it to the risks of changes in foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency transactions (including those for which forward exchange contracts are held) are translated into New Zealand dollars using the spot exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the financial results. Cost allocations In 2019–20, Inland Revenue has introduced a simplified cost allocation model that delivers quality cost information that: • generates valuable insights • provides more visible linkage between business activities, outputs and products • brings together output and product costing in one model • aligns to Inland Revenue’s operating model • is simple to use and easy to maintain. Inland Revenue allocates costs directly to an output where a line of sight exists between an appropriation and business services or projects. Inland Revenue utilises indirect allocation where business services cannot be attributed directly to an output. Indirect allocation rates are apportioned to outputs based on weighting of relevant direct drivers the business services support. The changes to cost allocation policies from 2018–19 did not result in material changes to individual appropriations except for the Services for Customers multi-category appropriation where Services to Inform the Public about Entitlements and Meeting Obligations and Services to Process Obligations and Entitlements have increased with a relevant decrease in Investigations and Management of Debt and Outstanding Returns. The changes reflect Inland Revenue’s focus to support customers through a period of significant change and perform activities for transformation releases. Comparatives When the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements are amended or accounting policies are changed, comparative figures are restated to ensure consistency with the current period, unless it is impractical to do so. The presentation of some information has changed from the previous period with prior period balances re-classified to be comparable with current year figures. 125 Changes in accounting policies There have been no changes in accounting policies since 30 June 2019. Budget and forecast figures The budget, revised budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP, using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing these financial statements. The budget and forecast figures are not subject to audit. The budget figures for 2019–20 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2020. The revised budget figures for 2019–20 (refer to the Statements of budgeted and actual expenses and capital expenditure incurred against appropriations on page 109) are those included in the Addition to the Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2020. The forecast figures for 2020–21 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2021. The forecast financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989 to communicate forecast financial information for accountability purposes. They are compliant with PBE Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements. Forecast policies The forecasts have been compiled on the basis of existing government policies and ministerial expectations at the time the statements were finalised and reflect all government decisions up to 6 April 2020. While Inland Revenue regularly updates its forecasts, updated forecast financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2021 will not be published. The main assumptions are as follows: • Other than the work to progress the Business Transformation programme, Inland Revenue’s main activities will remain substantially the same as for the previous year. • Operating costs are based on historical information and Inland Revenue’s best estimates of future costs to be incurred for the delivery of our services and the Business Transformation programme. • Estimated year-end information for 2019–20 is used as the opening position for the 2020–21 forecasts. Any changes to budgets during 2020–21 will be incorporated into The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2021. Variations to forecast The actual financial results for the forecast period covered are likely to vary from the information presented in these forecasts. Factors that may lead to a material difference between information in these forecast financial statements and the actual reported results include: • changes due to initiatives approved by Cabinet • technical adjustments to the budget including transfers between financial years • the timing of expenditure relating to significant programmes and projects. 126Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Where our income came from Note 2. Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable. Revenue is recognised as follows: Revenue from the Crown Revenue from the Crown transactions are considered to be non-exchange transactions. Revenue from the Crown is measured based on Inland Revenue’s funding entitlement for the reporting period. The funding entitlement is established by Parliament when it passes the Appropriation Acts for the financial year. The amount of revenue recognised takes into account any amendments to appropriations approved in the Appropriation (Addition to the Supplementary Estimates) Act for the year and certain other unconditional funding adjustments formally approved prior to balance date. Inland Revenue can incur expenses only within the scope and limits of its appropriations. The fair value of revenue from the Crown is considered equivalent to the funding entitlement. Explanation of major variance from budget Revenue from the Crown was higher than budget by $3.847 million. The variance is due to additional funding required to administer policy decisions associated with the Government’s response to COVID-19. Other revenue Other revenue transactions as outlined below are considered to be exchange transactions. Revenue from recoveries Revenue from recoveries is recognised as revenue when earned. Sale of services The sale of services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are provided. Rental revenue from sub-leases Rental revenue from sub-leased property is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The variance is due to the change in the phasing and delivery of the transformation programme, the timing of organisational change required to deliver the programme outcomes and more cost-effective training and development activities delivered in-house and online. The cost of annual leave increased as leave accrued exceeded leave taken. Less leave was taken by staff during the COVID-19 lockdown period and due to subsequent restrictions on overseas travel. 128Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL ActualActualUnaudited Budget 201920202020 $000 $000$000 130,502Contractors108,521117,662 100,643Information technology and telecommunications104,23193,107 36,427Rental35,67642,645 13,375Office expenses12,37911,047 11,012Travel and transport7,39710,934 7,743Consultants7,3309,074 11,610Communications and publicity6,92914,695 6,609Outsourced contracts5,6127,639 4,516Legal expenses3,2066,244 2,294Bank fees2,6382,493 1,178Audit fees for audit of the financial statements1,1661,150 25Disbursements for audit of the financial statements10120 266Net loss on disposal of assets701– 142Debt expected credit losses and write-off4836 116Net realised and unrealised foreign exchange losses–– 2,930Other operating expenses1,7062,177 329,388Total operating 298,076318,893 Explanation of major variances against budget Operating expenses were $20.817 million lower than budget due to the phasing and delivery of the transformation programme, a reduction in expenditure on contractors and a reduction in travel costs due to new technology solutions that enable us to meet and work together virtually and COVID-19 related travel restrictions. Note 4. Operating Operating expenses are recognised as an expense in the period to which they relate. Operating leases A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset. Accommodation lease rentals payable under operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Lease incentives received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognised evenly over the term of the lease as a reduction in the rental expense. 129 Note 5. Contractors and consultants Inland Revenue uses contractors and consultants to provide backfill for vacant positions or cover short-term demand, where specialist skills or independent external advice are needed (such as specialist skills needed for our transformation programme), and in periods of peak demand. A contractor is a person who is not considered an employee, providing backfill or extra capacity in a role that exists within Inland Revenue, or acts as an additional resource for a time-limited piece of work. A consultant is a person or firm who is not considered a contractor or employee, engaged to perform a piece of work with a clearly defined scope and provide expertise, in a particular field, not readily available from within Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue has elected to disclose contractors and consultants information separately in accordance with Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission guidance: The difference between the amounts in the table above, and the contractors and consultants expense in note 4, is because the financial statement definitions vary slightly to the Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission (PSC) definitions. For example, amounts paid to other government agencies are excluded for PSC purposes. Note 6. Capital charge Inland Revenue pays a capital charge to the Crown on taxpayers’ funds as at 30 June and 31 December each year. This is recognised as an expense in the period to which the charge relates. The capital charge rate for the year ended 30 June 2020 was 6.0% (2019: 6.0%).

Return to New Zealand taxpayers Note 7. Taxpayers’ funds Taxpayers’ funds are the Crown’s net investment in Inland Revenue. Taxpayers’ funds are divided and categorised into a number of components: • total comprehensive revenue and expense • repayment of surplus to the Crown • capital injections • capital withdrawals. Capital management Inland Revenue’s capital is its taxpayers’ funds and is represented by net assets. Inland Revenue manages its revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and general financial dealings prudently. Inland Revenue’s taxpayers’ funds are largely managed as a by-product of managing revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and compliance with the Government Budget processes, the Treasury instructions and the Public Finance Act 1989. The objective of managing Inland Revenue’s taxpayers’ funds is to ensure that Inland Revenue effectively achieves its agreed outcomes, and remains a going concern. Note 8. Surplus payable to the Crown The surplus is required to be paid to the Crown by 31 October of each year. 131 Assets used to deliver our services Note 9. Property, plant and equipment Inland Revenue has operational assets that include IT equipment, furniture and office equipment, motor vehicles and leasehold improvements. The capitalisation thresholds are: • IT equipmentOver $2,000 • FurnitureOver $2,000 • Office equipmentOver $2,000 • Motor vehiclesNo threshold • Leasehold improvementsNo threshold Certain items of IT equipment, furniture and office equipment, which are low value and high quantity, such as chairs and IT monitors, are pooled together. All pooled assets are capitalised. Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost is the value of consideration given to acquire or create the asset and includes any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. Additions The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to Inland Revenue beyond one year, and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. In most instances an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised at its cost. Where an asset is acquired through a non-exchange transaction, it is recognised at fair value as at the date of acquisition. Subsequent costs Subsequent costs are capitalised when it is probable that the future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to Inland Revenue beyond one year and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance are expensed. Depreciation Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all property, plant and equipment, other than assets under construction. The rate of depreciation will reduce the value of the asset to the estimated residual value over the useful life of the asset. The useful lives of major classes of assets have been estimated as: • IT equipment3 to 5 years • Furniture3 to 10 years • Office equipment5 to 10 years • Motor vehicles5 years • Leasehold improvements3 to 10 years All property, plant and equipment other than motor vehicles are assumed to have no residual value. Motor vehicles are assumed to have a 20% residual value. The cost of leasehold improvements is capitalised and depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated remaining useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter, up to a maximum of 10 years. Assets under construction are recognised at cost less impairment and are not depreciated. The total cost of a capital project is transferred to the appropriate asset class on its completion and then depreciated. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance date. Disposals Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are recognised on a net basis in the surplus or deficit. 132Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL IT equipmentFurniture and office equipment Motor vehicles Leasehold improvements Assets under construction Total tangible assets 2020$000$000$000$000$000$000 Cost Opening balance as at 1 July 201932,90924,9333,31563,3172,798127,272 Additions by purchase2,9661,106–1,4227626,256 Transfers between category137(102)–2,712(2,668)79 Disposals(4,114)(1,168)(634)(4,292)–(10,208) Closing balance as at 30 June 202031,89824,7692,68163,159892123,399 Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses Opening balance as at 1 July 201923,29719,7152,52642,8132088,371 Depreciation and impairment5,9281,523927,161–14,704 Transfers between category(63)(102)–44–(121) Disposals(4,064)(1,059)(507)(3,939)–(9,569) Closing balance as at 30 June 202025,09820,0772,11146,0792093,385 Carrying amount as at 30 June 20206,8004,692570 17,08087230,014 2019 Cost Opening balance as at 1 July 201837,82722,9053,44058,9242,384125,480 Additions by purchase6,4232,247–4,9872,42016,077 Transfers between category–––2,006(2,006)– Disposals(11,341)(219)(125)(2,600)–(14,285) Closing balance as at 30 June 201932,90924,9333,31563,3172,798127,272 Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses Opening balance as at 1 July 201829,34118,4972,24039,0082089,106 Depreciation expensed5,3141,4343766,315–13,439 Depreciation capitalised¹(46)––(2)–(48) Disposals(11,312)(216)(90)(2,508)–(14,126) Closing balance as at 30 June 201923,29719,7152,52642,8132088,371 Carrying amount as at 30 June 20199,6125,21878920,5042,77838,901 1 Refers to the depreciation expense for existing assets that are used in the development of intangible assets. 133 Impairment Property, plant and equipment that have a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Property, plant and equipment are also reviewed annually for indicators of impairment at each balance date. Assets under construction are tested for impairment at each balance date. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable service amount. The recoverable service amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. Value in use is the present value of the asset’s remaining service potential. Value in use is determined based on either the depreciated replacement cost or the restoration cost, depending on the nature of the impairment and the availability of information. If an asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable service amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable service amount. The impairment loss and any reversal of impairment loss are recognised in the surplus or deficit. There was no impairment of property, plant and equipment associated with the impacts of COVID-19. 10. Intangible assets Inland Revenue has intangible assets in the form of internally generated software and business process design assets and software licences. All intangible assets have finite useful lives. Internally generated intangible assets There are two types of internally generated intangible assets: computer software and processes. The cost of internally developed computer software and processes comprises direct labour, materials purchased and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. These costs are associated with the development of identifiable and unique software controlled by Inland Revenue, which will generate future economic benefits beyond one year. Expenditure on development activities where research findings are applied to a plan or design for new or substantially improved processes is capitalised if the processes are technically and commercially feasible. Any other development costs are expensed. Costs incurred on research of an internally generated intangible asset are expensed. Where the research phase cannot be distinguished from the development phase, the total cost is expensed. Costs associated with maintaining internally generated computer software are expensed. Costs of configuring and customising commercial off- the-shelf software are capitalised. Website development costs are recognised as an intangible asset if it can be demonstrated that the website will generate probable future economic benefits. Subsequent costs associated with the development and maintenance of Inland Revenue’s existing websites are expensed unless they meet the capitalisation requirement of PBE IPSAS 31 Intangible Assets. Staff training costs are expensed. Software licences Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and be able to use the specific software. Costs associated with supporting and maintaining computer software licences are expensed. The capitalisation thresholds for intangible assets are: • Internally generated intangible assetsOver $20,000 • Software licences Over $20,000 Additions Intangible assets are initially recorded at cost and subsequently recorded at historical cost less amortisation and impairment losses. 134Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Amortisation The carrying value of an intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Amortisation begins when the asset is available for use and ceases when the asset no longer has a recognisable value. The amortisation charge is expensed. The useful lives of major classes of intangible assets have been estimated as: • Internally generated intangible assets 3 to 15 years • Software licences 3 to 15 years Assets under construction are recognised at cost less impairment and are not amortised. The total cost of a capital project is transferred to the appropriate asset class on its completion and then amortised. The assets’ useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance date. The gain or loss arising from the disposal of an intangible asset forms part of the surplus or deficit. Impairment Intangible assets that have a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are also reviewed annually for indicators of impairment at each balance date. Assets under construction are tested for impairment at each balance date. There was no impairment of intangible assets associated with the impacts of COVID-19. For further details refer to the policy for impairment of property, plant and equipment in note 9. The same approach applies to the impairment of intangible assets. Estimating the useful lives of intangible assets The useful lives of intangible assets are based on: • management’s view of the expected period over which Inland Revenue will receive benefits • historical experience with similar assets • anticipation of future events, which may impact their useful lives, such as changes in technology. 135 Internally generated intangible assets Software licences Assets under construction —intangibles Total intangible assets 2020$000$000$000$000 Cost Opening balance as at 1 July 2019702,848101,47733,361837,686 Additions by purchase78,34352510,78089,648 Additions internally developed7,909––7,909 Transfers between category(396,684)420,549(24,063)(198) Disposals(20,704)(259,621)–(280,325) Closing balance as at 30 June 2020371,712262,93020,078654,720 Accumulated amortisation and impairment losses Opening balance as at 1 July 2019476,05580,6413,617560,313 Amortisation and impairment32,12620,159–52,285 Transfers between category(383,714)387,331(3,617)– Disposals(20,640)(259,520)–(280,160) Closing balance as at 30 June 2020103,827228,611–332,438 Carrying amount as at 30 June 2020267,885 34,31920,078322,282 2019 Cost Opening balance as at 1 July 2018654,969106,61144,112805,692 Additions by purchase59,40584221,27481,521 Additions internally developed7,316–2,87410,190 Transfers between category34,899–(34,899)– Disposals(53,741)(5,976)–(59,717) Closing balance as at 30 June 2019702,848101,47733,361837,686 Accumulated amortisation and impairment losses Opening balance as at 1 July 2018489,29981,6223,617574,538 Amortisation charge—expensed39,0964,973–44,069 Amortisation charge—capitalised 1 6––6 Impairment losses1,304––1,304 Disposals(53,650)(5,954)–(59,604) Closing balance as at 30 June 2019476,05580,6413,617560,313 Carrying amount as at 30 June 2019226,79320,83629,744277,373 1 Refers to the amortisation expense for existing assets that are used in the development of intangible assets. There is no restriction over the title of Inland Revenue’s intangible assets nor are any intangible assets pledged as security for liabilities. Our intangible assets are mainly related to the START core revenue system and supporting infrastructure. Of the $322.282 million carrying value for intangibles, $297.522 million relates to the development of the START tax and social policy management system and supporting infrastructure assets. The estimated remaining life of the START assets is 12 years. 136Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Explanation of major variances against budget Intangible assets are $48.393 million lower than budget due to the re-phasing of the capital plan for the transformation programme to align with Inland Revenue’s updated delivery approach. Note 11. Debtors and prepayments Accounts receivable and other debtors transactions are considered to be exchange transactions. Debtor Crown transactions are considered to be non-exchange transactions. Allowance for credit losses Debtors and receivables are recorded at their face value, less an allowance for credit losses. Inland Revenue applies the simplified expected credit loss model of recognising lifetime expected credit losses for receivables. In measuring credit losses, receivables have been assessed on a collective basis as they possess shared credit risk characteristics. They have been grouped based on the days past due. Short-term receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include the debtor being in liquidation.

The expected credit loss rates for accounts receivable are based on the payment profile of receivables over the previous periods and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced for that period. The historical loss rates are adjusted for current and forward-looking economic factors, including COVID-19, that might affect the recoverability of receivables. There have been no changes during the reporting period in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions used in measuring the expected credit loss allowance. 137 ActualActual 20192020 $000 $000 4Opening balance as at 1 July125 122Additional provisions made during the year480 (1)Receivables written off during the year(12) 125Closing balance as at 30 June593 20192020 $000 $000 (84)Impact of a 2% increase on the lifetime expected credit loss assumption(154) 84Impact of a 2% decrease on the lifetime expected credit loss assumption154 Movements in the allowance for credit losses are as follows: Expected credit loss rate Gross carrying amount Lifetime expected credit loss 2020$000$000 Not past due–2,507– Past due 1 to 30 days0.06%1,5531 Past due 31 to 60 days0.12%1,6202 Past due 61 to 90 days2.04%982 Past due > 90 days30.5%1,930588 To t a l7.69%7,708593 2019 Not past due0.08%2,5352 Past due 1 to 30 days–72– Past due 31 to 60 days–64– Past due 61 to 90 days–89– Past due > 90 days8.52%1,442123 To t a l2.97%4,202125 The allowance for credit losses at 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019 was determined as follows: Sensitivity analysis The following table shows the effect of changes in the lifetime expected credit loss assumption. 138Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL ActualActualUnaudited Budget 201920202020 $000 $000$000 Creditors and other payables—exchange transactions 11,582Accounts payable649,000 40,810Accrued expenses—other34,52032,600 52,392Total creditors and other payables—exchange transactions34,58441,600 Creditors and other payables—non-exchange transactions 8,031GST payable13,5309,000 8,031Total creditors and other payables—non-exchange transactions13,5309,000 60,423Total creditors and other payables48,11450,600 Creditors and other payables are normally settled on 30-day terms, therefore the carrying value of creditors and other payables approximates their fair value. Explanation of major variances against budget Creditors and other payables were $2.486 million below budget due to early settlement of payables as a result of Government’s request to pay 95% of domestic suppliers within 10 business days, offset by lower GST input due to an underspend in operating expenses (refer to note 4). Liabilities incurred by Inland Revenue Note 12. Creditors and other payables Creditors and other payables due within 12 months are recognised at their nominal value, unless the effect of discounting is material. Creditors and other payables due beyond 12 months are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, where applicable. Note 13. Employee entitlements Current entitlements Employee entitlements that Inland Revenue expects to be settled within 12 months of balance date are measured at nominal value based on accrued entitlements at current rates of pay. These include salaries and wages accrued up to balance date, annual leave and time off in lieu earned up to but not yet taken at balance date, and retiring and long-service leave entitlements expected to be settled within 12 months. Inland Revenue recognises a liability for sick leave to the extent that absences in the coming year are expected to be greater than the sick leave entitlements earned in the coming year. The amount is calculated based on the unused sick leave entitlement that can be carried forward at balance date, to the extent that Inland Revenue anticipates it will be used by staff to cover those future absences. Inland Revenue recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where it is contractually obliged to pay them or where a past practice has created a constructive obligation and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Non-current entitlements Employee entitlements that are payable beyond 12 months, such as long-service leave and retiring leave, have been calculated on an actuarial basis. Other provisions include an allowance to meet requirements of the Holidays Act 2003 and other operational employee matters. 139 ActualActualUnaudited Budget 201920202020 $000 $000$000 Current liabilities—exchange transactions 28,066Annual leave31,62026,873 8,774Accrued salaries and wages11,06910,000 2,487Termination benefits12,0702,000 3,830Retiring leave4,5103,000 2,571Other provision4,2922,500 1,440Long-service leave1,4401,400 1,539Sick leave1,3001,300 2Time off in lieu63 48,709Total current liabilities—exchange transactions66,30747,076 Non-current liabilities—exchange transactions 22,530Retiring leave23,38033,000 6,570Long-service leave6,5008,387 1,584Other provision–– 30,684Total non-current liabilities—exchange transactions29,88041,387 79,393Total employee entitlements96,18788,463 Explanation of major variances against budget Provisions for employee entitlements were $7.724 million higher than budget mainly due to less leave taken by staff during the COVID-19 lockdown period, and deferred restructuring costs from the transformation programme, offset by macroeconomic changes to valuation assumptions for retirement leave and long-service leave. Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when an employee’s employment contract is terminated before their normal retirement or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Inland Revenue recognises the expense when it is demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees, according to a detailed formal plan without the possibility of withdrawal, or as a result of an offer for voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits to be settled within 12 months are reported at the amount expected to be paid. Otherwise they are reported as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows, where applicable. 140Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Termination benefits Other employee entitlements Total $000$000$000 Opening balance as at 1 July 20192,4874,1556,642 Additional provisions made12,97413713,111 Amounts used(3,212)–(3,212) Unused amounts reversed(179)–(179) Closing balance as at 30 June 202012,0704,29216,362 Opening balance as at 1 July 20184,1783,4427,620 Additional provisions made8537131,566 Amounts used(2,443)–(2,443) Unused amounts reversed(101)–(101) Closing balance as at 30 June 20192,4874,1556,642 Measuring retiring and long-service leave liabilities The actuarial calculations for long-service leave and retiring leave liabilities are based on: • employee contractual entitlements • years of service accrued to balance date and years remaining to entitlement • the present value of the estimated future cash outflows using an applicable discount rate and salary inflation rate. Sick leave, annual leave and vested long-service leave are classified as a current liability. Non-vested long-service leave and retiring leave liabilities expected to be settled within 12 months of balance date are also classified as a current liability. All other long-service leave and retiring leave is classified as a non-current liability. The present value of retiring and long-service leave obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis by an independent actuary. Key assumptions used in calculating liabilities are the discount rate and salary inflation. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of the liabilities. The discount rates used by the independent actuary for the retiring and long-service leave valuations are based on the Treasury published forward rates at 30 June 2020. The forward rates are derived from New Zealand government bonds. The long-term salary inflation assumption is based on the Treasury published rates at 30 June 2020 and after obtaining advice from the independent actuary. The long-term salary inflation assumption used was 2.19% (2019: 2.34%). COVID-19 impacts are reflected in the assumptions for discount rates and salary inflation. The net effect of these assumptions has resulted in an increase to the liability. The following section provides a sensitivity analysis of these assumptions. Movements in the provisions for termination benefits and other employee entitlements are as follows: 141 ActualDiscount rate change Salary inflation change Withdrawal rate change $000$000$000$000$000$000$000 – 1.0%+ 1.0%– 1.0%+ 1.0%– 1.0%+ 1.0% 2020 Long-service leave6,500409(364)(153)4061,670(1,290) Retiring leave23,3801,780(1,590)(38)1,7807,290(4,990) ActualDiscount rate change Salary inflation change Withdrawal rate change $000$000$000$000$000$000$000 – 1.0%+ 1.0%– 1.0%+ 1.0%– 1.0%+ 1.0% 2019 Long-service leave6,570426(379)(162)4261,680(1,290) Retiring leave22,5301,780(1,590)(51)1,8006,9804,800 Note 14. Other liabilities Provision for other liabilities Inland Revenue recognises a provision for future payments of uncertain amounts or timing where there is a present obligation (either legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that a payment will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are not recognised for net deficits from future operating activities. Provisions are recorded at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions to be settled beyond 12 months are recorded at their present value and are discounted using market yields on government bonds at balance date with terms to maturity that match, as closely as possible, the estimated timing of the future cash flows, where applicable. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense and is included in finance expense.

Each factor is considered separately as if all other factors remained constant. 142Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities with durations of less than 12 months are recognised at their nominal value, unless the effect of discounting is material. Other financial liabilities greater than 12 months are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, where applicable. Other financial liabilities relate to unexpired lease incentives with a carrying amount of $0.491 million at 30 June 2020 (2019: $0.701 million). Refer to note 4 for the accounting policy on lease incentives. Other disclosures Note 15. Related party transactions and key management personnel Inland Revenue is a wholly owned entity of the Crown. The government significantly influences the role of Inland Revenue, as well as being its major source of revenue. Related party disclosures have not been made for transactions with related parties that are within a normal supplier or client/recipient relationship on terms and conditions no more or less favourable than those where it is reasonable to expect that Inland Revenue would have adopted in dealing with the party at arm’s length in the same circumstances. Further, transactions with other government agencies (for example, government departments and Crown entities) are not disclosed as related party transactions when they are consistent with the normal operating arrangements between government agencies and undertaken on the normal terms and conditions for such transactions. Inland Revenue has no related party transactions that are required to be disclosed in 2020 (2019: nil). Remuneration to key management personnel The remuneration of key management personnel during the year was as follows: RemunerationRemunerationFull-time EquivalentsFull-time Equivalents 2020201920202019 $000$000 Leadership team, including 5,155 the Commissioner (Chief Executive)4,74211.811.0 The key management personnel remuneration disclosure includes the Chief Executive (Commissioner), seven Deputy Commissioners, Chief Tax Counsel, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief People Officer and those formally acting in those positions during the financial year. The Commissioner’s remuneration is determined and paid by Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission. The remuneration disclosure excludes the Minister of Revenue. The Minister’s remuneration and other benefits are set out by the Remuneration Authority, are not received only for their role as a member of key management personnel of Inland Revenue and are not paid by Inland Revenue. 143 Note 16. Financial instruments—categories of financial instruments The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities in each of the financial instrument categories are as follows: ActualActual 20192020 $000 $000 Financial assets measured at amortised cost 66,984Cash and cash equivalents62,962 136,476Debtor Crown220,107 4,742Net debtors7,651 208,202Total financial assets measured at amortised cost290,720 Financial assets measured at fair value through surplus or deficit 5Derivative financial instrument assets11 5Total financial assets measured at fair value through surplus or deficit11 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 52,392Creditors and other payables34,584 701Other financial liabilities491 53,093Total financial liabilities measured at amortised cost35,075 Financial liabilities measured at fair value through surplus or deficit 1,497Derivative financial instrument liabilities– 1,497Total financial liabilities measured at fair value through surplus or deficit– Note 17. Derivative financial instruments For certain foreign currency transactions, Inland Revenue uses derivative financial instruments (foreign currency forward exchange contracts) to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are entered into with the New Zealand Debt Management Office (NZDMO). The use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is governed by Inland Revenue’s foreign exchange policy, which provides principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with Inland Revenue’s risk management strategy. Inland Revenue does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. It has not adopted hedge accounting. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently restated at fair value at each balance date. They are reported as either assets or liabilities, depending on whether the derivative is in a net gain or net loss position, respectively. Movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the financial result. Derivative financial instruments are classified as current if the contract is due for settlement within 12 months of balance date. Otherwise the full fair value is classified as non-current. The net fair value of derivative financial instruments is an asset of $0.011 million as at 30 June 2020 (2019: liability of $1.492 million). The notional principal amount of outstanding forward exchange contract derivatives as at 30 June 2020 was NZ $2.048 million (2019: NZ $23.819 million). The contracts consisted of the purchase of US $0.961 million and AU $0.526 million (2019: US $14.979 million). The unrealised gain on the forward exchange contract derivatives was NZ $1.502 million at 30 June 2020 (2019: unrealised gain of $1.166 million). The majority of the forward exchange contracts relate to future expenditure requirements for the Business Transformation programme. 144Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS > DEPARTMENTAL Note 18. Financial instruments—fair value hierarchy disclosures For those instruments recognised at fair value in the Statement of financial position, fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy: • quoted market price (level 1)—financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets • valuation technique using observable inputs (level 2)—financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable • valuation techniques with significant non-observable inputs (level 3)—financial instruments valued using models where one or more significant inputs is not observable. The following table analyses the basis of the valuation of classes of financial instruments measured at fair value. The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been determined using discounted cash flows based on quoted market prices. ActualActual 2019Valuation technique2020 $000Level 2—observable inputs $000 Financial assets/(liabilities) (1,492)Forward foreign exchange contracts (net)11 Note 19. Financial instruments—financial instrument risks Inland Revenue’s activities expose it to a variety of financial instrument risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Inland Revenue has policies to manage the risks associated with financial instruments and seeks to minimise exposure from financial instruments. These policies do not allow Inland Revenue to enter into any transactions that are speculative in nature. Market risk Currency risk The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is called currency risk. Inland Revenue purchases fixed assets and services from overseas suppliers and it is therefore exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily for United States and Australian dollars. Under its foreign exchange policy, Inland Revenue enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures when single foreign exchange transactions exceed NZ $100,000 or the transaction exposure for an individual currency exceeds NZ $100,000. This policy has been approved by the Treasury and is in line with the requirements of the Treasury’s Guidelines for the Management of Crown and Departmental Foreign-Exchange Exposure. Sensitivity analysis Assuming that all other variables remained constant, the impact on the surplus of a 5% increase/decrease in the New Zealand dollar against various other currencies held by Inland Revenue in its foreign currency account at 30 June 2020 would be a $0.738 million decrease and a $0.668 million increase respectively. 145 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate, or the cash flows from a financial instrument will fluctuate, due to changes in market interest rates. Inland Revenue has no interest-bearing financial instruments, so it has no exposure to interest rate risk. Credit risk The risk that a third party will default on its obligations to Inland Revenue, causing a loss to be incurred is called credit risk. In the normal course of its business, credit risk from receivables is concentrated with the Crown and other government agencies but not with any individual agencies. The carrying amount of financial assets recognised in the Statement of financial position best represents Inland Revenue’s maximum exposure to credit risk at balance date. Inland Revenue does not require any collateral, security or other credit enhancements to support financial instruments with financial institutions that it deals with, because these entities have high credit ratings. Westpac is Inland Revenue’s main bank and has a Standard and Poor’s credit rating of AA–. Inland Revenue enters into foreign currency transactions with the New Zealand Debt Management Office (Standard and Poor’s credit rating of AA). For its other financial instruments, Inland Revenue does not have significant concentrations of credit risk. The carrying amount of financial assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated is not material. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Inland Revenue will encounter difficulty raising liquid funds to meet commitments as they fall due. As all but an insignificant proportion of funds come from the New Zealand Government and cash is drawn down on a fortnightly basis, Inland Revenue does not have significant liquidity risk. In meeting its liquidity requirements, Inland Revenue closely monitors its forecast cash requirements with expected cash drawdowns from the New Zealand Debt Management Office. Inland Revenue maintains a target level of available cash to meet liquidity requirements.

The Commissioner is accountable for the financial management of these activities. In 2019–20, we collected $78.2 billion of revenue on behalf of New Zealand to fund government programmes. We paid $6.9 billion in non-departmental expenses including Working for Families Tax Credits, KiwiSaver member tax credits, interest and other expenses. What non-departmental schedules are and are not The non-departmental schedules are prepared in accordance with relevant accounting policies and Treasury instructions to disclose non-departmental activities. The non-departmental schedules do not, and are not intended to, constitute a set of financial statements and, therefore, do not include elements that would normally be expected to be found in financial statements, such as details of a surplus or deficit, or a balance sheet. For a full understanding of the Crown’s financial position and the results of its operation and cash flows, refer to the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2020. 149 Contents 150Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL Schedule of non-departmental revenue For the year ended 30 June 2020 ActualNoteActualUnaudited Budget Unaudited Forecast 2019202020202021 $000 3$000$000$000 Direct taxation Income tax Individuals 32,022,657Source deductions (PAYE)34,073,38233,766,00033,977,000 7,663,149Other persons7,190,6647,149,0006,694,000 (2,428,720)Refunds(1,887,138)(1,937,000)(1,859,000) 585,498Fringe benefit tax 593,333585,000555,000 37,842,584Total individuals 39,970,24139,563,00039,367,000 Corporate tax 16,067,492Gross companies tax12,767,29515,538,00010,974,000 (343,017)Refunds(424,365)(218,000)(283,000) 650,367Non-resident withholding tax570,325648,000431,000 (252)Foreign-source dividend withholding payments ––– 16,374,590Total corporate tax 12,913,25515,968,00011,122,000 Other direct income tax 1,659,239Resident withholding tax on interest income1,528,8441,675,0001,016,000 838,149Resident withholding tax on dividend income827,581796,000596,000 1,351,203Employer superannuation contribution tax 1,406,4591,430,0001,363,000 3,848,591Total other direct income tax 3,762,8843,901,0002,975,000 58,065,765Total direct taxation 56,646,38059,432,00053,464,000 151 Schedule of non-departmental revenue (continued) For the year ended 30 June 2020 ActualNoteActualUnaudited Budget Unaudited Forecast 2019202020202021 $000 3$000$000$000 Indirect taxation Goods and services tax 33,397,969Gross goods and services tax34,742,58035,256,00031,241,000 (14,004,865)Refunds(14,111,693)(14,334,000)(12,925,000) 19,393,104Total goods and services tax 20,630,88720,922,00018,316,000 Other indirect taxation 105,097Approved issuer levy100,923101,000108,000 313,579Gaming duties276,214307,000296,000 2,108Other indirect taxation 2,0805,0002,000 420,784Total other indirect taxation 379,217413,000406,000 19,813,888Total indirect taxation 21,010,10421,335,00018,722,000 77,879,653Total taxation 77,656,48480,767,00072,186,000 Other revenue 179,337Child support196,567180,000199,000 393,900Interest unwind—student loans330,993415,000353,000 45,390Other revenue 56,97144,50049,800 618,627Total other revenue 584,531639,500601,800 78,498,280Total revenue excluding gains 78,241,01581,406,50072,787,800 The accompanying accounting policies and notes form part of these financial schedules.

Basis of preparation Reporting entity Inland Revenue is a government department as defined by section 2 of the Public Finance Act 1989 and is domiciled and operates in New Zealand. The relevant legislation governing Inland Revenue’s operations is the Public Finance Act 1989. Inland Revenue is a wholly owned entity of the Crown whose primary objective is to provide services to the public rather than to make a financial return. Accordingly, Inland Revenue has designated itself as a Public Benefit Entity (PBE) for financial reporting purposes. These non-departmental financial schedules present financial information on funds managed by Inland Revenue on behalf of the Crown. These non-departmental balances are consolidated into the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2020. For a full understanding of the Crown’s financial position and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year, refer to the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2020. Reporting period The reporting period for these financial schedules is for the year ended 30 June 2020. The forecast financial schedules are for the year ending 30 June 2021. The Chief Executive and Commissioner of Inland Revenue authorised these financial schedules on 30 November 2020. Statement of compliance The financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989, which includes the requirement to comply with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice (NZ GAAP), and the Treasury instructions. Inland Revenue has applied the Tier 1 Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PBE IPSAS) in preparing the 30 June 2020 financial schedules. Basis of preparation The financial schedules have been prepared on a going concern basis, and the accounting policies set out below and in the notes to the financial schedules have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial schedules. These financial schedules have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless otherwise stated. The accrual basis of accounting has been used. Functional and presentation currency These financial schedules are presented in New Zealand dollars, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000). The functional currency of Inland Revenue is New Zealand dollars. Accounting standard issued and not yet effective The standard issued but not yet effective, that has not been adopted early is: PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments The External Reporting Board issued PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments in March 2019. This standard supersedes PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which was issued as an interim standard. It is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Inland Revenue does not intend to adopt PBE IPSAS 41 early. When this standard is adopted, Inland Revenue does not expect any significant changes as the requirements are similar to PBE IFRS 9. How we have prepared these schedules 161 Estimations and judgements In preparing these financial schedules, judgements, estimates and assumptions have been made concerning the future. These judgements, estimates and their associated assumptions may differ from the subsequent actual results. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and other factors. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to revenue, and the carrying amounts of receivables and payables within the next financial year, are referred to in the notes. The impact of COVID-19 on estimates and assumptions is also discussed in these notes. Note 2 sets out how we considered the impacts of COVID-19 on the non-departmental financial schedules. Changes in estimations Income tax—companies and other persons We have updated the revenue recognition methodology to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on income tax for companies and other persons. This is required because income tax is an annual tax and the impact of COVID-19 will not be known until taxpayers file their annual terminal tax assessments in the future. The change applies to the taxpayers subject to the provisional tax regime who have not yet filed a terminal tax assessment for the 2020 and 2021 income tax years. The change in estimation has reduced tax revenue by $526 million, made up of $356 million for companies and $170 million for other persons. Further information on the change in methodology for estimating income tax is disclosed in notes 2 and 3. Accounting policies Significant accounting policies are included in the notes to which they relate. Significant accounting policies that do not relate to a specific note and which materially affect the measurement of financial results and the financial position are outlined below. Expenses Expenses are recognised in the period to which they relate. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in transit and funds held in bank accounts administered by Inland Revenue. All cash held in bank accounts is held in on demand accounts and no interest is payable to Inland Revenue. Comparatives When presentation or classification of items in the financial schedules is amended or accounting policies are changed, comparative figures are restated to ensure consistency with the current period, unless it is impracticable to do so. Change in accounting policies There have been no changes in accounting policies since the date of the last audited financial schedules. The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year. 162Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL Budget and forecast figures The budget, revised budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing these financial schedules. The budget and forecast financial schedules are not subject to audit. The budget figures for 2019–20 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2020. The revised budget figures for 2019–20 (refer to the Statement of non-departmental budgeted and actual expenditure incurred against appropriations on page 111) are those included in the Addition to the Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2020. The forecast figures for 2020–21 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2021. After the Estimates went to print, the tax forecasts were updated to take account of late-breaking Government decisions, particularly in relation to COVID-19 pandemic relief measures. The forecast financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989 to communicate forecast financial information for accountability purposes. They are compliant with PBE Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements. Forecast policies The forecasts have been compiled on the basis of existing government policies and ministerial expectations at the time the schedules were finalised and reflect all Government decisions up to 17 April 2020. While Inland Revenue regularly updates forecasts, updated forecast schedules for the year ending 30 June 2021 will not be published. The key assumptions in the preparation of the forecasts include the following: • Estimates for COVID-19 economic impacts and the Government’s COVID-19 economic response packages including: • a temporary loss carry-back rule to allow refunds of prior year tax paid by businesses that have or will incur tax losses in either the 2020 or 2021 income tax years • a same or similar business test for the carry forward of tax losses with effect from the 2021 income tax year • temporary powers to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to modify tax obligations impacted by COVID-19 • the reinstatement of a 2% diminishing value depreciation rate for commercial and industrial buildings • increasing the threshold for provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000 for the 2020–21 and later income tax years • increasing the low value asset write-off threshold to $5,000 for the 2020–21 income tax year • removal of the hours-test from the In-Work Tax Credit from 1 July 2020. • Tax revenue: tax policy changes enacted and announced by the Government will take place as planned and will affect tax revenue and receipts as calculated and agreed between Inland Revenue and the Treasury. • Student loans: the fair value of student loans is based on a valuation model adapted to reflect current student loans policy. As such, the fair value over the forecast period is sensitive to changes in a number of underlying assumptions, including future income levels, repayment behaviour and macroeconomic factors, such as wages inflation and discount rates. Any change in these assumptions would affect the present fiscal forecast. • Estimated year-end information for 2019–20 is used as the opening position for the 2020–21 forecasts. A significant assumption not included in the forecasts for 2020–21 and outyears is the introduction of the Government’s Small Business Cashflow Scheme. Details of the scheme are disclosed in note 6. For other key fiscal forecast assumptions, refer to the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2020 (https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/efu/budget- economic-and-fiscal-update-2020-html) 1 . Any changes to budgets during 2020–21 will be incorporated into The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the year ending 30 June 2021. 1 This link leads to information not covered by the audit opinion on page 184. 163 Variations to forecast The actual financial results for the forecast period covered are likely to vary from the information presented in these forecasts. Factors that may lead to a material difference between information in these forecast financial schedules and the actual reported results include: • changes due to initiatives or legislation approved by Cabinet • macroeconomic changes, including the expected impacts of COVID-19, impacting revenue, expenditure and debt levels • the timing of customers’ filing of returns and related payments • the timing of customer refund and credit claims • the outcome of disputes, including litigation. 164Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL How we have considered the impacts of COVID-19 Note 2. Considerations and adjustments for the impacts of COVID-19 On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation declared a global pandemic as a result of the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, which has impacted the global economy and created uncertainty in global markets and valuations. To respond to the impact of COVID-19, the New Zealand Government has taken a number of actions to support the wellbeing of New Zealanders and the New Zealand economy, including the introduction of a Small Business Cashflow Scheme to be administered by Inland Revenue. These actions have affected the New Zealand economy and these financial schedules. A summary of the key impacts on the non-departmental financial schedules is set out below. Tax revenue Tax revenue represents revenue for the 2019–20 financial year based on the revenue recognition methodology disclosed in note 3. While most revenue is recognised in cash in the same financial year, these financial schedules include tax estimates and assessments that are not due to be paid until after 30 June 2020. The amount owing is reported in receivables (refer to note 4). Estimation of tax revenue affects mainly income tax for companies and other persons. Accruing income tax revenue requires a significantly higher degree of estimation compared to tax revenue from GST and source deductions (e.g. PAYE). While most taxpayers pay annual income tax in instalments using the provisional tax regime, final income tax owed, or tax refunds due, for a year is only known with reasonable certainty when the taxpayer files a terminal tax assessment for that period. For GST and source deductions, estimations are relatively certain because taxpayer filing dates are so regular and frequent. The impact of COVID-19 on economic activity through alert levels and border restrictions has had flow on impacts to tax revenue in 2019–20 compared to what was expected prior to COVID-19. Taxation revenue was $77.656 billion in 2019–20, a decrease of $223 million (0.3%) compared to 2018–19. Taxation revenue was $3.11 billion lower than the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2019 budget. Most tax is paid on a payday or monthly basis. Therefore, the impacts of COVID-19 are recognised at the time of filing, with no need to change our revenue recognition policies. The exception is income tax for companies and other persons, where tax returns are filed in the future. Tax revenue—income tax for companies and other persons COVID-19 is expected to impact taxable income earned by companies and other persons for the 2019–20 financial year. Accordingly, we have updated our income tax estimation methodology for the 2020 and 2021 income tax years. This is required because income tax is an annual tax and the impact of COVID-19 will not be known until taxpayers file their annual terminal tax assessments in the future. Where customers subject to the provisional tax regime have not filed a terminal tax assessment for the period, provisional tax assessments are recognised based on the provisional tax method adopted by the taxpayer. These provisional tax assessments are based on 105% of the prior year terminal tax. This method suits a large number of taxpayers who generally expect to make more or roughly the same amount of profit in the coming tax year. However, given the large and sudden reduction in economic activity with COVID-19, particularly with New Zealand entering the Alert Level Four lockdown on 25 March 2020, the 105% assumption is now not considered appropriate for the estimation of income tax revenue for the financial year ended 30 June 2020. Therefore, estimated income tax revenue has been based on the Treasury’s most recent macroeconomic forecasts, using the percentage movement in forecasts of firms’ net operating surplus. As the estimation of income tax revenue is based on macroeconomic forecasts about how the New Zealand economy will perform in the future and how it relates to taxable income, it is an uncertain assumption, particularly in the current environment as a result of COVID-19. This is because macroeconomic forecasts by nature are inherently uncertain. Firms' net operating surplus is a measure of business profits that is published by Stats New Zealand (www.stats.govt.nz). The Treasury produces forecasts of future years’ net operating surplus in its economic and fiscal updates. As a result, the factor applied to the prior year’s terminal tax is 102.79% for the 2020 income tax year, which ended on 31 March 2020 and 97.26% for the 2021 income tax year which ends on 31 March 2021, with the period from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 included in these financial schedules rather than the standard factor of 105%. In the 2021 income tax year, the ‘uplift’ factor applied means there is actually a reduction in tax revenue estimates based on the prior year's tax assessments. While we believe the Treasury’s most recent macroeconomic forecast percentage change in firms' net operating surplus is the most appropriate assumption to determine taxable income in our tax estimation process, there are other possible macroeconomic assumptions that could have been used as inputs, including the forecast percentage change in nominal GDP or forecast percentage change in real GDP. The main reason that the percentage change in the net operating surplus measure was chosen, rather than the percentage change in GDP, is that the net operating surplus has a higher correlation with taxable profits of businesses than either nominal or real GDP. The firms’ net operating surplus is a component of Income 165 GDP and is designed to measure net profits of businesses. This measure is approximately equal to accounting profit before taxes, dividends, and interest, but after depreciation. Applying the forecast for firms’ net operating surplus results in a downward adjustment of $526 million to tax revenue, comprised of $356 million gross companies tax revenue and $170 million other persons revenue. The updated revenue recognition methodology for income tax is disclosed in note 3. The significant assumptions and sensitivities behind the estimation of income tax revenue for companies and other persons are: 2020 Assumptions Forecast firms’ net operating surplus—2020 income tax year2.79% Forecast firms’ net operating surplus—2021 income tax year(2.74%) Sensitivities Impact on revenue of a 1% increase in firms' net operating surplus ($000)185,000 Impact on revenue of a 5% increase in firms' net operating surplus ($000)924,000 Impact on revenue of a 10% increase in firms' net operating surplus ($000)1,848,000 Impact on revenue of a 1% decrease in firms' net operating surplus ($000)(185,000) Impact on revenue of a 5% decrease in firms' net operating surplus ($000)(924,000) Impact on revenue of a 10% decrease in firms' net operating surplus ($000)(1,848,000) There will always be a degree of uncertainty in respect of the estimate of income tax revenue, whether the standard 5% uplift assumption is applied or an alternate approach, but there is elevated uncertainty in the estimation this year due to the impact of COVID-19. However, applying a new assumption this year, based on the forecast of firms’ net operating surplus, is considered necessary and appropriate to reflect the current economic circumstances. Tax receivables The gross value of tax receivables at 30 June 2020 is $16.897 billion, an increase of $576 million (3.5%). The main driver of the increase is a $726 million (21%) increase in past due debt. During 2019–20, Inland Revenue made prioritisation decisions to redeploy staff from debt collection to other functions to manage the large and complex requirements to successfully deliver Release 4 of our transformation and support our customers as they continue to familiarise themselves with our new systems and processes. This prioritisation and the impacts of COVID-19 for our customers resulted in increased levels of debt and reduced debt repayments. Note 4 provides more information on the gross value and fair value of tax receivables, and the significant assumptions and sensitivities behind the fair value. Small Business Cashflow Scheme In response to COVID-19, the Government has made Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans available to eligible small-to-medium businesses. As at 30 June 2020, a total of $1.428 billion was disbursed in loans and $5 million has been repaid. The fair value of these loans at 30 June 2020 is $738 million. The most critical assumption for determining the fair value is the default rate of the loans, which informs the initial fair value write-down of the loans. The initial fair value write-down on the loans of $685 million is due to these unsecured loans being made to businesses severely impacted by COVID-19 at below market rates and with other favourable terms. Note 6 provides more information on the Small Business Cashflow Scheme, the valuation model and the significant assumptions and sensitivities behind the fair value. 166Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL How we have recognised revenue Note 3. Revenue Tax revenue is a non-exchange transaction. This means the payment of tax in itself does not entitle a customer to an equivalent value of services or benefits, because there is no direct relationship between paying tax and receiving Crown services and benefits. Tax revenue is recognised when a taxable event has occurred, the tax revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Crown. Tax is recognised at face value as the fair value is not materially different from the face value. The New Zealand tax system is based on self-assessment where customers are expected to understand the tax laws and comply with them. Inland Revenue helps customers comply and addresses non-compliant activities. Most people pay their fair share of tax. For the minority who do not, Inland Revenue intervenes and encourages them to do the right thing. However, such procedures cannot be expected to identify all sources of unreported income or other cases of non-compliance with tax laws. Inland Revenue is unable to reliably estimate the amount of unreported tax. Income tax Income tax is recognised on an accrual basis in the period the taxable event occurs. It is deemed to accrue evenly over the period to which it relates. Where income tax returns have not been filed for the relevant period, accrued income tax revenue receivable or payable has been estimated based on current provisional assessments or prior year provisional or terminal assessments. Tax revenue is recognised proportionally based on Student loans The fair value of the student loan scheme at 30 June 2020 is $10.395 billion, a net decrease of $336 million (3.1%). The net decrease includes repayments, new borrowings, the fair value write-down in new borrowing, interest unwind and fair value remeasurements. FAIR VALUE OF THE STUDENT LOAN SCHEME $000June 2020 Fair value at 30 June 2019 10,730,696 Repayments (1,477,268) Borrowings transferred from the Ministry of Social Development 1,412,774 Fair value write-down on new borrowings (506,118) Interest unwind 330,993 Other 507 Fair value before remeasurements 10,491,584 Fair value remeasurements (97,000) Total debt 10,394,584 The fair value remeasurement decrease of $97 million includes: • an increase in the fair value of $31 million for updates to the model using data to 31 March 2020 • a decrease in the fair value of $507 million to reflect the forecast impacts of COVID-19, including expected border restrictions, fewer expected overseas repayments and a reduction in the number of borrowers in substantive employment • an increase to the fair value of $343 million due to forecast lower risk-free interest rates partially offset by an increase to the risk premium • a repayment collection allowance of $36 million. Note 7 provides more information on the student loan scheme, the valuation model and the significant assumptions and sensitivities behind the fair value. 167 the balance date of the taxpayer. The amount of income tax receivable or refundable is not known with certainty until income tax returns for the period have been filed. This is usually some time after the publication of the Annual Report. The measurement of income tax accruals requires significant estimates, judgements and assumptions and has a number of uncertainties. These include the following: • Where taxpayers have chosen to estimate their provisional tax, income tax revenue is recognised based on the most recent estimate provided to Inland Revenue. • Where customers subject to the provisional tax regime have not yet filed a terminal tax assessment: • for the 2020 and 2021 income tax years, provisional tax assessments are recognised as revenue based on the prior year terminal tax adjusted for the Treasury’s firms’ net operating surplus for that year as at 13 July 2020 (refer to note 2). • for all other income tax years, provisional tax assessments are recognised as revenue based on the provisional tax method adopted by the taxpayer. Provisional assessments are based on 105% of the prior year terminal tax. • Where the taxpayers have made payments for more than the provisional tax assessment submitted, their credit balance is also accrued as revenue. • Where taxpayers have made payments to Inland Revenue but have not submitted a provisional tax assessment for the period, an estimate is made based on the payments. • For taxpayers not subject to provisional tax, an estimate is made of the tax revenues receivable and refundable at year end based on prior year terminal assessments. • For taxpayers subject to provisional tax who have not filed their tax return for the previous period, an estimate is made of the tax revenues receivable and refundable at year end based on prior year provisional tax assessments. Goods and services tax (GST) GST returns are assessed on a one, two, three or six-monthly basis and are due the month after the end of the period. At year end, Inland Revenue estimates the amount of GST outstanding as follows: • for customers who file a return of GST for the June period, the actual amounts filed are used • for customers who have not filed a return, the estimate is based on the most recently assessed GST return. Source deductions (PAYE) Employers are required to file an employment information form on each payday. Revenue is assessed based on these forms. June employment information forms filed by employers in July are accrued at year end. Child support Child support revenue is the penalties levied on child support debts owed to both custodial persons and the Crown by parents who pay child support, as well as child support due to the Crown. This revenue is recognised initially at fair value and subsequently tested for impairment at year end. Interest unwind—student loans Student loans are initially discounted to fair value. This predominantly reflects the time value of money. As time moves on, student loans become closer to being repaid and are therefore worth more. This increase in value is recognised as interest unwind. The interest unwind has been calculated using the official cash rate plus a risk premium calculated by the consulting actuaries. Fair value remeasurement—student loans Fair value remeasurement is the change in the value in the student loan portfolio over the year. Student loans are initially measured at fair value. The changes to fair value between periods are recognised as a gain or loss in the net surplus or deficit. More information is provided in note 7. 168Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL Crown assets we are managing Note 4. Receivables Receivables include general taxes, Working for Families Tax Credits, KiwiSaver and any penalties and interest associated with these activities. These are non-contractual sovereign receivables. The interest and penalties charged on receivables are presented as revenue in the Schedule of non-departmental revenue. Receivables for child support, the Small Business Cashflow Scheme and student loans are reported separately in notes 5, 6 and 7 respectively. Receivables are initially recognised at face value as the fair value is not materially different from the face value and are subsequently tested for impairment at year end. Allowances for amounts Inland Revenue does not expect to recover are recognised when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Impairments are included in the Schedule of non-departmental expenditure. Impairment losses can be reversed where there is evidence that the impaired value of the asset has increased. At the end of the year, receivables are valued by an independent external valuer using predictive models. Inland Revenue provides data to the valuer on receivable balances and repayments. The data is up to 30 June 2020. To calculate the impairment of receivables, assumptions are applied to future repayment behaviour, as well as economic factors such as discount rates. Key assumptions are explained below: • The recoverable amount of receivables is calculated by forecasting the expected repayments based on analysis of historical debt data, deducting an estimate of collection costs and then discounting using an appropriate rate. If the recoverable amount of the portfolio is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. Alternatively, if the recoverable amount is more, the carrying amount is increased. • Tax pooling funds held in Crown bank accounts have been netted off against receivables. These funds have been deposited by commercial intermediaries and allow customers to pool tax payments to reduce their exposure to use-of-money interest. Underpayments and overpayments are offset within the same pool. The gross value of tax receivables at 30 June 2020 is $16.897 billion, an increase of $576 million (3.5%). The main driver of the increase is a $726 million (21%) increase in past due debt. Inland Revenue’s approach is to prevent customers getting into debt and having penalties and interest added to what they owe. In response to COVID-19, we increased our support to ensure customers knew what help and options were available to them. We also deferred debt activities where that would be the best outcome for the customer. During 2019–20, Inland Revenue made prioritisation decisions to redeploy staff from debt collection to other functions to manage the large and complex requirements to successfully deliver Release 4 of our transformation and support our customers as they continue to familiarise themselves with our new systems and processes. This prioritisation and the impacts of COVID-19 for our customers resulted in increased levels of debt and reduced debt repayments up to 30 June 2020. This has resulted in an increase in debt impairment, reflecting decreased expected recoverability. As noted by the valuer, it is not possible to assess with any certainty the implications of COVID-19 on the value of tax receivables or the economy as a whole, in terms of length or the degree of impact. The uncertain and volatile nature of future debt repayments means that there is significant uncertainty in the estimated value of receivables. The valuation reflects the increased levels of debt and reduced debt repayments observed in the data up to 30 June 2020. Future repayments of debt will be dependent on the economic impacts of COVID-19 on our customers and the effectiveness of our compliance activities and relief mechanisms, such as instalment arrangements.

Due dates will vary, depending on the type of revenue owing (for example, income tax, GST, KiwiSaver) and the customer’s balance date. Past due debt includes debts collected under instalment, debts under dispute, default assessments and debts of customers who are bankrupt, in receivership or in liquidation. Inland Revenue has debt management policies and procedures in place to actively manage the collection of past due debt. The fair value of tax receivables at 30 June 2020 is $13.642 billion, a decrease of $369 million (2.6%). This reduction reflects a lower level of repayment of older debt as a result of COVID-19 impacts for our customers and the temporary redeployment of staff from debt collection to other functions. 170Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL ActualActual 20192020 12,763,914Recoverable amount of receivables not due ($000)12,590,190 1,247,144Recoverable amount of receivables past due ($000)1,051,749 14,011,058Total carrying value ($000)13,641,939 7.00%Use-of-money interest rate7.00% 5.00%Discount rate5.00% (27,988)Impact on the recoverable amount of a 2% increase in discount rate ($000)(20,200) 30,027Impact on the recoverable amount of a 2% decrease in discount rate ($000)18,800 – COVID-19 economic downturn scenario ($000) 1 (116,000) 1A scenario modelling a COVID-19 economic downturn.

The fair value of receivables is not materially different from the carrying value. Credit risk In determining the recoverability of receivables, Inland Revenue uses information about disputes and past experience of the outcomes of such disputes, together with trends of payment timeliness and other information obtained from credit collection. Under the Tax Administration Act 1994, Inland Revenue has broad powers to ensure that people meet their obligations. Part 10 of the Act sets out the powers of the Commissioner to recover unpaid tax. The Crown does not hold any collateral or any other credit enhancements over receivables which are past due. Receivables are widely dispersed over a number of customers and as a result the Crown does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk. The estimated recoverable amount of this portfolio and the significant assumptions and sensitivities underpinning the valuation of carrying value receivables are shown below: 171 Note 5. Receivables—child support The Crown collects monies from parents who pay child support and passes this to custodial persons. The child support receivable represents penalties which, in the main, relates to penalties imposed on parents who default on their child support payments. Child support penalties grow exponentially due to their compounding nature. The recovery of debt is challenging and 97% of child support debt is written down at initial recognition as we do not expect to collect it. The non-recoverability of penalties has been allowed for in the initial fair value write-down figure. At year end, the fair value of the outstanding debt is also tested for impairment. Historically, there have been limited provisions under child support legislation to write off penalties. However, legislative changes to the Child Support Act 1991, effective from 1 April 2016, increased the Commissioner’s ability to write off child support penalty debt. As a result of these legislative changes, the nominal value of child support debt will reduce over time. Credit risk The Crown does not hold any collateral or any other credit enhancements over receivables for child support which are past due. Receivables for child support are widely dispersed over a number of customers and as a result the Crown does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk.

Small Business Cashflow Scheme (References to surplus and deficit in this note refer to the surplus and deficit of the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand). On 12 May 2020, the Government opened the Small Business Cashflow Scheme to assist small-to-medium businesses impacted by COVID-19. The scheme is administered by Inland Revenue and provides loans of up to $100,000 to businesses employing 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees for a maximum loan term of five years. Eligible businesses can borrow $10,000 plus an additional $1,800 per equivalent full-time employee. To be eligible for the loans, borrowers need to declare that they are a viable business, and that they will use the money for core business operating costs. Loans are interest free if they are paid back within a year. Otherwise, the interest rate will be 3% per annum for a maximum term of five years. Repayments are not required for the first two years, but voluntary payments can still be made over this period. During months 25 to 60, regular principal and interest payments are required to be paid on outstanding balances. Inland Revenue holds the total nominal debt, administers the initial fair value write-down expense and any subsequent fair value adjustments, and is responsible for collecting the loan. Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans are designated at fair value through surplus or deficit under PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The difference between the amount of the loan and the fair value on initial recognition is recognised as an expense. The initial fair value is lower than the amount of the initial loan for a number of reasons including that: • repayments are not required for the first two years • because there is no interest charged in the first year, the time value of money will erode the value of future repayments • the interest rate of 3% charged is lower than the market interest rates for loans to small-to-medium businesses • borrowers may default on their obligations. At the end of the year, actuarial and predictive models are used to compare the carrying value to the fair value of the loan portfolio and the difference will be recognised in the surplus and deficit of the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand. We use the following key terms to help us define loan values: Fair valueThe market value of loans if they could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s-length transaction. Nominal valueThe total amount owed by borrowers at a point in time, including loan principal, interest, fees and penalties. 173 The nominal and fair values of loans are shown below.

Inland Revenue provides data to the valuer on borrowing and repayments, and data on borrowers such as industry and region. The data is up to 30 June 2020. The key assumptions in determining the $738 million fair value of Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans as at 30 June 2020 are the timing of principal and interest repayments and the default rate. The most critical assumption is the default rate of 29.7% which has been explicitly modelled for each industry sector, and cross-checked by modelling using market discount rates. An additional cross-check was provided by applying banking capital requirements and a risk-weighted assets assumption to estimate the regulatory capital required for a bank owning these loans. This has enabled a calculation of the hypothetical fair value of the loans to a New Zealand bank. As noted by the valuer, there are significant uncertainties in estimating the fair value of the scheme. The key uncertainties include: • the scheme is new and there is limited data to determine the likely repayment default experience • there are limited reference points to determine discount rates for discounting the cashflows • there are uncertainties from the impact of COVID-19 on the wider economy or on the specifics of the businesses receiving loans from the scheme • the uncertain and volatile nature of the future debt repayments. The modelling and sensitivity analysis undertaken by the valuer notes a wide range of possible fair values, estimated to be +/- 20% of the fair value. This can be expressed as a fair value between $452 million and $1.024 billion. The significant assumptions and sensitivities behind the fair value are: 2020 Assumptions Loan interest rate3.0% Default rate29.7% Discount rate15.0% Sensitivities Impact on fair value of a 20% increase in the initial fair value write-down ($000) (285,000) Impact on fair value of a 20% decrease in the initial fair value write-down ($000) 285,000 Impact on fair value of a 10% increase in the initial fair value write-down ($000) (143,000) Impact on fair value of a 10% decrease in the initial fair value write-down ($000) 143,000 The loan portfolio is exposed to a variety of financial instrument risks, including credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on their obligation to repay their loans, causing the scheme to incur a loss. The risk of default has been assumed to be equivalent to a C-grade investment. The scheme does not require borrowers to provide any collateral or security to support advances made. As the total sum advanced is widely dispersed over a large number of borrowers, the scheme does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk. Inland Revenue will use a variety of activities that inform and assist customers and enforce compliance to reduce the risk of non-payment of obligations. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates impact discount rates. The risk is that if interest rates rise, the value of the scheme will significantly decrease as the discount rates applied to the expected future repayments will be higher, decreasing their value. This risk is minimal in the current economic environment. Changes in interest rates could also impact on the Government’s return on loans advanced. The interest rate attached to the loans is set by the Government. 175 Note 7. Student loans (References to surplus and deficit in this note refer to the surplus and deficit of the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand). StudyLink (Ministry of Social Development) administers the initial capital lending and issues student loans, which are then transferred to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue holds the total nominal debt, administers the initial fair value write-down expense and any subsequent fair value adjustments, and is also responsible for the collection of debt. Student loans are designated at fair value through surplus or deficit under PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The difference between the amount of the student loan and the fair value on initial recognition is recognised as an expense. The initial fair value is lower than the amount of the initial student loan for a number of reasons including that: • some borrowers will never earn enough to repay their loans • some overseas-based borrowers will default on their payment obligations • because there is no interest charged on New Zealand-based borrowers’ balances, the time value of money will erode the value of future repayments. At the end of the year, actuarial models are used to compare the carrying value to the fair value of the student loan portfolio and the difference is recognised in the surplus and deficit of the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand. Details of the models are provided later in this note. We use the following key terms to help us define student loan values: Fair valueThe market value of student loans if they could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s-length transaction. Nominal valueThe total amount owed by borrowers at a point in time, including loan principal, interest, fees and penalties. 176Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL The nominal and fair values of student loans are shown below.

Student loan valuation model At the end of the year, the student loan portfolio is revalued to fair value by an independent external valuer using actuarial models. Stats New Zealand collates most of the data for the actuarial valuation model from Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Development. The data is made up of borrowings, repayments, income, educational factors and socio-economic factors. It is current up to 31 March 2019. In addition, supplementary data from Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service, about loan transactions and borrowers’ cross-border movements for the period up to 31 March 2020, is also included. The fair value movement, recognised in the surplus and deficit, relates to changes in discount rate and a reassessment of the expected repayments of loans. The fair value movement at 30 June 2020 is a decrease of $97 million. This decrease incorporates the following changes to the fair value: • The discount rate adjustments have increased the value of the scheme by $343 million (2019: $734 million). The discount rates used for determining the fair value are equal to the Treasury’s prescribed risk-free rates for accounting valuations plus a risk premium. Since 30 June 2019, risk free rates have fallen significantly, which has increased the fair value of the student loan portfolio. The risk premium increased from 2.34% to 2.66% in line with market data. • An adjustment for the impact of COVID-19 decreased the fair value by $507 million as it is expected that the borrowers will be adversely impacted by COVID-19. The inputs used for this adjustment include historical data from the global financial crisis and the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2020 forecasts for unemployment and migration trends. The adjustment includes: • Updated modelling assumptions for employment and migration decreased the value by $276 million. It is assumed there will be a 10% decrease in the proportion of borrowers who are in substantive employment from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021. Employment has been modelled to return to normal levels from 1 April 2025. The model has also been adjusted to assume no New Zealand-based borrowers migrate overseas from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2022. Migration is assumed to return to its normal patterns from 1 April 2022. There have been no modelling adjustments for overseas-based borrowers returning to New Zealand. • A provision of $100 million has been included for a deterioration in overseas-based borrowers’ compliance. This provision is equivalent to a 10% drop in overseas borrowers making repayments for a five-year period. • Updated macroeconomic assumptions, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19, have decreased the fair value by $131 million, of which $120 million relates to updated salary assumptions. Salary inflation assumptions have mostly decreased this year, resulting in lower projected domestic incomes, domestic borrower obligations and repayments. • Other expected repayment adjustments have increased the value of the student loan portfolio by $31 million (2019: $211 million increase). 178Annual Report 2020 FINANCIAL SCHEDULES > NON-DEPARTMENTAL A breakdown of the fair value remeasurement—student loans reported in the Schedule of non-departmental gains and losses is set out below.

The fair value is sensitive to changes in a number of underlying assumptions and judgements, including future income levels, repayment behaviour and macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and discount rates. As noted by the valuer, it is not possible to assess with any certainty the implications of COVID-19 on the fair value of the scheme or the economy as a whole, in terms of the length or degree of impact. There is very little data available to determine the impact of COVID-19 and the modelling adjustments made involve significant judgement and were based on input from the Treasury and other experts. For these reasons, the valuation has a high degree of inherent uncertainty and there is a significant risk of material adjustment to the fair value in future accounting periods. The key risks are as follows: • Before COVID-19, there were improvements in overseas compliance. We expect that overseas compliance will deteriorate as a result of COVID-19, but the extent of this is unknown. There is a risk that the deterioration is underestimated in the valuation. • The model assumes that low-earner borrowers will remain low earners for the same duration in the future as they do currently. There is a risk that this group will increase due to COVID-19 and rising unemployment. If the length of time borrowers remain low earners increases then a decrease in fair value may result. • The proportion of borrowers becoming low earners (that is, earning below $25,000 per annum) continues to be above 50% for those studying lower-level certificates. If this trend continues, long-term earners not in substantive employment will increase and a decrease in fair value may result. • The modelling for migration is based on a four-year average of cyclical migration trends rather than current peaks and troughs in migration. This year, explicit modelling has been done for COVID-19. There is a risk that migration trends may be different to what has been modelled and, therefore, impact on the fair value. • The risk premium methodology will be reviewed in 2020–21. A change in methodology is a possibility and may have a significant impact on the fair value. 179 The significant assumptions and sensitivities behind the fair value are: 20192020 Assumptions 10,730,696Fair value ($000)10,394,584 4.40%Discount rate4.03% 2.6%–5.0%Interest rate applied to loans for overseas-based borrowers1.9%–5.0% 1.4%–2.1%Consumer Price Index0.53%–2.0% 3.0%–3.5%Future salary inflation0.03%–3.52% Sensitivities  91,000 Impact on fair value of a 1% increase in average wage earnings inflation over five years ($000)109,000 (110,000) Impact on fair value of a 1% decrease in average wage earnings inflation over five years ($000)(114,000) 140,000 Impact on fair value of a 2.5% increase in overseas-based borrowers making repayments ($000)121,000 (147,000) Impact on fair value of a 2.5% decrease in overseas-based borrowers making repayments ($000)(128,000) (580,000)Impact on fair value of a 1% increase in discount rate ($000)(602,000) 648,000Impact on fair value of a 1% decrease in discount rate ($000)674,000 N/AImpact on fair value of a 1% increase in borrowers going overseas ($000)65,000 N/AImpact on fair value of a 1% decrease in borrowers going overseas ($000)(23,000) N/AImpact on fair value of a 1% increase in borrowers returning to New Zealand ($000)47,000 N/AImpact on fair value of a 1% decrease in borrowers returning to New Zealand ($000)(52,000) N/AImpact on fair value of a 1% increase in borrowers moving from low earner to high earner ($000)70,000 N/AImpact on fair value of a 1% decrease in borrowers moving from low earner to high earner ($000)(65,000) The student loan portfolio is exposed to a variety of financial instrument risks, including credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on their obligation to repay their loans or die before their loan is repaid, causing the scheme to incur a loss. The risk of death or default cannot be quantified. The student loan scheme does not require borrowers to provide any collateral or security to support advances made. As the total sum advanced is widely dispersed over a large number of borrowers, the student loan scheme does not have any material individual concentrations of credit risk. The credit risk is reduced by the collection of compulsory repayments through the tax system. This is less effective with overseas-based borrowers. Many New Zealand-based borrowers earning over the income threshold have compulsory deductions from salary and wages to repay their loans. Overseas-based borrowers are required to make repayments twice a year based on their loan balance. Inland Revenue uses a variety of communications and campaigns to reduce the risk of non-payment of obligations. Loans are written off on death, for hardship, bankruptcies and in other special circumstances. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates impact discount rates. The risk is that if interest rates rise, the value of the scheme will significantly decrease as the discount rates applied to the expected future repayments will be higher, decreasing their value. In the current economic environment this risk is minimal. Changes in interest rates could also impact on the Government’s return on loans advanced. The interest rate and the interest write-off provisions attached to student loans are set by the Government.

Interest is paid at a rate of 3% per annum if a deposit is left in the scheme for a period of more than 12 months. The environmental restoration account allows businesses to set aside money to cover costs for monitoring, avoiding, remedying or mitigating any detrimental environmental effects which may occur in later years. Interest is calculated at a rate of 3% per annum and is payable from the day after the deposit is made until the day before a refund is made. Refunds will be made when the environmental restoration costs are incurred. 2019–20 is the final year for the adverse event income equalisation scheme. Crown liabilities we are managing Note 8. Refundables and payables Refundables and payables are financial liabilities and are recognised at their nominal value as they are due within 12 months. The nominal value is considered to approximate their fair value. Taxes refundable represent refunds due to customers. KiwiSaver payable represents contributions to be forwarded to scheme providers at balance date. 181 Crown contingencies we are managing Note 11. Contingencies Contingent liabilities and assets are recorded in the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets at the point at which the contingency is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Contingent liabilities are disclosed if it is probable that they will occur. Contingent assets are disclosed if it is probable that the benefits will be realised. Contingent liabilities Legal proceedings and disputes—assessed If a legal case is still not resolved at the end of the disputes process, Inland Revenue will issue an amended assessment to the customer and recognise revenue and a contingent liability. The customer is then able to file proceedings with the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court disputing the assessment. Unclaimed monies Unclaimed monies are repaid to the entitled owner on proof of identity. Based on trends from prior years, the estimated likely amount of unclaimed monies that will be paid is recorded as a liability in the Schedule of non-departmental liabilities and the remainder is recorded as a contingent liability in the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets. Contingent assets Disputes—non-assessed Contingent assets arise as part of the tax dispute process, for example when Inland Revenue has advised a customer of a proposed adjustment to their tax assessment through a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). At this point, Inland Revenue has not issued an amended assessment and no revenue has been recognised so these adjustments are recorded in the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets as disputes—non-assessed. The customer has the right to dispute this adjustment and a disputes resolution process is entered into. Inland Revenue records a contingent asset based on the cash likely to be received from the disputes process, based on experience and similar prior cases, net of losses carried forward. Contingent assets can also arise where the customer has not filed an assessment, but Inland Revenue believes they are liable for tax. In this situation, Inland Revenue will issue an assessment. Where the customer chooses to dispute the Inland Revenue initiated assessment, the assessment is not recognised as revenue and a contingent asset is recorded in the Schedule of non-departmental contingent liabilities and contingent assets. The value of the asset is based on the likely collectable portion of the default assessment, net of losses carried forward. Other disclosures Note 12. Collection of earner levy Inland Revenue collects these levies on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and passes the monies directly to them. The levies are not recognised as revenue or expenditure in the non-departmental schedules. In 2019–20, ACC paid Inland Revenue $17,250,000 for these services. Note 13.

The Auditor-General has appointed me, Kelly Rushton, using the staff and resources of Audit New Zealand, to carry out, on his behalf, the audit of: • the financial statements of Inland Revenue on pages 115 to 146, that comprise the statement of financial position, statement of commitments, statement of contingent liabilities and contingent assets as at 30 June 2020, the statement of comprehensive revenue and expense, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows for the year ended on that date and the notes to the financial statements that include accounting policies and other explanatory information; • the performance information prepared by Inland Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2020 on pages 70 to 103; • the statements of expenses and capital expenditure of Inland Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2020 on pages 109 to 112; • the schedules of non-departmental activities which are managed by Inland Revenue on behalf of the Crown on pages 150 to 181 that comprise: • the schedules of assets; liabilities; commitments; and contingent liabilities and assets as at 30 June 2020; • the schedules of expenses; and revenue for the year ended 30 June 2020; • the statement of trust monies for the year ended 30 June 2020; and • the notes to the schedules that include accounting policies and other explanatory information. Opinion In our opinion: • the financial statements of Inland Revenue on pages 115 to 146: • present fairly, in all material respects: • its financial position as at 30 June 2020; and • its financial performance and cash flows for the year ended on that date; and • comply with generally accepted accounting practice in New Zealand in accordance with the Public Benefit Entity Reporting Standards. • the performance information of Inland Revenue on pages 70 to 103: • presents fairly, in all material respects, for the year ended 30 June 2020: • what has been achieved with the appropriation; and • the actual expenses or capital expenditure incurred compared with the appropriated or forecast expenses or capital expenditure; and • complies with generally accepted accounting practice in New Zealand. • the statements of expenses and capital expenditure of Inland Revenue on pages 109 to 112 are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of section 45A of the Public Finance Act 1989. • the schedules of non-departmental activities which are managed by Inland Revenue on behalf of the Crown on pages 150 to 181 present fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the Treasury Instructions: • the assets; liabilities; commitments; and contingent liabilities and assets as at 30 June 2020; and • expenses; and revenue for the year ended 30 June 2020; and • the statement of trust monies for the year ended 30 June 2020. Our audit was completed on 30 November 2020. This is the date at which our opinion is expressed. The basis for our opinion is explained below, and we draw attention to the impact of Covid-19 on Inland Revenue and the activities it manages on behalf of the Crown. In addition, we outline the responsibilities of the Commissioner and our responsibilities relating to the information to be audited, we comment on other information, and we explain our independence. Emphasis of matter – Impact of Covid-19 Without modifying our opinion, we draw attention to the disclosures about the impact of Covid-19 as set out in Note 2 to the non-departmental statements and schedules. We also draw specific attention to the following matters in the non-departmental statements and schedules due to the significant level of uncertainty caused by Covid-19: 185 • Estimation of income tax revenue for companies and other persons Note 2 on page 164 describes the significant uncertainties, assumptions, and sensitivities in estimating income tax revenue for companies and other persons for the year ended 30 June 2020. A new estimation methodology has been adopted this year that is based on uncertain macroeconomic forecasts about how the economy will perform in the future due to the impact of Covid-19 and how those forecasts relate to income tax revenue for companies and other persons. • Tax receivables Note 4 on page 168 describes the uncertainties, assumptions, and sensitivities in estimating the value of tax receivables and associated impairment as at 30 June 2020. As noted by the valuer, it is not possible to assess with any certainty the implications of Covid-19 on the value of tax receivables. • Small Business Cashflow Scheme Note 6 on page 172 describes the significant uncertainties, assumptions and sensitivities in estimating the fair value of the Small Business Cashflow Scheme (the Scheme) loan portfolio as at 30 June 2020. As noted by the valuer, there are significant uncertainties in estimating the fair value of this new Scheme because there is limited data to determine likely repayment default experience, and how Covid-19 will impact the businesses receiving loans. • Student loans Note 7 on page 175 describes the significant uncertainties, assumptions, and sensitivities in estimating the fair value of the student loan portfolio as at 30 June 2020. As noted by the valuer, it is not possible to assess with any certainty the implications of Covid-19 on the value of the student loan portfolio. Basis for our opinion We carried out our audit in accordance with the Auditor-General’s Auditing Standards, which incorporate the Professional and Ethical Standards and the International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Responsibilities of the auditor section of our report. We have fulfilled our responsibilities in accordance with the Auditor-General’s Auditing Standards. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Responsibilities of the Commissioner for the information to be audited The Commissioner is responsible on behalf of Inland Revenue for preparing: • financial statements that present fairly Inland Revenue’s financial position, financial performance, and its cash flows, and that comply with generally accepted accounting practice in New Zealand. • performance information that presents fairly what has been achieved with each appropriation, the expenditure incurred as compared with expenditure expected to be incurred, and that complies with generally accepted accounting practice in New Zealand. • statements of expenses and capital expenditure of Inland Revenue, that are presented fairly, in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989. • schedules of non-departmental activities, in accordance with the Treasury Instructions, that present fairly those activities managed by Inland Revenue on behalf of the Crown. The Commissioner is responsible for such internal control as is determined is necessary to enable the preparation of the information to be audited that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the information to be audited, the Commissioner is responsible on behalf of Inland Revenue for assessing the Department’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Commissioner is also responsible for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to merge or to terminate the activities of Inland Revenue, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. The Commissioner’s responsibilities arise from the Public Finance Act 1989. Responsibilities of the auditor for the information to be audited Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information we audited, as a whole, is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit carried out in accordance with the Auditor-General’s Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements are differences or omissions of amounts or 186Annual Report 2020 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT disclosures, and can arise from fraud or error. Misstatements are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of readers, taken on the basis of the information we audited. For the budget information reported in the information we audited, our procedures were limited to checking that the information agreed to Inland Revenue’s Statement of Intent 2018-2022, the relevant Estimates and Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations 2019/20, and the 2019/20 forecast financial figures included in Inland Revenue’s 2018/19 Annual Report. We did not evaluate the security and controls over the electronic publication of the information we audited. As part of an audit in accordance with the Auditor-General’s Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. Also: • We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the information we audited, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • We obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Inland Revenue’s internal control. • We evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Commissioner. • We evaluate the appropriateness of the reported performance information within Inland Revenue’s framework for reporting its performance. • We conclude on the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis of accounting by the Commissioner and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on Inland Revenue’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the information we audited or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause Inland Revenue to cease to continue as a going concern. • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the information we audited, including the disclosures, and whether the information we audited represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with the Commissioner regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. Our responsibilities arise from the Public Audit Act 2001. Other information The Commissioner is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included on pages 1 to 69, 104 to 108, 188 to 199, but does not include the information we audited, and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the information we audited does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of audit opinion or assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information. In doing so, we consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the information we audited or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on our work, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Independence We are independent of Inland Revenue in accordance with the independence requirements of the Auditor-General’s Auditing Standards, which incorporate the independence requirements of Professional and Ethical Standard 1: International Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Other than in our capacity as auditor, we have no relationship with, or interests, in Inland Revenue. Kelly Rushton Audit New Zealand On behalf of the Auditor-General Wellington, New Zealand Additional information Taipitopito anō 188Annual Report 2020 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Information sharing with the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) Under information sharing regulations, Inland Revenue must report annually, for this approved information sharing agreement (AISA), on actions taken during the financial year.

Under sections 96S(1)(b), 96T and 96U of the Privacy Act 1993, and clause 9 of the Privacy Regulations 1993, the Privacy Commissioner has specified the following reporting in respect of the AISA for: supply of information for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation or providing evidence of serious crime. A copy of the AISA is available to view at: https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/information-sharing/information-sharing/nz-police Information shared DescriptionFinancial year ending 30 June 2019 Financial year ending 30 June 2020 Number of requests for information made by New Zealand Police to Inland Revenue170203 Number of responses with information provided by Inland Revenue to New Zealand Police150198 Number of occasions Inland Revenue proactively provided information to New Zealand Police55 Costs The estimated cost of the sharing agreement with New Zealand Police is $9,905 for the year ended 30 June 2020.

Assurance An internal critical task assurance review is applied across a selection of information requests and proposed responses. There have been no instances identified of information being shared contrary to the AISA. Amendments No amendments have been made in the reporting period. 190Annual Report 2020 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Information sharing with the Ministry of Social Development Under sections 96S(1)(b), 96T and 96U of the Privacy Act 1993, and clause 9 of the Privacy Regulations 1993, the Privacy Commissioner has specified the following reporting in respect of the approved information sharing agreement (AISA) listed in schedule 2A of the Privacy Act between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to facilitate the following public services: (a) The accurate and efficient assessment of eligibility for, and entitlement to, benefits and subsidies; (b) The accurate and efficient assessment and enforcement of tax obligations, including recovering any associated debt; and (c) The accurate and efficient assessment and enforcement of obligations relating to benefits and subsidies, including recovering any associated debt. Inland Revenue will collate the following information annually (for the period between 1 July and 30 June) and report the information in its annual report for that year: Scale MetricShares derived from: 2018–192019–20 Administration of shared services: Number of records disclosed (MSD to Inland Revenue)Commencement Cessation benefits/students2,6101,081 Housing ShareNote 1 Note 1 Child support administration94,378 2 94,378 2 Student Loan Programme7,041,500 2 5,547,303 3 Administration of social assistance: Number of records disclosed (Inland Revenue to MSD)Community Services Card1,787,3715,908,889 4 Commencement Cessation benefits/students2,6101,081 Proactive Information Share—benefits and students 556,683429,025 Housing ShareNote 1 Note 1 Child support administration402,047 2 402,047 2 Student Loan Programme15,700 2 42,450 3 191 Benefits (Quantitative) MetricShares derived from: 2018–192019–20 Administration of shared services (Inland Revenue): Number of services automatically transferredWorking for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) administration 12,68421,583 Value of services stopped (overpayments)WfFTC double payment (number)9021,170 WfFTC double payment (value)$282,725$241,017 Administration of social assistance (MSD) (across product range): Services offered or renewed (number)Community Services Card376,672203,992 Service cancellations (number)Proactive Information Share—benefits and students 1,378725 Housing ShareNote 1 Note 1 Adverse action notices (number sent)Community Services Card12,5170 Commencement Cessation benefits/students504 Proactive Information Share—benefits and students 67,84443,930 Housing ShareNote 1 Note 1 Challenges (number received and number upheld)Community Services Card (received)100 Community Services Card (upheld)50 Commencement Cessation benefits/students (received) 00 Commencement Cessation benefits/students (upheld) 00 Proactive Information Share—benefits and students (received) 393171 Proactive Information Share—benefits and students (upheld) 20079 Housing Share (received)Note 1 Note 1 Housing Share (upheld)Note 1 Note 1 192Annual Report 2020 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Benefits (Quantitative) cont.

Due to other Ministry priorities, resources to implement these changes have not yet been prioritised. 2 Estimated (as agreed with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner). 3 Transactions recorded in START, our new tax and revenue technology system, that occurred between 16 April and 30 June 2020. Due to data migration as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the whole year could not be reported on. 4 An issue with Inland Revenue’s START system resulted in very large files being sent to MSD for clients that may be eligible for a Community Services Card, where the fortnightly file in March 2020 started having more than 500,000 clients in it. This may have contributed to the increase in this area of the reporting. 193 Qualitative benefits • The information sharing under this AISA effectively helps MSD to assess eligibility for Community Services Cards and benefits and identify overpayments. It is also the most effective way for Inland Revenue and MSD to ensure customers receive their correct Working for Families Tax Credit entitlements. • There were no data breaches under the AISA in 2019–20. • Some of the sharing activity in 2019–20 was paused due to the need for significant operational resources to be diverted to the COVID-19 response, by both Inland Revenue and MSD. • From the start of the response activities to COVID-19, we focused on supporting customers, and providing relief where appropriate. We also deferred or delayed audits, disputes and debt activities. That decision has affected some of the data and results for the Commencement Cessation Benefits/Student Match and the Proactive Information Share. Assurance In the 2019–20 year: • MSD and Inland Revenue received no privacy complaints about the operation of the information sharing under the AISA. • There was no change to the Order in Council. Information sharing with approved credit reporting agencies In the year ended 30 June 2020, the Commissioner communicated information to an approved credit reporting agency in relation to one taxpayer only. 194 INDEX Annual Report 2020 Index Aggressive tax planning 41, 99 All-of-Government services 32 Analytics28, 35–38, 41, 44, 48, 79–80 Appropriations 21–22, 86, 109–112 Approved information sharing agreements 31, 188–193 Assets 64, 104–105 Ātea56, 64 Audit 35–37, 40–41 Automatic Exchange of Information43, 82 Awards32, 42, 51 Base erosion and profit shifting 43–44, 82 Bright-line 40–41 Budget-funded initiatives38, 97, 99 Business continuity61 Business transformation 25–28, 32, 47, 56, 60, 64, 103, 106 Campaigns43 Capability47–48, 80 Capital expenditure and capital injections 109–110 Cheques28 Child support 11, 28, 32, 36, 39, 44 Collaboration 29, 31–32, 74, 82 Commissioner of Inland Revenue4–8, 29, 54, 59, 62 Commissioner’s Awards51 Compliance35–44, 95–99 Corporate strategy18 COVID-1928–31, 36–38, 40, 50–51,61 Culture49–50, 52, 84 Customer satisfaction 31, 37, 76, 89 Customers 11, 23–32, 35–44, 52–53, 76, 89 Cyber security63 Data centres64 Debt 38–40, 95–97 Digital services26–27, 74–75, 77 Disaster recovery64 Diversity and inclusion52–56, 84–85 Double tax agreements44 Emergency response28–30, 61 Enterprise support services64 Environmental sustainability 65 Ethnicities55 Executive Leadership Team14–15 Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO)54–55 Fraud prevention 36–37, 63 Gender pay gap 54–55, 85 Global tax evasion43–44 Governance 59–62 Government Office Accommodation Programme 65 Government spending10 Health and safety 50–51 Hidden economy 40, 99 High-wealth customers42 Impact measures19, 76–83 Independent reviews60, 61 Information security63 Information sharing 29, 31, 81, 188–193 Intelligence-led37–38, 41, 49 Internal assurance60 International tax compliance 42–44 Investigations 40–42, 98–99 Investor Confidence Rating 87 KiwiSaver11, 26–28 195 Public rulings41 Public Sector Reputation Index83 Recognition 51 Release 326, 80 Release 426–28, 31, 61 Remote working27, 50–51, 54, 64 Returns not filed by the due date38, 95–97 Research and development tax credits30, 31 Revenue collected 10, 150–151 Risk and Assurance Committee62 Risk management 60–63 Security50, 63–64 Significant enterprises42–43 Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme28–29, 37, 80–81 Social policy 11, 28, 31, 39–40 Staff engagement50, 84 STA RT26, 28–29, 38, 48, 63–64, 79–80 Student loans 11, 27, 40 System availability 105 Tax agents31 Tax law 41 Tax Working Group31, 32 Te Tiriti o Waitangi Treaty of Waitangi52 Te reo Māori52 Training48, 50, 53 Vision Inside cover, 19 Unions47, 50–51 ValuesInside cover Wage subsidy29, 81 Women in leadership roles54, 56 Workforce profile55–56 Working for Families Tax Credits11, 38 Learning and development47–48 Litigation42 Locations12 Māhutonga approach52 Māori language and tikanga 52 Mission Inside cover, 19 Multinationals 42–43 myIR 26–27, 29, 37–38 Non-compliant activities40–42 Online services 25–27, 77–78 Operating environment16 Operating expenditure21–22, 86, 107–108 Organisation design47 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 43–44, 54 Organisational structure13 Our people45–56 Outcome measures19, 71–75 Output measures 88–103 Overseas-based student loan customers 40 Overseas-based parents who owe child support 39 Papa Pounamu 54 Payday filing38, 78 People capabilities47 Performance measures 20, 67–105 Performance targets achieved20, 70 Policy changes 30–31 Pou Whirinaki extended support period26 Privacy 63 Procurement 66 Property portfolio65 Property compliance40–41 Prosecutions42 196 INDEX Annual Report 2020 List of figures and tables Figure 1: We are transforming New Zealand’s revenue system in four stages in a series of releases 25 Figure 2: Inland Revenue’s 12 people capabilities 47 Figure 3: Our culture anchors 49 Figure 4: Our desired organisational culture 49 Figure 5: Our governance and accountability structure 60 Table 1: Tax debt as at 30 June 39 Table 2: Child support debt as at 30 June 39 Table 3: Net repayments by overseas-based customers 40 Table 4: Health and safety reports 2019–20 50 Table 5: Ethnicities at Inland Revenue 55 Table 6: Percentage of leadership roles by ethnicity 55 Table 7: Our workforce profile 56 Table 8: A summary of our enterprise risks 61 197 Appendix 1: Glossary Te r mDefinition aggressive tax planningRefers to tax positions taken by taxpayers to reduce a tax liability or increase their entitlements to social benefits by using inappropriate or unlawful tax structures. appropriationA parliamentary authorisation for the Government or an Office of Parliament to incur expenses or capital expenditure.

Annual Report 2022
==================

This is Inland Revenue’s Annual Report for 2021-22.

Ko tēnei te Pūrongo ā-Tau 2021-22 a Te Tari Taake.

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue - our story
----------------------------------------

At Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue, we're passionate about Aotearoa New Zealand being a great place to live and work.  We're making it simpler for everyone to pay tax that pays for the things they value, like health care, education and protecting the environment.

For almost 150 years we've protected the integrity of the tax system, so New Zealanders can trust that everyone is contributing what they are meant to. We support people and businesses with initiatives such as tax credits for working families, child support payments, student loan repayments, and support for businesses impacted by COVID-19.

We are learning to weave te Tiriti o Waitangi principles and te ao Māori through everything we do. We recognise that New Zealand and its communities are diverse, so we are listening to these communities and working to provide a tax system that works for everyone.

We know most New Zealanders believe paying their tax is a good thing. They know we're here to help them. They also know that, when people choose not to meet their obligations, we'll take action.   

We think paying taxes and getting what you're entitled to shouldn't take a lot of work, which is why we've been changing every part of how we do things. We're using data and analysis in new ways to make it easier for people to get things right and harder to get them wrong.   

Businesses no longer have to fill out a lot of forms—we have software to do this for them. People don't need to work out if they are due a refund—this happens automatically. If people are paying or getting too little or too much, we can fix it before it becomes a problem.   

Now we've made things simpler, people don't need to get in touch as often. We're able to spend more time with the customers who need our help. 

Our people work in teams from different parts of the organisation, combining skills and knowledge to do a great job. Being agile, resilient and curious means we're able to help New Zealanders get things right, even when times are challenging.

Every day, we work with our colleagues across the Public Service, the tax community and organisations throughout New Zealand to continually improve the tax system for New Zealanders.

We're proud to work at Inland Revenue, knowing we help to make Aotearoa New Zealand a great place to live and work, now and in the future.

Anonymous information leads to IR visits
========================================

**31 October 2024** Inland Revenue (IR) staff are making unannounced visits to hundreds of businesses who we believe aren’t meeting all their tax obligations as employers.  
  
The visits are another round in IR’s Hidden Economy suite of work and follows on from the successful liquor store campaign in the past year.  
  
**Anonymous tip offs**  
  
The businesses which will be visited have been identified from the list of nearly 7,000 anonymous tipoffs the department receives each year.    
  
The volume of tipoffs has grown over previous years indicating an increased sense of frustration by the community in general with businesses who are not doing the right thing.  
  
Inland Revenue’s has analysed the anonymous information at a high level. That’s shown the tax risks overwhelmingly relate to taking the cash for personal use without recording sales and/or paying employees in cash.   
  
**Risks**  
  
Those risks are higher where businesses deal directly with consumers and their goods and services are at a low average price point. The lower the average transaction value, the more likely a customer is to pay in cash.  
  
Also, when businesses handle significant amounts of cash, business owners have a stronger means, motive, and opportunity to choose not to record the cash sales correctly for tax purposes.   
  
**Get it Right**  
  
Right now, we’re focused on employer’s obligations, and we’ve ended up with nearly 300 employers across various sectors who we’ll be visiting and whose practices we’ll be looking more closely at.  
  
This campaign is part of the Get it Right campaign. Most businesses do the right thing, but there are those that don’t. We are aware of and actively seeking out and prosecuting those who aren't paying their fair share.  
  
Businesses need to keep a record of and declare all income and sales, including any cash sales. It's fine to receive cash payments, so long as those are recorded and reported as income earned in GST and income tax returns.  
  
**We can help**  
  
We want the businesses we are visiting to understand their obligations and we’ll help them put their affairs right. But we’ll also act on any further non-compliance, with consequences for them.   
  
This is not an audit or an in-depth review, but it is a chance for businesses to explain what they’re doing and get some help in getting it right.  
  
There are also resources online if people need help:  
\- Get it right  
\- Register as an employer (ird.govt.nz) – includes Employers Guide IR335 (July 2024)  
\- Complete my tax code declaration (ird.govt.nz) – IR330 (July 2024)

Appeal against High Court decision awarding indemnity costs to the Commissioner
===============================================================================

2014 case note – Court allowed appeal overturning cost judgment, indemnity costs replaced with scale costs – hopeless case, access to justice.

Case

Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue; Redcliffe Forestry Venture Limited & Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules, Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules

### Summary

The Court allowed the appeal overturning Brewer J's cost judgment in _Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZHC 3411 and replaced the indemnity costs awarded in favour of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") with scale costs.

### Impact of decision

The Court confirmed the approach in _Bradbury v Westpac Banking Corp_ \[2009\] NZCA 334, \[2009\] 3 NZLR 400 ("_Bradbury"_) in determining whether a case for indemnity costs was made out and held that awarding the costs must be consistent with access to justice. Noting timing is a critical factor, what happens between substantive judgment and the costs decision is not relevant to the consideration of awarding indemnity costs.

### Facts

This appeal relates to the Trinity scheme, which was confirmed as tax avoidance by the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289_._

This decision in particular relates to the High Court judgment delivered by Brewer J which awarded indemnity costs to the Commissioner for a proceeding commenced by the appellants which sought to set aside _Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 22 NZTC 19.027 (HC) ("_Accent 2004"_).

In the High Court proceeding, the Commissioner filed a protest to jurisdiction under rule 5.49 of the High Court Rules. This was upheld by Venning J in _Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] 1 NZLR 336 (HC) ("_Redcliffe 2010"_) but subsequently overturned by the Court of Appeal (_Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZCA 638, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 823), on the basis that the rule 5.49 procedure was not the appropriate vehicle for the Commissioner to challenge the application to set aside the _Accent 2004_ judgment. However, on appeal the Supreme Court reinstated Venning J's judgment (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd_ (2012) NZSC 94, \[2013\] 1 NZLR 804).

Brewer J found that the application to set aside _Accent 2004_ was hopeless from the outset and amounted to a collateral attack on legal matters that had already been pronounced upon by the Supreme Court. Brewer J relied, amongst other things, on a substantially similar proceeding that was rejected by Keane J in _Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2010) 24 NZTC 24,126.

### Decision

In addressing the principles governing indemnity costs, the Court first referred to rule 14.6 of the High Court Rules and rule 53E(3) of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005, under which a court may award indemnity costs if:

1.  the party has acted vexatiously, frivolously, improperly, or unnecessarily in commencing, continuing, or defending a proceeding or a step in a proceeding; or
2.  some other reason exists that justifies the court making an order for indemnity costs despite the principle that the determination of costs should be predictable and expeditious.

The Court considered _Bradbury_, the leading case on indemnity costs, where the Court noted that access to justice is a fundamental right, and listed non-exhaustive categories in which indemnity costs have been ordered. These included "making allegations which ought to never have been made or unduly prolonging a case by making groundless contentions, summarised in French J's 'hopeless case' test".

The Court noted that the reference to the "hopeless case" test is an observation made by French J (_J Corp Pty Ltd v Australian Builders Labourers Federation Union of Workers (WA Branch) (No 2)_ (1993) 46 IR 301 (FCA)) who relied on an earlier decision of Woodward J (_Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd_ (1988) 81 ALR 397 (FCA)) where he found that if a case is truly hopeless, the action must be presumed to have been commenced for some ulterior motive.

The Court, pointing out the long delay (almost four years) between the judgment in _Redcliffe 2010_ and Brewer J's decision, considered that what happened after _Redcliffe 2010_ was decided could not have a bearing on the appropriate award of costs in _Redcliffe 2010_ itself.

The Court also found Keane J's judgment was not relevant to the determination of costs for _Redcliffe 2010_ as Keane J's decision was reserved and had not been delivered when the statement of claim for _Redcliffe 2010_ was filed.

The Court rejected the appellants' argument that if their case was hopeless, it meant that the Court of Appeal's decision reversing _Redcliffe 2010_ was a hopeless decision; pointing out the Court of Appeal only considered the Commissioner's jurisdictional argument, not the merits of the underlying proceeding.

The Court went on to find that while it accepted the existence of serial attacks on the decision of the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] NZLR 289, indemnity costs could not be awarded in relation to _Redcliffe 2010_ which was at the beginning of the series of proceedings. It stated this was a case where a claim failed after due consideration, rather than one which was so hopeless that it should never have been brought in the first place. The Court also noted that awarding indemnity costs would not be consistent with access to justice, a consideration the court identified in _Bradbury_.

The Court held that Brewer J was wrong in taking into account subsequent litigation involving the appellants and others, and allowed the appeal substituting an award of costs on a 2C basis, plus disbursements.

In relation to the costs in this matter, the Court awarded to the appellants collectively one set of scale costs reduced by 50 per cent of the costs payable for a standard appeal in recognition that the appeal was heard on the papers in conjunction with a number of other appeals.

Appeal against partial strike-out dismissed
===========================================

2017 case note – Court of Appeal dismissed appeal against partial strike-out – Chatfield - legitimate expectation, relevant considerations.

Case

Chatfield & Co Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZCA 148

Legislative References

Section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994; Double Taxation Relief (Republic of Korea) Order 1983; Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

Chatfield & Co Ltd and Chatfield & Co (collectively **Chatfield**) applied to judicially review a decision of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") to issue 15 Notices to Furnish Information under s 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA") ("the Notices"). In September 2016 the High Court struck out most of Chatfield's claims (_Chatfield & Co Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2016\] NZHC 2289, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-072). Chatfield appealed. On 1 May 2017 the Court of Appeal ("the Court") dismissed the appeal.

### Impact

The decision applies the standard principles governing strike-out. It also provides some useful comments on the exercise of s 17 of the TAA, operational statements and legitimate expectation.

### Facts

The National Tax Service of the Republic of Korea ("the NTS") asked the Commissioner to obtain and provide certain information relating to a number of Companies ("the Companies"), pursuant to a double taxation agreement ("the DTA") between the Republic of Korea ("Korea") and New Zealand. The Commissioner implemented the NTS request by issuing the Notices to Chatfield, the tax agent for the Companies, under s 17 of the TAA.

In May 2015 Chatfield filed a judicial review proceeding alleging the Commissioner acted unlawfully in deciding to issue the Notices, by:

1.  breaching a legitimate expectation (based on Operational Statement 13/02 ("OS 13/02")) that she would not issue the Notices to Chatfield without first seeking the requisite information from the Companies themselves ("the first cause of action"); or
2.  by failing to take into account certain relevant considerations (being a legitimate expectation the Commissioner would follow OS 13/02; the existence of OS 13/02 and its terms; the limited nature of the tax agent/client relationship and the terms of the DTA) ("the second cause of action"). 

In September 2016 the High Court granted the Commissioner's application to strike out all except one part of Chatfield's claims, leaving only one part of the second cause of action to go to a substantive hearing. Chatfield appealed.

### Decision

The Court agreed with the High Court that the claims in issue were not reasonably arguable and dismissed the appeal.

**_First cause of action: legitimate expectation_**

The Court referred to authority supporting the principle that parties seeking to invoke a legitimate expectation claim must satisfy a number of requirements, the first being an unambiguous commitment or promise by a public authority to follow a certain procedure. The interests of good administration requires the implementation of that unambiguous commitment provided that doing so does not interfere with that authority's statutory duty or powers and in the revenue context the Court has previously emphasised that the scope for invoking legitimate expectation is limited by the scheme and purpose of the income tax legislation (citing _Comptroller of Customs v Terminals (New Zealand) Ltd_ \[2012\] NZCA 598, \[2014\] 2 NZLR 137; _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v New Zealand Wool Board_ (1999) 19 NZTC 14,476 (CA)).

The Court referred to previous case law where the Court rejected taxpayer claims of a legitimate expectation that they would not be assessed for income tax purposes on certain transactions based upon operational statements issued by the Commissioner relating to the power to strike down transactions for tax avoidance (_Miller v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2001\] 3 NZLR 316 (PC); and _Dandelion Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2003\] 1 NZLR 600 (CA)). The Court held the rationale for that approach is beyond challenge – policy statements prepared for the guidance of taxpayers and the general public cannot be elevated to the character of constraints on the Commissioner's statutory duty as only Parliament has that authority (and the same rationale must apply to the exercise of the Commissioner's statutory powers).

The Court noted the power to demand information is necessarily broad given relevant information is normally within the taxpayer's sole possession and control. Section 17 contains the only limitation on that power – the Commissioner must be satisfied the information is necessary or relevant for any purpose relating to the enforcement of the Income Tax Act or any other statutory function (her satisfaction in that respect was not contested here).

The Court found OS 13/02 is simply a comprehensive and correct explanation of the nature and extent of the Commissioner's statutory power to demand information and the circumstances in which she proposes to exercise that power. Parliament vested the Commissioner with this operational discretion to decide what information she considers necessary or relevant and how it is to be obtained but did not vest the discretion for the particular purpose of limiting or impinging upon her otherwise broad statutory power.

The Court rejected Chatfield's attempt to distinguish between information sought under s 17 which is not required for a domestic purpose and information required to satisfy a foreign state's request. The Court did not agree with the submission that exceptions contained in Article 25(2)(a) and (b) of the DTA limit the Commissioner's s 17 power. The Court noted Article 25 has the force of a statutory provision in New Zealand, obliging the Commissioner to exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of the DTA or Korea's domestic laws. While forming part of the legal framework within which the Commissioner exercises her powers and applies operational statements, the Court found nothing to suggest Article 25 exceptions limit the Commissioner's s 17 power by obliging her to seek the information from taxpayers before requiring Chatfield's compliance as tax agent.

The Court held that even if OS 13/02 was capable of constituting a binding representation limiting the circumstances in which the Commissioner would exercise her power, Chatfield's argument failed when applied to the plain words of OS 13/02. The Court rejected Chatfield's argument that the word "may" as used in paragraph 71 of OS 13/02 was synonymous with and must read "will only" seek information from tax agents where it relates to an inquiry for a different purpose than satisfying a request under the DTA.

The Court agreed that in paragraphs \[71\] - \[79\] of OS 13/02 the Commissioner is referring to a limited category of information relating to tax avoidance or evasion or offences likely to lead to prosecution. The Court was satisfied the word "may" as used here was no more than an expression of how the Commissioner intends to exercise her power in certain circumstances which did not apply in this case. The Court confirmed paragraph \[43\] of OS 13/02 is a correct legal recital of the Commissioner's power to seek information from multiple sources including those other than the affected tax payer, such as tax agents, whether before or after seeking information directly from that tax payer.

The Court rejected the argument that the claim should not have been struck out as further evidence regarding the meaning of OS 13/02 may be available at trial, holding that the proper construction of OS 13/02 was one of law (not fact as argued by Chatfield) to be determined according to settled principles of interpretation of the document itself.

The Court was satisfied OS 13/02 is not arguably capable of constituting a legitimate expectation by a taxpayer or its agent that the Commissioner will limit the circumstances in which she will exercise her discretionary power under s 17 to demand information, but recorded that even if wrong on that point, it was not satisfied that OS 13/02 could arguably be construed as imposing such a limitation.

**_Second cause of action: relevant considerations_**

The Court endorsed the High Court's answer to the allegation that OS 13/02 amounted to a voluntary representation to the world at large regarding the procedures the Commissioner will follow and considerations she will take into account when exercising her power, finding it followed logically from the primary conclusion on legitimate expectation. In finding OS 13/02 could not be construed as limiting the circumstances in which the Commissioner will exercise her s 17 power on receipt of a request under the DTA, it was therefore irrelevant as to whether the Commissioner did or did not take OS 13/02 into account and its consideration would have made no difference to the decision.

The Court held the Commissioner's knowledge of the role actually played by a tax agent in performing its contractual duties is not relevant to a request of an entirely different nature for documents required for the performance of a statutory obligation, the only relevant consideration being (once the Commissioner is satisfied that documents are necessary or relevant), whether in fact the agent is likely to hold them.

The Court also rejected a further proposition that the Commissioner should have taken into account possible reputational damage to Chatfield in complying with the notices. 

The Court noted there was no cross-appeal of the decision not to strike out the final claim (that the Commissioner issued the Notices without taking into account the terms of Article 25 and its three exceptions). Assuming the High Court was correct that the Commissioner was required to take Article 25 into account, the Court noted the only evidence before it was that she did in fact do so. The Court however noted it did not have jurisdiction to intervene further.

Appeal by Trinity investors to set aside a High Court decision
==============================================================

2014 case note - Court confirmed that once a decision considered on appeal the lower court has no jurisdiction - Trinity, nullity, indemnity costs, functus officio.

Case

Accent Management Limited v Attorney General, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants' appeal from the High Court judgment of Priestly J (_Accent Management Ltd v Attorney-General_ \[2013\] NZHC 1447, (2013) 26 NZTC 21,020) where he upheld a protest to jurisdiction by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") and the Attorney-General. The original judgment addressed an attempt by the appellants to set aside _Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC) on the basis that Venning J, the first instance judge, failed to apply a purportedly mandatory provision of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("ITA") being subpart EH.

### Impact of decision

The Court of Appeal confirmed that once a decision has been considered on appeal, the lower court is _functus officio_ and has no jurisdiction. It further found the fact the High Court is a hearing authority in terms of section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") does not affect the status of the High Court or of the High Court judge hearing the challenge proceeding.

### Facts

This judgment relates to an appeal against a High Court judgment of Priestly J (_Accent Management Ltd v Attorney-General_ \[2013\] NZHC 1447, (2013) 26 NZTC 21,020) ("Priestly J judgment") where he upheld a protest to jurisdiction by the Commissioner and the Attorney-General (the respondents will be jointly referred to as "the Commissioner") and dismissed the application made by the appellant to set aside an earlier decision _Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC) ("_Accent 2004"_). His Honour also awarded indemnity costs to the Commissioner.

_Accent 2004_ ruled that an arrangement to which the appellant and a number of other taxpayers were party was a tax avoidance arrangement. This was confirmed by the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 ("_Ben Nevis 2008_").

The appellant was seeking to set aside _Accent 2004_ as anullity on the basis that Venning J, the first instance judge, failed to apply, as claimed by the appellant, a mandatory provision of the ITA - being subpart EH.

The Commissioner submitted the principle of finality applies and the High Court is _functus officio_ and therefore has no jurisdiction to consider the appellant's claim because the appellant is essentially re-running the arguments that failed in _Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2010) 24 NZTC 24,126 (HC) ("_Accent 2010"_) and in the Supreme Court in the _Redcliffe_ proceedings (_Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] 1 NZLR 336 (HC); _Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZCA 638, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 823; _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd_ \[2012\] NZSC 94, \[2013\] 1 NZLR 804 ("_Redcliffe SC"_).

### Decision

The Court of Appeal found for the Commissioner and dismissed the appeal.

The Court of Appeal stated in relation to the issue of jurisdiction that the appellant's arguments were materially the same as those it already considered and by the Supreme Court, and therefore the High Court was _functus officio_ and did not have jurisdiction to deal with an application. It stated at \[40\]:

*   We conclude that there is no material distinction between the present case and _Redcliffe_ _SC_. Applying _Redcliffe_ _SC_ leads to the inevitable conclusion that the High Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with Accent's claim.

The Court found the issue of whether the High Court being a hearing authority makes it amenable to reviewing its own decisions, a red herring. It stated at \[30\]:

*   There is nothing to suggest that the fact the High Court is a hearing authority in terms of section 3 of the TAA affects the status of the High Court or of the High Court Judge hearing the challenge proceeding. The TAA does not reconstitute the High Court as an inferior tribunal, subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court on judicial review.

The Court went on to uphold the indemnity costs awarded to the Commissioner in the Priestly J judgment and awarded indemnity costs to the Commissioner in this case stating at \[45\]:

*   As we have noted earlier the question of the applicability of section EH(1) has become something of a refrain. There comes a time when the appellant must accept that the decision of the Court went against it in the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis 2008_ and must face up to the consequences of that finding.

2014 case note – successful application by the CIR to strike out a purported appeal of a decision made by the Taxation Review Authority - interlocutory, objection.

Case

TRA 011/13; \[2014\] NZTRA 14

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998

### Summary

A successful application was made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") to strike out a purported appeal of a decision made by the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") under the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 ("TRAR").

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms that s 26 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 ("TRAA") does not provide a separate right to appeal from decisions made by the TRA under the TRAR.

### Facts

On 7 February 2014, the taxpayer filed a notice of appeal purporting to appeal the decision of the TRA not to make orders under Regulation 6(4) of the TRAR.

The taxpayer had sought orders directing the Commissioner to allow objections made by the taxpayer in relation to several income years. Judge Sinclair determined that the objections in relation to the 1991-94 income years were not competent objections under s 126 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). Consequently she declined to make the orders sought by the taxpayer ("the Decision").

The Commissioner applied to strike out the appeal on the basis that there was no jurisdiction to appeal the Decision as it was not a "determination of an Authority on any objection" under s 26 of the TRAA.

### Decision

The TRA granted the Commissioner's application and made an order striking out the applicant's Notice of Appeal.

In relation to two preliminary issues raise by the taxpayer, Judge Sinclair held, firstly, that the TRA had jurisdiction to determine the Commissioner's present application as the TRA had heard and determined applications to strike out purported appeals on other occasions. The TRA's jurisdiction had not been overruled in the High Court and Court of Appeal which considered the matter.

Secondly, her Honour noted Judge Barber's observations in _Case W48_ (2004) 21 NZTC 11,448that procedural steps taken by the Registry cannot create jurisdiction that otherwise does not exist, and concluded that the TRA is not bound by a procedural step taken by the case manager (who had sent the taxpayer an email accepting the Notice of Appeal).

Judge Sinclair moved on to consider whether s 26(1) of the TRAA which states "\[T\]he determination of an Authority on any objection shall be subject to appeal to the High Court in any case where …", limited appeals only to determinations of the TRA on any objections, or allowed appeals of interlocutory decisions.

Her Honour noted that s 26 of the TRAA applies only to objections under Part 8 of the TAA. She concluded that there is no right of appeal from the Decision under s 26 of the TRAA as the applicant's objections were not considered to be objections commenced under Part 8.

Judge Sinclair, citing Hammond J's reasoning in _M & J Wetherill Company Limited and Ors v Taxation Review Authority_ \[2004\] 21 NZTC 18,924,found the Decision was of an interlocutory nature as there has not been a determination of an objection on its merits.

In relation to s 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and s 6 of the TAA, her Honour found that there would be no denial of natural justice, or damage to the integrity of the tax system, if the TRA struck out the appeal. She concluded that there was no absolute right of appeal from decisions of the TRA and for such a right to exist the appeal must come within the provisions of s 26(1) of the TRAA.

Finally, Judge Sinclair agreed with the Commissioner that matters the applicant may intend to raise on appeal are irrelevant to this issue and there is no reason to delay hearing the application until the grounds of the appeal have been articulated.

### Summary

The taxpayer appealed the High Court decision to strike out its application for judicial review of the Commissioner's actions. The allegations against the Commissioner included illegality in withholding refunds; retrieving refunds accidentally paid; negligence; breach of statutory duty and not complying with the Bill of Rights Act.

### Background

This was an appeal from the decision of the High Court allowing the Commissioner's application to strike out Ch'elle Properties Ltd ("Ch'elle") Judicial Review proceedings.

### Facts

Ch'elle filed GST returns for the taxable periods ending 31 May 1999 and 31 July 1999 claiming input tax credits totalling approximately $9 million. This was based on the purported purchase of 117 properties. The properties were sold by vendors set up and controlled by Nigel Ashby ("Mr Ashby"). Minimal deposits were paid and settlement was deferred for 20 years.

As Ch'elle was registered for GST on an invoice basis it claimed the GST on the purchases at the time an invoice was issued. The vendor companies were registered for GST on a payment basis, allowing it to defer accounting for output tax until settlement.

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA"), High Court ("HC") and most recently, the Court of Appeal ("CA") found Ch'elle was not entitled to input credits in relation to 114 of the property transactions on the basis the scheme was one of tax avoidance.

In June 2004 Ch'elle also sought declaratory relief by way of judicial review and damages under the six causes of action set out below:

*   The Commissioner acted illegally when he recouped money paid accidentally to Ch'elle pursuant to section 43 of the GST Act;
*   The Commissioner was illegally withholding $9 million of input tax credits as he had not invoked section 46 of the GST Act;
*   The Commissioner acted illegally in making his assessment and during the disputes process and adjudication. Therefore the decisions of the TRA and High Court were invalid;
*   The Commissioner was negligent in that he breached a statutory duty of care and caused foreseeable loss;
*   The Commissioner breached a statutory duty;
*   The Commissioner had not complied with the NewZealand Bill of Rights Act ("NZBORA") in that he breached Ch'elle's right to natural justice.

The Commissioner sought to have the action struck out on the basis the claim amounted to an abuse of process, was untenable and/or futile.

Justice Keane in the HC struck the judicial review application out on the basis the causes of action on which Ch'elle relied were either untenable, an abuse of process or futile. There was no basis on which the taxpayer could resurrect its claim by amending its pleading. \[see _Ch'elle Properties (NZ) Limited v CIR (2005)_ 22 NZTC 19,622\]

### Decision

#### 1st cause of action

In view of the TRA and HC decisions in the Challenge proceeding, the declaration that the Commissioner was unlawfully in possession of the refund was unavailable to Ch'elle. The refund was not and never should have been the property of Ch'elle. In addition, a declaration that the Commissioner acted illegally in removing the refund would be misleading since it had been established that Ch'elle was not entitled to the refund.

#### 2nd cause of action

The CA agreed that while the Commissioner failed to follow the section 46 procedure (which the Commissioner accepted), the fact the scheme was found to be tax avoidance meant the declarations sought would be futile.

#### 3rd cause of action

The CA agreed with the HC that no declaration of invalidity was available as the TRA hearing cured any procedural problems with the previous assessment. In addition, despite Ch'elle arguing otherwise, the Commissioner's SOP addendum was issued within the response period. Finally, in relation to the argument that the Commissioner could not advance arguments which differed from Adjudication, the issue was estopped from being argued as the HC had found in the Commissioner's favour and Ch'elle had not appealed this point.

#### 4th cause of action

The CA found the negligence claim deficient as no particulars of the purported breach were provided. The CA agreed with the HC finding that it was undesirable to impose a duty of care on the Commissioner given the elaborate statutory construct within which the Commissioner and taxpayers relate.

#### 5th cause of action

The CA found the allegation of breach of statutory duty to be totally misconceived in that if the refunds were properly payable Ch'elle would not need to rely on this tort for payment.

#### 6th cause of action

The CA agreed with the HC that the final cause of action relying on section 27 New Zealand Bill of Rights Act could not succeed as the authority did not extend beyond procedural fairness. In addition, any possible breach on the part of the Commissioner before the assessments were issued was cured by the objection process. For this reason they preferred not to express an opinion as to the ambit of section 27(1) or circumstances in which compensation could be awarded.

Appeal Status

Appealed
APPENDIX 1 October 2024 Page 1 of 3 Appendix 1: Options analysis Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) evaluated five options to address issues with their information sharing arrangements. These were: • Option 1: Maintain the status quo • Option 2: Use the Commissioner of IR’s powers to request information • Option 3: Make regulations to permit bulk data collection • Option 4: Amend primary legislation, and • Option 5 (preferred option): Establish an approved information sharing agreement (AISA). Each option was evaluated based on its effectiveness in facilitating existing information sharing between the parties, as well as its ability to enable further information sharing in compliance with current legislation (outlined in Chapter 2). Option 1: Maintain the status quo • The first option considered was maintaining the status quo. Under this option, information-sharing between the parties would not be expanded beyond the current settings as Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) cannot legitimise disclosures that would otherwise be unauthorised under the Tax Administration Act 1994, Privacy Act 2020, or any other statute. • Additionally, as the MOU between Inland Revenue and business.govt.nz was underpinned by COVID-19 legislation and has since expired, any proposed entity information shares in Category 9 would no longer be possible. Option 2: Use the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s powers to request information • The second option considered was using Inland Revenue’s existing information- gathering powers, particularly the power to request information in section 17B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to obtain information from MBIE. • The information-gathering power contained in section 17B is broad and could potentially be used by Inland Revenue to access any relevant information from MBIE. However, while it allows Inland Revenue to obtain information from MBIE, it would not allow MBIE to obtain information from Inland Revenue in return. • Using section 17B in this manner also lacks transparency. No Order in Council or other process open to public scrutiny is required for Inland Revenue to request information under this section, and few limits exist on the nature or extent of data which Inland Revenue can request. While this is appropriate for audits and criminal investigations, it is less appropriate for regular bulk collection of data concerning the public. A different approach would allow more public oversight about what data is being collected and why. • Ultimately, this option would not allow Inland Revenue and MBIE to share further information. It would not alter existing information sharing arrangements. APPENDIX 1 October 2024 Page 2 of 3 Option 3: Make regulations to permit bulk data collection • The third option considered was using another of Inland Revenue’s information- gathering powers, set out in section 17L of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to request information. Section 17L empowers the Commissioner to request bulk data on an ongoing, recurring basis for a particular purpose relating to administration or enforcement of Inland Revenue’s responsibilities. • An Order in Council approved by the Governor-General is required to collect information under section 17L. This Order must specify the nature of the information Inland Revenue can request and the purpose for which the information must be used. This allows for public scrutiny and the placement of appropriate limits on what information Inland Revenue can collect. Section 17L is therefore a more appropriate tool than section 17B for ensuring transparency. • However, like section 17B, section 17L authorises the gathering of information by Inland Revenue, but does not authorise Inland Revenue to share information with MBIE. Again, this option would not overcome the legislative restrictions that prevent Inland Revenue from sharing information with MBIE that will help it to better carry out its responsibilities. Nor would it alter existing information sharing arrangements. Option 4: Amend primary legislation • The fourth option considered was legislative amendments to allow the parties to disclose information to one another on a broader basis. This would require amendments to several pieces of primary legislation, including to the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Companies Act 1993, the Charitable Trusts Act 1957, and the Incorporated Societies Acts 1908 and 2022. • This option would allow two-way sharing between Inland Revenue and MBIE and negate the need for Inland Revenue to use its information gathering powers. For this reason, it would be superior to options 2 and 3, which only enable a one-way share of information and rely on the use of IR’s information gathering powers. • Another advantage of this option is that it would require the full parliamentary process, which allows for public transparency and debate. • This option could, however, be complex and take significant time. It would likely involve changes to multiple pieces of primary legislation, and it could take some time for the passage of all the necessary legislation. Use of parliamentary resources for such legislation would limit the opportunity to address other unrelated matters through legislation. • Legislative change may also be a less flexible option than other options considered. If the requirements for information sharing were to change, an Act of Parliament would likely be required to make future legislative changes. • Ultimately, this option would achieve the desired outcomes of providing for existing information sharing and enabling sharing that is currently not allowed. It does, however, come with some difficulties, in that it would be time-consuming to undertake and lack flexibility once enacted. Option 5: Establish an AISA (preferred option) • The fifth option considered was the use of an approved information sharing agreement (AISA). APPENDIX 1 October 2024 Page 3 of 3 • The AISA proposed by Inland Revenue and MBIE would consolidate the existing information sharing agreements in the MOUs, alongside other proposed information shares. Essentially it would create a single authority for the sharing of information between the parties, applying the same processes and protections across all shares. • Importantly, an AISA would enable a two-way share of information between Inland Revenue and MBIE. An AISA can address current legal restrictions, as it is one of the few exemptions to the confidentiality obligations in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (see the exception in section 18B(2)). AISAs can also modify restrictions in the Privacy Act 2020 that would otherwise prevent MBIE from sharing information with Inland Revenue. • The process for developing and approving an AISA allows for public scrutiny and transparency. The parties are obliged to consult with the public, and the Privacy Commissioner, before presenting an AISA to ministers. An AISA will take effect only if the Governor-General approves it through an Order in Council. The Order in Council will ensure the terms of the AISA are publicly available. • The AISA regime in the Privacy Act 2020 provides a clear mechanism for agencies to share information to enable the better delivery of public services. It is a scheme tailored to achieve the types of outcomes that Inland Revenue and MBIE are seeking to achieve. It has inbuilt protections for privacy. For instance, an AISA must clearly set out what types of information are to be shared, the purposes for which such information can be used, and the types of security arrangements that will apply to the transfer and handling of the information. This ensures that individuals’ privacy is not unreasonably impinged and that there are adequate safeguards to protect the privacy and security of information. • An AISA is also easier to amend than primary legislation if changes to it are needed. The mechanism for this would be an amendment to the AISA, which would have effect only once the Governor-General approved it through an Order in Council. The parties would need to consult the public and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner before agreeing to any changes that would have privacy implications. • While AISAs can take time to develop, they are more flexible and less resource intensive to put in place than amending primary legislation and should make less use of parliamentary resources. • Overall, establishing an AISA is a positive step because it would allow Inland Revenue and MBIE to share more information effectively. This will help them fulfil their obligations, uphold privacy expectations, and better discharge their functions and duties.
APPENDIX 2 October 2024 Page 1 of 10 Appendix 2: Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment proposed approved information sharing agreement master table of categories of information shares Categories of information Existing information share Information to be shared Purpose for use of information Category 1: Register information Relying on Inland Revenue’s (IR) collection powers in s17B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, IR currently obtains access to some information: • on the Companies Register, or • held by Market Integrity branch (MIB) in connection with its administration of the Companies Register. MIB to give IR certain information held by the Registrars in relation to the following registers: • Companies Register (Companies Act 1993) • Incorporated Societies Registers (both the current register under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 and the new version of the register under the Incorporated Societies Act 2022) • Incorporated Charitable Trust Board Register (Charitable Trust Board Act 1957). The register information provided by MIB will include information on the registers that is publicly available, and also other information held by the Registrar that is not publicly available. The registers themselves include information in data fields and also copies of documents which have been filed for an entity. The register information provided by MIB will include only the information in data fields. See Appendix 3 for specific details of the types of information that MIB will provide for each register. Purpose 2(a) of the Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA), including the following uses: 1. IR may use the register information to: a. verify or update the contact or other details it holds for taxpayers and other parties b. assist with general service delivery and the provision of services to taxpayers c. assist businesses to comply with their tax obligations d. support its compliance and enforcement functions, including to detect or provide evidence of offences under any legislation it administers (currently or in the future) or the Crimes Act 1961 or to detect or provide evidence of non- compliance with other tax obligations e. assist in tax policy development and assessing the impact of tax policy products. In carrying out these purposes, IR may depart from the standard search criteria available to the public when using the register information. For example, IR may search the register information at scale and carry out searches across the different registers and merge register information with information from a variety of sources to create information to support the uses listed above. APPENDIX 2 October 2024 Page 2 of 10 Categories of information Existing information share Information to be shared Purpose for use of information Category 2: Removal and restoration information MIB already shares removal information with IR under an MOU. MIB regularly propose that entities are removed from the Companies and Limited Partnerships Registers. A list of the notices of intention to remove an entity is sent to IR. IR then reviews the list and determines whether it objects to any entity being removed. These objections are then sent to MIB for consideration. More specifically, MIB give IR the following: a. list of companies (pending removal) that the Registrar has given public notice of their intention to remove from the register b. list of companies (pending removal) where IR has an existing objection to their removal from the register c. list of limited partnerships (pending removal) that the Registrar has given public notice of their intention to remove from the register d. list of limited partnerships (pending removal) where IR has an existing objection to the removal from the register e. list of companies and limited partnerships that have been struck off or restored to the register.
