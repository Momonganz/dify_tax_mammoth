annual income tax rates that would apply for the 2022–23 tax year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same as those for the 2021–22 tax year. Effective date The proposed amendment would be effective for the 2022– 23 tax year. Key features The proposed annual income tax rates for the 2022–23 tax year would be set at the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 11 Platform economy 12 OVERVIEW The platform economy (also referred to as the gig and sharing economy) refers to economic activity facilitated by digital platforms (such as smartphone apps) that connect buyers with sellers who provide their skills, assets, and labour. Examples include accommodation services (such as short-stay and visitor accommodation), transportation services (such as ride-sharing and delivery services), and personal and professional services (such as tutoring, gardening, web and graphic design) provided through digital platforms. The platform economy has become an increasingly popular means of enabling people to supplement their income or conduct their business. While the exact size of the platform economy in New Zealand is not known, it is expected that there are tens of thousands of taxpayers who earn income from their activities on digital platforms. The proposals in this Bill are intended to ensure that New Zealand’s tax settings remain fit-for -purpose in light of the platform economy and its expected growth. They do so by ensuring Inland Revenue has better access to information about income earned by sellers on digital platforms based in New Zealand and offshore, and by maintaining and promoting the sustainability of New Zealand’s broad-based GST system by requiring digital platforms to charge and collect GST on services provided through them in New Zealand. The proposals in the Bill follow consultation by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD). The OECD considered a range of tax implications arising from the growth and popularity of the platform economy. This led to publications by the OECD on issues related to tax administration, information reporting and exchange, and VAT/GST policy and administration. The Government drew on this material in formulating proposals that could be implemented in New Zealand and consulted on the proposals in a March 2022 discussion document, “The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy”. The proposals in this Bill are set out against this background and include:  Implementing an OECD information and reporting exchange framework in New Zealand that would require New Zealand-based digital platforms to provide Inland Revenue with information annually about the consideration sellers on those platforms received from relevant activities. Inland Revenue would use that information in its administration of the tax system where the information related to New Zealand tax residents and would share information with foreign tax authorities where the information related to non-residents.  Extending the GST rules for electronic marketplaces that currently apply to remote services (imported digital services) and low value imported goods to also apply to taxable accommodation, ride-sharing, and food and beverage delivery services that are provided through electronic marketplaces. These proposals also include a flat-rate credit scheme intended to reduce compliance costs for accommodation hosts and drivers (underlying suppliers) who are not required to be registered for GST. The Bill proposes that the OECD’s information reporting and exchange framework would take effect in New Zealand from the 2024 calendar year, with the first information reporting obligations (and exchange) occurring in early 2025. The GST changes are proposed to take effect on 1 April 2024. These timeframes are intended to provide operators of electronic marketplaces with at least 12 months to make the necessary changes to their systems and services to become compliant with the proposed rules. 13 INFORMATION REPORTING Clauses 139(3), (6) and (8), 141, 160(1), 162, 172, 173(2), 178, 179 and 180 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments give legislative effect in New Zealand to an information reporting and exchange framework developed by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD). The reporting framework requires platform operators to provide tax authorities with information about sellers and the income they earn from certain activities on digital platforms. This information could then be exchanged between tax authorities. The proposed amendments would require platform operators based in New Zealand to provide Inland Revenue with information about consideration sellers receive from the following activities provided through digital platforms:  the rental of immovable property (including commercial, short-stay, and visitor accommodation)  personal services (including any time- or task-based work, such as ride-sharing, food and beverage delivery, and graphic and web design services)  the sale of goods, and  vehicle rentals. Background Inland Revenue receives information about income earned by taxpayers from a range of sources. For employees, Inland Revenue receives income information from employers on a regular basis. For those with investment income, Inland Revenue receives information from companies, banks, and other investment vehicles on a regular basis. Inland Revenue relies on this information to administer the tax system. This information is used to make sure that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax and are receiving correct entitlements under social policy schemes. Taxpayers that provide their skills, assets, and labour through digital platforms will have corresponding tax obligations, such as being required to declare their income and expenses from these activities, pay tax on any profits they make, and potentially being required to register for GST. Despite digital platforms having become an increasingly popular means of conducting businesses or supplementing income, Inland Revenue does not receive information about income taxpayers earn from their activities on such platforms unless specific requests are made. By design, digital platforms hold a significant amount of information about taxpayers (such as the amount of consideration received for activities provided through the platforms) that would assist Inland Revenue (and other tax authorities) to ensure taxpayers are complying with their tax obligations. Inland Revenue (and other tax authorities) could request this information from digital platforms or use their information demand powers to obtain it. However, this would increase compliance costs for platform operators, who would need to collate this information and provide it to tax authorities. Multinational digital platforms could be subject to requests from multiple tax authorities and that would further increase compliance costs. 14 To mitigate the costs associated with requiring multinational digital platforms to report to multiple tax authorities, and to ensure that tax authorities have access to information about taxpayers that are directly relevant for tax administration purposes, the OECD developed an information reporting and exchange framework. The OECD’s information reporting and exchange framework requires platform operators that are based in a jurisdiction to provide information to that jurisdiction’s tax authority once a year. The information would relate to the activities of sellers providing services (including accommodation rental, personal services, vehicle rentals, and the sale of goods) through the platform. To the extent this information was relevant to them, it would be shared with the other tax authorities that sign up to the framework. The OECD designed the framework to be consistent with rules being applied in Europe from 2023 that were developed by the European Commission. The proposed timeframe for New Zealand to implement the information reporting and exchange framework is aligned with other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom. If the framework is not implemented in New Zealand, European tax authorities may seek information from New Zealand-based digital platforms about European tax residents. This could result in significant compliance costs for New Zealand-based digital platforms. The information reporting and exchange framework supplements another OECD publication entitled the Code of Conduct: Co-operation between tax administrations and sharing and gig economy platforms. This code sets out the core elements of co- operation between tax authorities and platform operators. 1 International context The exchange of information with other jurisdictions would primarily be conducted under the Multilateral Convention for Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the Multilateral Convention), which currently extends to 146 jurisdictions. New Zealand signed the Multilateral Convention in 2012. The Multilateral Convention authorises automatic exchanges of information, subject to detailed terms to be agreed between competent authorities. The competent authority in New Zealand is the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or a delegated authority. Article 6 of the Multilateral Convention authorises automatic programmes of exchange of information but requires the specific details of such exchanges to be set out in subsidiary instruments. For this purpose, the OECD developed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information on Income Derived through Digital Platforms (MCAA). The MCAA contains the detail of the reporting standards explained in this Commentary. The MCAA is an agreement that can be signed by competent authorities. The MCAA can be signed before domestic legislation relating to the model reporting standards developed by the OECD (discussed below) is enacted. Key features The key features of the amendments include:  Incorporating model rules developed by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) into the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). These rules are defined as the “model reporting standard for digital platforms” and the “extended model reporting standard for digital platforms”. 1 OECD (2020). Code of Conduct: Co-operation between tax administrations and sharing and gig economy platforms, OECD, Paris. www.oecd.org/tax/forum-on-tax-administration/publications- and-products/code-of-conduct-co-operation-between-tax-administrations-and-sharing-and-gig- economy-platforms.pdf 15  Changes to the TAA necessary to support the interpretation and implementation of both model reporting standards in New Zealand.  Requiring “reporting platform operators” and “sellers” to comply with the requirements set out in the reporting standards, including due diligence procedures, reporting, and record keeping.  Adding new civil penalties to the TAA that could apply in circumstances where reporting platform operators and sellers do not comply with their obligations under the reporting standards.  A regulation-making power that enables the Governor-General to make Orders in Council that provide for the effect of future changes to the reporting standards agreed by the OECD. Effective date The proposed regulation-making power would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. The other proposed amendments would take effect on 1 January 2024 and would be effective for the 2024 and later calendar years. On this timeframe:  New Zealand-based reporting platform operators would be required to collect information on sellers that receive consideration from activities on their platforms from 1 January 2024.  Reporting platform operators would need to report this information to Inland Revenue in early 2025, and Inland Revenue could exchange information with other tax authorities in early 2025. Detailed analysis In summary, the proposals in the Bill would affect:  sellers on digital platforms that receive consideration for relevant activities, and  operators of digital platforms that connect buyers with sellers of relevant activities. Relevant activities include the rental of immoveable property (such as visitor and short-stay accommodation), personal services (such as ride-sharing, food and beverage delivery services), the sale of goods, and vehicle rentals. These activities were identified by the OECD as the most significant in the platform economy currently. If the reporting standards were implemented in New Zealand, sellers on digital platforms would need to provide additional information to platform operators. This information would include their tax file number, country of tax residence, and other identifying information. New Zealand-based platform operators would then be required to report information to Inland Revenue about the income earned by sellers on their platform. To the extent this information related to New Zealand tax residents, Inland Revenue would use this information for tax administration purposes, such as checking that income had been included in sellers’ income tax returns. Where information related to non-resident sellers, Inland Revenue could share this information with those non-resident sellers’ tax authorities who could also use it for tax administration purposes. 16 Example 1: Basic operation of the reporting standards in New Zealand Graeme (a New Zealand tax resident) and Lottie (a non-resident for tax purposes) operate through a New Zealand-based digital platform. Under the proposed amendments, the operator of the digital platform must collect identifying information from Graeme and Lottie and provide this, as well as details of the consideration they receive from relevant activities, to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue could:  use information it receives from the platform operator about Graeme for tax administration purposes (such as checking that Graeme has included income from his sales on the digital platform in his income tax return), and  share information it receives from the platform operator about Lottie with the tax authority in the jurisdiction in which Lottie is a tax resident. Lottie’s tax authority could also use this information for tax administration purposes. Operators of digital platforms would be required to conduct due diligence procedures for sellers on their platform, collect and collate information, and report this to Inland Revenue. The information would relate to a calendar year and would need to be provided by 31 January following the end of the calendar year. These obligations are set out in the reporting standards, which the Bill proposes would have legislative effect in New Zealand. Penalties may apply in circumstances where platform operators and sellers do not comply with their obligations under the reporting standards. The remainder of this Commentary item is intended to provide an overview of how the OECD’s information reporting and exchange framework would be implemented in New Zealand. It summarises, rather than replicates, concepts used from the reporting standards themselves. The end of this Commentary item includes information about where the reporting standards, and the associated guidance, can be accessed on the OECD’s website. Implementing the reporting standards in New Zealand Instead of transposing the text of the reporting standards into the TAA, the Bill proposes amendments that would give legislative effect to the reporting standards in New Zealand. It achieves this with a proposed amendment to section 185E of the TAA, which outlines the purpose of Part 11B (that contains the provisions related to international information sharing agreements), and the insertion of new section 185S (Requirements for reporting platform operators and sellers) of the TAA. The proposed new section would apply to operators of New Zealand-based digital platforms and sellers on those platforms. It would require operators and sellers to comply with all the requirements set out in the reporting standards. For these purposes, the Bill defines two reporting standards:  the model reporting standard for digital platforms, and  the extended model reporting standard for digital platforms. Model reporting standard for digital platforms The Bill would insert a definition of “model reporting standard for digital platforms” into section 3(1) of the TAA. This proposed definition refers to the Model Rules for Reporting by Platform Operators with respect to Sellers in the Sharing and Gig 17 Economy. This standard was developed by the OECD and G20 and it was agreed by the Council for the OECD. This standard contains the rules that require “reporting platform operators” to provide information about tax resident (and non-resident) sellers who provide the rental of immoveable property (such as visitor and short-stay accommodation) and personal services (such as ride-sharing). Extended model reporting standard for digital platforms The Bill would also insert a definition of “extended model reporting standard for digital platforms” into section 3(1) of the TAA. This proposed definition refers to the Model Reporting Rules for Digital Platforms: International Exchange Framework and Optional Module for Sale of Goods. In addition to the activities covered in the model reporting standard for digital platforms, this standard also includes the sale of goods and vehicle rentals. This standard was developed by the OECD to match reporting rules designed by the European Commission that apply to members of the European Union from 2023 (known as “DAC7”). Members of the European Union can share information with jurisdictions outside of the European Union to the extent that the receiving jurisdiction has rules of equivalence with the European Union. Implementation and administration of the reporting standards Proposed new section 185S of the TAA contains various provisions that are necessary to support the interpretation, administration, and implementation of the two reporting standards in New Zealand. It would:  provide legislative effect in New Zealand for both the model reporting standard for digital platforms and the extended model reporting standard for digital platforms  require “reporting platform operators” and “sellers” (as defined in the reporting standards) to comply with their obligations under the standards  import definitions used in the reporting standards into the TAA for Part 11B (the Part of the TAA that includes the rules for international information exchange agreements)  require references to a jurisdiction in the reporting standards to be taken as a reference to New Zealand, and  not give legislative effect to an optional provision in the reporting standards that would exclude smaller-scale platform operators from the reporting requirements. This approach to implementing the reporting standards in New Zealand was considered preferable to transposing the standards directly into the TAA. This is because transposing the requirements into the TAA increases the risk of interpretive errors and mismatches between the reporting standards and New Zealand’s implementation of the reporting standards. The Bill contains safeguards to ensure that future changes to the rules would be subject to an exclusion process by way of Order in Council (see the heading “Regulations related to the model reporting standards for digital platforms” below). The Bill proposes amendments to the record-keeping provisions of the TAA that would require “reporting platform operators” to retain records that show the steps undertaken in the operation of the digital platform and the information relied on for the performance of due diligence procedures and reporting requirements as set out in the reporting standards. 18 “Reporting platform operators” and “sellers” The Bill would require reporting platform operators and sellers to comply with their obligations under the reporting standards. The reporting standards themselves define the terms “reporting platform operator” and “seller”. Broadly, a person is a “reporting platform operator” if:  they are a “platform operator” (as defined in the reporting standards) and they are a tax resident in New Zealand, or  if they do not have a residence for tax purposes, they have a place of management (including effective management) in New Zealand or are incorporated in New Zealand. The reporting standards include special rules that apply in circumstances where there is more than one reporting platform operator. These rules prevent the need for multiple reporting platform operators to provide the same information about the same seller to different tax authorities. The Bill does not give legislative effect to the optional provision in the model reporting rules for digital platforms in relation to “excluded reporting platform operators”. An excluded reporting platform operator is relieved from the reporting requirements contained in the model reporting rules. This exclusion is targeted at smaller-scale digital platforms to reduce their compliance costs. Including this exclusion in New Zealand’s implementation of the reporting standards could have resulted in Inland Revenue not receiving information from tax authorities in Europe because New Zealand would not have had rules of equivalence (as the European rules do not include an option for excluding smaller-scale reporting platform operators). The reporting standards also define a “seller”. The definition of “seller” broadly refers to a person who receives consideration for their activities provided through a digital platform. Certain sellers are excluded from the reporting requirements, such as:  large providers of hotel accommodation that provide accommodation at a high frequency (at least 2,000 services per year in respect of a “Property Listing”)  government entities, and  entities (including related entities) whose stock is regularly traded on an established securities market. Due diligence procedures The reporting standards contain due diligence procedures that reporting platform operators must conduct in relation to sellers that are active on a digital platform for a “reportable period” (a calendar year). This involves collecting identifying information about sellers, such as their name, date of birth, address, and tax file number (including the jurisdiction that issued the tax file number). Reporting platform operators are also required to consider the seller’s tax residence based on address information provided by the seller. Further information on the due diligence procedures is included in the reporting standards themselves. The reporting standards require reporting platform operators to complete the due diligence procedures set out in the standards by 31 December (the end of the reportable period). Option to report only on New Zealand tax resident sellers under the model reporting standard for digital platforms The Bill proposes that reporting platform operators based in New Zealand would be able to choose to apply only the model reporting standard for digital platforms (that covers the rental of immovable property and personal services) and not the extended 19 model reporting standard (that covers the sale of goods and vehicle rentals), provided that the sellers operating on the digital platform are tax resident in New Zealand and are not tax resident in a country or territory other than New Zealand. This decision would be enabled under proposed new section 185S(3) of the TAA. Example 2: New Zealand-based digital platform with a New Zealand tax resident seller receiving consideration for the sale of goods Rose is a New Zealand tax resident and provides luxury accommodation in a bach she owns in Waikanae. Rose is not a tax resident in another jurisdiction. Rose renovates her property and decides to sell secondhand furniture on a New Zealand digital platform, “Kraymond’s List”, that facilitates the sale of goods. Under the proposed amendments, the operator of “Kraymond’s List” could choose:  to apply the model reporting standard for digital platforms only in respect of Rose — this would mean that it did not need to provide Inland Revenue with any information about Rose; or  to apply the extended model reporting standard for digital platforms — this would mean it needed to provide information to Inland Revenue about the consideration Rose received from the sale of the secondhand furniture. If Rose were a non-resident for tax purposes, the operator would be required to apply the extended model reporting standard and provide Inland Revenue with information about the consideration Rose received from the sale of goods. The purpose of this is to recognise that New Zealand has international obligations to collect and share information about non-resident sellers on New Zealand-based digital platforms with foreign tax authorities. Without collecting and sharing this information, there would be a risk that foreign tax authorities would not share information they hold on New Zealand tax resident sellers with Inland Revenue. However, as this risk does not arise in relation to collecting and sharing information about New Zealand resident sellers, providing reporting platform operators based in New Zealand with a choice as to whether they report to Inland Revenue information about New Zealand tax resident sellers that receive income from the sale of goods or vehicle rentals would allow those operators to reduce their compliance costs. Form, due date, and use of information under the reporting standards The Bill does not prescribe the form, use, and due date of information under the reporting standards directly. These requirements are contained in the reporting standards. The reporting standards require reporting platform operators to provide information to tax authorities in accordance with the OECD Sharing and Gig Economy XML Schema. This ensures that the data tax authorities receive will be in a standardised format that is capable of being exchanged between tax authorities. The reporting standards also require that information be provided by 31 January following the completion of the calendar year. This timeframe is necessary to enable foreign tax authorities to use the information in the tax assessment process for sellers. Inland Revenue would use the information it received under the reporting standards (and from foreign tax authorities) for tax administration purposes. This would include cross-checking of sellers’ income tax returns against information to ensure that sellers were declaring income from their activities conducted through digital platforms. The Bill does not propose using the information to pre-populate sellers’ income tax returns. 20 Pre-population of income tax returns will be considered in the future and would require legislation to achieve. Enforcement and penalties Jurisdictions that implement the reporting standards are required to implement effective enforcement provisions to address any non-compliance by:  platform operators with reporting obligations, and  sellers who must provide platform operators with information about themselves. The Bill therefore proposes to introduce new civil penalties to the TAA that could apply to platform operators and sellers that fail to comply with their obligations under the reporting standards. The penalties in the Bill are based on penalties introduced to the TAA when the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) (an OECD information exchange relating to financial account information) was implemented in New Zealand. The penalties are contained in proposed new sections 142J (for platform operators) and 142K (for sellers) of the TAA. If the Commissioner assessed a penalty under either of these new sections, the penalty would become payable on the later of:  30 days after the date on which the Commissioner makes the assessment for the penalty, and  the date set out by the Commissioner in the notice of assessment as being the due date for payment of the penalty. Penalties would not apply to the extent that a platform operator or seller, as applicable, establishes in proceedings challenging the assessment of the penalty that the penalty is excessive, or that the operator or the seller is not chargeable with the penalty. The Commissioner would be required to make an assessment of the penalties before the penalties are payable by the platform operator or the seller. The Commissioner would be able to make an assessment of the penalties without needing to issue a notice of proposed adjustment. It is anticipated that the Commissioner would exercise discretion in applying penalties during the first years of operation of the reporting standards. This is provided platform operators and sellers had demonstrated a willingness to comply with their obligations under the reporting standards. This is also consistent with the approach taken by the Commissioner when the CRS was implemented in New Zealand. Penalties when platform operators fail to comply with their obligations Reporting platform operators could be liable for penalties under proposed section 142J of the TAA where they have an obligation to comply with the requirements set out in the model reporting standard for digital platforms and/or the extended model reporting standard for digital platforms and they do not meet the requirements for sellers operating on their platform. The Bill proposes that the penalty be $300 for each occasion that the reporting platform operator does not meet their requirements. This is capped at a maximum of $10,000 per “reportable period” (a calendar year). Reporting platform operators would not be liable to pay these penalties if the failure to meet the requirements under the applicable model reporting standard is shown to be due to circumstances outside of their control. The Bill also proposes increased penalties for reporting platform operators that do not take reasonable care to meet the requirements of the reporting standards. The amount of the penalty would be $20,000 for the first occasion and $40,000 for 21 subsequent occasions. This would be capped at a maximum of $100,000 for a reportable period. Penalties when sellers fail to comply with their obligations A person who is a seller on a digital platform could be liable for a penalty under proposed section 142K of the TAA where they have an obligation to provide information to a reporting platform operator under the reporting standards and they fail to comply with their obligations. The Commissioner would be able to assess a penalty of $1,000 in circumstances where the seller:  provides false or misleading information to the operator about either themselves or another person or entity  does not provide information to the operator about either themselves or another person or entity within a reasonable time after having received a request for the information, or  does not provide information that they are required to provide under the applicable reporting standard. Example 3: Seller fails to provide platform operator with required information Charlie sells goods on a popular digital platform based in New Zealand. He is a non-resident for tax purposes in New Zealand. As part of Charlie’s on-boarding process, the platform operator asks Charlie to provide his tax identification number and the country that issued his tax identification number. Charlie does not provide this information to the platform operator because he knows that it would result in information about his sales on the digital platform being shared with his tax authority. Under the proposed amendments, the Commissioner could assess a penalty of $1,000 that Charlie would be liable to pay under section 142K of the TAA in these circumstances. Absolute liability and strict liability offences would not apply The TAA includes criminal penalties that apply on conviction of absolute liability or strict liability offences. Proposed section 143(2E) would ensure that neither platform operators nor sellers could be convicted of an absolute liability or strict liability offence if they fail to comply with a requirement under the reporting standards. Instead, the civil penalties noted above could apply. Regulations related to the model reporting standards for digital platforms The Bill includes a regulation-making power that would enable the Governor-General to provide for the effect of future changes to the reporting standards by way of Order in Council. This regulation-making power is included in proposed section 226F of the TAA. Not all changes would need to be implemented through an Order in Council. For example, minor changes to the reporting standards, or the commentary for the standards, should automatically flow through into New Zealand. Minor changes may reduce compliance costs for reporting platform operators by clarifying how the rules are intended to apply. 22 Orders in Council would not have retrospective effect and would generally be expressed as applying from the calendar year following the Order in Council coming into force. If it is necessary for an Order in Council to come into force during the calendar year in which it is made, the changes effected by the Order would only need to be applied on a prospective basis from when it came into force. The OECD would coordinate and consult on changes to the reporting standards before New Zealand needed to consider the effect of an Order in Council for these purposes. If changes were made (through automatic inclusion or through an Order in Council), these changes would be communicated by Inland Revenue. This approach is consistent with how changes to the CRS would be implemented in New Zealand. Detailed guidance on the model reporting standards for digital platforms The guidance in this Commentary has focused on the specific amendments to New Zealand’s tax laws that would give effect to, or support implementation of, the OECD model reporting standards for digital platforms in New Zealand. For further information and detailed guidance, the OECD has published:  the model reporting standard for digital platforms  the extended model reporting standard for digital platforms  the User Guide  the XML Schema, and  the Code of Conduct. This information is accessible on the OECD’s website at https://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of -tax-information/model-rules-for -reporting-by - platform-operators-with-respect-to-sellers-in-the-sharing-and-gig-economy.htm 23 GST – MARKETPLACE RULES FOR ACCOMMODATION AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES Clauses 103(2), (4) and (8), 106(1) and (3), 109, 111(1) and (3), 129(1), (3), (5) and (6) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes that the current GST rules for electronic marketplaces that apply to remote services and certain imported goods be extended to apply to “listed services”. Listed services would include taxable supplies of accommodation, ride-sharing, beverage and food delivery services, and other services that are closely connected with these services. This extension would require marketplace operators to collect and return GST on these services provided through electronic marketplaces. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background GST is a consumption tax that applies to the supply of goods and services in New Zealand. It applies to a broad range of goods and services, which keeps it simple, fair, and efficient. Since its introduction in 1985, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) has been amended in response to new business models and technologies, including those that facilitate cross-border transactions. More recently:  in 2016, GST started applying to imported digital services (remote services) that are provided through electronic marketplaces such as websites and mobile phone app stores, and  in 2019, GST also started applying to supplies of low value imported goods (including goods purchased and imported through electronic marketplaces). These changes were consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system and helped support the sustainability and fairness of the GST system overall. These changes also followed a consultation process undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and similar changes have been implemented in many other countries with value-added tax (VAT) systems. In 2020, the OECD began to consider the VAT/GST policy and administration issues that arose in the context of the “gig and sharing economy” or, as described in this Bill, the “platform economy”. This led to a report, “The Impact of the Growth of the Sharing and Gig Economy on VAT/GST Policy and Administration”, which is intended to support jurisdictions to design and implement effective VAT/GST policy responses to the growth and popularity of the gig and sharing economy. The report contains a range of different options that jurisdictions with VAT systems could consider implementing, including requiring platform operators to collect and return GST on behalf of the sellers on the platforms. The Government consulted on potential changes to the GST system in New Zealand following the OECD’s report in a discussion document, “The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy”, published in March 2022. The discussion document observed that services provided through electronic marketplaces (such as accommodation and personal services) are often not subject to GST. This is because the providers of these services through electronic marketplaces operate below the GST 24 registration threshold of $60,000 per 12-month period. Where the providers of these services are registered for GST and have no control or influence over the pricing of the services (which are set by the marketplace operators), it is the providers (instead of consumers) that bear the GST costs. This is inconsistent with the principle that GST is intended to be a tax on final consumption by consumers and not generally a cost to businesses. Electronic marketplaces have become a popular means of enabling buyers to purchase services such as accommodation and transportation. These kinds of services, when provided through other means, are normally subject to GST under New Zealand’s broad-based GST framework. When provided through electronic marketplaces, the services are often not subject to GST. If this were to continue, it could have adverse consequences for the long-term sustainability of the GST system. It places traditional suppliers of these services who are charging and returning GST at a comparative disadvantage, and it could undermine New Zealand’s broad-based GST system. The Bill includes proposed amendments that would extend the current rules for electronic marketplaces to apply to a new category of “listed services”. These services would include taxable accommodation and certain transportation services, including ride-sharing, and beverage and food delivery services. The OECD identified these activities as among the most significant in the platform economy currently. The amendments have been designed in such a way that further activities or services could be included in “listed services” if appropriate. The proposed amendments in the Bill build on existing rules in the GST Act that apply to marketplace operators that supply remote services or imported goods in New Zealand. This is intended to reduce compliance costs on marketplace operators by leveraging rules that have been in place since 2016 and that marketplace operators are familiar with. Detailed analysis An electronic marketplace is a marketplace that is operated by electronic means through which a person (an underlying supplier) makes a supply of goods, remote services or, as proposed by the Bill, “listed services”. 2 The supply itself is made by electronic means through another person (the operator of the electronic marketplace) to a third person (the recipient). This definition includes a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform, or other similar marketplace. It does not include a marketplace that solely processes payments. The operator of an electronic marketplace is treated, for GST purposes, as the supplier of the relevant goods or services when certain criteria are met. The rules for electronic marketplaces also include a priority rule that applies where there are multiple electronic marketplaces that could be liable for GST on a single supply of goods or services. Under this rule, it is the first operator that authorises the charge or receives payment for the supply that is treated as the supplier. The Bill proposes amendments to the rules for electronic marketplaces that would extend the circumstances when the operator of an electronic marketplace would be treated as the supplier of services that are made through the marketplace. These amendments would supplement the existing rules for remote services and imported goods made through electronic marketplaces to also include a new category of “listed services”. 2 For “listed services”, an underlying supplier would be a host that provides the accommodation or a driver that provides the transportation services. 25 The Bill includes “listed services” in proposed section 8C of the GST Act. It sets out that the following services would be included in the definition:  Taxable accommodation services. This would include all forms of accommodation (such as commercial, short-stay, and visitor accommodation) other than exempt residential accommodation (see the heading “Taxable accommodation” below).  Transportation services. The relevant transportation services would be ride- sharing, and beverage and food delivery. Other transportation services would not be included in this definition (see the heading “Transportation services” below). “Listed services” would also include services that are closely connected with the above services where these services are also available through the electronic marketplace. This includes, for example, cleaning services that may be charged by the operator of the electronic marketplace to consumers. The Bill proposes to extend the existing electronic marketplace rules so that they would apply to determine whether the operator of the electronic marketplace is the supplier of the listed services. Under these rules, the marketplace operator of an electronic marketplace through which listed services are supplied would be treated as the supplier where they:  authorised the charge for the supply of the listed services to the recipient, and/or  set a term or condition, whether directly or indirectly, under which the supply of listed services is made. The existing rules in the GST Act that apply when there is more than one operator of the electronic marketplace would also apply in the context of the proposed amendments for listed services. When the operator of an electronic marketplace is treated as the supplier of listed services, the following would apply:  The person who provides the services (the underlying supplier) would be treated as having made a supply of the listed services to the operator of the electronic marketplace. This supply would be zero-rated under existing GST legislation and the underlying supplier would therefore not pay GST on this supply.  The operator of the electronic marketplace supplying listed services would be treated as the supplier of the listed services that would be subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. The underlying supplier would have incurred GST on costs associated with making supplies of listed services. The GST treatment of these costs would depend on whether the underlying supplier is registered for GST. If the underlying supplier is registered for GST, they would be able to deduct input tax on their expenses in the usual way (see the heading “GST-registered underlying suppliers” below). If the underlying supplier is not a registered person, they would be subject to the proposed flat-rate scheme (see the item “Flat-rate credit scheme” later in this Commentary). When GST would apply to listed services The proposed rules for listed services differ slightly from the existing rules for electronic marketplaces that supply remote services or goods. Those existing rules require:  the recipient of remote services to be a New Zealand tax resident, and  the address for the delivery of goods to be at a place in New Zealand. Further, where the recipient of remote services is a registered person themselves, the operator of the electronic marketplace can treat the services as being supplied outside New Zealand, or the services can be zero-rated. 26 The Bill proposes that where a marketplace operator is treated as supplying listed services, these services would be subject to GST when they are performed, provided, or received in New Zealand. Amendments are proposed to the place of supply rules in section 8 of the GST Act to achieve this outcome. Example 4: Listed services performed, provided, or received in New Zealand Charlotte is based overseas and is looking for accommodation in New Zealand for an upcoming holiday. She uses an electronic marketplace to book accommodation in a bach in Queenstown. Under the proposed amendments, as the accommodation provided through the electronic marketplace is in New Zealand, the marketplace operator would be treated as the supplier of the accommodation and would need to account for GST. The Bill also proposes that listed services would always be subject to GST at the standard rate. This means the current rules that allow marketplace operators to treat supplies of remote services or low-value goods made to GST-registered persons as zero-rated supplies (or supplies made outside New Zealand) would not apply to listed services. Marketplace operators would be required to collect and return GST on supplies of listed services from 1 April 2024. The effect of this is that the purchase of taxable accommodation or transportation services (as described in proposed section 8C(2)) through an electronic marketplace before this date would not be subject to GST. Example 5: Listed services purchased before 1 April 2024 Gerard and Nicole are based overseas. They purchase accommodation in New Zealand through an electronic marketplace in March 2024. The accommodation is booked for June 2024. Under the proposed amendments, the operator of the electronic marketplace would not collect GST on the accommodation, even though it is provided after 1 April 2024. Taxable accommodation The Bill proposes that all accommodation (other than exempt accommodation) provided through an electronic marketplace would be subject to GST. For a supply of accommodation to be exempt under New Zealand’s GST Act, the recipient of the accommodation must use the property as their principal place of residence, and they will usually have rights of quiet enjoyment. Accommodation provided through electronic marketplaces will generally not meet these criteria and therefore will not be exempt. This means that, under the proposals in the Bill, marketplace operators would need to return GST on accommodation services provided by underlying suppliers through the electronic marketplace at the standard rate of 15%. The Bill proposes that large commercial providers of accommodation can opt-out of this treatment – see the item “Opt-out agreements” later in this Commentary. The GST Act includes a special valuation rule for domestic goods and services provided in a commercial dwelling. This rule discounts the rate of GST from 15% to 9% in limited circumstances, provided certain criteria are met. New section 10(6B) proposes 27 that where the accommodation is provided through an electronic marketplace, this special valuation rule would not apply. This is because it would be impractical for the operator of an electronic marketplace to determine whether the underlying supplier is providing domestic goods and services that are subject to the discounted GST rate or other accommodation services that are subject to the standard GST rate. Transportation services The Bill proposes to define “transportation services” in the context of listed services as:  ride-sharing services, and  beverage and food delivery services. Ride-sharing services refers to the use of a mobile app or website (electronic marketplace) to engage a personal driver to collect and transport a fare-paying consumer to a chosen destination. Courier services for the delivery of beverages and/or food provided through an electronic marketplace are also included in listed services. This does not include the cost of the beverage or food itself. Closely connected services The Bill proposes to include in listed services all closely connected services that are advertised, listed, or otherwise available through the electronic marketplace. This means that services that are closely connected with the supply of taxable accommodation or the transportation services included in proposed section 8C(2)(b) of the GST Act would also be treated as listed services and would therefore be subject to GST. Services would be considered closely connected where they were incidental to the taxable accommodation or transportation services included in proposed section 8C(2). Example 6: Closely connected services Jenny seeks accommodation on Waiheke Island for an upcoming holiday. She wants to stay in a bach on the beachfront and uses an electronic marketplace that offers accommodation. Geoff provides accommodation in his property to Jenny through the electronic marketplace. The electronic marketplace also charges Jenny a cleaning fee of $50 that is payable to the electronic marketplace. Under the proposed amendments, the cleaning fee would be subject to GST as the fee corresponds to a service that is closely connected with taxable accommodation (a listed service). A service would not be considered closely connected with a listed service if the service did not arise because of the listed service itself. This means that, for example, if cleaning services were provided through an electronic marketplace but were not connected to taxable accommodation or the transportation services included in proposed section 8C(2), those cleaning services would not be “listed services” that a marketplace operator would need to collect and return GST on. 28 GST-registered underlying suppliers The proposed amendments would require marketplace operators to collect and return GST on behalf of underlying suppliers of listed services. This would apply regardless of the GST registration status of the underlying supplier. An underlying supplier of listed services will purchase goods and services for use in making supplies of listed services through electronic marketplaces. If the underlying supplier is registered for GST, they would be able to recover GST on these costs in the normal way, by claiming a deduction for input tax in their GST return. Under the proposed amendments in the Bill, an underlying supplier of listed services that is registered for GST would:  no longer account for GST on supplies of listed services sold through electronic marketplaces (as GST would be accounted for by the marketplace operator)  be treated as making supplies of listed services to the marketplace operator (section 60(1C)(a)), and these supplies would be zero-rated (section 11A(1)(jc))  need to include these zero-rated supplies in their GST return that they provide to Inland Revenue, and  be able to claim input tax deductions on the costs they incur in making supplies of listed services through electronic marketplaces in their GST return. Example 7: Recovery of GST on costs incurred by a GST-registered underlying supplier Wiremu provides ride-sharing services through an electronic marketplace. Wiremu has chosen to be registered for GST, and he has notified the operator of the electronic marketplace of his GST registration status. In making supplies of ride-sharing services, Wiremu purchases fuel and pays to have his vehicle registered and insured. These costs include GST, which Wiremu can recover as an input tax deduction when he completes his GST return. Under the proposed amendments, in this situation:  The operator of the electronic marketplace collects GST on the supply of ride- sharing services Wiremu provides through the electronic marketplace.  Wiremu recovers GST on his expenses in the normal way in his GST return. He includes the income he receives from the operator of the electronic marketplace in the zero-rated supplies box of his GST return to avoid having a GST obligation on these sales (as GST has already been collected by the operator of the electronic marketplace). 29 OPT-OUT AGREEMENTS Clauses 129(4) and (6), and 134 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would allow large commercial enterprises providing taxable accommodation services to enter into agreements with marketplace operators that enable them to continue being responsible for their own GST obligations. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background The proposal to extend the electronic marketplace rules to apply to listed services, including taxable accommodation services, would mean that operators of electronic marketplaces are treated as the suppliers of services that are supplied by another person. This is appropriate in circumstances where the underlying supplier of the services does not have a large commercial operation of providing accommodation services, such as a person who supplies short-stay accommodation in their own home or in an investment property. Many commercial enterprises that provide taxable accommodation (and who will already be collecting and returning GST to Inland Revenue on their supplies of accommodation) will list their services on electronic marketplaces. Under the proposals in the Bill, where taxable accommodation services are supplied through an electronic marketplace, the operator of the electronic marketplace (and not the accommodation provider itself) is treated as the supplier and would therefore have the obligation to return GST on those supplies to Inland Revenue. This could result in increased compliance costs for commercial accommodation providers who would need to make changes to their accounting systems and practices. To avoid this, the Bill proposes that large commercial providers of accommodation would be able to enter into agreements with operators of electronic marketplaces that enable them to retain responsibility for collecting and returning GST on their supplies of taxable accommodation. These “opt-out” agreements are intended to be available only to large commercial enterprises that provide accommodation services and not smaller-scale operations. In the case of the latter, the Government considers it appropriate that operators of electronic marketplaces should be responsible for collecting and returning GST. If an opt-out agreement were entered into, this would mean that:  the accommodation providers themselves would remain responsible for collecting and returning GST on the fees received for the accommodation services they provide, and  the operator of the electronic marketplace would not be treated as the supplier of the accommodation services and consequently would not need to collect and return GST to Inland Revenue on these supplies. This would enable large accommodation providers to maintain their existing accounting practices. It would also mitigate the risk of double taxation that might arise if the operator of the electronic marketplace collected and returned GST on supplies of 30 accommodation that large accommodation providers might also include as standard- rated sales in their own GST returns. Key features The proposed amendments would:  enable large commercial enterprises to enter into opt-out agreements from the electronic marketplace rules, allowing them to agree with marketplace operators to continue being responsible for collecting and returning GST on accommodation services they supply themselves, and  provide the Commissioner with a determination-making power that enables the Commissioner to determine the circumstances where other categories of taxpayers in the accommodation sector can enter into an opt-out agreement. Detailed analysis With marketplace rules, the operator of an electronic marketplace is treated as the supplier of goods or remote services that are provided by another person through the electronic marketplace (the underlying supplier). The rules that apply to electronic marketplaces are included in section 60C of the GST Act. The Bill proposes amendments to section 60C that would enable opt-out agreements between the operator of an electronic marketplace and a person who meets the criteria to be a “large commercial enterprise”. Proposed section 60C(2BB) would enable a person who meets the criteria to be a “large commercial enterprise” to enter into an agreement with the operator of an electronic marketplace that would treat the person, and not the operator of the electronic marketplace, as the supplier of the accommodation services made through the electronic marketplace (an “opt-out agreement”) where:  the documentation provided to the recipient of the services shows the supply as being made by the large commercial enterprise and not the operator of the electronic marketplace, and  a documented agreement between the operator of the electronic marketplace and the large commercial enterprise provides that the large commercial enterprise is liable for the payment of GST, and not the operator of the electronic marketplace. The Bill proposes to define a “large commercial enterprise” as a person who provides accommodation services through an electronic marketplace (an underlying supplier) and lists more than 2,000 nights of accommodation available through the electronic marketplace in a 12-month period. This threshold is similar to the threshold of 2,000 listings per year that is applied in the OECD model reporting standards for determining when a seller on a digital platform should be subject to the reporting requirements. The underlying supplier would also need to have a reasonable expectation that they can meet this threshold for any 12-month period. Proposed section 60C(2BC) would also allow the Commissioner to determine alternative criteria that can be satisfied for an underlying supplier to be a “large commercial enterprise”. In making such a determination, the Commissioner would have to have regard to:  the compliance costs that would arise for underlying suppliers in making changes to their accounting systems and practices, and  the size, scale, and nature of the accommodation services and activities undertaken by underlying suppliers (and it would not be determinative that the underlying supplier exceeded the GST registration threshold alone). 31 The Commissioner would undertake public consultation before making a determination. The Bill proposes that electronic marketplace rules for listed services would apply from 1 April 2024. However, the Bill also proposes a special transitional rule that would make the amendments relating to listed services and opt-out agreements effective on the date the Bill is enacted. This would enable large commercial enterprises to enter into agreements with the operators of electronic marketplaces well before 1 April 2024. It would also enable the Commissioner to make a determination that defines the class of taxpayers who can meet the criteria to be a “large commercial enterprise” that can enter into an opt-out agreement. This transitional rule is included in proposed section 85D. 32 FLAT-RATE CREDIT S CHEME Clauses 103(3) and (8), 109, 116(3), (16), (22), (25) to (27), 130 and 183(1) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would implement a flat-rate credit scheme that marketplace operators would have to apply for underlying suppliers of listed services that were not registered for GST. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background The Bill proposes that operators of electronic marketplaces that supply listed services (taxable accommodation and certain transportation services) would be required to collect and return GST on these supplies to Inland Revenue. For underlying suppliers that are registered for GST, they would be able to continue claiming input tax deductions for goods and services they purchase to make supplies of listed services through electronic marketplaces (see the heading “GST-registered underlying suppliers” in the item “GST – Marketplace rules for accommodation and transportation services” earlier in this Commentary). For underlying suppliers that are not registered, or required to be registered, for GST, the Bill proposes a flat-rate credit scheme. The flat-rate credit scheme would require marketplace operators to pass on, as a credit, a proportion of the consideration charged for the listed services to the underlying supplier. The flat-rate credit approximates the amount of GST that the underlying supplier would be able to recover as a GST deduction if they were registered for GST. Flat-rate schemes are used in other jurisdictions with value-added tax systems as a way of reducing the compliance and administration costs associated with GST registration. Key features The proposed amendments would:  require marketplace operators to apply a flat-rate credit scheme for underlying suppliers of listed services who have not notified them that they are registered for GST  provide an input tax deduction equal to the amount of the flat-rate credit for listed services, which marketplace operators would account for in completing their GST return  require sellers to provide marketplace operators with sufficient information about themselves and their GST registration status to enable marketplace operators to apply the flat-rate credit scheme  include rules to reverse the benefit of the flat-rate credit where it is received by underlying suppliers who are registered for GST, and 33  include an ability for the Commissioner to disclose a person’s GST registration status to marketplace operators to ensure the effective operation of the flat-rate credit scheme. Detailed analysis The purpose of the flat-rate credit scheme is to reduce compliance costs for underlying suppliers who are not required to be registered for GST and who would be able to take an input tax deduction for GST on costs they incur in making supplies of listed services. It would achieve this by providing these underlying suppliers with a flat-rate credit that approximates the amount of GST deductions they would be able to claim on their costs if they were registered for GST. Underlying suppliers could choose not to apply the flat-rate credit scheme and instead claim input tax deductions as a GST-registered person would in the usual way. The flat-rate credit scheme would not be available to GST-registered underlying suppliers, including underlying suppliers who are required to be registered for GST (because they make more than $60,000 of taxable supplies in a 12-month period). The proposed flat-rate credit scheme would require:  underlying suppliers to provide their name, tax file number, and GST registration status to the operators of electronic marketplaces that they operate on (and to update this information as soon as practicable in the event of changes, for example, a person becomes registered for GST)  operators of electronic marketplaces to take an input tax deduction equal to the flat-rate credit, which is prescribed in proposed section 20(3N) of the GST Act, where the services provided are listed services, and the underlying supplier has not notified the operator of the electronic marketplace that they are registered for GST at the time of supply, and  operators of electronic marketplaces to pass on the flat-rate credit to underlying suppliers of listed services, and to also provide details of the passed-on flat-rate credit amount as part of their usual reporting practices at least once a month. Proposed new subsection 20(3N) provides that the amount of the input tax deduction to be taken by operators of electronic marketplaces that corresponds to the flat-rate credit passed on to relevant underlying suppliers (that is, underlying suppliers of listed services who have not notified the operator of the electronic marketplace that they are registered for GST) would be 8.5% of the value of the listed services. The deduction for input tax is taken under proposed section 20(3)(de). The flat-rate credit is required to be passed on to relevant underlying suppliers under proposed section 8C(3)(b)(ii). The flat-rate percentage was determined through analysis of GST return information from suppliers who had identified themselves as suppliers of accommodation in holiday homes and from taxi drivers. Example 8: Basic operation of the flat-rate credit scheme for marketplace operators Henry provides taxable accommodation through an electronic marketplace where the marketplace operator is responsible for collecting and returning GST on these supplies. Henry notifies the operator of the electronic marketplace that he is not a registered person for the purposes of the GST Act. Josie books accommodation that Henry provides through the electronic marketplace for $200 plus GST for the stay. The marketplace operator collects 34 GST of $30 on the supply of the taxable accommodation that they are treated as making to Josie. Knowing that Henry is not a registered person, under the proposed amendments, the marketplace operator applies the flat-rate credit scheme and calculates:  GST of $30 at 15% of the value of the supply, and  the input tax deduction of $17 for the flat-rate credit at 8.5% of the value of the supply. The marketplace operator would be required to deduct input tax of $17 from the $30 of GST payable to Inland Revenue and pass on the $17 to the underlying supplier as a flat-rate credit. The marketplace operator would pay the remaining $13 to Inland Revenue, and this would be the net GST collected on the supply of the accommodation. The flat-rate credit scheme would not apply where the underlying supplier is registered for GST and has notified the operator of the electronic marketplace of their GST registration status. This is because underlying suppliers that are registered for GST would recover GST on the costs of goods and services they use in making supplies of listed services in the normal way through their own GST return (see the heading “GST-registered underlying suppliers” in the item “GST – Marketplace rules for accommodation and transportation services” earlier in the Commentary). Receiving flat-rate credit when registered for GST The Bill also contains amendments that would maintain the integrity of the flat-rate credit scheme. These proposed amendments are to ensure that the benefit of the flat- rate credit is only available to underlying suppliers of listed services who are not registered, or required to be registered, for GST. If an underlying supplier of listed services were registered for GST and received the flat-rate credit, under proposed section 8C(3) of the GST Act, they would:  Have a tax shortfall equal to the amount of the flat-rate credit they received. This tax shortfall could be liable for shortfall penalties under the Tax Administration Act 1994 of up to 150% of the flat-rate credit taken for a taxable period that the underlying supplier should not have received.  Be required to account for output tax for the amount equal to the flat-rate credit they received in a taxable period. This output tax obligation, and the timing of the output tax adjustment, is provided for in proposed sections 20(3JD) and 20(4E) of the GST Act. Example 9: Underlying supplier of listed services is registered for GST and receives flat-rate credit – tax shortfall Bradd is a registered person and provides taxable accommodation services through an electronic marketplace. He has notified the operator of the electronic marketplace that he is not a registered person for the purposes of the GST Act. Bradd’s only sales are through an electronic marketplace. He is registered for GST on a six-monthly basis. Between April 2024 and September 2024, Bradd makes sales through the electronic marketplace equal to $46,000 ex cluding GST. Bradd has incurred expenses of $5,000 including GST. Bradd has claimed GST on these expenses in his GST return. 35 Under the proposed amendments, as Bradd notified the operator of the electronic marketplace that he was not a registered person, Bradd also received flat-rate credits from the operator of the electronic marketplace equal to $3,910. Bradd therefore has a tax shortfall equal to this amount and could be liable for a shortfall penalty of up to 150% of the tax shortfall. Example 10: Underlying supplier of listed services is registered for GST and receives flat-rate credit – output tax adjustment In completing her GST return for the period ending 31 March 2025, Poppy realises she has received flat-rate credits from the operator of the electronic marketplace she operates through. Poppy identifies this from the statement the operator of the electronic marketplace has provided her showing the amount of the flat-rate credits she received in March 2025. Poppy became a registered person in February 2025 but forgot to notify the operator of the electronic marketplace of the change in her GST registration status. Poppy is keen to correct this error. The amount of the flat-rate credits Poppy received in February and March totalled $6,000. Poppy includes $6,000 as an output tax adjustment in her GST return for the period ending March 2025. This output tax will be offset by the amount of GST on the expenses Poppy is claiming an input tax deduction for in the GST return. If an underlying supplier of listed services who is registered for GST receives flat-rate credits that span multiple taxable periods (and therefore multiple GST returns), an output tax adjustment would need to be made in the GST return for each taxable period that the underlying supplier received the flat-rate credit. The timing rules for the adjustment are included in proposed section 20(4E) of the GST Act. Example 11: Timing of output tax adjustment for the flat-rate credit spanning multiple taxable periods Marley is registered for GST and provides listed services through an electronic marketplace. He incorrectly receives the flat-rate credit as he had not notified the operator of the electronic marketplace that he is registered for GST. Marley has a six-monthly taxable period, providing GST returns for the periods covering 1 April 2025 to 31 October 2025 and 1 November 2025 to 31 March 2026. Marley receives the following amounts of flat-rate credits:  $600 in February 2025  $400 in March 2025  $800 in April 2025. Marley is required to make an output tax rate adjustment of:  $1,000 in his GST return for the taxable period ending 31 March 2025, and  $800 in his GST return for the period ending 31 October 2025. 36 Requirement for underlying suppliers to provide marketplace operators with information To enable the effective operation of the flat-rate credit scheme, underlying suppliers would have to provide marketplace operators with their name, tax file number, and GST registration status under proposed section 60H(1). If this information changed (for example if the underlying supplier registered for GST), the underlying supplier would be required to inform the marketplace operator of this change as soon as practicable in accordance with proposed section 60H(2). An underlying supplier is also a “seller” for the purposes of the OECD’s model reporting standards for digital platforms and would be required to provide information about themselves to a reporting platform operator for those purposes. The Bill also proposes that the Commissioner would be able to disclose a person’s GST registration status to marketplace operators for the effective operation of the flat-rate credit scheme. The marketplace operator would be required to act on this information from the Commissioner as soon as practicable (see proposed section 8C(5) of the GST Act and the proposed permitted disclosure in clause 3B of schedule 7, Part A, of the Tax Administration Act 1994). GST returns for marketplace operators The Bill proposes that the operators of electronic marketplaces that supply listed services would be required to take a deduction of input tax equal to the flat-rate credit in circumstances where the underlying supplier had not notified them that they were registered for GST. The marketplace operator would then be required to pass on this flat-rate credit to these underlying suppliers. The deduction for input tax would be taken under proposed section 20(3)(de) in the marketplace operator’s own GST return, and this would reduce the amount of GST payable to Inland Revenue on the listed services the marketplace operator is treated as supplying. Proposed section 60H(3) would enable marketplace operators to rely on the information they receive from underlying suppliers about their GST registration status. If the GST registration status of an underlying supplier is later found to be incorrect (and the operator of the electronic marketplace took a deduction for the flat-rate credit), the operator of the electronic marketplace would not be liable for the tax shortfall. This is intended to recognise the compliance costs associated with the flat- rate credit scheme on operators of electronic marketplaces, who should be protected from any tax shortfalls that relate to underlying suppliers. Where the operator of an electronic marketplace is a non-resident for GST purposes, GST returns and payments would be provided to Inland Revenue on a quarterly basis. If the operator of an electronic marketplace is a New Zealand resident, the filing and payment frequency would depend on the value of marketplace operator’s total supplies. Marketplace operators would continue applying the existing GST rules to determine whether their facilitation services were standard rated, zero-rated, or non-taxable. The Bill does not contain amendments to these rules. The Bill does not contain amendments requiring marketplace operators to provide Inland Revenue with periodic information about underlying suppliers that have received the flat-rate credit. This is because Inland Revenue would seek to use the information under the OECD’s model reporting standards for digital platforms to determine whether underlying suppliers had correctly received the flat-rate credit. Inland Revenue could also request information from marketplace operators if necessary to ensure the integrity of the flat-rate scheme. 37 CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS Clauses 105(4) and (12), 109, 110, 111(2) and (3), 114, 115, 125, 126, 128, 131 and 132 Summary of proposed amendments Several consequential amendments are required to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to ensure that the proposed extension of the existing rules for electronic marketplaces to supplies of listed services work as intended. Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for taxable periods starting on or after 1 April 2024. Background The GST rules for electronic marketplaces treat the marketplace operator as the supplier of the goods or services that are provided through the electronic marketplace by someone else (the underlying supplier). The GST Act contains special rules for electronic marketplaces and the Bill proposes to extend these rules to also apply where the services supplied through the electronic marketplaces are listed services. These include amendments to the rules for:  vouchers, discounts, and loyalty programmes  taxable periods  taxable supply information  bad debt deductions for marketplace operators  GST registration  agents  the keeping of records in a place outside of New Zealand, and  foreign currencies and currency conversion. These proposed amendments would be consequential in nature and are intended to ensure that the existing rules for operators of electronic marketplaces apply in the context of listed services. Detailed analysis Vouchers, discounts, and loyalty programmes The GST Act contains special rules for vouchers, discounts, and loyalty programmes. When the rules for remote services and imported goods were enacted, amendments were made to these rules to ensure they applied appropriately when remote services and imported goods were supplied through electronic marketplaces. The Bill proposes amendments to these rules for listed services supplied through electronic marketplaces: for vouchers (section 5(11G)), discounts (section 10(7D)), and loyalty programmes (section 9(9)). These rules would apply to listed services in the same way that they apply to remote services and imported goods. 38 Taxable periods Non-resident marketplace operators have a quarterly taxable period, with the first taxable period beginning on 1 January and ending on 31 March. This means that their GST returns and payments are due four times a year. The Bill proposes an amendment to the rules for taxable periods in section 15 of the GST Act that would incorporate a reference to “listed services”. This would ensure that non-resident operators of electronic marketplaces that make supplies of listed services would be able to maintain a quarterly taxable period. Taxable supply information A GST-registered person who makes supplies of goods and services is generally required to provide the recipient of the supply with taxable supply information. The Bill proposes amendments to this general rule in circumstances where:  There is a deemed supply of listed services from the underlying supplier to an electronic marketplace. There would be no requirement for the underlying supplier of listed services to provide taxable supply information to the operator of the electronic marketplace in these circumstances. This is included in proposed section 8C(3)(a)(i) of the GST Act.  The operator of an electronic marketplace is treated as making a supply of listed services to a person. The Bill proposes that the operator of an electronic marketplace would be required to provide the recipient of listed services with taxable supply information. There is no need for the recipient of the supply to request the taxable supply information, and the GST registration status of the recipient is also not relevant. This is included in the proposed amendment to section 19K of the GST Act. Bad debt deductions for operators of electronic marketplaces The GST Act includes special rules that enable marketplace operators to claim a bad debt deduction for GST they would be liable to pay to Inland Revenue on supplies of remote services or imported goods made through electronic marketplaces. The Bill contains an amendment to section 26AA of the GST Act that would enable marketplace operators that are treated as the supplier of listed services to apply these rules. This would enable them to claim a bad debt deduction for the GST component of the listed services that they have written off as a bad debt. Under these rules, the bad debt deduction would be reversed to the extent that the GST was recovered by the marketplace operator. GST registration The proposed new rules would require non-resident operators of electronic marketplaces that supply listed services to register for, and return, GST on these supplies where they are performed, provided, or received in New Zealand if these supplies exceed, or are expected to exceed, NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. The Bill proposes to amend the registration rules in section 51 of the GST Act to enable non-resident operators of electronic marketplaces to use a fair and reasonable method of converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency to determine whether the registration threshold has been exceeded. The Commissioner is not able to allocate a tax file number (IRD number) to an offshore person unless they have provided the Commissioner with evidence of their New Zealand bank account number. An exception to this exists where the offshore person needs an IRD number solely because they are a non-resident supplier of goods and services under the GST Act. This exception would continue to apply in 39 circumstances where a non-resident marketplace operator would need to register for GST in New Zealand. Agents The Bill proposes an amendment to the agency rules in section 60 of the GST Act to allow non-resident marketplace operators to enter into agency agreements with New Zealand resident agents. The New Zealand resident agent would be treated as the supplier of listed services instead of the marketplace operator. Record keeping GST-registered persons can apply to the Commissioner for authorisation to keep records at a place outside New Zealand or in a language other than English. The Bill proposes an amendment to the record-keeping rules in section 75 that would provide an automatic exception from this requirement where a marketplace operator treated as a supplier of listed services is a non-resident. This is intended to reduce compliance costs for non-resident operators of electronic marketplaces as they would not need to obtain authorisation from Inland Revenue to maintain records outside New Zealand. Currency conversion The Bill proposes to amend the rules for New Zealand and foreign currency in section 77 of the GST Act to provide non-resident marketplace operators with the option of expressing amounts in a foreign currency at the time of supply. This would override the general principle in the GST Act that all amounts be expressed in New Zealand currency at the time of supply. 41 Cross-border workers 43 CROSS-BORDER WORKERS REFORM Overview The Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 impose obligations on persons who make payments subject to pay as you earn (PAYE) withholding tax – including non-resident contractors’ tax (NRCT), fringe benefit tax (FBT) or employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). Concerns were raised with Inland Revenue that current policy settings do not adequately reflect the complexities of cross-border work or the ways in which work is changing. In light of those concerns, an officials’ issues paper 3 was published containing potential policy options for addressing issues faced by employers and payers of non-resident contractors with a view to improving certainty, efficiency and fairness in the tax system. Following consultation, measures contained in this Bill were developed to respond to the issues raised with Inland Revenue. The measures seek to balance competing considerations—in particular, whether:  an ultimate tax liability exists for the payee in New Zealand,  withholding taxes enable the risk of non-compliance to be managed, and  better provision, and use, of information can play a role in promoting tax compliance. The proposed amendments are part of a wider package of reform to the tax treatment of employers, payers and cross-border workers, including administrative and operational changes. In addition to the key legislative amendments described below, three remedial legislative changes are included in the reform package. Amendments to the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules The PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules are strictly applied. PAYE streamlines the collection of taxes on employees’ salaries and wages and ensures the amounts collected are broadly accurate. PAYE collection and reporting also enables better administration of the tax and transfers system. FBT and ESCT ensure all elements of remuneration are taxed on an equivalent basis. These taxes are quantified and collected under subpart RD (Employment-related taxes) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed amendments would acknowledge that employees working in New Zealand for a non-resident employer (whether as a remote worker, a business traveller or on assignment to a New Zealand business) are in different compliance circumstances to employees of resident employers. These different circumstances may mean a different administrative approach is justified that reduces the cost of compliance with the rules. The proposed key amendments seek to:  enable more flexible application of the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules in specific circumstances, including: − introducing a grace period that will apply in certain circumstances, − enabling the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to agree with an employer of cross-border employees to pay PAYE annually in special circumstances, and 3 Cross-border workers: issues and options for reform : an officials' issues paper (October 2021) (ird.govt.nz) 44 − repealing the PAYE bond provision, which is rarely used and is anticipated will no longer be required, and  improve the clarity and integrity of the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules. Amendments to the non-resident contractor rules NRCT applies to contract payments for the performance of services by a non-resident contractor and the supply of personal property or services by other persons. NRCT was introduced and expanded in response to specific concerns about the integrity of the New Zealand tax base. The purpose of NRCT is to manage ‘flight risk’ – contractors who departed New Zealand having completed their work and collected payment but having not paid the New Zealand tax due. It is intended to be a robust withholding obligation. Unless a contract payment is exempt, the payer is required to withhold NRCT, generally at 15%, from each contract payment. While NRCT is included in the PAYE system, it can apply to contracts in which both payer and contractor are non-resident and only the activity takes place in New Zealand. Further, NRCT is an interim, not minimum or final, tax — the non-resident contractor has its own tax filing requirement that gives effect to the final tax position. The proposals in the Bill aim to modernise the NRCT rules and introduce more flexibility for payers of NRCT. The proposed amendments are:  simplifying the approach to the schedular payment thresholds  introducing a reporting requirement for payers of NRCT  improving the flexibility of NRCT payments and exemptions by: − introducing a grace period that will apply in certain circumstances, − modifying NRCT exemptions, and − introducing a nominated taxpayer approach, and  repealing the NRCT bond provision, which is rarely used and is anticipated will no longer be required. 45 FLEXIBLE PAYE, FBT AND ESCT ARRANGEMENTS Clauses 16, 17, 18, 86, 91 and 98(5) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would enable more flexible pay as you earn (PAYE) withholding tax, fringe benefit tax (FBT), and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) arrangements for employers of cross-border employees. Effective date The proposed amendments would generally take effect on 1 April 2023. Provisions that introduce flexible PAYE measures, including the introduction of the 60-day grace period and the repeal of the PAYE bond provision, would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background The Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) impose obligations on persons who make payments subject to PAYE, FBT, ESCT (collectively referred to in this discussion as “the rules”) as applicable. As the rules are strictly applied, in some circumstances the cost of compliance can be disproportionately high. The strictness of the rules is appropriate for domestic employees, but the tax arrangements for cross- border employees can be unduly complicated, and it is not always easy for an employer to meet their New Zealand tax obligations on a timely basis. The proposed amendments seek to reduce the cost of compliance with the rules. Key features The proposed amendments would establish a more flexible framework for PAYE, FBT and ESCT where these rules are applied to cross-border employees. The key features are:  A definition of a “cross-border employee” for the purpose of the rules.  A 60-day grace period that applies where a cross-border employee has breached the conditions of an exemption from the rules or receives an extra pay.  An ability for the employer to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for a bespoke PAYE arrangement in special circumstances.  Repeal of the PAYE bond provision. Detailed analysis Cross-border employment arrangements take a variety of forms, including secondments, short-term business travel and remote working (where a person works in a different location to the employer’s place of business). As the arrangements can be complicated, an employer may not correctly understand, or be able to meet, their New Zealand payment and tax obligations even though they are trying to comply. Examples that demonstrate the problem include the following situations:  An employer may expect an employee to benefit from an exemption from New Zealand tax under the terms of a double taxation agreement, but a project delay means that the conditions for exemption are not met, and this results in the need to pay New Zealand tax. 46  The employee is paid elements of their remuneration package from one or more global locations. It is not always possible to gather and process compensation data in time to meet New Zealand’s reporting and payment due dates. Strictly, breaches of the rules require a voluntary disclosure to report underpaid tax to Inland Revenue and correct the tax position for each affected employer and/or employee. Voluntary disclosures are time-consuming and costly to prepare, and from an administrative perspective, they are also time-consuming to process and resolve. Definition of a “cross-border employee” The flexibility enabled by the proposed amendments would apply to cross-border employees only. Proposed new section CE 1F(4) of the ITA would define a “cross- border employee” as:  an employee of a non-resident employer who provides services in New Zealand, or  a New Zealand resident employee who provides services outside New Zealand. The purpose of the definition is to ensure that flexibility is appropriately targeted and to enable Inland Revenue to police the application of the rules. The definition is intended to apply to cross-border secondees, short-term business travellers and remote workers (persons whose employer does not provide a workplace in New Zealand). The definition would extend to persons who may work abroad but who are resident in New Zealand and who pay tax in New Zealand on the worldwide basis. 60-day grace period Proposed new sections CE 1F(3B) to (3E) would enable an employer to meet or correct their PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations within a 60-day grace period where they have taken reasonable measures to manage their employment-related tax obligations, and the employee is present in New Zealand for a period during which the employee has:  breached a threshold for exemption under section CW 19 of the ITA  breached a threshold for exemption under a relevant double taxation agreement, or  received an extra pay. The grace period would run from the earliest of the date of the breach or payment and the date on which the employer could reasonably foresee that the breach or payment will occur. The grace period would be available to employers of cross-border employees and to cross-border employees who are responsible for paying PAYE, FBT and ESCT themselves. At present, these persons may choose to make a voluntary disclosure of underpaid tax to Inland Revenue. Under the proposed amendments, a voluntary disclosure would be unnecessary where an employer or relevant cross-border employee meets or corrects the tax due within the grace period. Penalties and interest would not be imposed in respect of underpaid tax if the underpayment is corrected within the grace period. Application for a bespoke PAYE arrangement Section RA 5 of the ITA provides that a person who makes a PAYE income payment, pays an employer’s superannuation cash contribution or provides a fringe benefit must either withhold and pay, or pay, the amount of tax due under the rules. Section RA 15 provides the payment dates for interim and other tax payments, including PAYE, FBT and ESCT. 47 The proposed amendment to section RA 15 would enable an employer of a class of cross-border employees to apply to the Commissioner for an agreement that the tax due for a PAYE income payment may be made by 31 May following the end of the tax year. The agreement would only be made where ‘special circumstances’ exist. Applicants would need to establish the basis for seeking an annual arrangement for payment. Inland Revenue will develop guidance to clarify the types of scenarios that would qualify for annual payments of tax. Repeal of the PAYE bond Under current law, section RD 23 of the ITA allows an employer or PAYE intermediary to apply to the Commissioner to be released from a withholding obligation for a PAYE income payment by providing a bond or other security for the amount that would otherwise be required to be withheld. The section applies where it could not be reasonably determined at the time of withholding whether the payment will be exempt income of an employee under section CW 19 (Amounts derived during short-term visits) or a relevant double tax agreement. If the employee’s PAYE income payment does not ultimately qualify for exemption, the payment of the bond is credited against the amount of tax payable. Regardless of whether the total amount of tax due is satisfied by the bond or security, use of money interest accrues on the total amount of tax due. This provision has been little used in practice. A more flexible approach to the rules is expected to mean that section RD 23 is no longer required, and it is therefore proposed to repeal the section. 48 PAYE, FBT AND ESCT INTEGRITY MEASURES Clauses 16, 17, 93, 94, 98(5), 142, 164, 169 and 181(1) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would clarify the application of the pay as you earn (PAYE) withholding tax, fringe benefit tax (FBT), and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rules (collectively referred to in this discussion as “the rules”) by introducing a safe harbour and clarifying that obligations pass to the employee in the absence of other arrangements. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2023. Background The obligations imposed by the rules have been interpreted differently by employers, tax advisors and Inland Revenue. A recent operational statement “Non-resident employers’ obligations to deduct PAYE, FBT and ESCT in cross-border employment situations” 4 has clarified that the obligations arise for an employer with a sufficient presence in New Zealand. The sufficient presence test is a fact-based determination of whether the employer has made themselves subject to New Zealand law. This can range from trading from a permanent office or site to a single employee who performs contracts in New Zealand on behalf of the non-resident employer. If an employer wrongly assesses itself as not having a sufficient presence in New Zealand and on that basis does not perform its obligations under the rules, it will need to pay the underpaid tax, penalties and interest to Inland Revenue. Under the current rules, if there is no sufficient presence in New Zealand, an employee should pay PAYE directly to Inland Revenue. However, no equivalent rule exists for FBT and ESCT. It is necessary to provide rules that ensure the payment of FBT and ESCT so that all elements of remuneration are taxed equally, as they are for domestic employees. Key features The proposed amendments would:  make a safe harbour available to non-resident employers who wrongly assess their liability to the rules, where the conditions of the safe harbour are met, and  provide that where a non-resident employer does not have an obligation under the rules, the employment-related tax obligations pass to the employee in the absence of other arrangements. Detailed analysis The application of the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules lack clarity. Further, there is a need to ensure that non-cash benefits and employer’s superannuation contributions are taxed. The proposed amendments to the rules would clarify and support the integrity of the sufficient presence test. 4 os-21-04.pdf (ird.govt.nz) 49 Safe-harbour arrangements for non-resident employers Proposed amendments to sections 120B and 141ED of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would provide a safe harbour for non-resident employers who have incorrectly determined that they do not have New Zealand PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations. The rules propose that a safe harbour would be available where the non-resident employer has:  either two or fewer employees present in New Zealand at any point in the income year, or pays $500,000 or less of gross employment-related taxes in New Zealand for the income year, and  arranged for their employment-related tax obligations to be met by another person or has communicated to the affected employee(s) that they must meet those obligations directly. Where the conditions of the safe harbour are met, a non-resident employer who has incorrectly determined that they do not have a sufficient presence in New Zealand would be protected from penalties and interest on the unpaid tax. The safe-harbour arrangement would confirm that the persons who may discharge a non-resident employer’s obligations under the rules are varied: it may be an agent or PAYE intermediary, or it may be a related company that agrees to take on the obligation, in accordance with existing rules and operational practice. Transfer of obligations to an employee Where a non-resident employer does not have a PAYE obligation, proposed new section CE 1F(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would clarify that the obligation to pay and report PAYE, FBT and ESCT transfers to the employee. Section RD 21 provides that if some, or all, of the amount of tax for a PAYE income payment is not withheld at the time it is paid to an employee, the employee must provide the relevant income information and pay the amount of the deficiency. As noted above, there is currently no equivalent provision for FBT and ESCT. Proposed new sections RD 62B and RD 71B would therefore provide the rules corresponding to section RD 21 for FBT and ESCT respectively. This would ensure that employees are taxed equally on fringe benefits and superannuation contributions, regardless of their employer’s New Zealand tax residence or presence. 50 FLEXIBLE NRCT PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS Clauses 145 and 170 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would enable more flexible arrangements for paying non- resident contractors tax (NRCT) by providing for a 60-day grace period and introducing a nominated person approach. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background The Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) impose obligations on persons who make contract payments (payers) to non-resident contractors to withhold NRCT, a tax on certain schedular payments. The NRCT rules are strict and inflexible. In practice, unforeseen factors may impact the performance of the contract and mean that NRCT should have been withheld. This could occur where a non-resident contractor is called in at short notice to handle an emergency. In other cases, weather, or other factors outside the payer or non- resident contractor’s control, cause project times to overrun. In these circumstances, correction is required. Under current law, the correction is made by a voluntary disclosure. This process can be complex, costly and time-consuming. The strict nature of the rules also may not work well for certain types of business models that commonly use non-resident contractors, for example, large projects where multiple different businesses are working together. This process could be streamlined by allowing one entity to be accountable for the NRCT on the project as a whole. The proposed amendments would modernise the application of the rules to support a more flexible approach. Key features Proposed new section 141GC of the TAA would introduce flexibility into the NRCT rules by allowing a 60-day grace period for correcting NRCT payments. Proposed new section 24HB would enable a payer to nominate a related New Zealand person to take on their NRCT obligations and form the basis of a good compliance history for exemption purposes. Detailed analysis Introducing a grace period for NRCT Proposed new section 141GC would introduce a 60-day grace period for a payer to meet or correct their NRCT obligations where:  the payer makes a schedular payment to a non-resident contractor, and  at the time the payment was made it was not clear that withholding would be required (for example, where the payer intended to rely on the 92-day threshold), 51  some, or all, of the tax is underpaid at the tax due date, and  the payer can demonstrate they have taken reasonable steps in relation to the tax obligations for the schedular payment. The grace period would run from the earliest of the date of the breach and the date on which the employer could reasonably foresee a breach will occur. Introducing this flexibility is intended to allow underpayments of NRCT to be remedied without attracting penalties or interest, provided the payer can demonstrate they have made reasonable enquiries or took reasonable steps to confirm the thresholds would not be exceeded. If this correction is not made within the 60 days, normal procedures would apply. Introducing a nominated taxpayer approach to NRCT A non-resident contractor may be liable to pay income tax relating to its contract activities in New Zealand, or be obliged to undertake certain tax obligations, such as withholding pay as you earn from employee earnings. Some business models would benefit from streamlining the management of their tax obligations, for example, where a non-resident contractor creates separate project entities for each contract undertaken. Proposed new section 24HB would confirm that a ‘nominated taxpayer’ may meet a non-resident contractor’s New Zealand tax obligations. The intention is to simplify the process of meeting NRCT obligations, particularly where delivery of a project involves multiple parties, or where a non-resident contractor uses different businesses for separate contracts. The proposed new section would clarify that the nominated taxpayer would:  be permitted to discharge the non-resident contractor’s obligations on its behalf, and  provide a compliance history for the purposes of obtaining an NRCT exemption under section RD 24 of the ITA (see the item “Exemptions for withholding NRCT” later in this Commentary). Each person in the arrangement would be jointly and severally liable for the amount of tax. 52 SCHEDULAR PAYMENTS TO NON-RESIDENT CONTRACTORS – WITHHOLDING THRESHOLDS Clause 90 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would change the interpretation of the schedular payment withholding thresholds as they apply to payments made to non-resident contractors from an ‘all circumstances’ view (considering all the non-resident contractor’s activity in New Zealand) to a ‘single payer’ view (considering matters only related to the contract with the payer). Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background Payers are not required to withhold non-resident contractor’s tax (NRCT) if the payment is exempt under either of two schedular payment thresholds: the 92 days of presence rule (section RD 8(1)(b)(v) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA)) or the $15,000 de minimis rule (section RD 8(1)(b)(vi)). Under the current ‘all circumstances’ view, the payer is required to consider matters unrelated to the contract payment, including:  days of presence unrelated to the contract (for example, holidays), or  contract payments made to the contractor for all contract activities or services in New Zealand by other payers, that may be completely unrelated to that payer. This imposes an excessive compliance burden on the payer and may be difficult to apply in practice. Key features The proposed amendments would modify how a payer considers the thresholds from an ‘all circumstances’ view to a ‘single payer’ view. This would mean the payer only had to consider the thresholds relating to their contract or contracts with the non- resident contractor. Detailed analysis The proposed amendments to section RD 8 would modify the threshold tests to require the payer to consider the tests in relation to their contract (or contracts if more than one in a 12-month period), with the non-resident contractor only. This means, when applying the NRCT thresholds, the payer would be required to consider:  For the 92-day test: the days on which the non-resident contractor is in New Zealand to perform the duties for the contract (from their arrival to their departure after completion of the contract). This would include weekends and holidays during the period of the contract but exclude days on which the contractor is present in New Zealand for purposes unrelated to the contract.  For the $15,000 test: the payments made to the contractor or another person on their behalf that are related to the contract. 53 For these thresholds, the payer’s assessment of the relevant threshold in relation to their contract with a non-resident contractor may include a payment made to that contractor by an associated person or, for a consolidated group, a payment made to a member of the group of companies. These proposed changes would be supported by a new reporting requirement that would enable monitoring of the thresholds by Inland Revenue (see the item “Reporting requirements for payers of NRCT” later in this Commentary). 54 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PAYERS OF NRCT Clauses 143 and 182 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would introduce a reporting requirement for payers of non-resident contractor’s tax (NRCT). Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background Payers of NRCT are not currently required to provide information to Inland Revenue about payments to non-resident contractors. This puts the burden of correct assessment and policing of the NRCT thresholds on the payer and creates an information imbalance between payers of NRCT, non-resident contractors and Inland Revenue. The Bill proposes modifying the schedular payment thresholds to a ‘single payer’ view (see the item “Schedular payments to non-resident contractors: withholding thresholds” earlier in this Commentary). This would introduce an integrity risk. Without reporting, Inland Revenue would be unable to police the rules and would be unaware of whether NRCT had been correctly withheld from contract payments. Reporting will assist Inland Revenue to identify the non-resident contractor and monitor the thresholds and exemptions. Currently, where tax has not been withheld, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may seek the tax due from the payer or the non- resident contractor. 5 Reporting will better enable Inland Revenue to seek New Zealand tax due from the non-resident contractor. Key features Proposed new section 23R of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would introduce a reporting requirement for persons who make a schedular payment to or on behalf of a non-resident contractor. Payers of NRCT would have to provide the information set out in proposed new schedule 6B, which is as follows:  The names of the payer and payee  The date on which the schedular payment is made  Whether the schedular payment is paid during a grace period  The contact addresses 6 of the payer and payee, whether in NZ or otherwise  The tax file number of the payee, or their foreign tax identification number  The gross amount of the schedular payment  The amount of tax withheld from the schedular payment 5 Interpretation Statement (IS 10/04) Non-Resident Contractor Schedular Payments 6 Under section 14G of the Tax Administration Act 1994, contact addresses include postal, email and electronic addresses. 55  Whether an exemption applies in relation to the schedular payment  Whether a threshold applies in relation to the schedular payment  The start and end dates of the contract under which the schedular payment is made. Payers would be required to provide this information monthly, on the 15 th day following the end of each calendar month. 56 EXEMPTIONS FOR WITHOLDING NRCT Clauses 92, 144 and 145 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would improve the flexibility of non-resident contractor’s tax (NRCT) exemptions by  enabling exemptions to have retroactive effect  enabling an associated New Zealand entity to establish good compliance history for a non-resident contactor, and  repealing the NRCT bond provision. Effective da te The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background An exemption from withholding NRCT can be obtained under section RD 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) if the NRCT thresholds do not apply. Exemptions are available if one or more of the following conditions are met:  the amount of the payment is not assessable income,  the contractor provides a bond or other security for the income tax payable on the amount, or  the contractor has a ‘good compliance history’ in the previous 24 months that is expected to continue. If an exemption is granted, this is notified by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 24H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Detailed analysis Enabling NRCT exemptions to have retroactive effect The proposed amendment to section 24H of the TAA would allow exemptions from withholding NRCT to have retroactive effect. This would mean that if the exemption is issued after the date of the first contract payment, the exemption can cover payments made before its issue date. This retroactive period would be limited to the 92 days before the person applied for the exemption. Enabling associated New Zealand entities to form a basis for good compliance history A non-resident contractor with no prior presence in New Zealand cannot establish a ‘good compliance history’ for the purpose of obtaining an exemption. This approach does not work well for all business models. For example, where separate project entities are created for each contract undertaken, each new entity cannot establish two years of good compliance history even though an associated entity may have a presence in New Zealand. Using the nominated taxpayer approach (see the item “Flexible NRCT payment arrangements” earlier in this Commentary), proposed new section 24HB of the TAA would enable an associated New Zealand entity to establish a good compliance history 57 for the purpose of obtaining exemption certificates for associated non-resident contractors. Repeal of the NRCT employee bond provision The NRCT rules provide that a non-resident contractor may apply for an exemption certificate on the basis that they have provided a bond or other security for the income tax payable for a contract payment. This provision is rarely used in practice. A more flexible approach to the NRCT rules means that this exemption would no longer be required, and it is therefore proposed to repeal section RD 24(1)(b) of the ITA. 58 EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS TO FOREIGN SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES Clauses 25, 26, 89, 181(2) and (3) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would make employer contributions to foreign superannuation schemes subject to tax under PAYE, rather than fringe benefit tax (FBT). Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background Currently, under section CX 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ( ITA), a fringe benefit arises when an employer contributes to a superannuation scheme for the benefit of an employee. The contribution is generally taxed under FBT rules unless it qualifies as an ‘employer’s superannuation cash contribution’. 7 A fringe benefit also arises under section CX 14 when an employer contributes to a sickness, accident, or death benefit fund for an employee. It is common for cross-border employees and their employers to contribute to a superannuation scheme established in the country of origin. The employee may not receive any other benefits that would be subject to FBT. As such, FBT treatment creates compliance costs in filing FBT returns that might not otherwise be required. Key features The proposed amendments would ensure employer contributions to a foreign superannuation scheme would be subject to PAYE as salary or wages, rather than FBT. This would include contributions to sickness, accident, or death benefit funds within the foreign superannuation scheme. 7 Employer’s superannuation cash contributions are contributions paid in money either to a superannuation fund or under the KiwiSaver Act 2006. These contributions are taxed under ESCT as per section RD 65 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 59 FBT OBLIGATIONS AND ‘TRAILING PAYMENTS’ Clause 28 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would clarify that payments to an employee for services provided in New Zealand that are made after the employee has ceased to live and/or work in New Zealand should not trigger a fringe benefit tax (FBT) liability except to the extent the benefits relate to the time spent working in New Zealand. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background Fringe benefits, such as health insurance or a vehicle, may be provided by an employer to their employees. Currently, section CX 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ensures any fringe benefits provided to an employee in a quarter or income year are subject to FBT if the employee receives a taxable PAYE income payment in that quarter or income year. If no taxable PAYE income payment is derived, the benefits received by the employee are not fringe benefits and no FBT is payable by the employer. Some employees will receive a payment, such as a cash bonus relating to their time working in New Zealand, after they have ceased to work here or to be a New Zealand tax resident. These are known as trailing payments and are, correctly, taxable PAYE income payments in New Zealand. However, trailing payments can pose a problem where employees receive fringe benefits abroad. This is because New Zealand tax obligations can be triggered on any fringe benefits provided at the time the trailing payment arises. This can include fringe benefits provided abroad and unrelated to time spent working in New Zealand. Such an outcome is contrary to the policy intent. Detailed analysis The proposed amendment to section CX 26 would resolve the unintended FBT consequences of receiving a trailing payment. The proposed change would clarify that benefits received by an employee after they have ceased to work in New Zealand and/or ceased New Zealand tax residence are only fringe benefits and subject to FBT to the extent the benefits relate to a period of work in New Zealand. Consistent with policy intent, the trailing payment itself remains a PAYE income payment. 60 CLARIFYING THE STATUS OF NON-RESIDENT ENTERTAINERS Clause 98(11) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would change the definition of “non-resident contractor” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) to exclude a “non-resident entertainer” and thereby clarify the provisions that apply to non-resident entertainers. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background Schedular payments, such as those received by non-resident entertainers, are usually subject to withholding tax. Schedule 4 of the ITA provides the withholding rates for schedular payments. Sections RD 8(1)(b)(v) and (vi) of the ITA exclude payments to non-resident contractors from the meaning of a “schedular payment” if they meet certain day-count or monetary thresholds. Interpretation Statement IS 10/04 Non-resident contractor schedular payments outlines that, while the term “non-resident contractor” is broad enough to include a “non-resident entertainer”, these two categories should be considered separately. This is because, under both domestic law and tax treaties, non-resident entertainers are provided a different tax treatment to non-resident contractors. This ambiguity around the breadth of the term “non-resident contractor” can lead to confusion and could mean that:  the applicable withholding rate in schedule 4 of the ITA is not immediately apparent, and  non-resident entertainers could be incorrectly viewed as entitled to the exclusions from withholding for non-resident contractors in sections RD 8(1)(b)(v) and (vi) of the ITA. The proposed amendment would remove this confusion and clarify the position of non- resident entertainers. 61 Dual resident companies 63 DUAL RESIDENT COMPANIES – LOSS GROUPING, CONSOLIDATION, AND IMPUTATION CREDIT RULES Clauses 63, 64, 77, 78, 79, 81, 83, 98(2) and (9) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would allow dual resident companies to be eligible to offset income tax losses against the profits of other group companies, be a member of a consolidated group and retain their imputation credit account (ICA) balance. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 15 March 2017. This would ensure New Zealand companies affected by the change to Australia’s corporate tax residence rules have uninterrupted access to certain New Zealand tax regimes. Background In March 2019, in response to an Australian High Court judgment, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) issued new technical interpretations of Australia’s corporate tax residence rules. In particular, new guidance was provided on how to apply the central management and control (CMAC) test, a key element for determining whether a company has tax residence in Australia. The revised view of the CMAC test was retrospectively applied from 15 March 2017, although the ATO has adopted a transitional compliance approach where it is not currently applying resources to review the residence status of companies in certain situations. This new interpretation effectively meant that companies with Australian directors could now be Australian tax resident, even if the company’s commercial activities are carried on outside Australia. This change may affect New Zealand companies with Australian-based directors, potentially making them tax resident in both countries (referred to as being “dual resident”). As part of the October 2020 Federal Budget, the previous Australian Government announced that it intended to enact retrospective legislation to effectively return the CMAC test back to its original interpretation. This legislation has not yet been enacted. Under New Zealand’s tax rules, there are several beneficial tax regimes that do not ordinarily apply to dual resident companies. There is an opportunity to amend the eligibility requirements of certain beneficial tax regimes to include dual resident companies, while maintaining the integrity of the underlying rules. Key features The proposed amendments would allow companies that are dual resident to offset their tax losses against the profits of another company in the same group. The amendments would also allow a dual resident company to be a member of a consolidated group of companies for income tax purposes. This includes where the company’s residence tie-breaks to another country under a double tax agreement (a DTA non-resident company). The proposed amendments would also allow companies that change their tax residence from New Zealand to Australia, or vice versa, to automatically retain their accumulated ICA balance. 64 Detailed analysis Three New Zealand tax regimes have been identified where changes should be made to resolve concerns with the application of Australia’s residence rules while maintaining the integrity of the underlying regimes. Loss grouping rules The proposed amendments would amend the residence requirements of the loss grouping rules so that a dual resident company can use the loss grouping rules. These requirements were originally implemented to prevent “double dipping” of expenditure (that is, claiming a deduction in more than one country for the same expense). This integrity issue is now addressed by the hybrids and branch mismatch rules, which means the residence requirement in the loss grouping rules is no longer required. The proposed amendments would repeal section IC 7(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. This section requires that a New Zealand resident company must not be either a DTA non-resident company or liable for tax in another jurisdiction for the duration of the commonality period. The repeal of the residence requirements in section IC 7(2) would mean a company that is both New Zealand tax resident and tax resident in another jurisdiction would be able to offset its losses against the profits of another company in the same group of companies for New Zealand tax purposes. This is provided the company still satisfies the other requirements, including that it is either incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on a business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Commonality periods starting before 15 March 2017 The loss grouping rules require a “loss” company and a “profit” company to maintain a common ownership (common voting and market interests of at least 66%) over a period. The commonality period encompasses the commencement of the income year in which the loss company incurs the loss to the end of the income year in which the loss is used by the profit company. The Bill proposes introducing new sections IC 5(8) and IZ 7B to ensure that the existing residence requirements are applied to commonality periods that begin before 15 March 2017 where the tax losses arose in a tax year after the 1990–91 tax year. This would mean that for calculating a commonality period that began before 15 March 2017 and continued after 15 March 2017 (for losses incurred after the 1990–91 tax year), the existing residence requirements in section IC 7(2) would only apply up to 15 March 2017 and cease thereafter. Consequently, to offset a tax loss that arose before 15 March 2017, either of the two companies may still be dual resident, provided that the period of dual residence started after 15 March 2017. Example 12: Loss grouping rules after 15 March 2017 A New Zealand resident company, ABC Limited, is tax resident in both New Zealand and Australia. In the 2021–22 income year, ABC Limited has a net loss of $100,000. ABC Limited has common voting and market interests of 75% with DEF Limited, a New Zealand resident company. For the 2022–23 income year, ABC Limited had net income of $0, with carried forward losses from the previous year of $100,000, and DEF Limited had net income of $100,000. ABC Limited wishes to make available its accumulated tax loss of $100,000 to DEF Limited. ABC Limited elects to transfer its accumulated tax loss to DEF Limited. 65 While ABC Limited is a dual resident company, under the proposed amendments the residence requirements would not apply from 15 March 2017, and therefore, the tax loss could be transferred from ABC Limited to DEF Limited. Example 13: Commonality period that began before 15 March 2017 Since the 2014 income year, a New Zealand resident company, Rose’s Flowers Limited, has had common voting and market interests of 80% with Zoë’s Pots Limited. In the 2016 income year, Rose’s Flowers Limited incurs a net loss of $50,000. In 2019, Rose’s Flowers Limited becomes tax resident in Australia, as well as New Zealand. In 2019, Zoë’s Pots Limited has net income of $50,000 and Rose’s Flowers Limited has net income of $0. Rose’s Flowers Limited wishes to make available its accumulated tax loss of $50,000 to Zoë’s Pots Limited. While Rose’s Flowers Limited is a dual resident company, under the proposed amendments the residence requirements would not apply after 15 March 2017. For the purposes of the commonality period, as long as the residence requirements were maintained up to 15 March 2017, then Rose’s Flowers Limited (as the “loss” company) would be able to be a dual resident company after 15 March 2017, even if the tax loss arose before 15 March 2017. Therefore, Rose’s Flowers Limited could offset its $50,000 tax loss against Zoë’s Pots Limited’s net income. However, if Rose’s Flowers Limited had become dual resident in 2016 instead, then it would not be able to offset that loss. Consequential amendments Consequential amendments to sections IC 5(1)(b) and LK 1 are required because section IC 7 no longer includes a residence requirement. Consolidation rules The proposed amendments would amend the tax residence requirements for the consolidation rules to enable a dual resident company to be a member of a consolidated group of companies. Similar to the residence requirements in the loss offset rules, these requirements were implemented to prevent “double dipping” of expenditure. This integrity issue is now addressed by the hybrids and branch mismatch rules, which means the residence requirement in the consolidation rules is no longer required. The proposed amendments would repeal the residence requirements in sections FM 31(1)(b) and (e) that currently require that a company is not a foreign company or liable for income tax in another jurisdiction through domicile, residence, or place of incorporation. This would mean a company that is both a New Zealand tax resident and tax resident in another jurisdiction would be able to be a member of a consolidated group of companies. 66 Example 14: Consolidation rules after 15 March 2017 Since its incorporation on 1 April 2010, GB Limited has been tax resident in New Zealand and a member of a consolidated group for income tax purposes. On 1 August 2018, GB Limited became resident in Australia under Australian tax law. While GB Limited is now a dual resident company, under the proposed amendments the requirements in section FM 31(1)(b) and (e) would no longer apply from 15 March 2017. Consequently, GB Limited could continue to be a member of the New Zealand consolidated group after becoming Australian tax resident on 1 August 2018. ICAs A New Zealand resident company is required to maintain an ICA. An Australian resident company can also choose to maintain an ICA, but it cannot do so until it makes an election to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This requirement can result in a New Zealand resident company losing its ICA credit balance if it becomes Australian tax resident before making the relevant election. The proposed amendments would automatically make a New Zealand resident company an Australian ICA company when its residence tie-breaks to Australia under the Australia/New Zealand double tax agreement (the DTA). That is, in these circumstances, the DTA non-resident company would not be required to follow the election process currently set out in section OB 2. At the time when the company becomes an Australian ICA company because of the residence tie-break test under the DTA, the company would continue to be required to maintain an ICA. Proposed section OB 2(3B) would ensure that the company’s ICA balance, at the point of becoming an Australian ICA company, is preserved and consequently any accumulated imputation credits up until the point of becoming an Australian ICA company are retained. It is appropriate in this instance for these credits to be retained and available for use in the future. This is because the same shareholders would own the company before and after the company has become a DTA non-resident company with Australia, meaning they bore the economic cost of the tax that generated the imputation credits. This is consistent with the overall approach of allowing both New Zealand and Australian tax resident companies to maintain an ICA. The proposed amendments would also allow an Australian ICA company to preserve its ICA balance if the company’s residence was to revert to New Zealand. These amendments would not apply where a New Zealand resident company becomes tax resident in any country other than Australia. Definitions in YA 1 The relevant definitions in section YA 1 would be amended as follows:  “Australian ICA company” would include where a New Zealand resident company becomes an Australian ICA company because it has become Australian tax resident under the DTA.  “ICA company” would no longer refer to an election being made for an Australian ICA company to be an ICA company. 67 Example 15: Company becomes an Australian ICA company after 15 March 2017 Southern Crux Limited was incorporated in New Zealand on 1 February 2000. From 1 April 2019, directors of Southern Crux Limited started to exercise control of the company while in Australia and the company became Australian resident under Australian tax law. While Southern Crux Limited is resident in both New Zealand and Australia under their respective tax laws, under the Australia/New Zealand DTA the company is treated as being solely resident in Australia. Under the proposed amendments, this change in residence would mean Southern Crux Limited automatically became an Australia ICA company and would continue to be required to maintain an ICA. The company’s pre-existing ICA balance from when it was an ICA company would be carried forward. Imputation groups The proposed amendments include a consequential change to the eligibility rules for imputation groups in section FN 4(1)(d). This change would retain the eligibility of an Australian ICA company to be a member of an imputation group but remove the requirement for the company to have elected to be an Australian ICA company. 68 DUAL RESIDENT COMPANIES – INTEGRITY ISSUES WITH DIVIDENDS AND CORPORATE MIGRATION RULES Clauses 10, 11, 13, 15, 22, 47, 60 to 62, 84, 85, 87, 95 to 97, 98(7), (8) and (19), 139(2) and 146 to 148 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments seek to address integrity issues involving New Zealand resident companies where the residence tie-breaks to another country under a double tax agreement. In particular, the proposed amendments would:  remove the exemption in section CW 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA) (the domestic dividend exemption) for certain dividends paid to New Zealand resident companies whose residence tie-breaks to another country under a double tax agreement (DTA), and  extend the rules in subpart FL of the ITA (the corporate migration rules) to certain companies whose residence tie-breaks from New Zealand to another country under a DTA. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 30 August 2022. Background Integrity issues have been identified regarding the domestic dividend exemption and the corporate migration rules. These issues give rise to situations where companies may derive income or pay dividends without the anticipated New Zealand income taxation by changing their tax residence and obtaining tax relief under a DTA. Domestic dividend exemption In general, a dividend paid between members of a wholly owned group of New Zealand resident companies is exempt income under section CW 10 of the ITA. This domestic dividend exemption currently applies to dividends paid to a New Zealand resident company that is also resident overseas under the tax laws of another country (referred to as a “dual resident company”), including where the company’s residence tie -breaks to another country under a DTA (a DTA non-resident company). In some cases, a DTA may prevent the application of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) when a dividend is paid by a DTA non-resident company to a non-resident. This is because the dividend is treated as being paid between two non-New Zealand residents under the DTA. Corporate migration rules The corporate migration rules in subpart FL of the ITA apply when a company ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident, and they result in a deemed liquidation, disposal of assets and distribution to shareholders for tax purposes. This process can give rise to an income tax or NRWT liability for the emigrating company. However, the corporate migration rules do not apply when a New Zealand resident company becomes a DTA non-resident company. This can result in New Zealand losing taxing rights on income and distributions made to non-residents due to the application of a DTA, even though there has not been a change in the company’s tax residence 69 under domestic law. This significantly undermines the effect of the corporate migration rules. The combination of the domestic dividend exemption and the corporate migration rules, with the tax relief provided by DTAs to DTA non-resident companies, creates potential opportunities for foreign-soured income to go untaxed in New Zealand and for dividends to be paid to non-residents without the application of NRWT. Detailed analysis Dividends paid to DTA non-resident companies The proposed amendments would remove the domestic dividend exemption for certain dividends paid to a DTA non-resident company and would require NRWT to be withheld. A two-year period is provided for the dividend payer to meet this NRWT obligation. However, if the DTA non-resident company becomes New Zealand tax resident for the purposes of applying the relevant DTA during this period, and the company does not pay a dividend, the dividend would again be treated as exempt and there would be no NRWT obligation. Changes to the domestic dividend exemption The scope of the domestic dividend exemption would be reduced so that it no longer exempts certain dividends paid to a DTA non-resident company. However, to ensure the new rules are targeted towards the dividends of greatest concern, the proposed limitation to the domestic dividend exemption would not apply in any of the following circumstances (see proposed new section CW 10(1)(f)(i) to (iii) of the ITA):  Where all shareholders of the dividend recipient would be entitled to a full exemption from NRWT under an applicable DTA if they received a dividend from the dividend recipient (that is, if a dividend was on-paid to the shareholders) and the recipient was treated as a company that was not a foreign company (as defined in section YA 1 of the ITA).  Where the total dividends received by the recipient from the payer is less than $1 million in each 12-month period that includes the date the recipient derives the dividend.  If, within a two-year period of the dividend recipient receiving the dividend, the company’s tax residence changes so that it is no longer a “foreign company” and it has not paid a dividend while it was a foreign company. The first bullet point acknowledges that there is no risk to the New Zealand tax base (that is, no NRWT would be payable) if the dividend-receiving company immediately on -paid the dividend to its own shareholders, assuming the company was not a foreign company at the time and its shareholders would have qualified for full tax relief under a DTA. The second bullet point is a de minimis rule and will reduce the impact of the changes on smaller businesses. The third bullet point seeks to address a situation where the dividend recipient’s residence only temporarily tie-breaks to another jurisdiction under a DTA (for example, due to a change in application of another country’s tax laws). This is achieved by providing a two-year period for the tax residence of the dividend recipient to be changed back to New Zealand. However, it is only applicable if the dividend recipient does not pay a dividend while being a DTA non-resident company, as a 70 dividend paid during that time to the DTA non-resident company and on-paid could be completely relieved from NRWT due to the application of a DTA. It is envisaged that the various limitations noted above would mean the majority of dividends paid between New Zealand resident companies within a wholly-owned group of companies would continue to be entitled to the exemption in section CW 10 of the ITA. In addition, proposed new section CW 10(1B) of the ITA would provide that the domestic dividend exemption would also generally be available to the extent a dividend is fully imputed. This acknowledges that fully imputed dividends paid by a wholly-owned New Zealand tax resident company to its non-resident parent company would generally have NRWT applied at a rate of 0% (under section RF 11B of the ITA). Example 16: DTA relief NZ Limited is a New Zealand tax resident company and is wholly owned by DR Limited. DR Limited is resident in New Zealand and Australia under their respective tax laws. DR Limited’s residence tie-breaks to Australia under the Australia/New Zealand DTA. DR Limited is wholly owned by AUS Limited, an Australian tax resident company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. AUS Limited has held the shares in DR Limited for more than 10 years. On 30 June 2023, NZ Limited pays an unimputed dividend of $2 million to DR Limited. The dividend paid to DR Limited would meet the requirements of proposed new section CW 10(1)(f)(i) of the ITA as:  the shareholder of DR Limited, AUS Limited, is tax resident in Australia, and  assuming DR limited was New Zealand tax resident for the purposes of applying the Australia/New Zealand DTA, a dividend it paid to AUS Limited would not be taxable in New Zealand due to article 10(3) of the Australia/New Zealand DTA. Example 17: Fully imputed dividend Bob’s Books Limited is a New Zealand tax resident company. It is wholly owned by Pete’s Publishing Limited, which is tax resident in both New Zealand and Australia. Under the Australia/New Zealand DTA, Pete’s Publishing Limited is treated as being tax resident in Australia. On 1 July 2024, Bob’s Books Limited pays a fully imputed dividend consisting of cash of $1,080,000 and imputation credits of $420,000. Because the dividend is fully imputed, as calculated under section RF 9 of the ITA, the dividend would meet the requirements of proposed new section CW 10(1B) of the ITA. Assuming the other relevant criteria are satisfied, the dividend would be exempt under the proposed amendments to section CW 10 of the ITA. 71 Example 18: Partially imputed dividend Assume the same facts as in example 17. On 31 May 2025, Bob’s Books Limited pays a net dividend of $1.44 million and attaches imputation credits of $280,000. Applying the formula in section RF 9 of the ITA, $720,000 of the net dividend would be treated as being fully imputed for the purposes of proposed new section CW 10(1B) of the ITA. The remaining $720,000 of the net dividend would not meet the requirements of proposed section CW 10(1B) of the ITA. Accordingly that $720,000 may be subject to NRWT under the proposed amendments. Dividend rules As noted above, the proposed changes would provide taxpayers with the opportunity to correct their tax residence within two years to ensure the domestic dividend exemption applied. To cater for this, it is proposed that a two-year deferral of income would be applied to those dividends within the scope of the proposed changes to the domestic dividend exemption. Proposed new section CD 1(3) of the ITA would modify the income year that a dividend is allocated to if it is derived by a New Zealand resident company that is treated as not being resident in New Zealand under a DTA, and the requirements of sections CW 10(1)(b) to (d), (5), and (6) of the ITA are met. This income is deferred to the “DRCD 8 deferral date”, which is defined in proposed new section RA 6(2) of the ITA as the second anniversary of the date on which the dividend was paid. NRWT obligations for dividends A dividend paid to a DTA non-resident company is equivalent in some respects to a dividend being paid to a non-resident company. This is because, once a dividend is paid to a DTA non-resident company, New Zealand may lose its right to tax the on- payment of that dividend to another company. For this reason, it is considered appropriate for the NRWT rules to apply to a dividend paid to a DTA non-resident company. The NRWT obligation would apply on the DRCD deferral date under proposed new section RA 6(5) of the ITA. To ensure a dividend paid to a DTA non-resident company would be subject to the NRWT rules, proposed new section RF 2(1)(b) of the ITA would expand the definition of “non-resident passive income” to include any dividend, other than an investment society dividend, having a source in New Zealand that is derived by DTA non-resident company. However, if the dividend was exempt income, proposed new section RF 2(2BA) of the ITA would exclude the dividend from being non-resident passive income. 8 Dual Resident Company Dividend. 72 Example 19: No NRWT obligation due to a change in tax residence Jolly Jandals Limited is a New Zealand resident company. It is wholly owned by Aussie Thongs Limited, which is tax resident in both New Zealand and Australia. Aussie Thongs Limited’s tax residence tie-breaks to Australia under the Australia/New Zealand DTA. On 1 July 2023, Jolly Jandals Limited pays an unimputed dividend of $3 million to Aussie Thongs Limited. From 1 May 2025, there is a change in the way that control of Aussie Thongs Limited is exercised, resulting in the company becoming New Zealand tax resident under the Australia/New Zealand DTA. Aussie Thongs Limited has not paid a dividend since it received the dividend from Jolly Jandals Limited on 1 July 2023. In this situation, the dividend paid by Jolly Jandals Limited would qualify for the revised domestic dividend exemption in proposed new section CW 10 of the ITA. This is due to Aussie Thongs Limited becoming New Zealand resident under the Australia/New Zealand DTA within two years of receiving the dividend from Jolly Jandals Limited and not having paid a dividend itself since the receipt of the dividend. As a result, the dividend from Jolly Jandals Limited would not be subject to NRWT. Consequential amendments The Bill also proposes a number of consequential amendments that would:  update references in sections RF 2C and RF 12G of the ITA as a result of changes to section RF 2  insert the relevant definitions in section YA 1 of the ITA  insert a definition of “DRCD deferral date” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), and  amend sections 25G and 29 of the TAA to reflect that a dividend paid under proposed new section CD 1(3) is paid on the DRCD deferral date. Corporate migration rules New Zealand’s corporate migration tax rules ensure that companies that migrate their tax residence from New Zealand (and therefore cease being tax resident under New Zealand’s domestic law) pay tax on all their worldwide income earned while tax resident in New Zealand. These rules reflect the inability for New Zealand to tax companies in certain situations once they become a DTA non-resident company. However, similar issues arise for New Zealand tax resident companies if they become non-resident for the purposes of applying a DTA. For example, where a DTA non- resident company pays a dividend to a non-resident, that dividend may be relieved from New Zealand taxation in some instances due to the application of a DTA. Similarly, a DTA can relieve a DTA non-resident company from taxation on certain types of income (such as income from sources outside New Zealand). As the economic effects are very similar to a company ceasing being tax resident under New Zealand’s domestic law, it is proposed that the corporate migration rules would be triggered immediately before a New Zealand tax resident company becomes a DTA non-resident company in the situation where it pays a dividend or obtains relief from taxation of income under a DTA. 73 It is therefore proposed to amend the corporate migration rules in certain situations where a New Zealand resident company becomes a DTA non-resident company. New section FL 3 The Bill proposes inserting new section FL 3 of the ITA into the corporate migration rules. The purpose of proposed new section FL 3 is to bring into scope those companies that are still tax resident under domestic law but to which New Zealand loses taxing rights because of a residence tie-break test in a DTA. Proposed new section FL 3 would apply to treat a New Zealand tax resident company as migrating from New Zealand immediately before it becomes a DTA non-resident company on or after 30 August 2022 where one of the following events (known as a “triggering event”) occurs:  the company derives income that is eligible for relief under a DTA while it is a DTA non-resident company  the company pays a dividend that is not fully imputed while it is a DTA non- resident company  the company becomes non-resident, or  the company has been treated as a DTA non-resident company for the previous two years. Deferring the application of the corporate migration rules for up to two years would provide an opportunity for taxpayers to remedy any inadvertent residence changes. If a DTA non-resident company’s residence reverts to being New Zealand resident for the purposes of applying the relevant DTA and none of the triggering events listed in proposed section FL 3(1) have occurred, then proposed new section FL 3 would not apply to the company. Under proposed section FL 3(2), when one of the triggering events occurs, the DTA non-resident company would be treated as disposing its assets and making a distribution to its shareholders immediately before it became a DTA non-resident company. Proposed section FL 3(3) would treat each shareholder of the DTA non- resident company as being paid a dividend equivalent to the amount they would be entitled to if the company was treated as going into liquidation. These proposed provisions would ensure that New Zealand can tax the accumulated income and gains of the company before it becomes a DTA non-resident company and a DTA restricts or removes those taxing rights. Example 20: Company continues to be non-resident under a DTA after two years Cloudy Cloud Limited is a New Zealand resident company that provides IT cloud storage services. On 1 October 2023, several directors of Cloudy Cloud Limited relocated to the United Kingdom to investigate potential new markets and commercial partners. It was anticipated that this project would take up to nine months. On 1 May 2025, as part of the general tax residence compliance checks, tax advisors of Cloudy Cloud Limited discovered the directors had continued to reside in the UK and continued to exercise control of the company while in the UK. The directors made the decision to remain in the UK for the foreseeable future. 74 The directors exercising control of Cloudy Cloud Limited while in the UK resulted in the company becoming UK resident under UK domestic law from 1 October 2023. Application of the residence tie-breaker test in the New Zealand/UK DTA results in Cloudy Cloud Limited being treated as UK resident for DTA purposes from 1 October 2023. On 1 October 2025, the directors were still residing in the UK and exercising control of Cloudy Cloud Limited from the UK. Therefore, on 1 October 2025, Cloudy Cloud Limited would have been treated under a DTA as not being New Zealand resident for a continuous period of two years. Under the proposed amendments, assuming no other triggering event in proposed section FL 3(1) has occurred, section FL 3(1)(d) would apply, and Cloudy Cloud Limited would be treated as migrating immediately before becoming a DTA non-resident company. Example 21: Company pays a dividend Valleys Limited is a company that is tax resident in both New Zealand and Japan. On 1 May 2023, Valleys Limited becomes treated as Japanese resident under the Japan/New Zealand DTA. On 1 August 2023, Valleys Limited pays a $5 million unimputed dividend to its shareholder, Japan Holdco. Japan Holdco is tax resident in Japan. Due to a change in the location from which control of the company is exercised, Valleys Limited is treated as being resident in New Zealand under the Japan/New Zealand DTA from 1 April 2025. Although the tax residence of Valleys Limited has reverted to New Zealand within two years of becoming non-resident under a DTA, Valleys Limited paid a dividend while it was a DTA non-resident company. The payment of a dividend on 1 August 2023 by Valleys Limited would be a triggering event for the purposes of proposed section FL 3(1), and Valleys Limited would be treated as migrating immediately before it became a DTA non-resident company under the proposed amendments. Example 22: Company derives income that is subject to relief under a DTA Trash Limited is a New Zealand tax resident company. It undertakes operations in the waste and recycling industry in both New Zealand and Austria. On 28 January 2024, Trash Limited ceases its activities in New Zealand. On 15 October 2024, due to a change in the place from where the central management and control takes place, Trash Limited becomes tax resident in Austria. Under the Austria/New Zealand DTA, Trash Limited is treated as being resident in Austria from 15 October 2024. On 18 December 2024, Trash Limited sells its New Zealand and Austrian assets to a third party. 75 Some of the assets disposed of by Trash Limited are not connected with a New Zealand permanent establishment for the purposes of the Austria/New Zealand DTA. As a result of Trash Limited not being New Zealand resident for the purposes of the Austria/New Zealand DTA, some of the income derived from disposing of the assets is relieved from New Zealand tax under the Austria/New Zealand DTA. The derivation of income on 18 December 2024 that is relieved from tax due to a DTA would be a triggering event for the purposes of proposed section FL 3(1)(a), and Trash Limited would be treated as migrating immediately before it became a DTA non-resident company under the proposed amendments. The proposed rules would include an income allocation rule for both the company and shareholders. The income derived from a deemed disposal, liquidation and distribution would be allocated to the income year in which the relevant triggering event occurred. The income would still be treated as arising immediately before the change in residence for the purpose of the DTA and New Zealand’s domestic tax law. This would ensure New Zealand can still tax that income under the DTA on the basis that the company was New Zealand resident. Amendments to sections FL 1 and FL 2 Section FL 1(1) of the ITA would be amended to provide that the subpart also applies where a company is treated under a DTA as not being a New Zealand tax resident. Section FL 1(2) would also be amended to include a reference to a triggering event occurring. Section FL 2 of the ITA would also be redrafted, but the substance of the section would remain unchanged. Change in definition of time of emigration The Bill proposes updating the definition of “time of emigration” in section YA 1 of the ITA to include the situation where a New Zealand resident company becomes a DTA non-resident company. Consequential amendments The Bill proposes updating references in sections CD 14, CD 26, CD 43, EE 31, OB 62 and RA 18 of the ITA to include proposed new section FL 3. The Bill also proposes updating sections 25E and 29 of the TAA to include proposed new section FL 3. 77 GST apportionment 79 GST APPORTIONMENT AND ADJUSTMENT RULES Clauses 103(5) to (7), 105(5) to (8), (13), (14), 113, 116(4), (6), (9) to (15), (17), (21), (23), (24), (27) to (29), 117 to 124, 136 and 156 Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes a package of changes to the GST apportionment and adjustment rules that would reduce the compliance costs they impose on businesses and better align them with current taxpayer practices. These changes would include:  introducing a principal purpose test for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive) that would allow a registered person to claim a full GST input tax deduction, and  allowing GST-registered persons to elect to treat certain assets that have mainly private or exempt use, such as dwellings, as if they only had private or exempt use. Effective date Most of the proposed amendments would have effect for goods and services supplied, or adjustment periods beginning, on or after 1 April 2023. The exceptions to this are noted below and explained in more detail in the Detailed analysis:  The proposed amendments to allow GST-registered businesses to elect to treat the supply of certain goods, with mainly private or exempt use, as an exempt supply would generally have effect for supplies made on or after 1 April 2011.  The proposed amendments to the asset value thresholds determining the number of years that post-acquisition adjustments are required would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent.  The proposed amendments to the definition of “actual deduction” in the wash-up calculation in section 21FB of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) and the definition of “percentage actual use” in section 21G would take effect on 30 June 2014.  The proposed amendments to sections 20(3E), (3EB), 21(4) and (4B) of the GST Act to allow Inland Revenue to approve a wider range of apportionment methods would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent.  The proposed repeal of the mixed-use asset rules in sections 20(3JB) and 20G of the GST Act would have effect for a registered person’s first adjustment period beginning on or after 1 April 2024. Background To ensure GST is not a cost on business production, businesses can claim input tax deductions on purchases of goods and services they use in their business. However, where the asset is used both for business and non-taxable use, such as a van delivering packages during the week and used privately in the weekend, the taxpayer can only deduct a percentage of the total input tax deduction. The deduction is based on their estimate of the percentage of business use. This is known as apportionment. Apportionment ensures GST is collected on the asset’s non-taxable use. Once a business has claimed an input tax deduction based on their estimated business use, they are generally required to monitor their actual use of the asset over time. I f 80 the estimate is inaccurate, they must account for this difference in their GST return at the end of each year. 9 This is known as an adjustment or change in use. The current GST apportionment and adjustment rules are complex and impose high compliance costs. For example, the apportionment rules apply to all goods and services acquired by registered persons. This imposes undue compliance costs for low-value assets, such as computers, phones and tools, which often only have a very small or incidental amount of private or exempt use. Also, the current rules can result in large and unexpected GST liabilities. For example, if a registered person disposes of an asset (for example, land or a dwelling) that they have used a small percentage of to make their taxable supplies (for example, as a home office or workshop), the disposal of that asset can be a taxable supply. However, such disposals would often not be taxable supplies if a different ownership structure had been used, for example, owning the asset through a company, partnership or trust that was separate to the registered person using part of the asset in their taxable activity. The proposed changes in the Bill are designed to reduce business compliance costs, better align the rules with current taxpayer practices, and improve fairness between different types of ownership structures. Key features The proposed amendments would make the following changes to the GST apportionment and adjustment rules:  A principal purpose test would be introduced in proposed new sections 20(3CB) and (3CC) of the GST Act for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive) such that a registered person would be able to claim a full GST input tax deduction for such goods or services (rather than applying the apportionment or adjustment rules) provided they were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. No input tax deduction would be able to be claimed for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less that were not acquired principally to make taxable supplies.  Under proposed new section 14(4), GST-registered persons would be able to elect to treat the supply of certain goods as an exempt supply. This would apply to goods not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.  The number of adjustment years that GST-registered persons need to monitor their percentage actual use of assets and make post-acquisition adjustments would be amended to limit the number of adjustments to ten for land and to increase the other asset value thresholds.  The disposal of an asset for which a registered person has previously claimed taxable use would be deemed to be a taxable supply under proposed new sections 5(16) and (16C). In addition, where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers a registered person has increased their non-taxable use of goods or services and then applied the wash-up rule in section 21FB in contemplation of the sale of the goods or services or ceasing their taxable activity, proposed new section 5(16B) would ensure the disposal of the relevant asset would also be deemed by proposed new section 5(16C) to be a taxable supply. 9 Adjustments are not made in certain cases, mainly for assets valued below $5,000. The Bill proposes increasing this to $10,000. 81  The ability to use the wash-up rule in section 21FB would be expanded to enable it to apply when there has been any permanent change in use and to allow it to be applied in the adjustment period in which the change of use occurred.  Remedial amendments would be made to the definition of “percentage actual use” in section 21G and the definition of “actual deduction” in section 21FB.  Amendments to sections 20(3E), (3EB), 21(4) and (4B) would enable Inland Revenue to approve a wider range of apportionment methods that are more practical for GST-registered businesses to apply.  The mixed-use asset rules in sections 20(3JB) and 20G of the GST Act would be repealed, and GST input tax deductions and adjustments would instead be calculated using the same general GST apportionment rules that apply to other assets.  A new information disclosure would be introduced to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to improve Inland Revenue’s ability to monitor and collect GST owing on the sale of assets by a GST-registered business that claimed the taxable use of an asset when they originally acquired the asset. Detailed analysis Principal purpose test for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less The Bill proposes the introduction of new rules in sections 20(3CB) to (3CF) of the GST Act that would allow a registered person to claim a full input tax deduction for a supply of goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less (excluding GST) for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Principal purpose is intended to have the same meaning in proposed new section 20(3CC) as the reference to principal purpose used in the pre-2011 GST Act definition of “input tax”. The principal purpose is the main, primary or fundamental purpose. This does not necessarily equate with more than 50% taxable use. Example 23: Goods acquired for $10,000 or less with a principal purpose of making taxable supplies Phil is a GST-registered contractor who acquires a laptop for $3,000 (plus $450 GST) for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, although he may also use it occasionally for private use. Because the laptop was acquired for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive) and for a principal purpose of making taxable supplies, under the proposed amendments Phil would be able to claim a full input tax deduction for the $450 GST he paid on acquisition in his next GST return. If a supply of goods or services is acquired for $10,000 or less (excluding GST) but not for a principal purpose of making taxable supplies, a registered person would not be able to either claim an input tax deduction for the acquisition of the good or service or apportion input tax for an adjustment period between their taxable and non-taxable use of the good or service. 82 Example 24: Goods acquired for $10,000 or less with mostly private use Amy acquires a car for $9,000 (plus $1,350 GST) that has a principal purpose of private use, but which she may also use occasionally in her business to make taxable supplies (estimated to have 20% taxable use by mileage). Because the car was acquired for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive) and not for a principal purpose of making taxable supplies, under the proposed amendments Amy would not be able to claim an input tax deduction on acquisition or make any subsequent adjustment for the 20% taxable use. The proposed principal purpose test is intended to apply instead of the general apportionment rules. Proposed amendments to sections 20(3C), (3L) and (3LB) would ensure that those sections do not apply if the proposed new sections 20(3CB) and (3CC) apply. Thus, if the good or service was acquired for $10,000 or less (excluding GST), sections 20(3C), (3L) and (3LB), which provide a deduction to the extent that the goods or services are used to make taxable supplies, would no longer apply. If the goods or services are acquired for more than $10,000, then the registered person would continue to apportion input tax on acquisition using sections 20(3C), (3L), (3LB) and (3G) to (3M). This will be based on their intended percentage use for making taxable supplies, with adjustments being made at the end of their adjustment period (balance date) under sections 21 to 21H. If the registered person has agreed an alternative apportionment method with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under sections 20(3E), 20(3EB), 21(4) or 21(4B), they would continue to apply this agreed apportionment method rather than the new principal purpose test. This is because such persons often agree a global apportionment ratio based on their mix of taxable and exempt supplies and this ratio is used for both inputs acquired for less than $10,000 and higher value inputs. In such cases, it would increase compliance costs and change the agreed ratio if they were required to account for inputs below $10,000 using a different method to the method agreed with the Commissioner. The proposed new principal purpose test would be applied at the time a registered pe rson acquired the goods or services. The proposed amendment to section 21(2)(b) would ensure that the registered person would no longer need to monitor the actual use after acquisition, nor make any annual adjustments for goods or services valued at less than $10,000 at the end of their adjustment period (for example, their balance date). The amendment would increase the threshold in section 21(2)(b) from “$5,000 or less” to “$10,000 or less”, ensuring no adjustments would be made for goods or services valued at $10,000 or less. The proposed amendment to section 21(2)(b) would apply to all goods and services valued at $10,000 or less, including those that are not principally used to make taxable supplies. The proposed amendments to sections 20(3C), (3L), (3LB), and 21(2)(b) and inserting sections 20(3CB) to (3CF) to introduce the principal purpose test would have effect for goods and services acquired on or after 1 April 2023. GST-registered persons may elect to treat the supply of certain goods as an exempt supply The Bill proposes inserting new section 14(4) to add to the list of exempt supplies in section 14 of the GST Act. This new provision would allow registered persons to elect to treat the supply of goods that were not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies as exempt. This proposal is intended to align the GST rules with current practices for GST-registered persons who may have some minor use of 83 their goods, such as private dwellings, in the course and furtherance of their taxable activity (that is, their GST-registered business). The proposed exemption would be limited to goods (as opposed to services) as it is intended to be used for tangible assets, such as land, dwellings or vehicles, which are likely to have a minor amount of use in making taxable supplies, rather than intangibles, such as brands or intellectual property, which are likely to have an exclusive or mainly taxable use when acquired by registered persons. Limiting the exemption to goods also clarifies that the goods need to be sold or disposed of for the exemption to apply. Where land or dwellings are provided by way of a lease, the service of providing the lease should be subject to the usual GST rules, rather than affected by the proposed exemption. To qualify as an exempt supply under the proposed rule, the goods would have to satisfy the following requirements outlined in proposed new section 14(4)(a) to (d):  No previous deductions claimed for the goods under section 20(3).  The goods were not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.  The goods were not used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.  The goods were not acquired as zero-rated supplies under sections 11(1)(m) or (mb). No deductions under section 20(3) Proposed section 14(4)(a) would require the registered person making the supply of goods not to have previously claimed a deduction under section 20(3) for the goods they are now supplying. If they have claimed any deductions under section 20(3), the exemption would not apply. The relevant deductions that the registered person may have claimed under section 20(3) could include:  an input tax deduction under section 20(3)(a) or (b) at the time the goods were acquired  a subsequent deduction under section 20(3)(e) after applying the adjustment rules to the goods at the end of the person’s adjustment period, or  deductions under 20(3) for other goods and services that were acquired to make substantial improvements to the goods being supplied under section 14(4). The policy intention is to only consider deductions taken for substantial improvements that have become an integral part of the goods being supplied. The registered person would still be able to satisfy section 14(4)(a) if they claim input tax deductions for overheads or operating costs that do not become an integral part of those goods. Example 25: Dwelling with a minor use in a registered person’s taxable activity Rebecca is a registered person who acquired a dwelling that was not a zero- rated supply when it was acquired. She did not claim deductions under section 20(3) for the cost of acquiring the dwelling or of any subsequent capital improvements to the dwelling. Although part of the dwelling is used to run Rebecca’s taxable activity of farming, t he dwelling’s principal purpose is a private residence. Rebecca claimed input tax deductions for certain overheads and operating costs, such as insurance, utilities and local authority rates, based on the percentage that these services were used to make taxable supplies. 84 Under the proposed amendments, when Rebecca sells the dwelling, she would be able to elect to treat the sale as an exempt supply of goods as it meets the requirements of the proposed new section 14(4). Example 26: Dwelling where deductions are claimed for taxable use Vincent is a registered person who acquired a dwelling for $920,000 from an unregistered person. Vincent intends to use 20% of the dwelling (a dedicated office) to make taxable supplies for his GST-registered consulting business. He therefore claims an input tax deduction of $24,000, which is 20% of the GST fraction of the purchase price. He later spends $23,000 (including GST) on substantial renovations (replacing the windows, carpet and blinds) to improve the office, which he uses exclusively to make taxable supplies for his consulting business. Vincent claims a deduction for the $3,000 of input tax paid for the renovations. The dwelling would not qualify for the exemption in proposed new section 14(4) because relevant deductions were taken for the goods under section 20(3). A deduction was claimed on acquisition, and deductions were also claimed for substantial improvements that became an integral part of the dwelling. Because the dwelling is partly used to make taxable supplies, it will be a taxable supply when sold. Vincent can claim an additional deduction under section 21F for the non-taxable percentage use of the consideration he receives when he sells the dwelling. In this case, the office used to make taxable supplies comprised 20% of the use of the dwelling. If Vincent sold the dwelling for $1.15m, he would return output tax of $150,000 and could claim an adjustment under section 21F for an additional deduction of $120,000. The net GST he would return on the sale would be $30,000. Not acquired for principal purpose of making taxable supplies Proposed section 14(4)(b) provides that the goods cannot have been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Principal purpose is intended to have the same meaning here as the reference to principal purpose used in the pre-2011 GST Act definition of “input tax”. The principal purpose is the main, primary or fundamental purpose. This does not necessarily equate with a more than 50% test. Not used for principal purpose of making taxable supplies Proposed section 14(4)(c) provides that during the time the registered person owned the goods, they cannot have been used by the person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. To satisfy section 14(4)(c), the primary use of the goods, from the time the person acquired them until their disposal, would need to be a non- taxable use, that is, a private or exempt use. It also means the goods cannot be goods whose principal purpose involved the registered person selling the goods in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity, such as trading stock. Not acquired as a zero-rated supply Proposed section 14(4)(d) requires that the goods cannot have been acquired as a zero-rated going concern under section 11(1)(m) or as a zero-rated supply of land 85 under section 11(1)(mb). 10 For section 11(1)(m) to apply, the registered person who acquires the goods must acquire a taxable activity, or part of a taxable activity, that is a going concern at the time of supply and capable of continuing as a going concern. For section 11(1)(mb) to apply, the registered person must acquire land with the intention of using it to make taxable supplies. Output tax adjustment to satisfy section 14(4)(d) In most cases where a GST-registered purchaser acquires land or business assets that qualify for zero-rating under section 11(1)(m) or (mb), they will be acquiring these goods for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. However, in some cases the purchaser’s taxable use of the goods, while sufficient for the supply of the goods to qualify as a zero-rated supply under section 11(1)(m) or (mb), may be minor and secondary to their non-taxable (exempt or private) use of the goods. Therefore, the supply of the goods would satisfy the requirements of proposed new section 14(4) other than paragraph (d). To accommodate these cases, an additional amendment is proposed to sections 14(4)(d) and 20(3J) that would allow the registered person to return an amount of output tax under section 20(3J)(a)(iv) equal to the full nominal GST amount as calculated by section 20(3J)(a)(i). If the registered person made this output tax adjustment, the exclusion under proposed new section 14(4)(d) for goods acquired as zero-rated goods would no longer apply. Although the person acquired the goods as a zero-rated supply, making the output tax adjustment would put them in the same position as a person who acquired standard-rated or secondhand goods and did not claim an input tax deduction on acquisition. This proposed amendment would have effect for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023 (see the heading “Effective date of section 14(4)” below). Example 27: Acquiring a holiday home as a zero-rated supply of land Gavin is a registered person who acquires a holiday home from another registered person. Gavin’s principal purpose for acquiring the holiday home is to use it for his own private recreation (and not as his principal place of residence). However, because Gavin also intends to use the holiday home for a secondary and more minor purpose of making taxable supplies of guest accommodation, he acquires the holiday home as a zero-rated supply under section 11(1)(mb) for $1m (rather than a standard-rated supply of $1m plus $150,000 of GST, which would have been the price had section 11(1)(mb) not applied to the supply). Under proposed new section 20(3J), if Gavin intended to use section 14(4) to make his future disposal of the holiday home an exempt supply, he could choose to return output tax of $150,000, being the full amount of the nominal GST component. If he did this, section 14(4)(d) could then be satisfied for a future disposal of the holiday home. 10 Note that to qualify as a zero-rated supply, land cannot be intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a close relative. Furthermore, supplies of dwellings (such as farmhouses) will often be separate supplies to supplies of the surrounding land (such as a farm) due to the operation of section 5(15), which splits the supply into a supply of a principal place of residence and a supply of land. This means a principal place of residence may be acquired as a separate supply to the supply of zero-rated land, and therefore such a residence may still qualify as not being acquired as a zero-rated supply. 86 Alternatively, Gavin can choose to return the smaller amount of $105,000 output tax under section 20(3J) based on his 70% expected non-taxable use of the holiday home at the time he acquires the holiday home. However, if he does this, a future disposal of the holiday home would not qualify for the exempt supply rule in section 14(4)(d) as he would not have returned the full amount of the nominal GST component on acquisition of the zero-rated supply of land. Electing to use new section 14(4) The registered person would not generally have to disclose to, or notify, the Commissioner that they have made the election to treat the supply of the qualifying goods as an exempt supply. Instead, they would simply not account for GST on the asset (by not claiming deductions for the secondary taxable use and not returning output tax on disposal). The only exception to this would be for assets acquired before 1 April 2023 and subject to the transitional rule, explained below. Effective date of section 14(4) The proposed new exempt supply rule in section 14(4) would generally have effect for taxable supplies made on or after 1 April 2011. This retrospective application date would mean that if a registered person had previously ta ken a tax position consistent with the requirements of proposed new section 14(4), this tax position would become correct once the Bill is enacted. This could include a person treating their dwelling as not being part of their taxable activity even though it may have been partly used to make taxable supplies. However, in cases where an assessment has already been made for a taxable supply before 30 August 2022, that is, the registered person has returned output tax on goods they sold or disposed of before that date, the supply of those goods would remain a taxable supply. For goods that a registered person sells or disposes of between 30 August 2022 and 1 April 2023 that would qualify as exempt supplies under the proposed new section 14(4), the registered person would be able to amend their GST position to make the relevant disposal an exempt supply. The proposed amendments to sections 14(4)(d) and 20(3J) to allow a registered person to make an output tax adjustment for the full nominal GST component of goods acquired as zero-rated land or a zero-rated going concern, so that the acquisition is no longer treated as a zero-rated supply, would have effect for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. Transitional rule for certain goods acquired before 1 April 2023 Proposed new section 91 would insert a transitional rule to allow a registered person to return an amount of output tax for certain goods that would otherwise not satisfy proposed new section 14(4) so that those goods may qualify as an exempt supply on disposal. This transitional rule would apply for the 24-month period between 1 April 2023 and 1 April 2025. Proposed new section 91 would apply when a registered person has acquired goods before 1 April 2023 and previously claimed a deduction under section 20(3) for the goods or acquired them as zero-rated supplies. Provided the relevant goods were not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, the registered person could elect to notify the Commissioner before 1 April 2025 and return output tax based either on the previous taxable use that was claimed for the goods (where deductions have been claimed under section 87 20(3)) or the taxable use percentage of the nominal GST component (as defined in section 20(3J)) (where the goods were acquired as a zero-rated supply). If a registered person applied section 91 and returned the relevant output tax amount, a future disposal of the relevant goods would be an exempt supply. This would be unless the registered person later chose to claim a deduction under section 20(3) for any taxable use of the goods since applying section 91. Consequential amendments to sections 5(15) and 21(2) A consequential amendment is proposed to section 21(2) to ensure that the registered person would not have to monitor their actual taxable use and make adjustments at the end of their adjustment period for any goods for which they apply the proposed new rules in proposed sections 14(4) or 91. This reflects the fact that to apply these new rules the person would have to have either not claimed input tax deductions or returned an amount of output tax, meaning they end up with the same net GST position as a person who has no taxable use of the goods. No adjustments are necessary when a person has no taxable use of their goods. The proposed amendment to section 21(2) would have effect for supplies made on or after 1 April 2011, but not to supplies for which an assessment has been made before 30 August 2022. Consequential amendments are also proposed to section 5(15). Section 5(15) currently applies if a person makes a supply of real property (land) that includes a principal place of residence (such as the person’s home). It provides that the principal place of residence is treated as a separate (and usually non-taxable) supply to other parts of the real property, such as farmland or a business premises, which may be a taxable supply. The proposed amendments would expand the scope of section 5(15) so it would also apply to a supply of real property that has goods the registered person has elected to treat as an exempt supply under proposed new sections 14(4) or 91. The exempt supply of these goods would be treated as a separate supply to the supply of any other real property. It is anticipated the relevant exempt goods will usually be a dwelling. For example, a second house that is not any person’s main home, a holiday house or a dwelling used to provide temporary worker accommodation. As these types of dwellings would not be a principal place of residence, they would not currently be treated as a separate supply under the current section 5(15). The proposed amendments would ensure such dwellings (or other exempt goods) are treated the same as dwellings that are a person’s principal place of residence. The proposed insertion of section 5(15)(c), relating to proposed new section 14(4), would have the same retrospective effective date as proposed new section 14(4) itself, that is, generally supplies made on or after 1 April 2011 (see the heading “Effective date of section 14(4)” above). The proposed insertion of section 5(15)(d), relating to proposed new section 91, would have the same effective date as proposed new section 91, that is, 1 April 2023. Reducing the number of required adjustment periods The current GST adjustment rules require unlimited adjustment periods for land and two, five or ten adjustment periods for other types of goods or services, depending on their value. A higher number of required adjustment periods imposes higher compliance costs as the registered person needs to monitor their taxable use of the asset and make adjustments for a longer period. The Bill proposes amendments that would require only ten adjustment periods for land and would reduce the number of adjustments required for certain other assets by increasing the relevant asset value thresholds: see table 1 below. 88 Table 1: Changes to adjustment periods Required number of adjustment periods (Balance dates since acquisition) Current asset values Proposed new asset values (Differences to current asset values shown in bold) Zero (No adjustments to deduction taken on acquisition) $5,000 or less Apportionment on acquisition $10,000 or less Full input tax deduction on acquisition if acquired for a principal purpose of making taxable supplies, otherwise no deduction Two $5,001 to $10,001 $10,001 to $20,000 Five $10,001 to $500,000 $20,001 to $500,000 Ten $500,000+ $500,000+ and land (regardless of the value of the land) Unlimited Land (regardless of the value of the land) Not applicable Proposed amendments to section 21G(4) would replace the reference to “$5,000” with “$10,000” and the two references to “$10,000” with “$20,000”. Section 21G(4)(a)(iii), which provides for 10 adjustment periods, would be amended so that it also applies to land, and section 21G(5), which currently requires an unlimited number of adjustment periods for land, would also be amended. The requirement for ten adjustment periods for land would apply regardless of the value of the land. Thus, even if land was acquired for less than $500,000, it would still be adjusted for ten adjustment periods. These proposed amendments would take effect from the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Deeming the disposal of an asset to be a taxable supply An asset for which a registered person has previously claimed a taxable use Under the current GST Act, supplies of goods or services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity are taxable supplies. This includes sel ling or otherwise disposing of assets used by the registered person in their taxable activity. A person’s taxable activity includes all activities in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity, which includes anything done in connection with the beginning or ending of that activity, including a premature ending. However, even with this broad definition, it may be unclear whether a disposal of a valuable asset, such as land, is a taxable supply when the registered person is no longer using the asset to make taxable supplies, or when they previously claimed they had a taxable use of the asset but did not in fact use the asset to make any taxable supplies. To clarify that the disposal of such goods and services is a taxable supply, the Bill proposes replacing section 5(16) and inserting new section 5(16C). These provisions would deem such a disposal to be made in the course and furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the person (a taxable supply). The disposal could be the sale of the relevant goods or services, or it could be a deemed disposal because another 89 deeming rule applies, such as section 5(3), which deems the disposal at market value of any assets held by a person who ceases to be a registered person. The proposed deeming rule would apply to goods and services that a person has previously claimed a taxable use for, even though the person is not using the goods or services in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity at the time the goods or services are disposed of. It would effectively broaden the scope of the existing deeming rule in section 5(16), which applies to dwellings for which a registered person has claimed a deduction under section 20(3). The definition of “registered person” includes a person who is liable to register for GST. This means that the proposed deeming rule in section 5(16C) would also apply to a person who had previously deregistered from GST but becomes liable to register for GST because of the application of the section and the fact they are making taxable supplies of more than $60,000 in a 12-month period (including the consideration received for the section 5(16C) taxable supply). There are three ways that a person may have previously claimed a taxable use for the relevant goods or services:  by claiming an input tax deduction for taxable use under section 20(3)  by acquiring the supply from another registered person as a zero-rated supply of land under section 11(1)(mb), or  by acquiring the supply as a zero-rated going concern under section 11(1)(m). The proposed deeming rule would not apply in situations where the registered person had previously returned an amount of output tax on the goods or services equal to or greater than either the deductions taken for the relevant goods or services under section 20(3), or the nominal GST component under section 20(3J) in the case of a supply that was acquired by them as a zero-rated supply of land or a going concern. The person could have previously returned this amount of output tax because of one or more of the following circumstances:  The person had deregistered for GST and returned output tax on the market value of the asset (which was higher than the acquisition cost) under section 5(3).  Section 20(3J) applied, and the registered person’s percentage intended use for making taxable supplies was nil at the time they acquired the supply, which had initially been treated as a zero-rated supply of land or a going concern. For example, at the time of supply the person had initially planned to use the land to make taxable supplies, but once they acquired the land their plans changed so that they would only have private or exempt use of the land.  The wash-up rule in section 21FB had been applied by a registered person who had total non-taxable use, and therefore they had repaid an amount of output tax equal to their earlier deductions or nominal GST component for their earlier taxable use.  The registered person had applied the proposed new transitional rule in section 91 for qualifying goods they had acquired before 1 April 2023 and had notified the Commissioner and returned output tax equal to the previous deductions (or nominal GST component) claimed in respect of their taxable use of the goods. Section 5(19) of the GST Act would also be repealed as it would become superseded by the proposed new section 5(16). Section 5(19) provided an election that a registered person could use before 1 August 1996 to pay output tax on a dwelling for which the person had previously claimed deductions under 20(3) to ensure a future disposal of the dwelling would not be subject to the deeming rule in section 5(16). The proposed new section 5(16) would mean that, provided the registered person who applied the section 5(19) election had not claimed a subsequent deduction under section 20(3) for a taxable use of the dwelling since returning the output tax in 1996, 90 a disposal of the dwelling would not be deemed by the new section 5(16) to be a taxable supply. Assets sold after a non-taxable wash-up is performed Section 21FB of the GST Act currently applies when a person changes their use of an asset to either a fully taxable or a fully non-taxable use. If a person’s use becomes fully non-taxable, the asset may no longer be used in the course and furtherance of the person’s taxable activity and therefore not a taxable supply if it is subsequently sold or disposed of. This provides a potential opportunity for tax avoidance. For example, registered persons could try to minimise their output tax liability on assets, such as land, that are used to make taxable supplies but which they plan to sell soon. The output tax that needs to be returned under section 21FB on a change to non-taxable use is based on the full input tax deduction that could have been claimed for the GST charged on the asset at the time it was originally acquired. This means that for appreciating assets, such as land, the output tax liability from claiming a change of use and applying section 21FB may be significantly less than the output tax that would be charged at the time of disposal if the asset was sold as a taxable supply. To address this risk, proposed new section 5(16B) provides that the new deeming rule in section 5(16C) would also apply in circumstances where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers the registered person has increased their non-taxable use of the goods or services and then applied section 21FB in contemplation of the sale of the goods or services or ceasing their taxable activity. If proposed new section 5(16B) applied, the disposal of the relevant asset would be deemed by proposed new section 5(16C) to be made in the course and furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the person (that is, it would be a taxable supply). The disposal could be the sale of the relevant goods or services, or a deemed disposal under another deeming rule (such as section 5(3), which deems the disposal at market value of any assets held by a person who ceases to be a registered person). The proposed amendments to sections 5(16), (16B) and (16C) would have effect for goods and services supplied on or after 1 April 2023. Expanding the ability to use the wash-up rule Allowing the calculation in the current adjustment period Section 21FB of the GST Act contains a wash-up calculation that applies when a registered person has experienced a change to either 100 percent taxable use or 100 percent non-taxable use of an asset during the current adjustment period and for all the following adjustment periods. This is measured at two consecutive annual balance dates. If their use of the asset has changed to 100 percent taxable use, the wash-up rule requires the registered person to claim a full input tax deduction for the input tax they incurred at the time they acquired the asset. If, instead, their use has changed to 100 percent non-taxable use, they are required to make an output tax adjustment to repay input tax previously deducted. Some taxpayers may purchase business assets before they are GST registered that they subsequently use to make taxable supplies after they register for GST. If they had been registered for GST at the time they purchased the business asset, they would have been able to claim an input tax deduction in their next GST return to the extent to which they used the asset to make taxable supplies. The apportionment and adjustment rules allow such taxpayers to gradually claim input tax deductions on such assets after they have registered for GST. They may also be able to claim a full input tax deduction if the wash-up rule in section 21FB applies. This is because they would have had two adjustment periods where they had 100 percent taxable use of the 91 asset. However, this delays their ability to claim a full input tax deduction for assets used to make taxable supplies. To address this issue and reduce the compliance costs associated with requiring a taxpayer to measure their actual use and make two periods of adjustments for a permanent change of use, the Bill proposes an amendment so the wash-up calculation in section 21FB is applied at the end of the adjustment period in which the permanent change in use occurred. Allowing the calculation for any permanent change in use Another issue is the wash-up rule can only be used if there has been a change to either 100 percent taxable or 100 percent non-taxable use. This means the wash-up rule cannot be used by registered persons whose use has permanently changed but to a percentage less than 100 percent, for example, a registered person whose taxable use of an asset has permanently changed from 90 percent to 20 percent. Such registered persons are required to continue to gradually change their percentage actual use each adjustment period. This imposes compliance costs. To reduce these compliance costs, the Bill proposes amending the wash-up rule to allow it to be used for any permanent change to a particular fixed percentage use. For example, if a registered person’s use of a particular good or service permanently changed to 50 percent taxable use and they expected this percentage to remain stable for the foreseeable future, they would be able to perform the wash-up calculation. Example 28: Permanent change in use Tōtara is a registered person that acquires an apartment building for $23m from an unregistered person. Tōtara will use 80 percent of the building to make exempt supplies of accommodation in a dwelling and lease 20 percent of the building as a commercial lease to Rimu, a registered person who uses these apartments to supply commercial accommodation of hotel units and serviced apartments. Tōtara claims a deduction for 20 percent of the $3m input tax on acquisition, or $0.6m. After 24 months, Tōtara negotiates a long-term commercial lease to supply 50 percent of the building to Rimu for Rimu to make taxable supplies of commercial accommodation. This will result in a permanent change to 50 percent of the apartment building being supplied by Tōtara for making taxable supplies for the foreseeable future. The new permanent percentage use is 50 percent and the actual use in the previous adjustment period was 20 percent, a difference of 30 percent additional taxable use. Under the proposed new section 21FB, Tōtara would be able to make an adjustment at the end of their adjustment period (on their next annual balance date) to deduct $0.9m, which is equal to 30 percent of the $3m of input tax on acquisition. They would include this adjustment in their first GST return filed after the end of their adjustment period. After applying section 21FB, the registered person would not make any further adjustments in future adjustment periods unless their actual use changed from their new percentage taxable use of the goods or services. This outcome is already provided for by section 21(2)(ac) of the GST Act. The proposed amendments to section 21FB would have effect for a registered person’s adjustment period beginning on or after 1 April 2023. 92 Remedial amendment to definition of “percentage actual use” A remedial amendment is proposed to the definition of “percentage actual use” in section 21G to clarify that after the wash-up rule in section 21FB has been applied, the registered person should only measure their percentage actual use from the date that the wash-up calculation was performed, rather than the date they acquired the asset. The proposed amendment ensures the earlier adjustment taken under section 21FB is properly accounted for when the person makes a final adjustment either on disposal under section 21F or because they had to make a subsequent annual adjustment because their percentage use had changed since they applied the wash-up calculation. The proposed remedial amendment would take effect on 30 June 2014, which is the date the wash-up calculation in section 21FB was originally introduced. Remedial amendment to wash-up rule for assets that were zero-rated when they were acquired For the purposes of the wash-up calculation in section 21FB of the GST Act, “actual deduction” is defined in section 21FB(3)(b) as the “amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments made up to the end of the adjustment period referred to in subsection 1(c)(ii)”. This definition does not take into account any nominal deduction that the person has benefited from by paying a reduced amount of consideration when acquiring a zero-rated supply of land. This means that if a registered person acquires land as a zero-rated supply, and then changes their use of the land to a 0 percent taxable use, they could perform the wash- up calculation in section 21FB and have no output tax to return as their “actual deduction” would be nil. This is not the intended policy outcome. In other cases, where the land was acquired as a secondhand good or a standard-rated supply, the “actual deduction” would be the amount of input tax deducted on the land and the registered person would be required to return output tax equal to this amount. The other adjustment rules (including the definition of “full input tax deduction” in section 21FB) already take into account nominal deductions on acquisition under section 20(3J). It appears to be an oversight that this was not included in the definition of “actual deduction” in section 21FB. The Bill proposes a retrospective remedial amendment to take effect on 30 June 2014, the date the wash-up calculation was first introduced, to ensure the definition of “actual deduction” in section 21FB correctly accounts for land acquired as a zero-rated supply. Allowing Inland Revenue to approve a wider range of apportionment methods The apportionment and adjustment rules allow registered persons to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to agree an alternative apportionment method. This is intended to reduce compliance costs, as an alternative apportionment method could produce similar GST outcomes to the default apportionment rules but with lower compliance costs. Currently, any alternative apportionment method is required to “have regard to the tenor” of the default apportionment rules and formula. The default apportionment and adjustment rules require a person to apportion deductions based on their intended taxable percentage use or actual use in the current adjustment period, even though their current use may be temporary and incidental to their ultimate use of the goods or services. This requirement can prevent the Commissioner from agreeing to some methods that may simplify the apportionment and adjustments required but use a different approach to the default apportionment and adjustment rules. For example, a registered person may purchase land to conduct a large-scale development that will make substantial taxable supplies. However, the land contains 93 some existing houses for which they will receive residential rental income for a limited time as they prepare the planning and consents for the large-scale development. These supplies of accommodation in a dwelling are temporary and incidental to their much larger taxable use of the land. In such cases, it could be more practical for the registered person to return (but not charge to their tenants) output tax on consideration received for an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling. They could then be treated as though they made only taxable supplies and claim full input tax deductions for associated expenses, rather than apportioning their deductions and making annual adjustments under the default apportionment rules and formula. To accommodate a wider range of methods, the Bill proposes to remove the requirements in sections 20(3E), (3EB), 21(4) and (4B) that the alternative method “have regard to the tenor of” the default apportionment rules and formula. The proposed amendments would retain the more general requirement that the alternative method provides “a fair and reasonable method” of apportionment or calculating adjustments. These proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Repealing the mixed-use asset rules in sections 20(3JB) and 20G The mixed-use asset rules in sections 20(3JB) and 20G add the complexity of another potential formula but have limited application. The rules only apply to certain assets, such as holiday homes, aircraft, and boats, and only when their use is a mixture of private days, taxable days and at least 62 unused days. In addition, many of the holiday homes that would otherwise become subject to these mixed-use asset rules could become excluded from a registered person’s taxable activity due to the new exempt supply rules proposed in sections 14(4) and 91 (discussed above), which would allow registered persons to elect for mainly private or exempt assets to be treated as if they only had non-taxable use. The Bill therefore proposes to repeal the current mixed-use asset rules in sections 20(3JB) and 20G. In cases where GST apportionment continued to apply to a registered person’s mixed-use assets, their GST input tax deductions and adjustments would instead be calculated using the same general GST apportionment rules that apply to other assets. These general rules would allow an apportionment percentage to be calculated based on days of taxable use. This is a similar method to the current formula in section 20G, but the calculation would be less prescriptive, and it would not be limited to the set of “mixed-use assets” described in section DG 3 of the Income Tax Act. The proposed repeal of sections 20(3JB) and 20G would have effect for the registered person’s first adjustment period beginning on or after 1 April 2024. This would mean that if, on 31 March 2024, a registered person had begun an adjustment period for a mixed-use asset to which section 20G applied, they would continue to use section 20G until the end of that adjustment period. At their first adjustment period beginning on or after 1 April 2024, they would then begin to use the ordinary adjustment rules in sections 21 and 21A. Prescribing an information disclosure requirement for GST persons claiming a taxable use on purchases of land, aircraft or pleasure craft The Bill proposes introducing new section 61B to the Tax Administration Act 1994, which would provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the ability to prescribe a new type of information disclosure requirement that would apply when a registered person acquires land, a pleasure craft, or an aircraft with the intention of using it to make taxable supplies. 94 For this new rule, “land” would have the meaning set out in section 2 of the GST Act 1985, ”aircraft” would have the meaning set out in section 2 of the Civil Aviation Act 1990, and “pleasure craft” would have the meaning set out in section 2 of the Maritime Transport Act 1994. These definitions of land, aircraft and pleasure craft are currently used in the GST Act for determining if certain goods and services are zero- rated supplies. The proposed information disclosure requirement is intended to assist Inland Revenue to better monitor and promote compliance by registered persons who have previously claimed large input tax deductions (or acquired zero-rated land) but no longer appear to be proceeding with, or carrying on, a taxable activity (for example, they have been continuously filing GST returns with no or low sales). Proposed section 61B(1) would enable the Commissioner to prescribe and adjust the specific requirements to ensure the rules are practical and effective. It would allow the Commissioner to set (and adjust) what information would be reported and the form and deadlines for the disclosure, including the start date for the first disclosure period. The information required to be disclosed could include the amount of consideration paid for the asset, the initial amount of GST input tax deducted on purchase (or the nominal GST amount that would otherwise have been charged if the asset was purchased from another registered person as a zero-rated supply of land or a going concern), and a statement of how the asset will be used to make taxable supplies. Proposed new section 61B(2) would allow the Commissioner to ex empt certain types of registered persons from being required to disclose the information if they are considered by the Commissioner to represent a low risk of using the relevant asset for a private or exempt use. For example, the exemption could be designed to define certain categories of registered persons who have a well-established business of making taxable supplies of land development, commercial leasing, or dealing in aircraft or pleasure craft, whether by themselves or through associated persons. Before implementing an information disclosure requirement, Inland Revenue would work with GST practitioners and software developers to test the proposed design (including the specific information that would be disclosed, the timing and format of the disclosure and which groups or assets should be exempt as they represent a low risk) to ensure it is well-targeted and practical. Although the proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent, b ecause of the further design and testing required and the need to provide sufficient time for affected businesses and accounting software providers to update their systems, it is expected that the earliest possible implementation date to apply the new disclosure rules would be for land, pleasure craft or aircraft acquired on or after 1 April 2024. 95 Other policy items 97 GST STATUS OF LEGISLATIVE CHARGES Clauses 105(1), (3) and (11), 133, 135 and 137 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would introduce a rule that provides for the GST treatment of charges payable under legislation (including Acts and regulations) in New Zealand. The proposed amendments also include exceptions to this rule and a transitional regulation-making power for the Minister of Revenue to add charges to the proposed schedule of non-taxable legislative charges. Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for:  any legislative charges that come into force on or after 1 July 2023 (which includes new and amended legislative charges), and  all other legislative charges on 1 July 2026. The proposed amendments that prevent amendments to historic assessments would take effect on 30 August 2022. Background The term “charge” is used to describe a liability to pay money and is intended to be broad-ranging, including fees and levies. A legislative charge is a charge that is payable under legislation (including secondary legislation such as Orders in Council). Common examples of legislative charges include fees paid to government agencies or bodies for the renewal of a licence or for registration. Other types of legislative charges may be payable by certain persons in specific industries, where the revenue from those charges is used to fund the activities of a representative body or of a regulator. These charges are generally subject to GST as there is an obvious nexus between the supply and the consideration for that supply. The GST treatment of some legislative charges can, however, sometimes be unclear. To date, the approach to resolve these uncertainties has been for piecemeal amendments to be made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) to treat specific charges as consideration for the supply of goods and services and therefore subject to GST. This approach lacks transparency, creates uncertainty, and has resulted in an inconsistent and incoherent application of GST to legislative charges. The lack of a broad rule for legislative charges in the GST Act can be contrasted against the rules for government grants and subsidies. Under the framework for government grants and subsidies, the GST Act generally requires GST-registered recipients of government grants and subsidies to return GST on the amounts received if they relate to the recipient’s taxable activity. The GST Act also enables the Governor-General to declare government grants and subsidies not subject to these rules by Order in Council. Key features The key features of the proposals include:  A new rule that would provide that charges payable under legislation are treated as consideration for a supply of goods and services (the legislative charges rule). 98  Exceptions to the legislative charges rule that would provide that fines, penalties, interest, and general taxes are not treated as consideration for a supply of goods and services under the legislative charges rule.  A new schedule of non-taxable legislative charges, and a transitional regulation- making power that would enable the schedule to be updated by Order in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue until 30 June 2026.  GST-registered persons and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would be prevented from amending historic GST returns in a way that is inconsistent with the amendments.  The removal of a number of existing deeming provisions from the GST Act that would be superseded by the proposed amendments. Detailed analysis The Bill proposes amendments to section 5 (Meaning of the term supply) with the addition of new subsections (6EC) to (6EF). These proposed amendments would:  treat any charges, including fees and levies, payable under legislation as consideration for a supply of goods and services (new section 5(6EC))  exclude legislative charges that have been added to the proposed schedule of non- taxable legislative charges from the proposed deeming rule (new section 5(6ED)(a))  exclude legislative charges that are, or are in the nature of, fines, penalties, interest, and general taxes from the proposed rule (new section 5(6ED)(b)), and  define a “general tax” for these purposes as being a charge in the nature of a tax imposed by a tax law that is not earmarked in legislation for a specific purpose (new section 5(6EE)). The proposed amendments would be phased in over a three-year period. They would apply immediately to legislative charges that come into force on or after 1 July 2023. For all other charges, the rule would apply from 1 July 2026. This three-year transitional period provides government agencies time to make any necessary changes to legislative charges for which they have administrative responsibility. The proposed legislative charges rule and the exceptions Proposed section 5(6EC) would treat any charge payable under legislation as consideration for the supply of goods and services. The usual rules for determining whether a supply of goods or services is standard rated, zero-rated, or exempt would continue to apply. 11 References to “legislation” are to be taken as a reference to the whole or part of any Act or secondary legislation. 12 This means that charges payable pursuant to any Act or any secondary legislation would be subject to the proposed rule and exceptions. Proposed section 5(6ED) provides that a legislative charge would not be treated as consideration for a supply of goods and services to the extent that the charge is, or is in the nature of, a fine, a penalty, interest, or a general tax. 11 A supply of goods and services could still be zero-rated or exempt depending on whether the conditions in sections 11, 11A, or 14 of the GST Act are satisfied. For example, a legislative charge for the supply of financial services (as defined in the GST Act) would still be exempt. 12 According to section 13 of the Legislation Act 2019. 99 Proposed section 5(6EE) defines a “general tax” for the purposes of the proposed amendments. For a charge to be a general tax, it would have to:  be a charge in the nature of a tax  be imposed by a tax law, and  not be earmarked in legislation for a particular purpose or function. Under the proposed definition, a levy that is paid to fund the activities of a regulator would not be a general tax because the legislation enabling the levy would earmark the revenue for a particular purpose or function (that is, to enable the regulator to perform its functions). In contrast, income tax and GST itself would be general taxes, as these charges are in the nature of a tax, are payable under a tax law, and the revenue from these charges is not earmarked in legislation for a particular purpose or function. The proposed schedule of non-taxable legislative charges The Bill proposes a schedule to the GST Act that would contain a list of non-taxable legislative charges. This is similar to an Order in Council that exists, and which is amended from time to time, for government grants and subsidies: the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992. The proposed schedule of non-taxable legislative charges could be amended through either:  amendments contained in primary legislation – for example, an amendment Act, or  the proposed transitional regulation-making power, which expires on 30 June 2026. The proposed transitional regulation-making power would enable the Minister of Revenue to recommend an Order in Council be made where the Minister is satisfied that adding a charge (which includes either a specifically named charge, or a class of charge) to the schedule is desirable, having regard to whether adding the charge, or class of charges, to the schedule would be consistent with the approach taken for similar charges in the past. The Bill proposes that the transitional regulation-making power would expire on 30 June 2026. This is the day before it is proposed the new rules would apply to all legislative charges. This three-year transitional period is intended to provide sufficient time for government agencies to make any necessary changes to legislative charges for which they have administrative responsibility or to seek an addition to the proposed schedule. The proposed schedule and regulation-making power are intended to recognise that there may be circumstances in the future where a specific charge should not be affected by the proposed rules. No charges have been included on the proposed schedule on the Bill’s introduction. The proposed schedule and regulation-making power would come into force on the day after the Bill receives the Royal assent. Limitation on amending assessments The Bill proposes the introduction of new section 81B of the GST Act. The new section would prevent taxpayers and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue from amending historic GST assessments in a way that would be inconsistent with proposed new sections 5(6EC) to 5(6EE). This limitation would apply retrospectively to 30 August 2022. The reason for this limitation is that persons who have paid GST on legislative charges would have done so with a reasonable expectation that GST would have been 100 applicable. To unwind GST assessments would result in compliance and administration costs for both those that collected legislative charges and Inland Revenue. Amendments to historic GST assessments to remove GST on legislative charges would:  provide a windfall gain for the persons responsible for the legislative charges equal to the amount of GST collected and returned to Inland Revenue (as there would be no corresponding obligation on the collector of the charge to forward this GST on to the payers of the legislative charges), and  require amendments to GST assessments for persons that have paid legislative charges and who have taken a deduction for input tax of the GST included in the legislative charges. Allowing amendments in these circumstances could also pose a significant fiscal risk for the Crown. Repealing specific deeming rules that have been superseded The GST Act has been amended over time to include specific provisions that deem amounts paid to be consideration for a supply of goods and services made by the recipient of the payment in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity that they carry on. The Bill proposes to repeal the specific provisions set out in table 2 below that would be superseded by the proposed rule for legislative charges. This is to avoid duplication and confusion. Table 2: Specific provisions to be repealed Section reference Description Section 5(6AA) Levies payable to the New Zealand Transport Agency and the Environmental Protection Authority under the Climate Change Response Act 2002 Section 5(6AAB) Fees and charges payable pursuant to regulations made under the Land Transport Act 1998 Section 5(6A) Registration and licence fees payable under the Land Transport Act 1998 Section 5(6AB) The levy payable to Fire and Emergency New Zealand under the Fire and Emergency New Zealand Act 2017 Section 5(6AC) Various payments and levies payable under the Waste Minimisation Act 2008 Section 5(6B) Road user charges payable under the Road User Charges Act 2012 Section 5(6BB) Regional Fuel Tax and rebates paid under the Land Transport Management Act 2003 (or associated regulations) Section 5(7F) The levy payable under the Infrastructure Funding and Financing Act 2020 The Bill proposes these provisions would be repealed on 30 June 2026. This is the day before the proposed rule for legislative charges would come into force. 101 The repeal of these provisions is not intended to affect the existing GST treatment of the charges or the status of the recipient of the charges as a registered person for the purposes of the GST Act. 102 BUILD-TO-RENT EXEMPTION FROM INTEREST LIMITATION Clauses 98(3) and 100 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments provide an in-perpetuity exemption from the interest limitation rules for build-to-rent dwellings that meet the asset class definition. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 October 2021 to align with the introduction of the interest limitation rules. Background The interest limitation rules took effect on 1 October 2021 and are aimed at tilting the playing field for existing residential property away from investors and towards first home buyers and owner-occupiers. Exemptions, such as the new build exemption, were included to ensure the interest limitation rules do not have a negative impact on new housing supply. An additional exemption for build-to-rent assets is considered necessary to ensure the rules do not negatively impact the supply of rental property specifically. Key features The Bill proposes to insert a new definition of “build-to-rent land” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). The interest limitation rules would not apply to interest incurred in relation to property that meets the definition of “build-to-rent land”. However, if the land fails to meet the definition at any point, the interest limitation rules would apply, and interest would no longer be able to be deducted in relation to that residential rental property. “Build-to-rent land” would mean land to the extent to which, together with any other contiguous land owned by the same person:  it has 20 or more dwellings  each dwelling is used, available for use, or being prepared or restored for use, as a dwelling occupied under a residential tenancy to which the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) applies  every residential tenancy has the option of a 10-year term, with the ability to give 56 days’ notice of termination  every tenancy agreement includes a personalisation policy, and  at no time it after it first meets the above requirements does it fail to meet those requirements. Exemption would apply to existing dwellings that meet the definition by 1 July 2023 The policy is intended to apply to new and existing build-to-rent developments. However, it is highly unlikely any existing developments would have offered 10-year tenancies to all tenants. Existing build-to-rent assets would therefore have until 1 July 2023 to comply with the tenure and personalisation policy requirements included in the definition of “build-to-rent land”. 103 Detailed analysis Configuration of development A build-to-rent development would have to have no less than 20 dwellings at all times that satisfy the requirements to qualify as “build-to-rent land”. The proposed definition would mean that dwellings could be held in one or more titles and could be on adjoining parcels of land. The development could also include commercial premises or other dwellings that do not meet the build-to-rent requirements and do not form part of the “build-to-rent land”. This would enable community amenities to be provided, allow for mixed tenure types, and provide alternative revenue streams for the development. In these instances, apportionment would be required. It is proposed that existing tax apportionment principles would apply. “To the extent” test A dwelling would qualify for the exemption “to the extent” to which it meets the definition requirements. This means each individual dwelling, as well as the overall development, would have to meet the definition for interest to be deductible. Only interest relating to the portion of the development that meets the definition of “build- to-rent land” can be deducted. Example 29: A development qualifies “to the extent” it meets definition Te Awhi Co completed an apartment block development in 2021 that is made up of 35 apartments along with a block of commercial shops on the ground floor. Of the 35 apartments, 10 were sold to owner-occupiers and 25 were retained by Te Awhi Co to rent out under the build-to-rent model. Assuming the 25 apartments meet the other requirements of the “build-to-rent land” definition (for example, they are rented out under the RTA, tenants have been offered a 10-year tenancy agreement, and personalisation policies have been offered), these 25 units would qualify as build-to-rent land. Any interest relating to these 25 apartments would therefore be deductible. Having commercial premises and dwellings that do not meet the “build-to-rent” definition in the same development does not stop the build-to-rent units from qualifying for the exemption. Any interest relating to those non-build-to-r ent parts of the development would not be deductible under the build-to-rent exemption. However, other exemptions may apply, such as the new build exemption. “Same person” A development must be owned by the same person to qualify for the exemption. The “same person” can include any natural person or legal entity (for example, a company). Continuous use requirement Land would have to continually meet the requirements of the “build-to-rent land” definition to qualify for the exemption. Even if land met the requirements in the future, it would never be able to qualify again as “build-to-rent land” if at any point it had failed to meet the definition. 104 Existing build-to-rent developments would have to meet all the requirements by 1 July 2023 and continue to meet the requirements at all times after this date. All new developments would have to comply at all times after 1 July 2023. Used, available for use, or being prepared or restored for use A dwelling would have to be used, available for use or being prepared or restored for use as a build-to-rent dwelling to qualify for the proposed exemption. The wording “available for use” would cover situations where dwellings are not currently occupied but are being advertised on the market as available for rent. “Being prepared or restored for use” would cover scenarios where a dwelling is not currently available for use but is undergoing work to be suitable for use as a rental property. For example, a unit may be renovated between tenancies to replace an outdated kitchen. The dwelling would still qualify during this period even though it is not occupied. Tenure length requirement Tenants of a build-to-rent dwelling would have to be offered a fixed-term tenancy of at least 10 years and be given the ability to give 56 days’ notice of termination. This does not mean the tenant has to accept this offer. They may agree to, or request, a different tenancy offer. Existing build-to-rent developments would have until 1 July 2023 to offer all existing tenants a 10-year contract, and they would have to offer all new tenants from 1 July 2023 a 10-year contract. Any build-to-rent development completed after 1 July 2023 would have to meet this requirement immediately. Personalisation policies Build-to-rent providers would have to supply tenants with explicit personalisation policies, beyond what is already allowed under the RTA, that outline any personalisation options available for tenants, for example, the ability to make certain renovations, or the allowance of pets. Req uiring explicit personalisation policies would make lifestyle issues like pets and home-making more transparent to prospective tenants and would allow build-to-rent providers to offer different personalisation options for different developments. For example, not all build-to-rent locations and typologies will be suitable for pets, and some build-to-rent providers may wish to promote exclusion of pets as a point of difference to benefit some tenants. Existing build-to-rent developments would have until 1 July 2023 to agree to personalisation policies with all current tenants. Any build-to-rent developments completed after 1 July 2023 would have to comply with this requirement immediately. When the exemption applies Taxpayers would be eligible for the exemption from the date the development meets the definition requirements. The exemption would take effect on 1 October 2021 to align with the introduction of the interest limitation rules. Existing build-to-rent developments completed before 1 July 2023 would have until this date to meet the definition requirements. If the development does not do so by 1 July 2023, they would never be able to qualify for the exemption. If an existing development qualified for the exemption, it would apply retrospectively; that is, they would be able to deduct interest incurred for the period between 1 October 2021 and the date they qualified. If the 2021–22 return has already been filed, taxpayers would be able to amend their return via the process under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 105 New build-to-rent developments would need to comply with the requirements immediately and would be eligible for the exemption from the date they meet the requirements. To qualify for the exemption, the Chief Executive of Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development would have to be satisfied that the development meets the definition of “build-to-rent land”. The asset would then be recorded on a register of assets that would be shared with Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would then exempt the listed taxpayers. The exemption would continue for as long as the development meets the definition requirements. Exemption applies to interest incurred in relation to build-to-rent land The effect of the build-to-rent exemption would be that the interest limitation rules in subpart DH would not apply to deny interest deductions. However, interest would still have to be deductible under existing tax rules. The interest deductible under the exemption would include interest on loans to:  acquire the land for a build-to-rent development  construct or install a build-to-rent development on the land  pay expenses such as insurance and rates, and  renovate, maintain, or repair a build-to-rent dwelling. When the exemption ceases A dwelling would cease to qualify immediately if it fails to meet the definition of “build- to-rent land”. If a dwelling in a development no longer meets the requirements, for example, if it is not rented out under the RTA, interest relating to that dwelling would no longer be deductible. If that dwelling ceased to qualify, and this resulted in there being less than 20 qualifying dwellings in a development, the exemption would cease to apply to the entire development. Example 30: When a unit ceases to qualify Assume the same facts as in example 29 above. Te Awhi Co currently deducts interest relating to the 25 qualifying units in its development. Four of these units are sold in February 2022, so interest is only deductible for the remaining 21 units. In May 2022, two units are rented out to new tenants who are only offered three-year contracts. This does not meet the requirement of offering a fixed- term tenancy of at least 10 years. As such, the two units no longer qualify for the exemption. There are now only 19 units that meet the requirements, so the exemption would cease to apply for the entire development. Interaction with the new build exemption The new build exemption currently applies to exempt new builds from the interest limitation rules for a period of 20 years. A new build is a self-contained dwelling that has received its CCC on or after 27 March 2020. A build-to-rent development is not barred from accessing the new build exemption. However, a development would still have to meet the build-to-rent exemption requirements from 1 July 2023 to access that exemption at any time in the future (for example, once the 20-year new build exemption ceases). 106 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN PUBLIC TRANSPORT FARES SUBSIDISED BY EMPLOYER Clauses 23 and 27 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would exempt from fringe benefit tax (FBT) public transport fares that are subsidised by an employer mainly for the purpose of their employees travelling between their home and place of work. Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for fringe benefits provided on and after 1 April 2023. Background Currently, contributions an employer makes to their employee’s public transport costs for travel between home and the workplace, for example, in the form of a voucher or a loaded electronic ticketing card, are generally an unclassified fringe benefit (see sections CX 2(1)(b)(ii), CX 37, and RA 5(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA)). FBT applies unless the benefit falls below certain de minima. 13 On the other hand, employer-provided on-premises car parks are largely exempt from FBT under the general exemption for on-premises benefits. This gap in the FBT rules can be a sizeable benefit given the rental cost of car parks in major urban areas. Broadening the coverage of FBT to include more of these car parks (the ideal tax policy outcome) has proved to be problematic in the past mainly due to concern about the potential compliance costs and safety issues for some CBD employees. 14 Acknowledging this issue, the Tax Working Group recommended aligning the FBT treatment by also exempting public transport subsidies from FBT. The proposal in the Bill reflects this recommendation. Specifically, this alignment would produce a more neutral FBT outcome between the options of travelling to and from work by car and travelling by the more environmentally friendly mode of public transport. Key features Proposed new section CX 19C provides that FBT would not apply to certain public transport fares that an employer subsidises. Detailed analysis Proposed new section CX 19C provides that public transport fares that an employer has subsidised mainly for the purpose of the employee travelling between their home 13 FBT does not currently apply if the value of all unclassified benefits provided falls below the standard de minima. Unclassified benefits are exempt from FBT when the taxable value of the benefit provided to each employee is $300 or less per quarter per employee and the total taxable value of all unclassified benefits provided by the employer over the past four quarters is $22,500 or less. 14 See, for example, various commentaries in 2012-13 when this was last attempted. 107 and place of work would not be a fringe benefit provided the public transport is via a bus, train, ferry, tram or cable car. This means that the employer would not have to pay FBT on such benefits. Air transport, taxis, shuttles and other services that people share access to that are provided by service providers with a physical and/or digital infrastructure network, (such as bike-sharing, ridesharing, and e-scooter hire) are not covered by the exemption. Interaction with section CX 9 (Subsidised Transport) The current concessionary provisions for certain subsidised transport (see sections CX 9, RD 33 and YA 1 “subsidised transport”) would continue to apply to situations that fall outside the application of the proposed public transport exemption in new section CX 19C, for example, where employees of an airline company are provided with free or discounted air travel. In such cases, the benefit to the employee will continue to be valued at 25% of the highest fare the employer charges the public for the equivalent transport. A consequential amendment to section CX 9 is proposed to clarify its relationship with the proposed new section CX 19C. Interaction with section CE 1 Some employer subsidised use of public transport may fall under the employment income rules in section CE 1 of the ITA rather than the FBT rules. For example, if an employer were to directly reimburse an employee in cash for their bus fare costs, that reimbursement would be employment income. The proposed amendment does not extend to those situations. From a policy perspective, there is no relative bias between car and public transport options in that situation as reimbursement of carparking costs would also be employment income. This contrasts with the example of an employer providing a bus/train pass, which would be a fringe benefit and qualify for the proposed exemption. Another example may be a public transport provider offering an arrangement whereby an employer could pay a portion (e.g. 100%, 50% or 25%) of the fare and would be billed by the public transport provider for an aggregated amount for all employees using their travel cards over the month. This would be likely to be a fringe benefit and qualify for the proposed exemption. 108 SCHEDULE 32 – OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS Clause 101 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would add nine charities to the list of donee organisations in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and rename an existing donee organisation following a restructure. Background Individual taxpayer donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 are entitled to a tax credit of 33⅓% of the monetary amount donated, up to the amount of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes that are mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. Effective date The proposed amendments w ould take effect on 1 April 2022, with the following exceptions:  the addition of Heilala Vanilla Foundation would take effect on 15 January 2022 and end on 31 March 2026  the addition of Anglican World Aid (Aotearoa) Limited would take effect on 11 April 2022  the addition of New Zealand for UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) would take effect on 15 February 2022  the removal of UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) would take effect on 1 April 2023, and  the addition of Pacific Island Food Revolution Limited would end on 31 March 2027. Key features The proposed amendments would:  Add nine charitable organisations to schedule 32 of the ITA. Donors to these charities would be eligible for tax benefits on their donations.  Change an existing reference following a restructure. Detailed analysis Additions to the list of donee organisations Anglican World Aid ( Aotearoa) Limited Anglican World Aid (Aotearoa) L imited was set up on 11 April 2022 as the humanitarian aid arm of the Anglican Missions Board of the Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia (the Missions Board). The Missions Board supports aid and development projects and coordinates appeals for emergencies (primarily in neighbouring Pacific Island nations). It is heavily involved in the aid response in Tonga 109 to the 15 January volcanic eruption and subsequent tsunami. It is active in supporting economic development projects in Kolkata, Fiji, and Tonga. Other objectives include providing relief from the effects of poverty in Mozambique and supporting Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. Anglican World Aid (Aotearoa) Limited will support the delivery of humanitarian aid projects coordinated by the Missions Board. Cotton On Foundation Limited Cotton On Foundation Limited is an Australian resident charity established by the Cotton On Group, which has a strong commercial presence in New Zealand. The Foundation’s works are directed at the relief of poverty, with a worldwide focus on impoverished communities. It supports a number of projects directed at improving educational outcomes in Uganda, Thailand, and South Africa through developing new infrastructure, such as buildings, and providing educational resources. Engineers Without Borders New Zealand Incorporated Engineers Without Borders New Zealand Incorporated (EWBNZ) supports capability- building programmes for engineering service providers in developing countries in the Pacific. Working with in-country partners, EWBNZ puts programmes in place to support learning and development outcomes for engineers and technicians. Recent projects include providing learning support for projects in Vanuatu and Kiribati. Family for Every Child New Zealand Trust Family for Every Child New Zealand Trust provides a platform for civil society organisations to collaborate and supports the exchange of knowledge and practice around children’s care by building skills in research, documentation, programme piloting, advocacy and technical assistance. It has headquarters in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as New Zealand. Forest for People Limited Forest for People Limited supports development projects and programmes directed at enhancing the welfare of indigenous communities in sensitive ecosystems. The projects create sustainable economic systems in developing countries through improving education outcomes and contributing to local employment in environmentally sustainable industries. Heilala Vanilla Foundation In response to the state of emergency in Tonga following the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption and subsequent tsunami on 15 January 2022, Heilala Vanilla Foundation has provided immediate aid in the form of food staple packs and safety equipment to assist with the remapping of the coastlines to allow boat landings to recommence on outlying islands. Heilala Vanilla Foundation’s donee status is to be time limited and end on 31 March 2026. This is because, while the Foundation is well placed to support recovery efforts following the recent tsunami, it may not have as strong a role to play in terms of Tonga’s overall future economic development. Joyya Trust Joyya Trust supports local capacity building in four communities known for extreme poverty and human trafficking in Kolkata and West Bengal, India. The Trust places special emphasis on education, local community initiatives and economic projects to alleviate urban poverty and empower women and girls into work to counteract human trafficking. 110 Pacific Island Food Revolution Limited Pacific Island Food Revolution Limited (PIFR) promotes local, healthy food in the Pacific to combat the non-communicable disease crisis through a multi-media communication programme that uses TV, social and traditional media, and community partnerships. PIFR’s aim is to use local healthy food and knowledge to underpin economic development, tourism, health and wellbeing. This is in response to the health and development crisis declared by Pacific Island Governments in 2011 and its potential impact on national development. PIFR’s donee status is to be time limited and end on 31 March 2027. This is because the charity is moving from a government grants-based model to a private donations model. The limited period will give Inland Revenue a chance to review their performance after having sufficient time to establish a donor base. Solomon Island Medical Mission Charitable Trust Solomon Island Medical Mission Charitable Trust’s primary purpose is to raise funds for a rural health clinic in Malaita and progressively upgrade its original hospital status. Work currently funded by the Trust, to be completed in the next few months, includes expanding the ablutions block and installing a water supply. Maintenance change following restructure The New Zealand Government granted UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) overseas donee status in the 2008–09 income year. UNHCR has since reviewed its fundraising activities in Australasia and has decided to create a New Zealand charitable trust - “New Zealand for UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees)”. Following this restructure, the overseas donee status should apply to this new entity instead. The insertion of “New Zealand for UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees)” would apply from 15 February 2022, with the reference to “UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees)” being removed on 1 April 2023. The overlapping references ensure that donation tax credit entitlements are preserved for existing UNHCR donors while the restructure occurs. The earlier application date was granted in respect of UNHCR’s relief work in Ukraine. 111 Housing remedial items 113 CLARIFICATION OF THE BRIGHT-LINE TEST EXCLUSION FOR INHERITED PROPERTY Clauses 6(2), 32(5) and 59 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments clarify how multiple sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) interact to provide relief under the bright-line test when residential land is transferred upon the death of the owner to the executor, administrator or relevant beneficiaries of the estate and subsequently disposed of. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background Inherited residential land is effectively exempt from the bright-line test. This outcome is achieved through three different sections in the ITA – sections CB 6A(2B), CZ 39(7), and FC 9 – but it is not always clear that they operate together. Subpart FC deals with the distribution, transmission, and gifts of property, mainly in relation to the transfer of property on the death of a person. Section FC 9 deals with the transfer of residential land on the death of a person to either the executor or administrator of the estate or a beneficiary beneficially entitled to the residential land under the terms of the deceased’s will or the rules governing intestacy. Under section FC 9(2), the bright-line test does not apply to the transfer of the land, including any intervening transfer to an executor or administrator. Sections CB 6A(2B) and CZ 39(7) state that sections CB 6A and CZ 39 do not apply to an amount derived “by an executor or administrator described in section FC 1(1)(a) (Disposals to which this subpart applies), or a beneficiary described in section FC 1(1)(b)” in disposing of that land. Effectively, this means the bright-line test does not apply if the executor or administrator of the estate or the ultimate beneficiary sells the residential land. Confusion can arise due to the wording of section FC 9(3). Section FC 9(3) provides that if the recipient disposes of the land and derives income, they take on the deceased person’s acquisition date and acquisition cost. Without knowledge of sections CB 6A(2B) and CZ 39(7), it could be incorrectly assumed that this cost base deeming rule in section FC 9(3) means a subsequent disposal of the residential land would be subject to tax under the bright-line test. The Bill proposes to amend sections, CB 6A(2B), CZ 39(7), and FC 9(2) to clarify this. 114 ROLLOVER RELIEF – BRIGHT-LINE TEST AND INTEREST LIMITATION Clauses 6(1), 7 and 8 Summary of proposed amendment Remedial amendments are proposed to the rules providing rollover relief for the bright-line test and the new interest limitation rules to ensure that the relief works as intended. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated otherwise. Effective date The proposed amendments would generally take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. However, the following amendments would take effect on 27 March 2021:  The proposed deletion of the words “and must not be to or from a person in their capacity of settlor, beneficiary, or trustee” from section CB 6AB(4).  Proposed new sections CB 6AB(5)(d) and (6)(ab), which relate to close family beneficiaries.  The proposed deletion of the words “, under section HF 2(3)(e)(i) (Who is eligible to be a Māori authority?)” from section CB 6AC(5).  Proposed new section CB 6A(1AB)(b), which provides that if rollover relief applies to a transfer, the recipient of the land would be subject to the same bright-line test as the transferor. The retrospective effect of these amendments to 27 March 2021 would mean they have the same effective date as the originally enacted provisions. Thus, they would have effect:  for the interest limitation rules, on 1 October 2021 for loans drawn down for disallowed residential property on or after 27 March 2021, and  for the bright-line test, for disposals occurring on or after 1 April 2022. Background Rollover relief under the bright-line test ensures that certain transfers of residential land are not taxed at the time of the transfer. Instead, the recipient takes on the original owner’s acquisition cost and date. When the recipient disposes of the residential land, this cost and acquisition date determines whether the disposal is taxed under the bright-line test and the amount of the gain that is taxable. In the context of interest limitation, interest deductions for residential property are being gradually phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025 for loans drawn down for residential property before 27 March 2021. For residential property loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021, interest deductions have generally been denied since 1 October 2021 except in simple refinancing scenarios. Rollover relief en sures that certain restructures of the property’s legal ownership and the accompanying loan do not kick someone out of this phasing-out period and into full interest denial before 31 March 2025 for loan amounts first drawn down before 27 March 2021. 115 Bright-line test The bright-line test, as introduced in 2015, included limited relief for certain transfers: relationship property, inherited property, and company amalgamations. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 introduced additional rollover relief rules for certain legal transfers of residential land when there is no underlying change in economic ownership. The changes extended coverage of rollover relief to the following legal structures from 1 April 2022, provided certain conditions are met:  Family trusts: standard trusts and Māori authority trusts  Look-through companies  Partnerships  Treaty of Waitangi settlements  Transfers within wholly-owned groups of companies. The extent of relief under the bright-line test for these new categories generally depends on the amount of consideration paid for the transfer:  If the transfer occurs at or below the original owner’s acquisition cost (that is, the person has not realised a gain), no tax consequences arise for the original owner if the transfer is made within the relevant bright-line period. The recipient then takes on the original owner’s bright-line start date and cost base.  If the transfer occurs for more than the original owner’s cost (that is, they have realised a profit), then that gain is taxed if the transfer is made within the relevant bright-line period. A rule that deems bright-line disposals to be made at market value is switched off to ensure any “paper profit” is not taxed. The recipient then takes on the original owner’s bright-line start date but with an updated cost base of the amount for the transfer. Interest limitation Rollover relief for interest limitation purposes is provided in the same situations as the bright-line test but with no requirement regarding consideration. The new interest limitation rules in subpart DH of the Income Tax Act 2007 deny deductions for interest incurred on loans on or after 1 October 2021 where those loans are drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 for “disallowed residential property” (DRP). Loans drawn down before 27 March 2021 are “grandparented transitional loans”, meaning that interest deductions are progressively denied over the period from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025 as “grandparented residential interest”. In limited circumstances, rollover relief is provided so that loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 also qualify as grandparented transitional loans. If certain conditions are met, section DH 5(5)(d) provides that New Zealand dollar denominated loan amounts (ignoring re-drawings or additional borrowings on or after 27 March 2021) are grandparented transitional loans to the extent the loans are for DRP for which a previous owner (the original owner) also had a loan. The loan amounts must be equal to or less than the amount of the original owner’s loan at the time the original owner transferred the property. Problems with the rules There are a number of technical issues with the rollover relief rules that apply for both bright-line test and interest limitation purposes. The rules need clarifying to ensure they operate as intended, particularly in relation to transfers to or from family trusts and transfers between different capacities. 116 Key features The following remedial amendments are proposed to clarify the rollover relief rules:  Proposed amendments to sections CB 6AB(2) and (3), and CB 6AC(2) and (3) would ensure that rollover relief applies to a transfer of residential land or DRP out of a family trust either back to the principal settlor or the group of settlors that originally transferred the land to the trust (provided that, for a group, at least one of the settlors is a principal settlor), even if the settlor (or settlors) is not an “original settlor” (as was required by the originally enacted provisions).  That rollover relief would apply to a transfer of residential land or DRP out of a family trust to a principal settlor even if the settlor did not originally transfer the residential property in question to the trust.  Proposed new sections CB 6AB(1)(b) and CB 6AC(1)(b) would provide that rollover relief would be available when residential land or DRP held in a qualifying family trust is resettled onto another family trust, provided certain conditions were met.  Proposed amendments to sections CB 6AB(3) and (4), and CB 6AC(3) and (4) would clarify the wording and intention of the provisions providing rollover relief for transfers involving multiple legal structures or between different legal capacities.  Proposed amendments to the definition of “close family beneficiary” in section CB 6AB(6) would include a company in which a 50 percent or more voting interest (or a 50 percent or more market value interest if a market value circumstance exists) is owned by a beneficiary that is a principal settlor of the trust, and the trustee of another trust if at least one beneficiary of the other trust is a close family associate of a beneficiary of the first trust.  Proposed amendment to section CB 6AC(5) would ensure that rollover relief would be available for certain transfers to or from qualifying family trusts that are Māori authorities, or eligible to be Māori authorities, regardless of how they are eligible to be Māori authorities.  Proposed new section CB 6A(1AB)(b) would clarify that when any of the rollover relief provisions applies to a transfer of residential land, the recipient of the land should be subject to the same bright-line test as the transferor was (that is, two, five or ten years). Detailed analysis Transfers to settlors (sections CB 6AB(2) and (3), and CB 6AC(2) and (3)) Rollover relief is available under either section CB 6AB(2) or CB 6AC(2) for a transfer of residential land or DRP from a qualifying family trust back to the settlors of the trust, provided certain conditions are met. One such condition is that the settlor must have originally transferred the land to the trust – or, in other words, they were the original owner of the land. Consequently, rollover relief is not currently available for transfers of residential land or DRP from the trust to the settlor where the settlor instead made cash settlements on the trust or guaranteed its obligations to enable the trust to acquire the land. Also, because the settlor must be an “original settlor” (meaning they made the original settlement of property on the trust), rollover relief is not currently available if the land is transferred to a person who became a principal settlor of the trust after the original settlement of property on the trust. This applies even if the settlor was in fact the original owner of the land and had become a principal settlor at, or by, the time they transferred the land to the trustee. The Bill therefore proposes to replace existing sections CB 6AB(2) and (3) and CB 6AC(2) and (3) with redrafted versions that would clarify that rollover relief would apply in these situations. 117 Note that the proposed amendments would also replace existing sections CB 6AB(1) and CB 6AC(1). However, these amendments are not intended as a policy change, but rather a streamlining of the provisions in the style of new sections CB 6AB(2) and CB 6AC(2). Removal of “original settlor” requirement Proposed new section CB 6AB(2)(a) provides that the bright-line acquisition date for land when a settlor of a family trust (the transferee) disposes of the land is the bright- line acquisition date of the trustee (being the previous owner), provided the following conditions are met:  the trustee transfers the land to the transferee(s) on or after 1 April 2022  if there is more than one transferee, the transferees acquire proportionally the same amount of land they originally transferred to the trustee, and  at the time that the trustee transfers the land to the transferee(s): – all transferees are beneficiaries of the trust – at least one transferee is a principal settlor, and – the trust is a “rollover trust”. The definition of “rollover trust” in section CB 6AB(5) is also proposed to be amended, so that it would mean, at the time of a relevant transfer to or from the trust:  all principal settlors are beneficiaries of the trust  all principal settlors are close family associates, 15 and  all beneficiaries are close family beneficiaries. 16 This would remove the “original settlor” requirement in the currently enacted provision, meaning that rollover relief would apply under section CB 6AB in the situation where a settlor receives land back from a qualifying family trust that the settlor previously sold the land to, or settled the land on – including in circumstances where the transferee is not the “original settlor” of the trust. Proposed new section CB 6AC(2)(a) similarly provides that, for a settlor of a Māori rollover trust, the bright-line acquisition date for land when the settlor (the transferee) disposes of it is the bright-line acquisition date of the Māori trustee (being the previous owner), provided the following conditions are met:  the Māori trustee transfers the land to the transferee(s) on or after 1 April 2022  if there is more than one transferee, the transferees are all settlors of the trust and acquire proportionally the same amount of land they originally transferred to the Māori trustee, and 15 Two people are “close family associates” under section CB 6AB(7) if they are within four degrees of blood relationship, or are married, in a civil union or de facto relationship, or one person is within four degrees of blood relationship to the other person’s spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner. 16 “Close family beneficiary” would be defined in proposed new section CB 6AB(6) to mean, for the relevant trust, a beneficiary that is one or more of the following: a principal settlor; a trustee of another trust and at least one beneficiary of the other trust is a close family associate of a beneficiary of the relevant trust; a close family associate of another beneficiary who is also a principal settlor; a company in which a 50 percent or more voting interest, or a 50 percent or more market value interest if a market value circumstance exists, is owned by a beneficiary who is a principal settlor or a close family associate of another beneficiary who is a principal settlor; or a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. 118  at the time that the trustee transfers the land to the transferee(s): – all transferees are beneficiaries of the trust – the trust is a “Māori rollover trust”. It is proposed to amend the definition of “Māori rollover trust” in section CB 6AC(4) so that it would mean, at the time of a relevant transfer:  all beneficiaries of the trust are either members of the same iwi or hapū, or descendants of the same tipuna (living or dead), and  the land is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. Provided the above conditions are met, rollover relief would apply if the trustee is a Māori authority or eligible to be one (see the definition of “Māori trustee” in section CB 6AC(5)). Example 31: Sale to family trust by non-original settlor In 2005, Martha settles a new family trust, with herself, her husband Bill and their children, Jack and Sean, as the beneficiaries of the trust. In 2007, Jack makes substantial settlements on the trust such that he becomes the principal settlor. In 2009, Jack acquires an investment property for $250,000. He later sells it to the trust in May 2019 for $600,000. In November 2022, the trust sells the property back to Jack for $600,000, even though the market value of the property is now over $1 million. At the time of the sale, Jack is still the principal settlor of the trust. As the amount paid by Jack for the property is equal to the amount the trustee originally paid for the property, full rollover relief would apply to the transfer under the proposed amendments. This means that the trust would not be subject to tax under the bright-line test on the transfer of the property to Jack in November 2022. This is because the trustee would be treated as disposing of the land at cost, meaning that their net income arising under the bright-line test is zero. Jack would be deemed to have a bright-line acquisition date of May 2019 for the land (being the date the trustee acquired the property) and a cost base of $600,000. Principal settlor not original owner of land Proposed new section CB 6AB(2)(b) would provide another route for rollover relief to apply when residential land or DRP is transferred from a qualifying family trust (referred to as a “rollover trust” in the legislation) to a principal settlor. Proposed new section CB 6AB(2)(b) would provide rollover relief when land is transferred from a rollover trust to a settlor or group of settlors, provided all settlors receiving the land are principal settlors at both the time the land is acquired by the trustee and the time the trustee transfers the land to the settlor(s). Rollover relief would not apply to transfers to settlors who are not principal settlors of the trust either at the time the land was acquired by the trustee or the time the trustee transfers the land. This timing requirement is to ensure that a beneficiary of the trust cannot become a principal settlor immediately before the transfer to them just so that they receive the land without bright-line test tax implications. It also 119 ensures that rollover relief does not apply to a transfer to someone who is no longer a principal settlor of the trust. Example 32: Transfer from family trust to principal settlor who made cash settlement on trust In August 2019, Nikki decides to settle a family trust with himself, his father, William, and his sister, Mary, as the beneficiaries of the trust. The only property settled on the trust at that time is $900,000 in cash contributed by Nikki, making Nikki the principal settlor of the trust (being the settlor whose settlements for the trust are greatest or greatest equal). Shortly afterward, in September 2019, the trustee uses the funds settled on the trust by Nikki to purchase a residential property for $850,000. In January 2023, the trustee transfers the property to Nikki for its cost of $850,000, even though at that time it is worth $1.2 million. At the time of the transfer, Nikki is still a principal settlor of the trust. Mary is also a principal settlor as she made a cash settlement on the trust of $900,000 in December 2019. As the amount paid by Nikki for the property is equal to the amount the trustee originally paid for the property, full rollover relief would apply to the transfer under the proposed amendments. This means that the trust would not be subject to tax under the bright-line test on the transfer of the property to Nikki in January 2023. This is because the trustee would be treated as disposing of the land at cost, meaning that their net income arising under the bright-line test is zero. Nikki would be deemed to have a bright-line acquisition date of September 2019 for the land (being the date the trustee acquired the property) and a cost base of $850,000. If the property had instead been transferred by the trustee to Mary, that transfer would not have qualified for rollover relief. This is because Mary was not a principal settlor at the time the land was acquired by the trustee. Resettlements of family trusts (sections CB 6AB(1)(b) and CB 6AC(1)(b)) Proposed new sections CB 6AB(1)(b) and CB 6AC(1)(b) would provide that rollover relief would be available when residential land or DRP held in a qualifying family trust (the head trust) was resettled onto another family trust (trust A). If certain conditions are met, proposed new section CB 6AB(1) (b) would provide that a person holding residential land as trustee of a sub-trust (trust A), where the land was transferred to them from a head trust, would have the same bright-line acquisition date for the land that the trustee of the head trust had. This treatment would apply if trust A and the head trust were both rollover trusts and if, for trust A:  all the beneficiaries were the same as for the head trust, or  all the natural person beneficiaries were either the same as, or close family associates of a principal settlor of, the head trust. In other words, rollover relief would only be available if both trusts met all the usual requirements for rollover relief in section CB 6AB(5). To qualify for rollover relief, each natural person beneficiary of trust A would have to be a close family beneficiary, or in the case of other principal settlors, each principal settlor would have to be a close family associate of the other principal settlors. At a 120 minimum, each natural person beneficiary of trust A would have to also be a principal settlor, or a close family associate of a principal settlor, of the head trust. Trust A may not necessarily have the same beneficiaries as the head trust. However, provided the above conditions were met this would not preclude the resettlement from qualifying for rollover relief. For example, if an additional generation is added to trust A’s beneficiaries, rollover relief would still be available if the close family beneficiary requirements were satisfied. Rollover relief would also apply even if the principal settlor of the head t rust is deceased. Example 33: Resettlement of family trust Dr X is the principal settlor and a beneficiary of his family trust, which meets the definition of a “rollover trust” in proposed new section CB 6AB(5). In April 2021, the trustee of the trust resettles the trust property, which includes residential land on a new family trust. The beneficiaries of the new family trust include relatives of Dr X within four degrees of blood relationship and their spouses, as well as a couple of registered charities. Aside from Dr X, the new trust has one other principal settlor, Dr X’s wife, Mrs X, who is also a beneficiary of the trust. Because the new trust would meet the requirements of the proposed amendments to sections CB 6AB(5)(b) to (d), including that all principal settlors (including Dr X) are close family associates and all beneficiaries are close family beneficiaries as defined in proposed section CB 6AB(6), and the transfer to the new trust at nil consideration is for less than the cost of the land to the trustee of the head trust, the transfer of the residential land from the head trust to the new trust would qualify for full rollover relief. This means that the trustee of the head trust would be treated as disposing of the land at cost, meaning that their net income arising under the bright-line test would be zero, and the trustees of the new trust would be deemed to have the same bright-line acquisition date and cost base for the land as the trustee of the head trust. Proposed new section CB 6AC(1)(b) would similarly provide rollover relief for resettlements of Māori rollover trusts. It is proposed to amend the definition of “Māori rollover trust” in section CB 6AC(4) so that it would mean, at the time of a relevant transfer:  all beneficiaries of the trust are either members of the same iwi or hapū, or descendants of the same tipuna (living or dead), and  the land is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. Provided that the head trust and sub-trust (trust A) have the same beneficiaries and are both Māori rollover trusts, rollover relief would apply under section CB 6AC(1)(b) if, for each of the trusts, the trustee is a Māori authority or is eligible to be one (see the definition of “Māori trustee” in section CB 6AC(5)). As with the rule for general family trusts above, this would include the situation where one of the settlors of the head trust is deceased. Transfers to self but in a different capacity and transfers involving multiple legal structures (sections CB 6AB(3) and (4), CB 6AC(3) and (4)) Section CB 6AB provides rollover relief for transfers of residential land or DRP to trusts, partnerships and look-through companies (LTCs), as well as transfers out of 121 these structures to the land’s original owner. For example, rollover relief is provided for the transfer of residential land held on family trust back to the original settlor. Rollover relief is also provided if that person then decides to transfer the land to an LTC of which they are the sole shareholder. For efficiency, it makes sense to provide rollover relief where the same result is achieved in one transaction, rather than two. Existing section CB 6AB(3) accordingly provides rollover relief for such composite transfers, as does section CB 6AC(3) for composite transfers involving family trusts that are Māori authorities or are eligible to be Māori authorities. The rules provide rollover relief where the original owner receives the residential land from the legal structure but in a different capacity, for example, if the settlor of a family trust receives the land from the trust in their capacity as a shareholder of an LTC. However, these provisions contain some wording errors and ambiguous phrasing, and as a result the meaning and intention of these provisions is not clear. Existing section CB 6AB(4) provides rollover relief if a person transfers residential land or DRP to themselves in a different capacity (such as a shareholder in an LTC or a partner in a partnership) and there is no intervening transfer to a third party. Similarly, this provision also contains some wording inaccuracies. Therefore, the following amendments are proposed to clarify the effect and intention of these provisions:  Redrafting sections CB 6AB(3) and CB 6AC(3) so that the proportionality and capacity rules are in separate provisions, rather than being combined into a single provision as at present. The proportionality rule 17 is proposed to be shifted to sections CB 6AB(2) and CB 6AC(2), while the capacity rule is proposed to remain in sections CB 6AB(3) and CB 6AC(3), albeit in a revised form. The latter amendment would remove the references to a person having a capacity “other than settlor or original settlor” in favour of stating that the transferors or transferees (as applicable) may have a different capacity for the purposes of subsections (1)(a) and (2) from the one in which they became a settlor of the trust.  Removing the requirement in section CB 6AB(4) that the transfer “must not be to or from a person in their capacity of settlor, beneficiary or trustee”. This wording was originally inserted with the aim of making it clear that either section CB 6AB(3) or CB 6AC(3) is the relevant rollover provision that applies when land is transferred from a trustee of a family trust to the original settlors’ LTC or partnership (or to the LTC owners or partners in the instance when it was the LTC or the partnership that originally transferred the land to the family trust), but the chosen wording was imprecise and caused confusion. Definition of “close family beneficiary” (section CB 6AB(6)) Amendments are proposed to the definition of “close family beneficiary” in section CB 6AB(6) as follows:  Adding a new paragraph (ab ) so that the definition would include a trustee of another trust if at least one beneficiary of the other trust is a close family associate of a beneficiary of the relevant trust. The words “or trustees of another trust and at least one beneficiary of the other trust is a close family beneficiary of the relevant trust” in section CB 6AB(5)(d) would be deleted.  Expanding the scope of paragraph (c) so that it would include a company in which a 50 percent or more voting interest – or a 50 percent or more market value interest, if a market value circumstance exists – is owned by a beneficiary that is a 17 Basically, the rule is that when land is transferred from a family trust back to a group of settlors who originally transferred the land to the trust, the settlors should acquire proportionally the same amount of land they each held before it was transferred to the trust. 122 principal settlor (see new subparagraph (i)). This would be in addition to the existing inclusion of a company in which a 50 percent or more voting interest (or market value interest) is owned by a beneficiary that is a close family associate of another beneficiary that is a principal settlor (now contained in subparagraph (ii)). Māori family trusts rollover relief (section CB 6AC(5)) Section CB 6AC provides rollover relief for transfers of land subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 to or from a trust that is either a Māori authority or eligible to be a Māori authority, and where all beneficiaries are members of the same iwi or hapū or are descendants of the same tīpuna. This is intended to mirror the general family trust rollover rule while recognising that Māori family trusts may be structured differently. The policy intent is that rollover relief should be available regardless of the reason why the trustee is a Māori authority or eligible to be one. However, the current provision is restricted to situations where the trustee is (or is eligible to be) a Māori authority who, on behalf of Māori claimants, receives and manages assets that are transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under the Treaty of Waitangi. This is because the existing section CB 6AC(5) specifically refers to a trustee of a trust that is either a Māori authority, or eligible to elect to be a Māori authority, under section HF 2(3)(e)(i). 18 This restriction is not necessary because another section provides rollover relief for Treaty of Waitangi settlements. Accordingly, an amendment is proposed to section CB 6AC(5) to delete the cross-reference to section HF 2(3)(e)(i) so that the provision would apply to any trust that is eligible to elect to be a Māori authority. Relevant bright-line period (section CB 6A(1AB)(b)) When a transfer of residential land is eligible for rollover relief, the intent is that the bright-line period does not reset. This includes both the start date of the bright-line period (that is, when the “clock” runs from) and which bright-line test applies (for example, the five-year or ten-year test). The start date of the bright-line period is determined by the date on which legal title was transferred, whereas which bright-line test applies is determined by the date of acquisition (generally when a person enters into the agreement to purchase a property). The current wording of the legislation provides that, when rollover relief applies, the recipient only takes on the original owner’s bright-line start date, not the underlying acquisition date. 19 This means that, while the start date does not reset, the recipient becomes subject to a ten-year bright-line period if the transfer is made on or after 27 March 2021. For example, a property acquired in 2016 would have been subject to the two-year test and could have been disposed of without tax under the bright-line test from 2018 onwards. However, if a transfer eligible for rollover relief occurs in 2022, the recipient would become subject to the ten-year bright-line test and would need to retain the property until 2026 to be able to dispose of the property without tax under the bright-line test. This is not the policy intent, and so the Bill would insert new section CB 6A(1AB)(b) to ensure that the recipient would also take on the relevant bright-line test length and other settings – including where no bright-line test applies because the land was originally acquired before 1 October 2015. 18 Section HF 2(3) sets out the circumstances in which the trustees of a trust are eligible to make an election to become a Māori authority. Paragraph (e)(i) of that section applies to the trustees of a trust who, on behalf of Māori claimants, receive and manage assets that are transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under the Treaty of Waitangi. 19 See sections CB 6AB(1), (2), (4), CB 6AC(1), (2), CB 6AE(1) and FB 3A(3). 123 Proposed new section CB 6A(1AB)(b) would provide that the ten-year bright-line test (section CB 6A) would not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of section CB 6AB, CB 6AC or CB 6AE and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 27 March 2021. Example 34: Land purchased before 27 March 2021 and sold to owners’ LTC after 27 March 2021 Geoff and his wife, Tate, purchase residential land in their own names for $670,000 on 6 May 2018, each of them holding a 50 percent share of the land. On 17 July 2023, they sell the land to a look-through company, A Co, that they jointly own 50:50, for $950,000. The market value of the land at that time is $1.12 million. Geoff and Tate are subject to the five-year bright-line test for the land, but because they held the land for five years before selling it to A Co, there is no tax liability under the bright-line test. Under the proposed amendments, partial relief would apply to the sale to A Co, meaning that A Co would take on Geoff and Tate’s original acquisition date of 6 May 2018 but not their acquisition cost of $670,000. A Co’s cost base would instead be the amount of consideration it provided, being $950,000. A Co would also be subject to the five-year bright-line test for the land, being the bright-line test period that Geoff and Tate were subject to. 124 CHANGES IN CO-OWNERSHIP OF RESIDENTIAL LAND Clauses 6(1), (3) to (6) and 32(1) to (4) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would clarify the application and effect of sections CB 6A(5B) and (5C), and CZ 39(5B) and (5C) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), which concern changes in co-ownership of residential land. A further amendment would clarify which bright-line test applies to shares in residential land that a person acquires at different times. Effective date The proposed amendments to section CB 6A would take effect on 27 March 2021. The proposed amendments to section CZ 39 would take effect on 29 March 2018. Background The bright-line test provides that income from the disposal of residential land is taxable when the disposal is within 10 years of the instrument of title being registered under the Land Transfer Act 2017. 20 The bright-line test was originally introduced as a two-year test. The two-year bright- line period applied for residential land acquired on or after 1 October 2015 and up to 28 March 2018. A five-year test applies for residential land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and up to 26 March 2021, and the 10-year bright-line test applies to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021. When there is a change to the shares that co-owners have in residential land, or where a co-owner is added or removed, the disposal of the share that changes hands may be subject to tax under the bright-line test. The start of the bright-line period should reset only for the ownership share that has changed hands. Similarly, when a joint tenancy is converted to a tenancy in common or vice versa, the start of the bright-line period should only reset to the extent that the co-owners’ proportional ownership shares (or nominal shares) in the land have changed. Provisions to clarify this were included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022, but they contain a number of wording inaccuracies and ambiguities. There is also a transitional issue relating to which bright-line test applies and whether different tests apply to shares a person acquires at different times. The application provisions for the earlier two-year and five-year tests provide that they apply when someone first acquires an interest in residential land on or after 1 October 2015 and 29 March 2018 respectively. However, the application provision for the 10-year test omits the word “first”. Key features The following remedial amendments are proposed to the bright-line rules in sections CB 6A and CZ 39:  In the provisions concerning changes to the form of co-ownership of residential land, it is proposed that references to a joint tenancy or tenancy in common being 20 In some cases, a different start date may apply. 125 “acquired” be amended to refer to the form of tenancy being “converted”. This would better reflect that the provision is concerned with changes to the form of co- ownership rather than the acquisition of land.  Proposed amendments would clarify that, when a person disposes of land, the bright-line test length and associated settings that will apply depend on when the person first acquired an interest in the land. If they acquired an interest in residential land before 27 March 2021 and then acquired an additional interest or share in the land after that date, when the land is sold it will all fall into the bright- line test length (and associated settings) that applied at the time they acquired their first interest in the land being sold. Detailed analysis Changes in the form of co-ownership (sections CB 6A(5B), (5C), CZ 39(5B) and (5C)) Under a joint tenancy, co-owners do not have defined shares in the property. However, when considering how the bright-line test applies to conversions between joint tenancy and tenancy in common, joint tenants are seen as equal co-owners. For example, for two co-owners of a property held under a joint tenancy, each co-owner is considered to hold a notional 50 percent, and for four co-owners, each is considered to hold a notional 25 percent. While the registration of a transfer instrument to effect a change in the form of co- ownership of land should not be considered a disposal for the bright-line test, registration of a transfer instrument under the Land Transfer Act 2017 sets the start date of the bright-line period. 21 As such, a question arose as to whether the registration of a transfer instrument to change the form of co-ownership of a parcel of land would reset the bright-line “clock”, meaning the bright-line period would start again from that point. New sections CB 6A(5B) and (5C), and CZ 39(5B) and (5C) of the ITA were introduced by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 to clarify that the bright-line clock is not reset when a transfer instrument is registered to effect a change in the form of co-ownership of land to the extent the economic ownership of the land has not changed. Sections CB 6A(5B) and CZ 39(5B) apply when a joint tenancy is converted to a tenancy in common, while sections CB 6A(5C) and CZ 39(5C) apply in the reverse situation when a tenancy in common is converted to a joint tenancy. The intent of these provisions is to provide that the bright-line acquisition date of residential land held under a tenancy in common or joint tenancy is not impacted by a change to a different form of co-ownership. However, the existing provisions state that the bright- line acquisition date is the date the joint tenancy 22 or the tenancy in common in equal shares 23 was “acquired”, which is not technically correct. Consistent with IS 22/03, those forms of co-ownership are not things that can be owned (and, therefore, acquired), so it is more accurate to refer to the date the form of co-ownership is changed. Amendments are therefore proposed to replace the references to the date the tenancy was “acquired” with references to the date the tenancy was “converted”. 21 For further information, see IS 22/03 “Income Tax – Application of the land sale rules to co- ownership changes and changes of trustees” available at https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/interpretation-statements/2022/is-22-03 . 22 In the case of a conversion from a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common – see existing section CB 6A(5B). 23 In the case of a conversion from a tenancy in common to a joint tenancy – see existing section CB 6A(5C). 126 The provisions also refer to the bright-line acquisition date (which is when the bright- line “clock” runs from) being the date the tenancy in common or joint tenancy (as appropriate) was acquired. However, the date the bright-line clock should run from is whatever date it ran from before the change to the form of co-ownership. This will typically be the date the land was originally transferred to the co-owners, not the date the land was originally “acquired” (which is typically when a sale and purchase agreement was entered into). Conversion from joint tenancy to tenancy in common Proposed new section CB 6A(5B) would provide that, when a joint tenancy is converted to a tenancy in common, the bright-line acquisition date for the definitions of “10-year test land” and “5-year test land” is the same as it was before the conversion. For the five-year bright-line test (which applies to disposals of residential land first acquired on or after 29 March 2018), proposed new section CZ 39(5B) would provide that when a joint tenancy is converted to a tenancy in common, an amount that a person derives from disposing of the land is income of the person if the disposal date is within five years of the date that was the person’s bright-line acquisition date for the land before the conversion. Example 35: Change from a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common Tony and Greta started a relationship in 2015. Both have children from previous relationships. In 2019, Tony and Greta purchased a rental property together as joint tenants. Two years later, they decide that, in the event of one of them dying, they want the share of the partner who dies to go to that partner’s children. In June 2021, LINZ registered their land transfer to change their ownership of the property from a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common (50:50). For the bright-line test to apply, there must have been a disposal of residential land by Tony and/or Greta. In this case, there has not been a disposal of land by either of them. Tony and Greta own the same land (the estate in fee simple) before and after the transfer. Before the transfer, they each had an interest in the whole of the property and a notional equal separate share (that is, 50 percent) they had the right to sever during their lifetime. After the transfer, they each still have an interest in the whole of the property, and they each now have a present entitlement to a 50 percent share. No land has passed from one party to another. Under the proposed amendments, the bright-line acquisition date is not reset in June 2021 when LINZ registered the transfer to change the form of co-ownership of the property. Tony and Greta’s bright-line period still starts on the date in 2019 when the property was originally transferred to Tony and Greta. Conversion from tenancy in common to joint tenancy Proposed new section CB 6A(5C) would provide that, when a tenancy in common is converted to a joint tenancy, the bright-line acquisition date for the definitions of “10- year test land” and “5-year test land” is the same as it was before the conversion. For the five-year bright-line test, proposed new section CZ 39(5C) would provide that when a tenancy in common is converted to a joint tenancy, an amount that a person derives from disposing of the land is income of the person if the disposal date is within five years of the date that was the person’s bright-line acquisition date for the land before the conversion. 127 Relevant bright-line period (section CB 6A(1AB)(a)) Proposed new section CB 6A(1AB)(a) would provide that the 10-year bright-line test (section CB 6A) does not apply to land if the person first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 27 March 2021.This would ensure that, when a person acquires a part share in residential land before 27 March 2021 and subsequently acquires an additional share in the same land on or after 27 March 2021, when the land is sold it will all fall into the bright-line test length and associated settings that applied at the time they acquired their first interest in the land. Example 36: Part share acquired in 2018 and additional share acquired in December 2021 In July 2018, Sarah and Hans bought a rental property as 50:50 owners. Sarah’s financial position changes in 2021, and so she asks Hans if he is interested in buying out her share of the property. He is keen to do this, so he buys Sarah’s 50 percent share at market value. LINZ registers the transfer in December 2021, and the register shows that the land is now held solely by Hans. This means that, for the bright-line test, Sarah has disposed of a 50 percent share in the land. The amount that Sarah sold the 50 percent share to Hans for is income to Sarah under the bright-line test, as the disposal was within the relevant bright- line period (five years). Sarah can deduct the amount she paid for her original 50 percent share of the property. Under the proposed amendments, when Hans eventually sells the rental property, it would be subject to the five-year bright line test – being the relevant bright-line test that applies if the owner first acquired an estate or interest in the residential land between (and including) 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. Note, however, that Hans has a July 2018 bright-line acquisition date for 50 percent of the land but a December 2021 bright-line acquisition date for the 50 percent share acquired that month. Therefore, if Hans sells the rental property before the relevant date in December 2026, 50 percent of the amount from the sale would be income under the bright-line test. 128 UPDATES TO DEFINITIONS USED FOR INTEREST LIMITATION RULES AND THE BRIGHT-LINE TEST Clauses 9, 35, 98(4) and (18) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would update the definitions of “business premises”, “principal settlor” and “settlement”, which are used for the bright-line test and the interest limitation rules. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 27 March 2021. Background The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 and the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 introduced several changes to the way residential property is taxed in New Zealand. This included changes to the bright-line test and the introduction of the interest limitation rules. Many existing defined terms were used, but in some situations the corresponding definitions were not updated. In addition, when a term is used for more than one regime, it is considered appropriate to define the term in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) rather than within the regime for which it was first used. Key features The proposed amendments would update the following defined terms to better reflect their relevance for the interest limitation rules and bright-line test:  business premises,  principal settlor, and  settlement Detailed analysis Business premises The interest limitation rules in subpart DH of the ITA do not apply to the extent disallowed residential property is used as business premises. However, the section YA 1 definition of “business premises” states it “is defined in section DD 11 (Some definitions) for the purposes of subpart DD (Entertainment expenditure) and the land sales provisions”. “Land sales provisions” is defined in section EL 3 only for the purposes of subpart EL and comprises sections CB 6A to CB 15 and CZ 39. The Bill proposes to repeal the definition of “business premises” in section DD 11 and move the substantive definition to section YA 1. The proposed updated definition in section YA 1 would apply for the purposes of subpart DD and DH, as well as sections CB 6A to CB 15 and CZ 39. 129 Principal settlor The term “principal settlor” is relevant when determining whether rollover relief is available for the interest limitation rules and the bright-line test in certain family trust situations. It is also used to determine whether the main home exception applies for the bright-line test and interest limitation rules. Before the enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022, “principal settlor” was defined in section CB 16A(7) and applied for the purposes of section CB 16A, section CZ 40, and subpart EL. The section YA 1 definition of “principal settlor” previously simply referred back to section CB 16A(7). To account for the broader application of the term, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 replicated the section CB 16A(7) definition in section YA 1. However, the now redundant definition in section CB 16A(7) was not repealed. Therefore, the Bill proposes to repeal the definition of “principal settlor” in section CB 16A(7). Settlement “Settlement” is defined in section YA 1. Paragraph (c) of that definition provides a specific definition of “settlement” for the definition of “principal settlor” in section CB 16A(7). In line with the proposed repeal of the definition of “principal settlor” in section CB 16A(7), the Bill proposes to remove this reference to section CB 16A(7) in the definition of “settlement”. Paragraph (c) of the definition of “settlement” would continue to apply for the definition of “principal settlor” as defined in section YA 1. 130 INTERPOSED ENTITIES – PROPERTY EXCLUDED FROM CALCULATION OF INTERPOSED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PERCENTAGE Clause 39(1) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would ensure that all disallowed residential property (DRP) that is excluded from the interest limitation rules is also excluded from the calculation of the interposed residential property (IRP) percentage of an interposed residential property holder (IRPH). Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 27 March 2021. Background The interposed entity rules support the integrity of the interest limitation rules in subpart DH of the Income Tax Act 2007. The rules deny interest deductions for taxpayers who indirectly hold DRP through an IRPH and borrow money to acquire ownership interests in, or become a beneficiary of, the IRPH. An IRPH is a company or trust that has DRP as a percentage of its total assets that exceeds a specified percentage. The rules deny interest deductions for a person based on the IRP percentage of the IRPH. Section DH 6 contains the rules for calculating the IRP percentage of an IRPH. Section DH 6(1) sets out the following formula to calculate the IRP percentage: disqualified assets ÷ total assets. Section DH 6(2) defines the items used in the formula. Section DH 6(2)(a) provides that “disqualified assets” is the value of the IRPH’s DRP. Section DH 6(2)(a)(i) excludes from “disqualified assets” property described in sections DH 4(1) to (3). Sections DH 4(1) to (5) provide subpart DH does not apply to interest incurred in relation to the land described in those sections, and section DH 4(6) provides that subpart DH does not apply to Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities and its wholly- owned subsidiaries. However, while property described in sections DH 4(1) to (3) is expressly excluded from “disqualified assets” in section DH 6, property described in sections DH 4(4) to (6) is not. As a result, under current law taxpayers who borrow money to acquire such property through an IRPH will be denied deductions for interest on the borrowed money. This result was unintended, and the proposed amendment rectifies this. Key features The proposed amendment excludes all DRP described in section DH 4 from the definition of “disqualified assets” in section DH 6. This would ensure that DRP that is subject to an exemption is not treated as a “disqualified asset”. 131 INTERPOSED ENTITIES – WHEN DRP IS A MIXED-USE ASSET Clause 39(2) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would ensure the interposed entity rules apply where disallowed residential property (DRP) is held through a close company by providing that property that is DRP and a mixed-use asset (MuA) is not excluded from the definition of “disqualified assets”. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 27 March 2021. Background The interposed entity rules support the integrity of the interest limitation rules in subpart DH of the Income Tax Act 2007. They deny interest deductions for taxpayers who indirectly hold DRP through interposed residential property holders (IRPHs) and borrow money to acquire ownership interests in such entities. They work by denying interest deductions based on an IRPH’s interposed residential property (IRP) percentage. The MuA rules in subpart DG deal with the deductibility and apportionment of expenditure incurred in relation to specified types of assets that are used partly for income-earning purposes, partly for private purposes, and not at all for at least 62 days in an income year. This means that DRP, such as a holiday home, can be a MuA. Section DH 6 contains the rules for calculating the IRP percentage of an IRPH. Section DH 6(1) sets out the following formula to calculate the IRP percentage: disqualified assets ÷ total assets. Section DH 6(2) defines the items used in the formula. Section DH 6(2)(a) provides that “disqualified assets” is the value of the IRPH’s DRP. Section DH 6(2)(a)(ii) excludes property that is subject to subpart DG from “disqualified assets”. The effect of the exclusion in section DH 6(2)(a)(ii) is that a close company that holds DRP that is a MuA may not be an IRPH. This would occur if, for example, a person borrows to acquire shares in a close company that only holds a holiday home, and that holiday home is used for private purposes and to earn income (and is not used for at least 62 days in an income year). In such a case, the MuA rules would allow an apportioned interest deduction based on the time that the holiday home is used to earn income. This result was unintended. T he policy intent is that the interest deduction should be fully denied under the interest limitation rules. The proposed amendment would rectify this. 132 DENIAL OF DEDUCTIONS ON FOREIGN CURRENCY LOANS Clause 41 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would repeal section DH 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which is redundant. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 27 March 2021, the date the provision originally applied from. Background Section DH 9 currently overrides sections DH 8(2) and (3) to deny all interest deductions on foreign currency loans in two situations. Phasing out of deductions Interest on a loan to fund disallowed residential property is denied a deduction under section DH 8(1). However, if the interest is grandparented residential interest, the interest deductions are phased out under section DH 8(2).Section DH 9 provides that, despite section DH 8(2), deductions are denied for all interest on foreign currency loans. This was to ensure that phased-out deductions are not available for foreign currency loans due to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates during the phasing-out period. However, foreign currency loans are already excluded from the application of section DH 8(2) because they cannot generate grandparented residential interest. Under section DH 5(5) a “grandparented transitional loan means loan amounts denominated in New Zealand dollars...”. As a foreign currency loan cannot be denominated in New Zealand dollars, it cannot be a grandparented transitional loan and cannot generate grandparented residential interest. Therefore, the phasing out of deductions in section DH 8(2) cannot apply to a foreign currency loan. It is therefore unnecessary for section DH 9 to override section DH 8(2). Interposed close companies Deductions are also denied for interest incurred to acquire an interest in a close company that is an interposed residential property holder. The formula in section DH 8(3) denies a portion of interest incurred by the shareholder in proportion to the amount of disallowed residential property held by the interposed residential property holder. There is no reason for section DH 9 to override this apportionment for a foreign currency loan. Section DH 9 is therefore redundant. The proposed amendment would repeal section DH 9. 133 MIXED-USE ASSET RULES – APPORTIONMENT OF INTEREST FOR DRP Clauses 37 and 38 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would correct a minor drafting error to ensure that interest incurred by a person, including a close company, on disallowed residential property (DRP) that is a mixed-use asset (MuA) is apportioned, separately from any other expenditure, under the formula in section DG 9(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 27 March 2021. Background The MuA rules are in subpart DG of the ITA and apply to natural persons and to close companies. Under the rules, interest incurred by natural persons for a MuA is apportioned between income-earning use, private use, and no use, using the formula in section DG 9(2). Interest incurred by close companies is apportioned under the applicable formula in section DG 11. The rules allow a deduction for the interest apportioned to income-earning use. The policy intent is that interest incurred by a close company for DRP that is a MuA is to be apportioned using the formula in section DG 9(2) and subject to the interest limitation rules in subpart DH. The legislation does not currently achieve this intent because interest incurred by a close company for DRP that is a MuA is not subject to the MuA rules. This is because, when the interest limitation rules were enacted, interest incurred by a close company for DRP that is a MuA was removed from apportionment under the applicable formula in section DG 11 and no provision was included for such interest to be apportioned using the formula in section DG 9(2). The current legislation is also not clear that interest incurred for DRP that is a MuA is to be apportioned separately from other expenditure under the formula in section DG 9(2). This is because the definition of the item “expenditure” in section DG 9(3)(a) aggregates all expenditure. Separate apportionment is required because if the apportioned interest is denied under section DH 8, it may be allowed under section DH 11 on the disposal of the DRP that is a MuA if the amount derived is taxable income. Key features The proposed amendments would insert new section DG 5(2)(d) and amend existing section DG 11(1)(b) to ensure that a person (being a natural person or a close company) must apportion interest for DRP that is a MuA using the formula in section DG 9(2) and must treat that interest as the item “expenditure” in section DG 9(3)(a). 134 PARTITIONING OF LAND AMONG CO-OWNERS Clause 98(6) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would ensure that the allocation of subdivided land among the co-owners of the original undivided land does not constitute a disposal for the land sales provisions. Effective date The proposed amendment would have effect for partitions occurring on or after 27 March 2021. For partitions occurring before 27 March 2021, Inland Revenue would not apply resources to identify non-compliance based on the current law interpretation. Background Taxpayers sometimes purchase land together as co-owners to pool resources. It is not uncommon in this situation for the co-owners to then subdivide the land and allocate the subdivided parcels to each of the co-owners based on their ownership interests in the original parcel. This is known as partitioning. Inland Revenue’s Tax Counsel Office (TCO) consulted on a draft Interpretation Statement in 2021 that stated that the partitioning of land among co-owners constitutes a disposal under the bright-line test and other land sales provisions. 24 Section GC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) deems the partitioning to occur at market value. An income tax liability can therefore arise on partitioning even where there is no effective change in economic ownership or where the person will not be taxed on the eventual sale of the property (for example, because it is their main home, or they hold the property for longer than the bright-line period). 24 PUB00411, “Income tax – Application of the land sale rules to changes to co-ownership, subdivisions, and changes of trustees”. The draft has now been finalised as IS 22/03, “Income Tax – Application of the land sale rules to co-ownership changes and changes of trustees”. Example 37: Subdivided land allocated among co-owners – outcome under current law Gordon and Elena buy a parcel of residential land as 50:50 co-owners to subdivide into two equal parcels. The bright-line acquisition date of this parcel of land is 23 July 2022. The subdivision occurs on 30 November 2022, with Gordon and Elena showing as 50:50 co-owners on each title. When the land is subdivided, Gordon and Elena each legally own 50% of the two parcels. Together they build two houses, one on each parcel, and split the costs accordingly. On 5 July 2023, one parcel is transferred to Gordon and the other to 135 For taxpayers on revenue account who are also taxed on the eventual disposal of the land, the current law interpretation means there are two taxing points – the partition or allocation, and the final sale. While section GC 1 of the ITA provides an uplift in the cost base to ensure there is no double taxation of the same income, taxpayers may face additional compliance costs and timing issues if the partition and eventual sale occur in different income years. Key features The proposed amendment to the definition of “dispose” in section YA 1 of the ITA would exclude the allocation of subdivided land among co-owners from being a disposal for sections CB 6A to CB 16, CB 18, CB 19, CB 21, CB 22, CZ 39 and subpart EL of the ITA. This exclusion would apply to the extent that the value of the allocated properties under the partition aligns with the co-owners’ interests in the original undivided parcel of land and contributions to development and construction costs. Any difference in these proportions (including any wash-up payments between the parties) would continue to be subject to income tax where applicable, as this difference would represent an economic change in ownership and actual disposal. Detailed analysis Proposed new paragraph (ab) in the definition of “dispose” in section YA 1 of the ITA would exclude the allocation of subdivided properties among co-owners from being a disposal for sections CB 6A to CB 16, CB 18, CB 19, CB 21, CB 22, CZ 39 and subpart EL of the ITA. These sections comprise the bright-line test and other land sales provisions, as well as the corresponding residential, business and farmland exclusions. The type of subdivision is irrelevant. For example, the proposed amendment would apply to fee simple subdivisions as well as unit titles issued under the Unit Titles Act 2010. Sections CB 6A(4) and CZ 39(3) would continue to apply so that, where the bright-line test applies, the relevant bright-line test acquisition date(s) for the allocated Elena. Gordon uses the property as his main home, while Elena rents her property out. On 5 July 2023 when one parcel is allocated to Gordon, Elena has legally disposed of her 50% interest in that parcel to Gordon. When the other parcel is allocated to Elena, Gordon has legally disposed of his 50% interest in that parcel to Elena. There is no payment between Elena and Gordon for this allocation because the values of the allocated properties align with their ownership of the original parcel of land and the construction costs were split accordingly. The properties are valued at $1 million each at the time the partition occurs. The disposals on 5 July 2023 are taxed under the bright-line test at market value. Before costs are deducted, Gordon’s bright-line income is $500,000 (arising from his disposal of his 50% share in Elena’s allocated property, i.e. 50% of $1 million). Elena’s bright-line income is $500,000 (arising from her disposal of her 50% share in Gordon’s allocated property, i.e. 50% of $1 million). The main home exclusion does not apply because Gordon did not use Elena’s allocated property as his main home and Elena did not use Gordon’s allocated property as her main home. 136 subdivided parcels should be the bright-line acquisition date for the original undivided parcel of land. The proposed amendments would apply for those who hold their land on capital account (and would therefore only pay income tax under the bright-line test if they sell within the relevant bright-line period) as well as those who hold their land on revenue account (for example, because they acquired the land with a purpose or intent of disposal or have a business of developing land). Proposed new paragraph (ab) of the definition of “dispose” would only apply to the extent the transfer results in the same proportionate economic ownership as before the transfer or other change of ownership. This requirement is not based on land area. Rather, it would consider the market values of the allocated properties and compare these to the ownership of the original undivided land and the co-owners’ contributions to development and construction costs. If there is a difference in how the divided properties are allocated, this difference would continue to be subject to income tax where applicable. This is because this difference in values represents a change in economic ownership and an effective disposal for at least one party. Example 38: Subdivided land allocated among co-owners Assume the same facts as in example 37. Under the proposed amendments, the allocation of the two properties on 5 July 2023 would not constitute a disposal, and Gordon’s and Elena’s respective bright-line acquisition dates would both be 23 July 2022 (that is, the bright-line acquisition date of the original undivided parcel). Elena enters into an agreement to sell her property on 7 March 2028. The new build bright-line test applies, so Elena needs to consider whether the agreement to sell is within five years of her bright-line acquisition date. As 7 March 2028 is not within five years of 23 July 2022, Elena’s disposal is not subject to income tax under the bright-line test. Gordon enters into an agreement to sell his property on 28 November 2028. The disposal is not taxed under the bright-line test because Gordon used the property as his main home for the whole period he owned it. Example 39: Unequal allocation of subdivided properties Ash and Larna are 50:50 co-owners of a parcel of residential land. They subdivide the land into two parcels and build a house on each parcel. One property is allocated to Ash and the other to Larna. At the time of the allocation, the property allocated to Ash is worth $600,000, while the property allocated to Larna is worth $400,000. The proposed amendment applies to the extent there is no change in Ash and Larna’s relative interests before and after the allocation. Larna had a 50% ownership interest before the allocation but, based on the market value of the properties at the time of the allocation, her equivalent ownership interest is now 40% (being $400,000/($600,000 + $400,000)). At the time of the allocation, Larna is therefore considered to have disposed of $100,000 of residential land, which Ash has acquired. 137 RING-FENCED RESIDENTIAL RENTAL LOSSES WHEN A TAX DEBT IS WRITTEN OFF Clauses 160(2) and 177 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to extinguish excess deductions ring-fenced under subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) when a taxpayer’s tax debt is written off. Effective date The proposed amendment would have effect for tax debts written off on or after 1 April 2023. This would apply even if the ring-fenced residential rental loss relates to a previous income year. Background Section 177C(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires the Commissioner to extinguish a taxpayer’s tax loss if a tax debt is written off. This ensures that taxpayers are not able to “double dip” and benefit from having a tax debt written off while still being able to use any accrued losses in the future. The residential rental loss ring-fencing rules have been in effect since the 2019–20 income year. Under section EL 4 of the ITA, deductions relating to residential rental property cannot exceed a person’s residential rental income for the year. Any excess amount is effectively ring-fenced and cannot be offset against other non-residential property income that year (for example, salary and wages). The excess amount is carried forward to a later year when the person derives residential income. “Tax loss” is undefined in the TAA, but it is defined in the ITA with reference to section IA 2(1) of the ITA. There is uncertainty around whether section EL 4 excess deductions form part of a taxpayer’s tax loss and can therefore be extinguished when they have a tax debt written off. Key features Proposed new section 177C(5BA) of the TAA would clarify that the Commissioner must extinguish a taxpayer’s ring-fenced residential rental losses (excess deductions under section EL 4 of the ITA) when he writes off a taxpayer’s tax debt. The amount extinguished would be limited to the amount of the tax debt written off, taking into account the tax value of the ring-fenced residential rental losses using a 33% rate for non-companies and 28% for companies. If, in addition to ring-fenced residential rental losses, a taxpayer also has a tax loss an d/or a tax credit carried forward under section LE 3 of the ITA, the proposed amendment to section 177C(5C) would provide that the tax loss must be extinguished first, followed by the ring-fenced residential rental losses, and then finally, the tax credit. Section 89C of the TAA requires the Commissioner to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) when making an assessment unless a specific exception applies. In line with existing section 89C(lb), which provides that a NOPA is not required when a tax loss is extinguished under section 177C(5), proposed new section 89C(lbb) would provide a similar exception for ring-fenced residential rental losses. 139 Foreign trust remedial items 141 ALIGNING THE FOREIGN-SOURCED INCOME EXEMPTION WITH THE FOREIGN TRUST DISCLOSURE RULES Clauses 70(1), (3) and (5), 139(4), 150(2), 151(1) to (4), 152(1), (3), (5) and (6), 153(1), (2) and (6) and 155(1), (2) and (3)(b) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would introduce a new definition of a “foreign exemption trust”. A foreign exemption trust would include any trust that is currently a foreign trust, but it would also include trusts where a trustee makes use of the foreign- sourced income exemption under section HC 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), unless there is an election under section HC 33 in effect. The “foreign exemption trust” definition would replace the “foreign trust” definition for the purposes of applying the foreign trust disclosure obligations. This would align the foreign-sourced income exemption in the ITA with the foreign trust disclosure rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background Since 1987, New Zealand has taxed trusts based on the settlor’s tax residence. A trust with a New Zealand resident settlor is taxed on its worldwide income. This is the case even if its trustees are non-residents: see section HC 25. Conversely, a trust that has never had a New Zealand resident settlor is only taxed on its New Zealand-sourced income, even if its trustees are residents. This is achieved through the foreign-sourced income exemption in section HC 26 of the ITA. In 2017, the disclosure requirements for foreign trusts were substantially strengthened in response to concerns that they were being used to avoid foreign income tax. For a “foreign trust” to use the foreign-sourced income exemption, it must now comply with the foreign trust disclosure rules in sections 59B to 59D of the TAA. However, this requirement only applies to a “foreign trust”. Some trusts can use the foreign-sourced income exemption without technically being a “foreign trust” and therefore without complying with the foreign trust disclosure rules. This misalignment is contrary to the original policy intent. Key features The proposed amendments would correct this misalignment as follows:  A new definition of “foreign exemption trust” would be added to denote which trustees must register and comply with the foreign trust disclosure rules. The new definition would include any trust that currently has to comply with the foreign trust disclosure rules as a “foreign trust”. However, the new definition would also include a trust for which the trustee uses, or has previously used, the foreign- sourced income exemption in section HC 26 of the ITA. An exception applies if an election under section HC 33 is effective for the trust.  A trustee of a foreign exemption trust would not be required to apply the domestic trust disclosure rules. 142 Detailed analysis A misalignment arises between the foreign trust disclosure rules and the foreign- sourced income exemption. This is because the exemption works by exempting the income of trusts that do not have a New Zealand resident settlor in a given income year. The exemption has always worked in this way as the ITA considers income on a yearly basis. It envisages that settlors may migrate to and from New Zealand and taxes accordingly. In contrast, the definition of “foreign trust” does not envisage settlors’ circumstances changing. A trust will only be a foreign trust if it has not had a New Zealand resident settlor since 1987, when the current tax regime for trusts was introduced. As a result of this misalignment, some trusts can use the foreign-sourced income exemption without technically being a “foreign trust”. For example, a trust that had a New Zealand resident settlor in a previous income year, but not in its current income year, may qualify for the foreign-sourced income exemption. This is the case even though such a trust will not technically be a “foreign trust”. It will not have to, and indeed cannot, comply with the foreign trust disclosure rules, which only apply to “foreign trusts”. Often these trusts will not have to comply with the domestic trust disclosure rules in sections 59BA and 59BAB either, as they do not have any New Zealand-sourced income. 25 Such trusts can therefore use New Zealand’s settlor-based trust regime to escape taxation in their home countries, without being required to disclose any information about their income to Inland Revenue. This was exactly the mischief the 2017 disclosure requirements were intended to address. The proposed amendment would resolve this issue by creating a new definition of “foreign exemption trust” to denote which trusts should comply with the foreign trust registration and disclosure obligations. In addition to those trusts that must already comply with the disclosure rules, a “foreign exemption trust” would explicitly include any trust, whether currently a foreign trust or not, that has derived income that is, or has been, exempt under the foreign-sourced income exemption. The definition would exclude trusts for which an election under section HC 33 is in effect. Use of the foreign-sourced income exemption A trust that has had a New Zealand settlor at some point after 1987 is not a “foreign trust” under current law. It is proposed that such a trust would only become a “foreign exemption trust” if its trustee uses, or ha s previously used, the foreign-sourced income exemption. Some trustees may derive income that qualifies for the exemption, but not use it, instead making an election under section HC 33. Other trustees will not use the exemption because they derive no foreign-sourced income, even though they would qualify for the exemption if they did. Such trusts would not have to comply with the foreign trust disclosure rules. This will reduce unnecessary compliance and administration costs. 25 The domestic trust disclosure rules only apply to trusts that derive assessable income” for a tax year. “Assessable income” does not include exempt income: section BD 1(5). As a result, if a trust only derives foreign income, and that income is exempt under the foreign-sourced income exemption in section HC 26, the trust will not have any assessable income. 143 Example 40: Trust with New Zealand rental portfolio In 2022, Meritiana, a New Zealand resident, sets up a trust with New Zealand trustees to hold her New Zealand rental portfolio. The trustees derive assessable income and will have to comply with the domestic trust disclosure rules. In 2026, Meritiana moves to Australia. The trustees continue to derive only New Zealand-sourced rental income so do not use the foreign-sourced income exemption. The trust therefore does not have to comply with the foreign trust disclosure rules and continues to comply with the domestic trust disclosure rules. The New Zealand tax consequences and disclosure requirements for the trust are identical to those for a purely domestic trust. In 2030, Meritiana moves back to New Zealand. Despite Meritiana’s movements, the trust never has to comply with the foreign trust disclosure rules because it never uses the foreign-sourced income exemption (and it had a New Zealand resident settlor after a settlement was first made on the trust). A New Zealand resident trustee becomes required to register if a trust falls within the proposed “foreign exemption trust” definition. For some trustees this would be once they use the foreign-sourced income exemption.  For trustees that have already used the exemption before the Bill receives the Royal assent, the requirement to register would be triggered on the Royal assent date. The trustee would then have until 30 April 2023 to apply for registration.  In any other case, the requirement to register would commence on the due date for an income tax return in which the trustee first takes a tax position that foreign income of the trust is exempt under section HC 26 of the ITA. 26 The trustee would then have to apply for registration within 30 days. In either of the two cases above, the trustee may be entitled to the longer grace period of 4 years 30 days if the requirements of section 59C(3) are met. The proposed amendment would also require the trustee to provide an annual return that includes the period in which the exemption is first claimed (even if that period occurred before the requirement to register is triggered). The annual return would have to meet the requirements of section 59D of the TAA. Example 41: Trust using the foreign-sourced income exemption In 2022, Rory, a New Zealand resident, sets up a trust with a New Zealand corporate trustee. The trust’s assets consist solely of foreign shares, which return foreign investment fund (FIF) income. The trust complies with the domestic trust disclosure rules and has a standard balance date of 31 March. In June 2026, Rory moves to Luxembourg. For the income year ending 31 March 2027, the trust cannot use the foreign-sourced income exemption as it had a New Zealand resident settlor during the income year. Nor is it a foreign exemption trust as it has had a New Zealand resident settlor after 1987. Therefore, it must still comply with the domestic trust disclosure rules. 26 The trustee may take a tax position by filing a return that only includes New Zealand-sourced income, even while it has foreign-sourced income, or by not filing a return at all when it only has foreign-sourced income. 144 For the income year ending 31 March 2028, the trust has no New Zealand resident settlor. It therefore uses the foreign-sourced income exemption for the 2027–28 income year. The trust has a tax agent, so the due date for its 2027– 28 income tax return is 31 March 2029. Under the proposed amendments to section 59C, the trustee would have to apply for the trust to be registered as a foreign exemption trust within 30 days of 31 March 2029. Under the proposed amendments to section 59D, the trustee would have to provide an annual return for the period 1 April 2027 to 31 March 2028, being the first year in which the exemption is claimed. This return would have to be provided at the same time that the trustee applied for registration. The new “foreign exemption trust” definition would replace the current “foreign trust” definition only for the purposes of applying the foreign trust disclosure rules. A trust that is registered as a “foreign trust” under current law would be treated as already being registered as a “foreign exemption trust” and would not have to reapply for registration. Consequently, such a trust would continue to be subject to the foreign trust disclosure rules under the new “foreign exemption trust” definition, regardless of whether it has used the foreign-sourced income exemption. Exception for trusts with a section HC 33 election If a person makes an election under section HC 33 to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee, it is proposed that the trust would stop being a foreign exemption trust from the date the election applied. This would ensure that trusts taxed on their worldwide income are subject to the domestic trust disclosure rules rather than the foreign trust disclosure rules. Example 42: Trust with section HC 33 election In 2019, Emilia, a Swiss resident, sets up a trust with a New Zealand trustee to hold her share portfolio and Swiss rental properties. Assume the trust has a standard balance date of 31 March. The trust is a foreign trust. It registers with Inland Revenue and complies with the foreign trust disclosure rules from its inception. The trustee also uses the foreign-sourced income exemption in section HC 26. Emilia subsequently moves to New Zealand and stops being a transitional resident on 15 May 2026. On 1 April 2027, she makes an election under section HC 33 to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee. Once Emilia becomes New Zealand resident, the trust would not fall under limb (a) of the proposed “foreign exemption trust” definition but would still fall under limb (b) of that definition as its trustee has previously used the section HC 26 exemption. It must continue to comply with the foreign trust disclosure rules. From the date of the election the trust would not fall under either limb of the proposed “foreign exemption trust” definition. It would no longer have to comply with the foreign trust disclosure rules and would instead comply with the domestic trust disclosure rules. The trustee would therefore file a final foreign exemption trust return for the 2026–27 year. From the 2027–28 year onwards, the trust would have to comply with the domestic trust disclosure rules. 145 Interaction with “foreign trust” definition The “foreign exemption trust” definition applies for the disclosure rules in the Tax Administration Act. The “foreign trust” definition applies for working out how its di stributions are taxed under the Income Tax Act. The two definitions apply for different purposes and can therefore operate independently. A trust will often be both a “foreign trust” and a “foreign exemption trust” at the same time. However, it could also be a “foreign exemption trust” but not a “foreign trust”. Example 43: Foreign exemption trust but not a foreign trust On 1 May 2020 Jacques, a non-resident, sets up a trust with a New Zealand trustee to hold his European rental properties. Assume the trust has a standard balance date of 31 March. Jacques becomes a New Zealand resident but remains a transitional resident until 6 October 2025. No election under section HC 33 is made for the trust. The trust uses the foreign-sourced income exemption for its European rental income in each income year from 1 May 2020 until 31 March 2025 (inclusive). It cannot use the exemption in the 2025–26 income year as Jacques stopped being a transitional resident in that year. From 1 May 2020, the trust would be a foreign exemption trust under the proposed amendments. The trust would have to register with Inland Revenue and comply with the foreign trust disclosure rules. Once Jacques becomes a New Zealand resident (even while he is a transitional resident), the trust would no longer be a foreign trust. However, it would remain a foreign exemption trust because it has previously used the section HC 26 exemption but has not made an election under section HC 33. 146 POWER TO DEREGISTER A TRUST Clause 154 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would create an explicit power for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to deregister a trust if the trust does not meet the requirements for registration under section 59B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power would be exercised on the Commissioner’s own initiative or on application by the trust. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Detailed analysis The legislation does not provide a power to deregister trusts, despite the Income Tax Act referring to deregistered trusts in section HC 26(1)(c)(iii). A trust may need to be deregistered if it no longer meets the requirements for registration or was mistakenly registered because it did not meet the requirements for registration in the first place. For example, this may occur if the trust is not a foreign trust or foreign exemption trust, 27 or it does not have a New Zealand resident trustee. The proposed amendment would address this by explicitly granting the Commissioner the power to deregister a foreign trust either by his own initiative or on application by a trust. The deregistration would be able to be backdated to the date when the trust stopped meeting the statutory requirements for registration. For example, if a trust stopped being a foreign trust on 1 January 2024 (and is not a foreign exemption trust), but the Commissioner did not become aware of this until 15 March 2024, the Commissioner would be able to backdate the deregistration to 1 January 2024. Under the proposed amendment, when the Commissioner exercises the power to deregister on his own initiative, he must give the contact trustee at least 30 days’ notice before the deregistration takes effect. The contact trustee then has an opportunity to respond if they consider the trust should remain registered, providing supporting information to the Commissioner as appropriate. A contact trustee of a trust must also apply for the trust to be deregistered if they become aware that the trust does not meet the requirements for registration. The trustee would have to provide the Commissioner with certain information, such as:  the reasons for deregistration  final annual returns that include the date before it is deregistered, and  any further information required by the Commissioner, such as supporting evidence where appropriate. Final annual returns could be part-year accounts (for example, if the trust winds up) or full-year accounts that include the date before deregistration (for example, if a trust 27 A “foreign exemption trust” is explained earlier in the Commentary in the item “ Aligning the foreign-sourced income exemption with the foreign trust disclosure rules”. 147 continues to exist but has stopped being a foreign trust because its trustees have moved offshore). 148 REQUIRE SIGNED DECLARATION FROM POST- REGISTRATION SETTLORS Clause 153(5) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would extend the requirement for the contact trustee to provide a signed declaration for each settlor of a trust on registration to also require a signed declaration for persons who become a settlor after registration. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background When applying for registration of a foreign trust, sections 59B(3)(c)(i) and (4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) require trustees to provide certain information, including a signed declaration, for any settlor of the trust. The signed declaration must state that each settlor has been informed of, and agreed to, certain TAA and anti- money laundering requirements, or that the settlor is deceased or cannot be located. However, some settlors may not make their first settlement on the trust until after the trust has been registered, and therefore it is unclear whether the requirement to provide a signed declaration applies. While section 59D(2)(c) does require the trustee to provide the same information about such new post-registration settlors in the annual return, this requirement does not extend to the signed declaration. The proposed amendment would extend this requirement to provide information in the annual return to include a signed declaration for post-registration settlors. The signed declaration would be required for all annual returns filed after the date the Bill comes into force. 149 TREATMENT OF RESIDUAL BENEFICIARIES Clauses 151(8) and (13) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would clarify that residual beneficiaries are subject to the same disclosure requirements as discretionary beneficiaries. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background Residual beneficiaries, also known as final beneficiaries, are beneficiaries that have a right to any undistributed trust property when the trust is wound up. The current disclosure rules do not mention residual beneficiaries and only refer to beneficiaries of fixed and discretionary trusts (for example, sections 59B(3)(c), (d) and (e) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). It is therefore currently unclear what disclosure requirements residual beneficiaries should comply with. The disclosure requirements for beneficiaries of fixed trusts on registration are more stringent than those for beneficiaries of discretionary trusts. The reason is because a beneficiary of a fixed trust has a fixed and certain interest in the trust property. In contrast, a beneficiary of a discretionary trust does not have a certain interest in the trust property and only has a right to be considered for a distribution. Sometimes discretionary beneficiaries are only stated as a class in the trust deed (for example, all descendants of the settlor) such that it cannot be known at the time of registration who all the discretionary beneficiaries of the trust are. Accordingly, when applying for registration of a discretionary trust, the contact trustee only has to provide enough details for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine, when a distribution is made under the trust, whether a person is a beneficiary (section 59B(3)(e)). Further details, such as the name, address and tax residence of a discretionary beneficiary, are only required when a distribution is made to that beneficiary (section 59D(2)(e)). Residual beneficiaries are similar to discretionary beneficiaries in that they do not have a certain interest in the trust property and may be stated in the trust deed as a class. The proposed amendment would therefore clarify that residual beneficiaries are subject to the same disclosure requirements as those that apply to discretionary beneficiaries. 150 UPDATING TRUST INFORMATION WHEN IT CHANGES Clauses 151(10) and (11), 152(2) and 153(4) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would require contact trustees to update information provided in an annual return if it changes. Changes to trustees or contact details would have to be updated within 30 days of the contact trustee becoming aware of it. Changes to other information would have to be updated in the next annual return at the latest. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background Section 59B(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires contact trustees to update information provided on registration, including the signed declarations for trustees, when that information changes. They are required to do this within 30 days after becoming aware of the addition or alteration (section 59C(2)). In addition, section 59B(6) provides that a contact trustee who anticipates ceasing to be contact trustee must also provide the Commissioner with certain details when the contact trustee or their details change. Changes in trustees and trustee details generally are subject to the 30 day time limit (see sections 59B(3)(c)(v), 59B(5) and 59C(2)). However, there is no corresponding requirement to update information that changes when it was provided in an annual return (for example, details of new settlors or beneficiaries). This was not intended. The need for information to be up-to-date applies regardless of whether it was first provided in an annual return or on registration. In addition, the 30-day time limit for updating information provided on registration can be inconvenient for trustees and may result in inadvertent non-compliance. For most types of information, it is sufficient if the information is updated in the next annual return. However, an exception is for changes to contact trustees or their contact details. It is important for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to have reliable contact information for contact trustees, and therefore this information should continue to be provided within the 30-day time limit. Key features The proposed amendments would clarify that contact trustees are required to update information provided in an annual return if the information changes. The proposed amendments would also address the timeframes within which updates must be provided:  Changes to contact trustees (under section 59B(6)) or their contact details (under proposed new section 59B(6B)) would have to be provided to the Commissioner within 30 days of the trustee becoming aware of it.  Changes to other information, regardless of whether it was given on registration or in an annual return, would have to be provided to the Commissioner in the next 151 annual return at the latest. Contact trustees would retain the option to provide information earlier, outside the annual return cycle, if they wanted. 152 TESTAMENTARY TRUSTS Clauses 70(2) and (4), and 151(9) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would treat a will creating a trust as a trust deed for the purposes of the foreign-sourced income exemption. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 21 February 2017. Background Section HC 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for foreign-sourced income to be exempt from tax if certain requirements are met. One such requirement is that the trust must have a trust deed (sections HC 26(1)(c)(i) and (1)(d)(i)). Testamentary trusts created by wills do not have trust deeds, as wills are not legally trust deeds. This means testamentary trusts cannot access the exemption. It was never intended for foreign trusts created under a will to be treated differently from a foreign trust created by a living settlor under a trust deed. The proposed amendments would therefore allow a will creating a trust to be treated as a trust deed for section HC 26. The proposed amendments would have retrospective effect from 21 February 2017 – the date when foreign trusts were first required to comply with the disclosure rules to use the foreign-sourced income exemption. 153 COMMISSIONER’S DISCRETION TO BACKDATE REGISTRATION Clause 151(2) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to backdate a foreign trust’s registration where a trustee has made reasonable efforts to be registered on time. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent, regardless of whether the trust applied for registration before or after that date. Background To use the foreign-sourced income exemption in section HC 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007, a foreign trust must meet certain conditions. One condition is that it must be registered both at the beginning of the income year and at the time when the foreign- sourced income is derived. Section HC 26(1B)(b) gives the Commissioner the discretion to allow the foreign- sourced income exemption to apply despite minor compliance failures with the disclosure rules. However, this discretion does not apply where a foreign trust is not registered in time. This may be excessively harsh in some cases where the trustee made reasonable efforts to be registered on time. Instead of giving the Commissioner the discretion to allow the foreign-sourced income exemption in cases where a trust is not registered in time, the proposed amendment would allow the Commissioner to backdate the trust’s registration. This is expected to be simpler, particularly where the trust has derived multiple items of foreign-sourced income in the relevant period. 154 NEW CIVIL PENALTY AND GREATER DISCRETION FOR FOREIGN-SOURCED INCOME EXEMPTION Clauses 70(6) and 167 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would allow for a more flexible and proportionate response to non-compliance with the foreign trust disclosure rules by introducing a new civil penalty for failure to comply with the rules and granting the Commissioner of Inland Revenue greater discretion to allow a trust to use the foreign-sourced income exemption in cases of minor non-compliance. Effective date The proposed new civil penalty would have effect for any failures to comply occurring on or after the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. The proposed discretion to allow the foreign-sourced income exemption would be able to be exercised on or after the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background When the foreign trust disclosure requirements were enacted in 2017, the penalties were not updated. The current penalties that apply are the general criminal penalties in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). In practice, the main consequence for a foreign trust that does not comply with the disclosure requirements in an income year is that it cannot use the foreign-sourced income exemption that year. This result can be too harsh (if the non-compliance was relatively minor) or too lenient (if the trust has no foreign-sourced income). Under section HC 26(1B)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), the Commissioner currently has a discretion to allow the foreign-sourced income exemption where there has been a failure to comply, but only if a trustee has corrected that failure within a reasonable time. However, some failures may not be able to be corrected – for example, the age of the trust, or prior mismanagement, may result in the loss of historical information on settlors or settlements – but are still so minor that the loss of the foreign-sourced income exemption is disproportionate to the extent of the failure. Key features The proposed amendments would:  introduce a new civil penalty of up to $1,000 for failure to comply with the disclosure rules, and  give the Commissioner a discretion to allow a trust to use the foreign-sourced income exemption. Detailed analysis New civil penalty The new civil penalty would be applied for failure to comply with the disclosure rules, such as when a trustee misses a deadline, provides an incomplete annual return, or provides false information. This penalty could apply instead of, or in addition to, the trust being denied the foreign-sourced income exemption. T he penalty would not 155 apply to a fai lure to meet the disclosure requirements if the Commissioner is satisfied that the failure occurred through no fault of the trustee or that the trustee made reasonable efforts to meet the requirements. Discretion to allow the foreign-sourced income exemption The Commissioner’s discretion would only be able to be exercised where the trustee had made reasonable efforts to:  comply with the requirements of sections 22, 59B, 59C and 59D of the TAA (as required in section HC 26(1) of the ITA), and  correct any failures to comply, even if the failure could not in fact be corrected. 156 CLARIFICATIONS TO THE TRUST RULES Clauses 98(20), 139(7), 151(2), (5), (6), (7), (12) and (13), 152(2), (4) and (5), 153(3), 155(3)(a) and (4), and 173(1) Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes a number of amendments that would clarify the rules by  replacing certain references in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to beneficiaries of a “fixed trust” or “discretionary trust” with references to beneficiaries with fixed or discretionary interests in a trust  replacing the confusing, undefined references to trustees “in the business of providing trustee services” in the TAA with the broadly similar, existing defined term of “professional trustee”  updating the definition of “trust rules” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) to refer to the relevant sections of the foreign trust disclosure rules in the TAA  amending sections 59B(3)(d) and 59D(2)(e) of the TAA to refer to the “date of birth” of the minor beneficiary instead of their “age”  amending references to a “resident foreign trustee” in the TAA to refer to a “trustee”, and  updating several minor cross-referencing errors in the TAA’s penalties provisions. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background References to fixed and discretionary trusts The TAA refers to beneficiaries of a “fixed trust” or a “discretionary trust” in sections 59B(3)(c)(vi), (vii), (d) and (e). A trust deed can provide for both fixed and discretionary beneficiaries in the same deed. It is unclear in such a case if the trust is a “fixed trust” or a “discretionary trust”. Arguably, the single trust deed can create multiple trusts – some fixed, some discretionary. However, this is not consistent with how the legislation is ordinarily understood and such an interpretation could cause unintended consequences (for example, separate disclosures having to be made or multiple registration and filing fees being paid in respect of the same trust deed). The proposed amendments would remove this uncertainty. Replacing references to trustees “in the business of providing trustee services” with “professional trustee” Sections 59B(3)(b)(i), 59C(3)(c), and 59E(5)(b) of the TAA currently refer to a trustee “in the business of providing trustee services”. This phrase is not a defined term. The term “professional trustee” is a defined term, and it is better understood and captures largely the same idea. It would therefore be clearer to use that existing defined term in these sections. The current definition of “professional trustee” in section 3 of the TAA only applies for the purposes of section 43B. However, section 43B now uses the term “professional 157 persons” instead of “professional trustees”. The proposed amendment would therefore update the definition of “professional trustee” so that it can apply for the purposes of the foreign trust disclosure rules. Updating the definition of “trust rules” The definition of “trust rules” in section YA 1 of the ITA does not refer to the relevant sections of the foreign trust disclosure rules. As a result, some provisions and definitions that should apply to the foreign trust disclosure rules do not. The proposed amendment would rectify this. Referring to the “date of birth” rather than “age” of minor beneficiaries Sections 59B(3)(d) and 59D(2)(e) of the TAA currently require a trustee to disclose the “age” of any minor beneficiaries of a fixed trust. Technically this requires trustees to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of the minor beneficiary’s new age every year as it changes, which is impractical. The proposed amendment would therefore require disclosure of a minor beneficiary’s “date of birth” instead. Changing references from “resident foreign trustee” to “trustee” The TAA currently uses the term “resident foreign trustee” in various places to refer to a New Zealand resident trustee of a foreign trust. This term is confusing as it can imply the trustee is foreign, even though it refers to a New Zealand resident trustee. The proposed amendments would remove this confusion. Updating penalties provisions cross-references Sections 143(1B) and (1C) of the TAA, which set out how the absolute liability offences in section 143(1) apply to resident foreign trustees, reflect the wording of the pre-2017 disclosure regime. Section 143(1C) currently refers only to section 59B (registration and initial disclosure requirement) and not to section 59D (annual return requirement). Section 143(1C)(b) refers to the appointment of another resident foreign trustee under section 59B(7) even though that subsection no longer provides for the appointment of a trustee. The proposed amendments to section 143 of the TAA would:  ensure that subsection (1C) refers to section 59D, and  remove the reference to section 59B(7). 159 GST remedial items 161 GST TREATMENT OF GOVERNMENT GRANTS PAID TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES Clauses 105(2) and (10) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment removes the exclusion for public authorities from the government grants and subsidies rule in section 5(6D) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). Effective date The proposed amendment would have effect for government grants and subsidies paid to public authorities on or after 1 April 2023. Background The GST Act contains a rule for payments in the nature of a grant or subsidy made by, or on behalf of, the Crown (the government grants and subsidies rule). The government grants and subsidies rule requires GST-registered recipients of government grants and subsidies to include these amounts in their GST returns as sales and pay GST on the amounts received. This ensures that GST-registered recipients, who are generally able to claim an input tax credit for expenses paid for with the government grant or subsidy, are no better off than recipients who are not registered for GST. The government grants and subsidies rule does not apply to public authorities. This means that, unless the amount of the grants or subsidies paid to public authorities is reduced by the amount of GST that would be payable on those grants or subsidies if the exclusion for public authorities did not exist, public authorities receive a greater ec onomic benefit than other GST-registered persons or unregistered persons. This was not intended. The Bill proposes amending the government grants and subsidies rule to remove the exclusion for public authorities. This will ensure that any public authority that receives a government grant or subsidy will be required to account for GST on the amounts received. 162 GST – IMPROVEMENTS TO PLACE OF SUPPLY RULES Clauses 106(2), 107 and 108 Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes several improvements to the GST “place of supply” rules to reduce compliance costs for users of these rules and create consistency with similar rules currently used for imported remote services and distantly taxable goods. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background The remote services and distantly taxable goods rules allow non-resident suppliers to use certain commercial proxies, assumptions, or practices to determine whether their supply is a taxable supply to a New Zealand resident consumer. This minimises compliance costs for these suppliers. However, other types of suppliers can also find it difficult to determine the tax residency of their customers or whether their customers are GST-registered businesses. The Bill proposes to reduce compliance costs for these suppliers by allowing them to apply similar rules. Detailed analysis The proposed amendments would enable a broader range of suppliers to use the proxies available to non -resident suppliers of remote service and distantly taxable goods to determine the GST treatment of their supplies. Allowing the residency proxies in section 8B to be used for exported remote services Section 8B of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides a list of various items of commercial information relevant for determining a recipient’s residency (for example, billing address, internet protocol address, bank details, and phone number). If two of the items support the conclusion that the recipient of the supply is a New Zealand resident, then the remote services rules treat that person as a New Zealand resident. Section 8B is currently limited to imported remote services supplied by a non-resident supplier. The Bill proposes allowing resident suppliers to apply these rules to determine if their supplies of remote services are being exported to a non-resident recipient and can therefore be zero-rated under sections 11A(1)(k), (l) or (m). Non-resident suppliers of imported goods to GST-registered customers Section 8(4) currently allows the non-resident supplier of goods that are in New Zealand at the time of supply and the GST-registered recipient of those goods to make an agreement that the supply is made in New Zealand. Such agreements allow the non-resident supplier to charge 15% GST on the supply of the goods and to claim input tax deductions for costs incurred to make the supply (such as GST imposed by Customs when the goods enter New Zealand). Stakeholders have submitted that it can be burdensome to enter into and manage these agreements in circumstances where non-resident importers have a lot of GST-registered customers. 163 Therefore, the Bill proposes replacing the requirement to have an agreement with the recipient of the goods with an option for the non-resident supplier to unilaterally treat the supply as being made in New Zealand. The non-resident supplier would implement this by charging 15% GST on the supply of the goods. The proposed approach is consistent with existing rules for remote services and distantly taxable goods in sections 8(4D) and 8(4F), which allow a non-resident supplier to treat the supply of services as being made in New Zealand. The Bill also proposes expanding the application of section 8BB to allow non-resident importers to use the sources of information outlined in that section to determine whether the recipient is GST registered for the purposes of section 8(4). The use of section 8BB is currently limited to situations where a non-resident is supplying remote services or distantly taxable goods. 164 LIABILITIES INCURRED DURING A VOLUNTARY ADMINISTRATION Clause 127 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would clarify that administrators are personally liable for GST liabilities incurred as an agent of a company in voluntary administration. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background When a registered person dies, becomes incapacitated, or goes into bankruptcy, receivership, or liquidation they become an “incapacitated person” for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). Section 58 of the GST Act deems the person carrying on the taxable activity on behalf of the incapacitated person (the specified agent) to be carrying on that taxable activity, including being GST registered. This means the incapacitated person is not treated as carrying on the taxable activity during the period, and the specified agent is liable for GST obligations of the incapacitated person during the agency period. There has been uncertainty as to whether an administrator, carrying on a voluntary administration, is currently within the scope of section 58. Voluntary administration is described in Part 15A of the Companies Act 1993, and “administrator” is a defined term in section 239B of the Companies Act 1993. It is understood that some administrators have taken a broad view of the definition of “incapacitated person” and interpreted a company in voluntary administration as being incapacitated under section 58. The administrator is therefore liable for the GST obligations of the company in voluntary administration. However, others have read the plain words of the provision and concluded that the absence of any reference to voluntary administration means it is outside the scope of the provision. On that basis, therefore, the administrator files GST returns on behalf of the company but is not personally liable for GST incurred during the voluntary administration period. The proposed amendments would provide certainty and consistency to the treatment of GST obligations incurred during a voluntary administration. Key features The proposed amendments would amend the section 58 definition of “incapacitated person” to include voluntary administration and the definition of “specified agent” to include administrator. This would mean the administrator would be deemed to be a registered person carrying on the taxable activity of the company or limited partnership in voluntary administration. 165 CLARIFICATIONS TO THE COMPULSORY ZERO-RATING OF LAND RULES Clauses 105(9) and 112 Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes the following three amendments to the GST business-to-business compulsory zero-rating of land rules to ensure they work as intended:  The first amendment would allow supplies that wholly or partly consist of the grant of an interest in land (such as the grant of a commercial lease) to be zero-rated, provided they meet the requirements set out in section 11(1)(mb) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act).  The second amendment would standard-rate periodic payments made under an agreement for periodic supplies of an interest in land (such as a commercial lease) following an irregular lump-sum payment of more than 25% of the total consideration under the agreement.  The third amendment would clarify aspects of section 5(23), which applies when it is discovered a supply that is wholly or partly of land has been incorrectly zero- rated. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Detailed analysis The GST business-to-business compulsory zero-rating of land rules are in place to address the risk of phoenix fraud and reduce compliance costs for GST-registered persons. The rules apply to supplies that are wholly or partly of land, provided the requirements in section 11(1)(mb) are met. In some circumstances, the zero-rating rules apply to commercial leases and associated payments, as outlined in section 11(8D). First proposed amendment The first proposed amendment would include in section 11(8D)(a) a supply that wholly or partly consists of a grant of an interest in land, provided it meets the requirements of section 11(1)(mb). This is intended to capture the situation where the purchase of business assets by a GST-registered person is made conditional on the grant of a lease over the business premises. In some situations, this type of transaction could be zero-rated as a going concern under section 11(1)(m). However, the supply will not always fit the GST Act definition of a “going concern” and applying a going-concern treatment will not always make commercial sense for the given transaction. If a pre-existing lease had instead been assigned to the GST-registered purchaser alongside the asset purchase, this transaction would be zero-rated under section 11(8D)(a). The proposed amendment is not intended to affect the GST treatment of the subsequent rental payments made under a newly granted lease. This is because section 11(8D)(b) provides that regular periodic payments made under an agreement providing for periodic payments for supplies of an interest in land (a lease) are not zero-rated supplies of land. Instead, these regular rental payments would generally be 166 for standard-rated supplies (such as rents on a commercial property) or exempt supplies of accommodation in a dwelling (such as rents under a residential tenancy). Second proposed amendment Under section 11(8D)(b), a payment made under an agreement providing for supplies of an interest in land (a lease) must be zero-rated if it meets the requirements of section 11(1)(mb), is not a regular payment, and is more than 25% of the consideration specified in the agreement. Subsequent regular periodic payments made under the agreement must also be zero-rated. This treatment of subsequent payments was intended to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. However, Inland Revenue has been informed by taxpayers that it has the opposite effect. The second proposed amendment would therefore require regular periodic payments made following an irregular payment to be standard rated (15% GST). The amendment would clarify that it is only irregular lump-sum payments of more than 25% of the total consideration specified in the lease agreement that are zero-rated. The proposed amendment would also clarify that the value of the lump-sum payment is based on the combined value of irregular payments made. This is to ensure that lump-sum payments are not split-up to avoid the application of zero-rating treatment. Third proposed amendment Currently, section 5(23) applies where it is discovered, after the date on which the relevant transaction was settled, that section 11(1)(mb) was incorrectly applied to zero-rate a taxable supply of goods that did not meet the requirements of that section. Section 5(23) deems the recipient of those goods to make a supply of the goods themselves, and therefore they must return output tax (15% GST) on the purchase price. This rule would be retained in proposed new section 5(23B). The Bill includes amendments that would clarify aspects of the application of this rule. First, it would clarify that it must be the supplier who incorrectly zero-rated the supply of goods in a GST return provided by them. Second, it would require either the supplier or the Commissioner to find that section 11(1)(mb) was incorrectly applied to the supply of goods. Third, it would specify that the rule applies to require the recipient to return output tax when the recipient did not provide the supplier with correct or sufficient information under section 78F to enable the supplier to determine whether the supply should be zero-rated. This would address the concern that malicious suppliers might use section 5(23) to shift the output tax liability onto unwitting recipients. If the deeming rule in proposed new section 5(23B) applied, no changes to the supplier’s GST assessment in respect of the incorrectly zero-rated supply would be necessary. If a person who receives a supply that was incorrectly zero-rated is not registered for GST, the person would be required to register for GST so they could account for output tax on the deemed supply under proposed new section 5(23B). In this situation, the person’s GST registration would relate solely to this supply, and there would be no other GST consequences. The registration could be cancelled once a GST return including the supply had been provided. 167 ASSOCIATING MEMBERS OF JOINT VENTURES WITH THE JOINT VENTURE Clause 104 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would associate members of a joint venture with the joint venture for GST purposes. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 30 August 2022. Detailed analysis A joint venture can register for GST in its own right and exist separately from its members under section 57 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). The proposed amendment would include a rule in section 2A of the GST Act associating a joint venture with its members (the joint venturers) for GST purposes. This would reflect the aligned economic interests of joint ventures and their members. This is also consistent with the rules that apply for other unincorporated bodies, such as partnerships and trusts. The effect of parties to a transaction being associated for GST purposes includes the following:  a supply of goods and services between associated persons is subject to GST at open market value  the value of secondhand goods input tax credits on supplies made between associated persons are appropriately limited, and  the time of supply for goods and services supplied between associated persons is deemed to take place when the services are performed or when the goods are either removed or made available, as appropriate. The existing rules in section 2A(1)(b) that associate companies and other persons will continue to apply to joint ventures that are companies. The proposed amendment would come into effect on 30 August 2022 to prevent a fiscal risk that could arise from the proposed amendment highlighting that members of a joint venture are not currently associated with the joint venture itself for GST purposes. 168 INPUT TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES NOT YET AVAILABLE FOR USE IN MAKING TAXABLE SUPPLIES Clauses 116(5), (7), (8), (18), (19) and (20) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would clarify that a GST-registered person can claim an input tax deduction when goods or services are supplied to them to the extent those goods or services are intended to be used by them in making taxable supplies. A number of consequential amendments are also proposed to clarify the application of sections 20(3L) and (3LB) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the following dates:  1 April 2011 for the amendments to section 20(3C)(a) and (b)  30 March 2022 for the amendment to the words before paragraph (a) in section 20(3C)  1 April 2014 and 30 March 2022 for the amendments to section 20(3L), and  30 March 2022 for the amendment to section 20(3LB). Detailed analysis Under current section 20(3C), a GST-registered person can claim an input tax deduction for GST paid on goods and services supplied to them to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. However, tax advisors have notified us that current practice is to claim an input tax deduction at the time of supply (apportioning for any non-taxable or exempt use) even in cases where the goods or services are not yet available for use in making taxable supplies. Current practice is consistent with the policy intention, which is to allow input tax deductions to be recognised in the same taxable period in which the GST time of supply occurred. The proposed remedial amendments to section 20(3C)(a) and (b) would therefore clarify that a GST-registered person is able to claim an input tax deduction to the extent to which goods and services supplied to them are used for, or intended to be used by them in, making taxable supplies. This would align the timing of the input tax deduction with the GST time of supply, which is determined by section 9 of the GST Act. For example, where a GST-registered person purchases goods ahead of them being produced, the proposed amendment would allow them to claim an input tax deduction at the time of supply to the extent to which they intend to use those goods in making taxable supplies. Under section 21G(2)(a), the adjustment period for input tax deductions claimed by a registered person begins when the goods or services are physically acquired or made available to them. Therefore, a GST-registered person that claims an input tax deduction in line with the proposed amendment (for example, on the basis that they intend to use the goods or services in making taxable supplies) would not have to 169 consider the adjustment rules until those goods or services were physically acquired or made available to them. As the proposed amendment would align the law with the policy intention, it would have a retrospective effective date of 1 April 2011, the date on which the current section 20(3C) wording was included in the GST Act. To ensure consistency, equivalent amendments are also proposed to sections 20(3L) and (3LB) to allow GST-registered non-residents to claim an input tax deduction for GST paid on goods and services supplied to them to the extent to which those goods or services are used or intended to be used by them in making taxable supplies (treating all their supplies as if they were made and received in New Zealand). These proposed amendments would take effect on 30 March 2022. The amendment to section 20(3L) would also take effect from 1 April 2014 to ensure it applies to an earlier version of that provision. It is also proposed that, with effect on 30 March 2022, section 20(3C) would be amended to clarify that it only applies if sections 20(3D), (3L) or (3LB) do not apply. 170 MODERNISING INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR GST Clauses 116(1), (2), 186, 187, 188 and 189 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would clarify several amendments made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 (the 2022 Amendment Act) to reform the tax invoicing rules for GST (now known as taxable supply information). These changes reform the way in which the GST system interfaces with 21 st century business record- keeping, both digital and manual, by simplifying record-keeping requirements for GST purposes. Effective date The proposed amendments to the provisions in the 2022 Amendment Act would take effect on the same dates as the relevant provisions in that Act took effect. This is achieved by proposing that the amendments to the 2022 Amendment Act in this Bill take effect on 30 March 2022, the day before that Act came into force. Detailed analysis The proposed remedial amendments to the taxable supply information requirements are listed in the table below. The section references discussed in the “Description of change” column in the table refer to the relevant sections in the GST Act. Table 3: Remedial changes to the taxable supply information requirements Section of the 2022 Amendment Act Description of change Clause of Bill Section 5(4)(b) The use of the term “peculiar” in the section 2 definition of “recipient details” is ambiguous. The proposed amendment would replace this term with “relevant”. 186(1) Section 5(4)(e) The reference to “the date of the supply” in the section 2 definition of “supply information” is ambiguous and could refer to various dates. Th is reference would be replaced with ““the date of the invoice, or where no invoice is issued, the time of supply”. 186(2) Section 19(1) (section 19E(1)(d) of the GST Act) Section 19E(1)(d) requires that supply correction information expresses the difference between the amount of consideration shown for the supply and the correct amount. The proposed amendment would provide that “supply correction information” can be corrected in a much less prescriptive manner, including allowing for corrections to be dealt with by cancelling the incorrect invoice and 187(1) 171 Section of the 2022 Amendment Act Description of change Clause of Bill issuing a new one, which better reflects commercial practice. Section 19(1) (section 19E(2)(b) of the GST Act) Section 19E(2)(b) sets out what taxable supply information means for a supply that has a value that exceeds $200 but does not exceed $1,000. As the rule is currently proposed, this includes a statement that the amount of consideration includes tax charged for the supply or a statement of the amount of tax charged for the supply. The problem is this could lead to a purchaser mistakenly thinking the price includes GST at the standard rate and claiming an input tax credit that they are not entitled to. For example, if A purchases a zero-rated supply for $800 from B, and the information provided merely includes a statement that the amount of consideration includes tax charged, B may mistakenly claim an input for 3/23 of the purchase price, thinking the standard GST rate of 15% applies. The proposed amendment ensures that the statement will specify the GST inclusive and exclusive amounts in these circumstances. 187(5) Section 19(1) (section 19E(2)(a), (b) and (c) of the GST Act) Section 19E(2)(a), (b) and (c) refer to a supply that “has a value that” exceeds the relevant threshold. This is problematic because “value of the supply” is a GST exclusive amount, whereas “consideration in money for the supply” is a GST inclusive amount. The proposed amendments would change “has a value that” to “the consideration in money for the supply”. This would align with the previous thresholds in section 24 of the GST Act, which referred to consideration in money. 187(2), 187(5) and 187(6) Section 19(1) (section 19E(2)(a)(iii) of the GST Act) The requirement for address details for the recipient under section 19E(2)(a)(iii) is redundant because “recipient details” in section 19E(2)(a)(ii) already requires identifying details for the recipient. Section 19E(2)(a(iii) would therefore be repealed. 187(3) 172 Section of the 2022 Amendment Act Description of change Clause of Bill Section 19(1) (section 19E(2)(a)(iv) of the GST Act) The reference to “the date of the supply” in section 19E(2)(a)(iv) is ambiguous and could refer to various dates. Th is reference would be replaced with “the date of the tax invoice, or where no invoice is issued, the time of supply”. 187(4) Sections 19(1) (section 19F of the GST Act) and 40 (section 75 of the GST Act) Section 19K(7)(a) provides that a supplier is not required to provide taxable supply information if the amount of consideration for the supply does not exceed $200. As a consequence of this, it may be difficult for the recipient of the supply to obtain the registration number of the supplier. The proposed amendments to both sections 19F and 75 would provide that a registered person is not required to keep a record of the GST registration number of the supplier if the amount of consideration for the supply is less than $200. An additional amendment to section 19F would clarify that a registered person who receives goods or services only needs to keep records if they are acquiring the supply to make taxable supplies (that is, if receiving goods or services for private use or to make an exempt supply, no records must be kept). 187(8) and 189 Section 19(1) (section 19G(2)(b) of the GST Act) The reference to “the date on which, or the period during which, the supply was received” in new section 19G(2)(b) is ambiguous and could refer to various dates. Th is reference would be replaced with “the date of the invoice, or where no invoice is issued, the time of supply”. 187(9) Section 19(1) (section 19G(2)(e) of the GST Act) The proposed amendment would repeal section 19G(2)(e), as “the time by which payment of the consideration for the supply is required” is not relevant. 187(10) Section 19(1) (section 19H(1) and 19H(3) of the GST Act) The proposed amendment to section 19H(1) would clarify that a registered person who receives a supply of secondhand goods that is not a taxable supply only needs to keep records of those goods if they have claimed an input tax deduction in respect of them (and therefore intend to use them to make taxable supplies). With the inclusion of the threshold amount in amended section 19H(1), section 19H(3) is no longer required. 187(11) and (12) 173 Section of the 2022 Amendment Act Description of change Clause of Bill Section 19(1) (section 19K(1) and (5) of the GST Act) The proposed amendments to sections 19K(1) and 19K(5) would replace the requirement to provide taxable supply information within 28 days of the supply to within 28 days of a request for this information. 187(13) and (14) Section 19(1) (section 19K(10) of the GST Act) Section 19K(10) provides that taxable supply information does not need to be issued if the Commissioner is satisfied that there are sufficient records to establish the particulars of the supply and it would be impractical to require taxable supply information to be provided. The proposed amendment would provide for a further option in these situations. This option would give the Commissioner discretion to allow the omission of certain particulars from taxable supply information (see previous law, section 24(6)(a) of the GST Act 1985). This would provide greater flexibility than simply allowing the taxable supply information to not be issued at all. In addition, a minor drafting error would be corrected by replacing “tax supply information” with “taxable supply information” in both places it appears. 187(15) Section 19(1) (sections 19E(2)(f) and 19L of the GST Act) Section 19L(1) sets out the taxable supply information required for supplies made by members of a GST or supplier group. Section 19L(1) would be replaced by new sections 19L(1) and (2) to ensure the requirement to provide a name and registration number only applies to either the supplying member or the representative/issuing member. A consequential amendment to section 19E(2)(f) would give effect to this change. 187(7) and (16) Section 19(1) (section 19N(2) of the GST Act) The proposed amendment to section 19N(2) would make the provision of supply correction information less prescriptive. The registered person would still be required to provide supply correction information, but the requirements of a date as agreed by the parties (section 19N(2)(a)) or within 28 days of the supply (section 19N(2)(b)) would be removed because they do not reflect commercial realities. 187(17) 174 Section of the 2022 Amendment Act Description of change Clause of Bill Section 21(1) and (2) The proposed amendment would rectify an error in effective dates. Section 21(1) of the 2022 Amendment Act, which amends section 20(2) of the GST Act, is scheduled to come into effect on 1 April 2023. The amendment would change this effective date to 30 March 2022. Similarly, section 21(2)(a) of the 2022 Amendment Act came into effect on the date of Royal assent. The proposed amendment would change this to 1 April 2023. 116(1), 116(2) and 188 175 Other remedial items 177 TAX TREATMENT OF EXPENDITURE ON DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS Clauses 34, 45, 46, and 98(22), (23) and (24) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would ensure that distribution network owners apply the component items approach, rather than the network approach, for depreciation and repairs and maintenance. A retrospective application date will validate the position of nearly all distribution network owners who have always applied the component items approach. The small number of network owners who apply a network approach for repairs and maintenance would be required to consistently apply the component items approach to both depreciation and repairs and maintenance from 1 April 2024. Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for the 2008–09 and later income years for distribution network operators that have always applied the component items approach For distribution network operators that have either filed a return before 1 April 2022 that does not apply the component items approach or have a binding ruling that allows the network approach, the proposed amendments would be effective for the 2024–25 and later income years. Background Distribution networks convey electricity, gas, water, and telecommunications. An example is the electricity distribution network of an electricity lines company. Its components include poles, cables, transformers, and switches. Deductions for expenditure on depreciable property are spread over the economic life of the property. Deductions for expenditure on repairs and maintenance are allowed in the year the expenditure is incurred. An issue in relation to distribution networks is whether the asset (for both depreciation and for repairs and maintenance purposes) is the network or its component items. If the asset is the network, expenditure to acquire or build the network will usually be depreciable over the life of the network and expenditure to replace its component items will usually be immediately deductible repairs and maintenance. If the assets are the component items, expenditure to acquire or replace a component item will usually be capitalised and depreciated over the life of the component (which is shorter than the life of the network). Network owners have, in nearly all instances, been depreciating component items of networks in accordance with the Commissioner’s depreciation schedule and treating component items as the relevant item of property for repairs and maintenance purposes since the depreciation rules were introduced on 1 April 1993 (component items approach). There is a high degree of uniformity in distinguishing capital expenditure from revenue expenditure for financial reporting purposes, Commerce Commission regulatory purposes and tax under the component items approach. The depreciation schedule has never included a depreciation rate for a distribution network 178 and the Commissioner considers it would be inappropriate to apply the default rate 28 to a network. In 2021, the Tax Counsel Office (TCO) of Inland Revenue concluded its view that, in accordance with case law, the asset for repairs and maintenance in the context of an Electricity Distribution Business is the “network” and not its components. TCO agree the “Asset” for repairs and maintenance considerations must be the same “Asset” for depreciation purposes, and consequently, they rejected the component items approach, which relied on the Commissioner’s itemised depreciation schedule. It concluded that, for the purposes of the depreciation rules and for determining whether expenditure on repairs and maintenance is deductible, a network, and not its component items, is the relevant asset (network approach). The network approach by extension applies to all distribution networks, including those that are not physically connected, such as cell phone towers. The network approach does not affect how the law applies to non-network assets, such as how depreciation applies to distinct chattels within residential property. Example 44: Component items approach The Ogdenville Community Trust owns and operates the electricity distribution network for Ogdenville and has always applied the component items approach. Their tax fixed asset register identifies 10,000 different items (mostly power poles) consistent with the items on the depreciation schedule with a depreciated tax value of $100m. This $100m can be broken into $98m of assets that will still exist at the end of the year and $2m of assets that are not fully depreciated but will be replaced during the year (assume the assets are disposed of for no consideration). During the current year, they spend $25m on the network. This can be broken down to $10m repairing existing assets (none of which improved the capital value), $5m replacing assets that have reached the end of their useful life and $10m extending and improving their network to provide additional capacity. The deductions during the current year for each of these categories is:  The existing assets that still exist at the end of the year are depreciated at their individual component rates. This provides a deductible depreciation loss of $8.8m.  For the existing assets that were disposed of, a deduction is available for their remaining adjusted tax value of $2m.  Expenditure on repairing existing assets of $10m is immediately deductible.  The $5m spent replacing assets and the $10m spent extending and improving the network are both amounts of capital expenditure and so are not immediately deductible. Assets with a cost of $15m will be added to the fixed asset register and will then be depreciable at individual component rates. This approach is broadly similar to the approach Ogdenville Community Trust applies for financial reporting and Commerce Commission purposes. There are differences in the depreciation rates for tax and for other purposes, so the depreciation amounts are likely to be different, but conceptually they are equivalent. 28 The default rate is for the remainder of items after allocating assets into the categories on the depreciation schedule. It is not intended to apply to the entire asset base of a distribution network. 179 Example 45: Network approach North Haverbrook Community Trust owns and operates the electricity distribution network for North Haverbrook. The Trust has previously applied the component items approach but has adopted the network approach for the current year. Their tax fixed asset register and expenditure in the current year are identical to the Ogdenville Community Trust in example 44. The deductions during the current year for each of these categories is:  The existing assets that still exist at the end of the year are depreciated at their individual component rates. 29 This provides total depreciation of $8.8m.  For the existing assets that were disposed of, a deduction is available for their remaining tax value of $2m.  Expenditure on repairing existing assets of $10m is immediately deductible.  The $5m spent on replacing assets is not significant, relative to the $100m value of the network, so is treated as repairs and maintenance and is immediately deductible.  The $10m spent extending and improving the network is capital expenditure. Assets with a cost of $10m will be added to the fixed asset register 30 and will then be depreciable at individual component rates. The network approach provides a higher deduction for repairs and maintenance than that available to the Ogdenville Community Trust in example 44. Over time the lower asset base will result in lower depreciation deductions and, if a network rate was issued, depreciation would likely be lower still. In aggregate, depending on a distribution network’s individual circumstances, this can provide a significant tax timing advantage over applying the component items approach. Over time original assets will be fully depreciated and/or replaced. The cost of replacement assets is not added to total assets, and therefore the tax value of the network will only represent the depreciated cost of extensions or improvements to the network. This will create a significant divergence between the tax value of the network and the value for accounting or regulatory purposes. Key features New definitions of “utilities distribution asset”, “utilities distribution network” and “utilities distribution network operator” would be added to section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Under proposed new section DB 68, when a utilities distribution network operator incurs expenditure on a utilities distribution asset or a utilities distribution network, the expenditure would be treated as relating to a utilities distribution asset, rather than the utilities distribution network, for determining whether the expenditure was capital in nature. 29 This is how distribution networks currently apply the network approach as there is no network depreciation rate. If the Commissioner issued a network depreciation rate, they would depreciate the network as a single asset at the network rate. It is likely the depreciation rate for a network would be lower than the average rate of its individual components. 30 As with footnote 29, this is because there is no network rate. If a network rate was added, they would increase the cost of the network asset by $10m and depreciate the new higher cost base at the network rate. 180 Proposed new section EE 6(2B) would confirm that utilities distribution assets are separate items of property for depreciation purposes, and proposed section EE 7(fc) would confirm that a utilities distribution network is not an item of depreciable property. Detailed analysis Definition of a “utilities distribution network operator” The proposed amendments would be specifically restricted to applying to distribution networks. This is because the TCO interpretation appears to have the most applicability to these industries. This is not intended to limit the application of an approach broadly equivalent to a component items approach in other sectors. A further extension of these principles could be considered in the future if taxpayers were found to be applying a different asset identification for depreciation and for repairs and maintenance purposes, as this misalignment would not be consistent with the policy intent. A definition of a “utilities distribution network operator” would be added to section YA 1. This definition would limit the scope of the other proposed amendments by ensuring the amendments apply only to electricity distribution, water, gas and telecommunication networks. For the avoidance of doubt, the proposed amendments are not intended to cover other networks, such as electricity generation, roads or railways. Definition of a “utilities distribution asset” The proposed definition of a “utilities distribution asset” would cover the assets that are used, or available for use, by the network operator to provide their goods and services. These assets will typically be those included in the Commissioner’s depreciation schedule, but the network operator will retain the flexibility how to classify smaller items. For example, a possum guard attached to a power pole could be included in the value of the power pole or could be separately identified (in which case the default depreciation rate would likely apply to that guard). Likewise, divisible assets, such as a length of electrical cable or a pipe, could continue to be classified in whatever way the network operator was reasonably categorising these. This may include methods such as a cable for a particular length, geographic area or installed during a specific period. A utilities distribution asset is not intended to cover groups of disparate assets, especially when those assets are separately identified on the depreciation schedule. Examples of groupings of assets that are not intended to be a utilities distribution asset include an entire network for a large area, such as a town, or a group of disparate assets (for example, power poles, cables, switches and a substation) within a smaller area, such as a suburb. This proposed amendment is not intended to limit the existing ability to pool assets with a value of under $5,000 per item or those with a greater value with a relatively homogeneous nature under a determination under section 91AAL of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which we understand some distribution networks are already applying. Whether expenditure is of a capital nature Proposed new section DB 68 would confirm that when a utilities distribution network operator incurs expenditure on utilities distribution assets, or their utilities distribution network, they must treat this expenditure as relating to the relevant utilities distribution asset, rather than the network. 181 The proposed amendment would not change the test as to whether expenditure is deductible revenue account expenditure or non-deductible capital account expenditure. The proposed amendment would simply confirm that the existing tests should be applied based on the expenditure being for separate assets, rather than the entire network. For example, expenditure on replacing an entire substation with an equivalent replacement item would meet the tests to be capital expenditure on the basis that all the asset has been replaced. However, if the network was instead chosen as the relevant asset, it is probable that the value of the substation would be low relative to the value of the entire network, and therefore applying the capital/revenue tests may have led to a different conclusion. Depreciation Proposed section EE 6(2B) would confirm that utilities distribution assets are separate items of depreciable property, and proposed section EE 7(fc) would confirm that a utilities distribution network is not depreciable property. This treatment is consistent with the depreciation schedule and officials’ understanding of the approach utilities distribution network operators have been applying since 1993. This amendment would prevent the distribution network, or a smaller group of disparate assets, from being treated as the item of depreciable property. Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for the 2008–09 and later income years for distribution network operators that have always applied the component items approach. It would be technically correct for this amendment to take effect on 1 April 1993; however, these earlier periods are covered by the time bar so making the amendment effective on 1 April 2008 removes the need to amend the Income Tax Act 1976, Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 while having no practical effect on these earlier returns. For distribution network operators that have either filed a return before 1 April 2022 that does not apply the component items approach or have a binding ruling that allows the network approach, the proposed amendments would be effective for the 2024–25 and later income years. This would allow distribution network operators who have already applied the network approach to continue to do so until the start of the 2024–25 year. 182 STUDENT LOAN TIME BAR Clause 163 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would limit the ability to adjust a past student loan repayment obligation once four years have passed. This amendment aligns student loan deductions, that relate to amendments to Employer Information, with other PAYE deductions for time bar purposes. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2023. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) imposes a four-year time bar on the amendment of tax assessments. The time bar means that, once four years have passed, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may not amend an assessment to increase the amount assessed or decrease the amount of a net loss. There are a limited number of exceptions to this four-year period, most notably that it does not apply in instances of fraud. The time bar was extended to include KiwiSaver employer and employee deductions and ACC earners’ levy deductions by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022. The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 deems incorrect student loan deductions to be full and final unless the amount of the under- or over-deduction is significant. However, there is no time bar for significant over- or under-deductions. There is nothing to prevent corrections to previously filed employment income information from amending an assessment of student loan deductions in the TAA. The consequence of not having a time bar for student loans is that it creates uncertainty for borrowers. This is because an employer can amend employment income information at any time. Such amendments can flow through and impact on a borrower’s loan repayment obligations and loan balance. The worst-case scenario is where an employer makes an amendment that results in a previously closed student loan having to be re-opened. The lack of a time bar also imposes an administrative burden on Inland Revenue, as Inland Revenue needs to explain to the individual that their student loan repayment obligations or balance has been affected by their employer correcting a past error. Key features The proposed amendment would insert new section 108AC into the TAA. The provision would prevent the Commissioner from amending an assessment that includes an amount of salary and wage deductions made under the SLSA after a period of four years. The existing limited exception to the time bar period would apply to this amendment, that is, where the employment income information provided by a taxpayer is fraudulent or wilfully misleading. In addition, the proposed new section would provide for an exception where not allowing an amendment of an assessment would have a significant adverse effect on a borrower. 183 BUSINESS CONTINUITY TEST – MEASUREMENT OF OWNERSHIP Clause 75 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would modify the beginning of the period of measurement for shareholder continuity for a company carrying forward tax losses under the business continuity test (BCT) from the date the loss was incurred to the date the company became subject to the BCT to ensure the ownership continuity provisions work correctly. Effective date The proposed amendment would be effective for the 2020–21 and later income years. Background The BCT, which was enacted in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021, allows companies to carry forward tax losses to future years when they have a change in ownership if there is no major change in the nature of the business activities of the company. Continuity of ownership is usually counted from the date a loss is incurred to the date the loss is used or the business continuity period ends. However, for a company that is maintaining losses under the BCT, this period is no longer appropriate, given the initial breach. In that case, the appropriate period would be from the date the company became subject to the BCT to the date the loss is used or the business continuity period ends. The amendment therefore proposes to amend the shareholder continuity test for the purposes of the BCT only to ensure it works correctly once there has been an initial shareholding breach. 184 EARLY PAYMENT DISCOUNT AND TAX P OOLING Clauses 190 and 191 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would change the effective date of the amendments made to the early payment discount (EPD) and tax pooling rules by sections 168 and 170 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 to the 2017–18 and later income years. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 30 March 2022. Background Amendments were made to sections RP 17 and RP 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007 by sections 168 and 170 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022. These changes were needed to ensure the treatment of EPD and tax pooling was the same throughout Inland Revenue’s transition from its former tax software platform, FIRST, to its new tax software platform, START. The changes were backdated, as requested by submitters, to the 2019–20 income year, as this is the year tax pooling and EPD began to be processed in START. However, cases relating to earlier income years were also processed in START (for example, late filers for the 2017–18 income year), but these cases were not able to enjoy the benefit of the recent amendments. As these amendments were intended to cover all transfers under START, the proposed amendments will change the effective date of these earlier amendments to the 2017– 18 and later income years. 185 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT RULES – DEBT-E QUITY SWAPS Clause 50 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would ensure that arrangements for an insolvent company debtor to issue shares for consideration on the basis that all or part of that consideration is used to repay a debt owed to the shareholder are treated in the same way as a direct issue of shares in repayment of debt. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background Under general tax principles, the forgiveness of a debt gives rise to taxable income because the debtor is in a better economic position than they were prior to the debt being forgiven. Under the current rules, tax consequences follow the form of the arrangement. This means that debt-forgiveness income can be avoided by using a two-step debt-equity swap. If shares are issued directly in exchange for a reduction in debt and the shares are worth less than the amount of the reduction, the debtor is taxed on debt forgiveness income. This is because the shares are worth less than the debt forgiven. However, if the arrangement is an issue of shares for cash and the debtor is required to use that cash to reduce or repay the debt, the shares can be treated as worth the same as the debt reduction, regardless of their actual value, and therefore no debt- forgiveness income arises. The proposed amendments would ensure that the financial arrangements rules operate as intended and taxpayers cannot avoid deriving debt-forgiveness income by using a two-step process for debt-equity swaps. Key features The proposed amendments would apply where there is an arrangement for an insolvent company to issue shares for consideration on the basis that all or part of that consideration is used to make a payment under a financial arrangement to which the company or an associated person is a party. Under the proposed amendments, that part of the consideration for which the shares are issued and the use of that consideration to make a payment under the financial arrangement would be disregarded. The issue of the shares would instead be treated as a payment under the financial arrangement. The amount of the payment would be the market value of the shares. 186 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS – IMPAIRED CREDIT ADJUSTMENTS Clauses 48 and 192 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would clarify that reversals of impaired credit adjustments to financial assets under the IFRS method are non-assessable to the extent that the reversal offsets a previous decline. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2007. Background Taxpayers who adopt the IFRS method are required to allocate the annual gain or loss in the value of a financial arrangement to an income year. However, if the financial arrangement is a financial asset, section EW 15D(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires that an amount arising from an impaired credit adjustment must not be allocated to an income year. This means that an adjustment due to the decline in the credit quality of a financial asset under IFRS is not tax deductible. This is the correct policy result, as these adjustments are provisions for doubtful debts. Doubtful debts are not tax deductible until they are written off as bad debts. Section EW 15D(3)(a) provides that an “impaired credit adjustment” means: for a financial arrangement accounted for under the fair value method, the movement in fair value through the decline in credit quality of the arrangement. Therefore, as the current law only considers declines in credit quality, an adjustment in recognition of a financial asset’s credit upgrade that reverses some, or all, of a previously reported credit loss is taxable income, even though the initial recognition was not deductible. This is an incorrect result and inconsistent with the policy intent of the subsection. In practice, Inland Revenue has been allowing reversals of impaired credit adjustments to be non-assessable. The proposed amendments would align the legislation with existing practice. Detailed analysis The proposed amendment to section EW 15D(3)(a) would ensure that reversals of impaired credit adjustments for financial arrangements accounted for under the fair value method are non-assessable to the extent they offset a previous decline. Increases in credit quality above, or in the absence of, a previous decline will still be required to be allocated to an income year and will remain assessable. A corresponding amendment will also be made to section EW 15C(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 for completeness. 187 Example 46: Reversal of an impaired credit adjustment A company recognises a financial asset under the IFRS method with an initial fair value of $100. There is a decline in credit quality of the financial asset during the first year. In recognition of an estimated credit loss, the company makes an impaired credit adjustment of $10 at the end of Year 1, resulting in a decrease in fair value of the asset to $90. This adjustment is not tax deductible. During Year 2 there is an improvement in the credit quality of the financial asset. The company revises its estimated credit loss for the asset and makes an upwards adjustment of $8 to partially reverse the previous impaired credit adjustment. This results in an increase in fair value of the asset to $98. The proposed amendments would ensure that the $8 gain is not required to be allocated to an income year and is not assessable income as it is a reversal of an impaired credit adjustment. Example 47: Improvement in credit quality above a previous decline Assume the same facts as in example 46 above. During Year 3, there is a further improvement in the credit quality of the financial asset. The company revises its estimated credit loss for the asset to a credit gain and makes an upwards adjustment of $5. This results in an increase in fair value of the asset to $103. The proposed amendments would provide that $2 of the $5 adjustment would be non-assessable, as this is the proportion of the adjustment that is offsetting an earlier decline. The remaining $3 is not a reversal of an impaired credit adjustment and will be assessable income. 188 GENERAL AND LIFE INSURANCE – REPLACEMENT OF NZ IFRS 4 WITH NZ IFRS 17 Clauses 20, 44, 58, and 98(10), (13), (14) and (25) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would update the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) to reflect that the NZ IFRS 4 accounting standard will be replaced by a new standard, NZ IFRS 17, from 1 January 2023. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 January 2023. Detailed analysis Life and general insurers currently use the NZ IFRS 4 accounting standard when calculating their Outstanding Claims Reserve (OCR). However, NZ IFRS 4 will be replaced by the new accounting standard, NZ IFRS 17, from 1 January 2023. To ensure taxpayers can continue to use IFRS accounting standards to calculate their OCR, the proposed amendments would replace the existing references to NZ IFRS 4 with references to the new NZ IFRS 17 accounting standard. 189 UPDATING LEGISLATIVE REFERENCES TO OECD TRANSFER PRICING GUIDELINES Clauses 66, 98(12) and (26), and 139(5) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would update the definition of “OECD transfer pricing guidelines” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) to refer to the 2022 version of the guidelines (2022 Guidelines) instead of the 2017 version (2017 Guidelines). A savings provision gives taxpayers time to become familiar with the new guidelines. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 20 January 2022. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply the 2017 Guidelines for the 2022–23 and earlier income years or for the period of any existing binding ruling applying the 2017 Guidelines (even if the period of the ruling extends beyond the 2022–23 income year). Background Transfer pricing rules apply to cross-border transactions between associated persons. Under section GC 6 of the ITA, the domestic transfer pricing rules are to be applied consistently with the “OECD transfer pricing guidelines”. The definition of “OECD transfer pricing guidelines” in section YA 1 currently refers to the 2017 Guidelines. 31 A deliberate decision was made to refer to a specific version of the guidelines, rather than to the guidelines as updated from time to time. This was so New Zealand did not automatically incorporate into domestic law any changes made at the OECD level without knowing, and considering, those changes. On 20 January 2022, the OECD published an updated version of the transfer pricing guidelines. 32 Officials have considered the changes made in the 2022 Guidelines and concluded the new guidelines are consistent with current transfer pricing practices. The 2022 Guidelines also provide additional guidance on the transfer pricing aspects of financial transactions. The 2017 Guidelines are therefore out of date, and references to the 2017 Guidelines in the ITA should be updated to refer to the 2022 Guidelines. Detailed analysis Transfer pricing rules apply to cross-border transactions between a New Zealand resident and an associated non-resident. Where the non-resident is in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA), the transaction is covered by the relevant DTA article based on Article 9 (Associated Enterprises) of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD Model). However, where the non-resident is in a country with which New Zealand does not have a DTA, the applicable rules are found in 31 OECD (2017), OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017. 32 OECD (2022), OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2022: https://www.oecd.org/tax/transfer-pricing/oecd-transfer-pricing- guidelines-for -multinational-enterprises-and-tax-administrations-20769717.htm 190 sections GC 6 to GC 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. New Zealand currently has 40 bilateral DTAs in force. The proposed amendments will only affect transactions not covered by a DTA. Cross- border transactions covered by an existing DTA will instead be governed by that DTA. DTAs are generally interpreted using an “ambulatory” approach, which means that guidance issued after the DTA came into force can still be considered in its interpretation. Although this has an element of retrospectivity, the convention is that updates to commentary and guidance are clarificatory only. Substantive changes should instead be made by changing the OECD Model itself, which will not automatically affect existing DTAs. Consistent with this convention, the differences between the 2017 Guidelines and the 2022 Guidelines are relatively minor and clarificatory in nature. They are also unlikely to affect most New Zealand taxpayers. One change relates to the “transactional profit split” transfer pricing method, which is rarely used in New Zealand. Another change provides guidance on certain hard-to-value intangibles, which are not generally observed in the New Zealand market. The most significant change is the inclusion of a new chapter on financial transactions. However, the guidance in that chapter is consistent with existing general transfer pricing principles and simply provides more detail and examples of how those principles apply to particular transactions. We also note that the changes in the 2022 Guidelines are from three OECD reports released in 2018 and 2020. Those reports were subject to public consultation, and therefore most transfer pricing practitioners were already aware of the changes before the 2022 Guidelines were published. The proposed amendments update the references to the 2022 Guidelines in section GC 13(1C) and the definition of “OECD transfer pricing guidelines” in section YA 1 of the ITA. Savings provision The savings provision is intended to give taxpayers more time to familiarise themselves with the new 2022 Guidelines. As noted above, however, the proposed amendments (and therefore the savings provision) will only affect transactions not covered by a DTA. Note that section GC 13(1C) currently refers to a particular paragraph of the 2017 Guidelines and it is proposed that this will be updated to refer to the new paragraph number for the relevant paragraph in the 2022 Guidelines. If a taxpayer relies on the savings provision and applies the 2017 Guidelines, they should continue to refer to the relevant paragraph in the 2017 Guidelines. 191 INCOME OF DECEASED PERSONS RECEIVED AFTER DATE OF DEATH Clauses 21 and 69 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would allow the tax return for a deceased person to include reportable income received up to 28 days after their date of death (DOD). Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for the 2022–23 and later income years. Background Section HC 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 currently provides that, in the case of a deceased person, an amount that would have been income of the person if they had been alive when it was received is treated as income of the trustee of the person’s estate. This requires the estate of the deceased person to register for an IRD number and file a separate tax return for the estate. Where the person has received only cash basis income this requirement seems excessive and results in unnecessary compliance costs, particularly where there is no tax to pay as the income has been fully taxed at source. This particularly affects payments by the Ministry of Social Development, whose current policy is to make payments to a deceased person up to 28 days after DOD. Under the current legislation, such payments are technically not considered to be payments received by the deceased person but rather by the estate. The estate is required to file a return for these payments under an estate IRD number. Key features Proposed new section HC 8(1B) would enable reportable income received up to 28 days after a person’s DOD to be treated as income of the deceased person and included in a return field under their IRD number. The result will be that the executor of the deceased person’s estate will not need to apply for an estate IRD number nor file a return for any reportable income received by the deceased person up to 28 days after DOD. A consequential amendment is proposed to section CV 12 to ensure the amount of any such reportable income is not income of the trustee of the estate if it was received within 28 days of the person’s DOD. 192 NON-ACTIVE TRUSTS Clauses 149 and 150(1) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would ensure that trusts and estates that derive small amounts of income are not required to file a tax return and therefore not required to comply with the new trust disclosure requirements. Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for the 2021–22 and later income years. Background Section 43B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides an exclusion for trustees of non-active trusts and executors or administrators of non-active estates from their tax filing obligations. Given the increased disclosure requirements under the new trust disclosure rules, the definitions in section 43B are overly restrictive and require more trusts and estates to file returns and comply with the new trust disclosure requirements than was intended. Some specific issues relating to the section are as follows:  It requires small testamentary trusts to file a return and meet the increased disclosure requirements, which may increase fees that would erode the corpus of the trust before vesting.  It does not apply to trusts with small amounts of income other than bank interest.  The de minimis of $200 for income and deductions is set too low and means that trusts that have immaterial amounts of income where tax has been deducted at source are required to file a return.  It is arguable that the wording in one of the exceptions does not deal with interest expenditure relating to dwellings owned by the trust.  It is unclear whether every non-active trust is required to notify Inland Revenue that it is non-active even if the trust does not have an IRD number. Key features The proposed amendments would include more trusts and estates within the ambit of section 43B, therefore removing them from the tax return filing obligations and increased trust disclosure requirements. In particular, the proposed amendments would:  No longer require a person to provide a declaration to the Commissioner that the trust or estate is non-active if the trust or estate does not have a IRD number.  Increase allowable administration costs from $200 to $1,000.  Extend the income exception from bank interest to reportable income. 33  Increase the threshold of the income exception from $200 to $1,000. 33 Assuming the trust is a natural person for the definition of “reportable income”. 193  Clarify that interest is included in the expenditure relating to dwellings owned by the trust.  Ensure that testamentary trusts with small amounts of income will not be required to file a tax return so that the administrative costs associated with filing returns do not unduly diminish the value of the trust. This would apply to a trust that: − is a testamentary trust − has distributions during the income year that do not exceed $100,000 − earns reportable income not exceeding $5,000 for the income year and has tax deducted from that income at the correct rate, and − if the trust derives non-reportable income of $1,000 or less, has deductions against that income of at least $800 for the income year. 194 PROVISIONAL TAX – STANDARD UPLIFT CALCULATION METHOD FOR THE SECOND INSTALMENT Clause 88 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would clarify the “uplift” factor a taxpayer using the standard method must use to calculate provisional tax payable for the year if they have not filed the preceding tax year’s tax return on or before the second instalment date. Effective date The proposed amendments in clauses (1) and (2) would have effect for provisional tax payments for the income years corresponding to the 2008–09 and later tax years. The proposed amendments in clauses (3)-(6) would be effective for the 2017–18 and later income years. Background For taxpayers using the standard “uplift” factor to calculate their provisional tax liability, section RC 5(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is unclear which uplift factor should be used by a taxpayer. The policy intent is that a taxpayer using the standard method to calculate their provisional tax liability for a tax year can initially use 110% of their residual income tax for the tax year before the preceding tax year to calculate their standard “uplift” amount (the 10% uplift). However, once they file the preceding tax year’s return the 110% option becomes unavailable to them, and they must use the 5% uplift factor (based on 105% of their residual income tax for the preceding tax year). 34 As the legislation currently reads, if a taxpayer has not filed their preceding year’s tax return before their first instalment date for provisional tax, it is arguable they can then use the 10% uplift for their second instalment date. This is the case even if they file their preceding tax year’s return after the first instalment date but before, or on, the second instalment date. This does not reflect the policy intent. In addition, there appears to be some confusion as to which “uplift” factor must be used when an instalment date falls on a day that is not a working day and taxpayers pay that instalment on the next working day but also file their preceding year’s tax return on that same day. The policy intent was correctly reflected in the Income Tax Act 2004. The uncertainty appears to have arisen as an unintended consequence of the rewrite of the legislation. The proposed amendments would clarify the position to reflect the policy intent. 34 This also applies if the relevant instalment is the final instalment. 195 INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF GRANTS PAID BY PUBLIC PURPOSE CROWN-CONTROLLED COMPANIES Clauses 30 and 36 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would ensure that grants paid by public purpose Crown- controlled companies (PPCCCs) have the same income tax treatment as grants paid by public authorities. Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for grants and subsidies paid by PPCCCs on or after 18 March 2019. Background On the advice of Crown Law, Inland Revenue changed its interpretation of a “public authority” in 2015. This resulted in a number of entities no longer qualifying as public authorities. A new income tax exemption for PPCCCs (section CW 38B of the Income Tax Act 2007) was enacted by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 with effect from 18 March 2019. Section CW 38B provides an income tax exemption for companies that meet specific criteria, including having a primary purpose of carrying out a public policy objective of the Government. Section CW 38B effectively restored the income tax exemption to certain companies that no longer qualified as public authorities following the change in interpretation. Grants paid by public authorities are exempt income of the recipient (section CX 47). The recipient is denied a deduction, to the extent of the amount of the grant, for expenditure that corresponds to the grant from the public authority (section DF 1). The Commissioner of Inland Revenue applied administrative discretion to treat PPCCCs as public authorities between the change of interpretation of “public authority” in 2015 and the enactment of section CW 38B on 18 March 2019. This meant that while PPCCCs were considered public authorities, grants paid by PPCCCs were exempt income of the recipient and deductions were denied for the corresponding expenditure. When section CW 38B was enacted on 18 March 2019, no consideration was given to how grants paid by PPCCCs should be treated by the recipients. Since 18 March 2019, these grants have been taxable income to the recipient and deductions have been allowed. Key features The proposed amendments would treat grants paid by PPCCCs as exempt income in the hands of the recipients and would deny deductions for expenditure relating to the grants. This would ensure that these grants are treated the same as grants from public authorities. 196 LTC ELECTION – ROLLOVER OF ACQUISITION DATE FOR COMPANY ASSETS Clause 68 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would clarify that, for a company making an election to become a look-through company (LTC), the LTC has the same acquisition date for the company’s assets as the superseded company. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2011, being the original effective date for section HB 13(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Background When a company makes an election to become an LTC, it is effectively deemed to have been replaced by the LTC. The policy intent is that the LTC steps into the shoes of the superseded company for all purposes under the LTC rules. In line with this intention, section HB 13(6) provides that an entity that ceases to be a company upon becoming an LTC is treated as having, as an LTC, the same status, intention, purpose and tax book values it had as a company for its assets, liabilities and associated legal rights and obligations. However, the section does not explicitly refer to the LTC having the same acquisition date for the assets as the superseded company. The proposed amendment would remedy this by providing that the LTC has the same tax book timings as the superseded company. 197 REFERENCES TO ADOPTION IN THE ITA AND THE TAA Clauses 67, 71, 98(17), 99, 165 and 175 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would remove redundant references to adopted children from the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Effective da te The proposed amendment would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background The Adoption Act 1955 provides that, once an adoption order has been made, an adopted child is deemed to become the child of the adoptive parents for all purposes, civil, criminal, or otherwise. The child is also deemed not to be the child of the birth parents. This is subject to the provisions of any enactment that distinguishes in any way between adopted children and other children. Therefore, the ITA and TAA do not need to specifically refer to children by adoption to ensure they are treated the same as children by birth, as they are already included within references to blood relatives. Both Acts contain several references to adoption, and these could create a negative inference for other provisions that do not include such a reference. Key features The Bill proposes to remove redundant references to adopted children in the ITA and TAA. The proposed amendments would not change the treatment of adopted children, who are already treated as blood relatives unless specifically provided otherwise. The amendments would simply remove any potential uncertainty around their treatment under the ITA and TAA. The proposed amendments are summarised in the table below. Certain references are deliberate and would be retained. Table 4: References to children by adoption in the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 References to be removed References to remain unchanged Section HA 7(3)(a) of the ITA Section HC 36(5) of the ITA and the reference to section 7(4) of the Adoption Act 1955 in the definition of “guardian” Section HC 36(5) of the ITA in the definition of “relative” Section 80KB of the TAA Section YA 1 of the ITA in paragraph (a)(iv) of the definition of “relative” Section YB 4(3) of the ITA 198 References to be removed References to remain unchanged Section 124G(4)(b) of the TAA Sections 173M(5) and (6)(c) of the TAA in relation to the definition of ‘relative’ 199 INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIAN UNIT TRUSTS Clauses 14, 31, 51, 52, 55, 56 and 57 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would:  allow New Zealand resident investors who hold 10% or more of the interests in an Australian unit trust (AUT) to use the fair dividend rate (FDR) method for calculating their attributable foreign investment fund (FIF) income, and  reduce economic double taxation by removing from taxation in New Zealand the income sourced from certain attributing interests in a FIF that will already be subject to tax under the FIF rules. Effective date The proposed amendment to the availability of the FDR method would be effective for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2014. The proposed amendments to limit the risk of economic double taxation would be effective for income years commencing on or after 1 April 2023. Background AUTs are an investment vehicle popular in Australia, particularly for large-scale infrastructure investments like public-private partnerships. AUTs are treated as trusts under Australian tax law but are considered companies under New Zealand tax law. In many AUTs, the beneficiaries of the unit trust (unit holders) have fixed rights to trust income that are not subject to trustee discretion. Income rights are divided amongst the beneficiaries based on how many units have been issued to them. The AUTs can be treated as ‘flow-through’ for Australian income tax purposes, with the unit holders treated as receiving the AUT income. The FIF rules tax investments held by New Zealand residents in a range of foreign funds, including foreign unit trusts. The FIF rules apply to portfolio interests (less than 10%) and, in some situations, to non-portfolio interests. The investor is taxed on their income from the investment on accrual. There are several methods available to investors under the FIF rules to calculate their attributable FIF income. FIF distributions are generally not taxed to prevent double taxation. The intent of the FIF rules is to ensure that New Zealand residents do not escape New Zealand income tax on their foreign investments. Under the FIF rules, the FDR method deems 5% of the opening value of a person’s investment to be taxable income. The FDR method is the standard method for many New Zealand residents for calculating attributable FIF income. The controlled foreign company (CFC) rules apply to interests held by New Zealand residents in foreign companies where generally five or fewer New Zealand residents hold 50% of the shareholding. The CFC rules tax mobile passive income as it accrues so that New Zealand income tax cannot be avoided by sheltering foreign income offshore. However, the current FIF and CFC rules can cause undesirable outcomes for New Zealand resident investors in AUTs in certain situations. The proposed amendments would rectify this. 200 Key features The proposed amendments would:  amend the definition of an “opening value” of a FIF interest in sections EX 52(5) and EX 53(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) to ensure that taxpayers can calculate their FIF income from an attributable interest in an AUT under the FDR method  extend the current treatment of distributions received from an AUT (which are treated as excluded income and not dividends) to include distributions from an AUT that are sourced from an attributing interest in a FIF, and  amend the CFC rules to exclude certain amounts from being an attributable CFC amount. This exclusion would apply to distributions received by an AUT CFC from an attributing interest in an AUT FIF, where an appropriate FIF calculation method is applied to that FIF. A consequential change is also proposed to the CFC rules to limit the funding costs deduction for distributions made by the AUT CFC. Detailed analysis Inability to use FDR method New Zealand resident investors who hold 10% or more of the interests in an AUT are currently unable to use the FDR method for calculating their attributable FIF income. Before 2014, interests of 10% or more in AUTs were exempt from the New Zealand FIF and CFC rules. In 2014, the FIF exemption for most AUTs was removed. However, certain consequential changes to the FIF rules were not made. In particular, the definition of “opening value” in the FDR method calculation rules was not amended to accommodate AUTs, which means that calculating FIF income under the FDR method is not possible. This omission inadvertently limits the options available for a New Zealand resident investor to calculate their FIF income from AUTs. The proposed amendment would ensure that New Zealand resident investors in AUTs can use the FDR method to calculate their FIF income in relevant situations. This change would be effective retrospectively to income years commencing on or after 1 July 2014 to preserve the position of taxpayers that may have calculated attributable FIF income using the FDR method since that date. Double taxation of FIF income from certain indirect AUT interests Where a New Zealand tax resident holds a direct interest in a FIF and one of the FIF methods listed in section EX 59 of the ITA are used to calculate income, the rules ensure no further taxation arises from that FIF interest to avoid double taxation. This is done by treating distributions from certain attributing interests in a FIF as excluded income and as not being a dividend. However, there is no corresponding exclusion of distributions from indirect FIF interests held by a CFC. This means if a New Zealand resident holds their FIF investment through an overseas subsidiary, rather than directly, a distribution from that indirect FIF interest can be taxable. An example of this is where an AUT that is a CFC holds the FIF interest. Distributions from an AUT generally do not qualify for the foreign dividend exemption and are taxed in New Zealand. This can result in double taxation of a New Zealand investor on the same economic income – once as attributed FIF income, and again as the distribution from the AUT. The proposed amendment would extend the dividend exclusion and excluded income treatment to a distribution paid by an AUT from funds sourced from certain attributing interests in a FIF. This would help to ensure that the economic income of the relevant FIF is only taxed once. 201 Over taxation of AUT CFC income Where a New Zealand resident investor owns an AUT CFC that holds an interest in an AUT FIF, a distribution from the AUT FIF to the CFC may be an attributable CFC amount for the New Zealand resident. The CFC rules provide a deduction for distributions by an AUT CFC in certain circumstances, but this is limited to a proportion based on the CFC’s assets that derive attributable CFC amounts relative to its total assets. While an AUT CFC must return the entire distribution from the AUT FIF as income, only a portion of that distribution is deductible when the AUT CFC passes that distribution on to its investors. Double economic taxation can arise because the New Zealand investor returns income under the FIF rules on its indirect investment in the AUT FIF and a portion of this is also returned by the taxpayer as income from its direct interest in the AUT CFC under the CFC rules. The proposed amendment would update the CFC rules to exclude amounts received by an AUT CFC from an attributing interest in an AUT FIF where the FIF income or loss of the AUT FIF will separately be attributed to a New Zealand resident under one of the methods listed in section EX 59 of the ITA. This will ensure that the economic income of the relevant FIF will only be taxed once to the New Zealand investor. An additional change will ensure that a deduction is not available under the CFC rules to the extent the AUT CFC on-pays the FIF distribution to its investor(s). 202 INTEREST RATE SWAPS HELD BY MULTI-RATE PIES Clause 72 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would reduce volatility for multi-rate portfolio investment entities (PIEs) by allowing them to choose to use Method C in Determination G27 to spread income and deductions from interest rate swaps if they meet the requirements for the method. Effective date The proposed amendment would be effective for the 2023–24 and later income years. Background Section HM 35(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains a timing rule that requires a multi-rate PIE to allocate income and deductions:  as reflected in the PIE’s valuation of investor interests (for example, unit pricing) if such valuations are made, or  as shown in the PIE’s financial statements if it does not value investor interests. This rule overrides other timing rules, including the spreading methods in the financial arrangements rules. The intention is to tax PIE income as it accrues to an investor rather than later when the investor may have already exited the PIE. Interest rate swaps, which change in value as interest rates change, are usually taxed under the financial arrangements rules. Method C in Determination G27 contains one of the available spreading methods for these swaps. This method effectively ignores unrealised fair value gains or losses on interest rate swaps for tax purposes, meaning only interest rate swap cashflows are taxed. This reduces volatility and is appropriate because, while there can be significant fair value movements (both gains and losses) over the life of a swap, these movements should net to zero if it is held to maturity. Multi-rate PIEs cannot currently use this determination method because of section HM 35(8). This results in volatility because fair value movements on interest rate swaps are included in the taxable income of a multi-rate PIE. The proposed amendment would remedy this. 203 MEANING OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGING Clause 54 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would clarify what highly effective hedging means for non- ordinary shares under the foreign investment fund (FIF) regime. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 26 June 2019. Background The comparative value (CV) method in section EX 44(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 must be used to calculate FIF income from all interests that are non-ordinary shares. One of the requirements for a non-ordinary share in section EX 46(10)(c)(ii) is that the FIF’s assets must be denominated in New Zealand dollars or be hedged to New Zealand dollars by a hedging instrument that is highly effective under IFRS 9. Alternatively, section EX 46(10)(cb)(iii) requires that the interest in the FIF itself must be hedged to New Zealand dollars by a hedging instrument that is highly effective under IFRS 9. However, IFRS 9 does not refer to, or define, a highly effective hedge. This means it is not clear when the CV method must be used. This problem is the result of a change made to sections EX 46(10)(c)(ii) and (cb)(iii) on 26 June 2019 that updated the accounting standard reference from NZIAS 39 to IFRS 9. Before this change, the non-ordinary share rules required a hedging instrument to be highly effective under NZIAS 39. NZIAS 39 defined a “highly effective hedge” as a hedging instrument that removes 80% to 125% of the foreign currency risk for the hedged item. This was a simple bright-line test for taxpayers to apply. Key features The proposed amendment would remedy this problem by amending section EX 46(10)(c)(ii) to require the FIF’s assets to be denominated in New Zealand dollars or have a value in New Zealand dollars that is governed by a foreign currency hedge that removes 80% to 125% of the foreign currency risk for the assets. It would also amend section EX 46(10)(cb)(iii) to require the interest in the FIF to have a value in New Zealand dollars that is governed by a foreign currency hedge that removes 80% to 125% of the foreign currency risk for the interest. 204 R&D TAX INCENTIVE – NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES IN ACTIVITIES Clauses 157 and 158 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would amend the R&D tax incentive (RDTI) to:  remove the requirement for businesses with multi-year general approvals to notify the Commissioner that there have been no material changes in their business, and  clarify when a business is required to apply for a variation to an existing approval to cover any material changes. Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for the 2020–21 and later income years. Detailed analysis Removal of existing notification requirement Businesses with a general approval of their R&D activities for multiple income years (up to three) are currently required to notify the Commissioner, in each of the second and third years of those approvals, that there have been no material changes for their business for the relevant income year. The first year for which this notification is required is the 2021–22 income year (for multi-year general approvals from the 2020– 21 income year). The proposed amendment would repeal section 68CB(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to remove this requirement as it imposes unnecessary compliance costs on businesses. It is more sensible to require businesses to notify the Commissioner when there is a material change in their business rather than when there is not one. Requirement to apply for variation In practice, businesses are already required to apply for a variation to an existing approval if there is a material change in their activities or their criteria and methodologies if they want that change to be covered by the existing approval. This is because a business cannot be credited the RDTI for activities or criteria and methodologies that are not covered, or are materially different from those covered, by their approval. Sections 68CB(7) and (7B) (for general approvals) and section 68CC(8) (for criteria and methodologies approvals) set out the Commissioner’s obligations for approving applications for variations. However, they do not specifically state under what circumstances a business must apply for a variation. Proposed new section 68CB(3B) would apply for activities covered by general approvals. It would clarify that if there is a material change in activities after a business has received approval, and the business wants the change to be covered by the existing approval, it would need to apply to the Commissioner for a variation of its existing approval by the deadline provided for in section 68CB(7) or (7B), as applicable. Proposed new section 68CC(4B) would apply for criteria and methodologies approvals. It would clarify that if there is a material change in criteria and methodologies after a business has received approval, and the business wants the change to be covered by 205 the existing approval, it would need to apply to the Commissioner for a variation of its existing approval by the deadline provided for in section 68CC(8). Both proposed new sections are intended to be clarifications only and would not change the existing processes or obligations for when there is a material change in ac tivities or criteria and methodologies. If there is a material change during the income year (for example, a business performs a new R&D activity during the year not initially covered by its existing RDTI approval), but the business does not wish to claim the RDTI for expenditure associated with that change, then there is no obligation to apply for a variation. 206 PETROLEUM DECOMMISSIONING Clause 82 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would correct an error with the petroleum decommissioning rules to ensure a refundable credit is not disallowed in a particular circumstance where the intent is that a refundable credit should be available. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 30 March 2022 to align with the date that the previous amendments were effective from. Background The petroleum decommissioning rules were amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 to ensure they applied correctly when a petroleum miner abandoned an exploratory well. Further detail on how these rules apply is in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34, No 5, June 2022. These amendments included introducing the term “exploration abandonment excess”, which is intended to limit a refundable credit when insufficient tax has been paid by the petroleum miner since drilling for the purposes of exploration ceased. This excess is calculated in one of three different ways depending on the circumstances outlined in sections LT 1(4D)(a) to (c). However, one particular circumstance inadvertently fell within paragraph (c) instead of paragraph (a). This circumstance is where a petroleum miner has not abandoned any exploratory wells but has a loss for the year that is higher than their expenditure on previously unallocated development deductions (section LT 1(1)(a)(i)) and decommissioning development wells (section LT 1(1)(a)(ii)). In this case, the exploration abandonment excess should be zero (rather than calculated under the formula in section LT 1(4D)(c)) as there is no abandonment expenditure to contribute to the refundable credit. Key features Section LT 1(4D)(a) would be amended so that it applies whenever a petroleum miner has not incurred expenditure in plugging and abandoning an exploratory well during the year such that the amount in section LT 1(1)(a)(iii) is zero. 207 REMOVING TRANSITIONAL PROVISION Clause 166 Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would remove a redundant provision. Effective date The proposed amendment would have effect for penalties imposed on or after 1 April 2023. Background Provisions allowing the Commissioner a discretion not to impose penalties where it was necessary due to resource constraints imposed by the co-existence of two Inland Revenue software platforms were included in the Tax Administration Act 1994. As new tax products were progressively introduced into Inland Revenue’s new computer system, START, these provisions have been repealed. However, the last of these provisions, section 139A(9), was retained until the completion of the business transformation programme as there was a concern that penalties could have arisen in relation to late returns where it would have been appropriate to grant remission. As sufficient time has now passed since all tax products were migrated to START, section 139A(9) is now redundant and should be repealed to avoid any confusion for taxpayers. Consequential amendments are also required to sections 139A(6) and (7) as these provisions refer to section 139A(9). 208 TRUSTS – IMPUTATION CREDITS AND DISTRIBUTIONS Clauses 12 and 80 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would ensure that the amount of the tax credits apportioned to a beneficiary of a trust after a dividend distribution match the imputation credits included in their assessable income to ensure the beneficiary is only taxed on the imputation credits they actually receive. Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for the 2008–09 and later income years. Background Section CD 15(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that the amount of a dividend received by a person includes any imputation credits attached to the dividend. Section LE 1 provides that if the person’s assessable income includes an imputation credit, then they have a tax credit that is equal to the imputation credit (plus any credits from prior years that have been carried forward). Section LE 5 applies when a person receives an imputed dividend in their capacity as a beneficiary of a trust. The section adjusts the beneficiary’s tax credit under section LE 1 so that the amount of tax credit they have under that section is proportionate to the trust distributions they have received. However, under the Income Tax Act 2004, there was a provision in addition to section LE 5. That additional provision applied if a beneficiary’s tax credit was adjusted, and it ensured the beneficiary’s imputation credit was also adjusted. This meant the imputation credit included in the beneficiary’s assessable income was the adjusted (or limited) amount. That additional provision was not carried over from the Income Tax Act 2004 to the Income Tax Act 2007. This means that, under current law, a beneficiary can be taxed on a portion of an imputation credit they have not actually received. This was not an intended change in the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. The proposed amendments would therefore correct this. Key features The proposed amendments would ensure that any limitation on the tax credit a beneficiary receives following a dividend distribution is also applied to limit the associated imputation credit they receive. The amendments would ensure that only the amount of imputation credit the beneficiary actually receives is included in their assessable income. Detailed analysis The proposed amendment to section LE 5(2) would extend the formula prescribed to limit a person’s tax credit to also limit the associated imputation credit included in the person’s assessable income. 209 The proposed amendment to section CD 15(1)(a) would then ensure that the imputation credit included in a person’s dividend under that section is reduced to take into account any limitation to the imputation credit made under section LE 5. That is, the adjusted imputation credit amount would be included in the person’s assessable income if section LE 5 applied to limit their tax credit. The proposed amendments would ensure that, if the imputation credit is limited because of section LE 5(2), only the imputation credit the person actually receives is included in their assessable income rather than the full imputation credit. 210 PRIORITY ACCORDED TO KIWISAVER EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS Clauses 140, 174, 193 and 194 Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would clarify that KiwiSaver employer contributions have the same preferential debt status whether the employer is a natural person or a company or association. Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2023. Background Where an employer is a natural person who has been bankrupted, unpaid KiwiSaver employer contributions are treated as preferential debt under section 167(2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Where an employer is a company or an association that is being liquidated, section 167(2)(b) of the TAA provides that KiwiSaver employer contributions have the ranking provided for in schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993. However, KiwiSaver employer contributions are not separately identified in schedule 7. This is creating confusion regarding whether they are preferential debt because, in all other cases, taxes with preferential status are separately identified in schedule 7. There is no reason that KiwiSaver employer contributions should have a different status where the employer is a company or association. The proposed amendments would clarify this. 211 Maintenance items 213 MAINTENANCE AMENDMENTS Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments in table 5 reflect minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of income tax legislation and subsequent changes. Effective date Effective dates for the proposed amendments are outlined in table 5. Minor maintenance items The proposed amendments in table 5 would correct any of the following:  ambiguities  compilation issues  cross-references  drafting consistency, including readers’ aids – for example, the defined terms lists  grammar  consequential amendments arising from substantive rewrite amendments, and  inconsistent use of terminology and definitions.

This emerging model of business, referred to as the gig and sharing economy, is driven by modern technologies that enable digital platforms to facilitate transactions between sellers and buyers, often through a mobile application. A study of the major global markets placed the size of the gig and sharing economy at US$204 billion in 2018, with that size projected to reach US$455 billion by 2023. As a result of growth in the gig and sharing economy, many people now have an opportunity to offer their goods and services to a wide audience of potential buyers in a format that is flexible and accessible. 1.2 The emergence of the gig and sharing economy has created a need for governments across the world to re-evaluate whether their tax systems remain fit -for -purpose. The Government wants to explore opportunities to ensure that the tax system functions fairly and supports those who earn income through the gig and sharing economy. 1.3 The purpose of this discussion document therefore is to consult generally on matters relating to New Zealand’s tax settings applicable to the gig and sharing economy. It considers options that the Government is considering that have the objectives of minimising compliance costs for digital platforms, improving fairness for traditional sellers, enhancing tax compliance generally, and making life easier for sellers entering the sector who may not be familiar with business tax obligations. 1.4 Chapter two provides background and context on these issues and discusses the opportunities and options available to address these issues. 1.5 Chapter three consults on whether New Zealand should implement rules developed at the OECD which require digital platforms to provide information to tax authorities that would then be shared globally. The purpose of these rules is to create a global standardised approach to information collection and exchange to ensure that income from sales is taxed appropriately. 1.6 Chapter four considers whether GST should apply to all sales made through digital platforms and whether digital platforms should have a role of collecting GST on behalf of sellers that operate on their platforms. This is to improve fairness and support the long-term sustainability of the GST system. This chapter also draws upon OECD work on the impacts of the gig and sharing economy on GST policy and administration. 1.7 Chapter five summarises other potential opportunities to improve the tax system in the context of the gig and sharing economy. It consults on whether there are improvements that could be made to some of the existing tax rules, and whether the Government should consider further measures to help reduce compliance costs for sellers in the gig and sharing economy. 1.8 Several key terms are used in this discussion document. Unless otherwise stated, those terms have the corresponding meanings: Digital platform These are software platforms that connect buyers and sellers of goods and services through an online marketplace. This is not intended to include Application Programming Interfaces 6 (APIs). This term is further defined in chapters 3 and 4 for the purposes of the proposals discussed in those chapters. DAC7 The Council Directive (EU) 2021/514 adopted by the Council of the European Union on 22 March 2021. DAC7 is discussed further in chapter 3. Gig and sharing economy Refers to economic activity facilitated by digital applications (often referred to as “apps”) that connect buyers with sellers who provide their skills, labour and/or assets for a consideration. Model rules Rules developed by the OECD to allow tax jurisdictions around the world to share information relating to transactions on digital platforms. The model rules are discussed further in chapter 3. Registered person A person who is registered for goods and services tax under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This also includes a person who is liable to be registered for GST under the Act. Seller People who earn income through their activity on digital platforms.

This chapter considers these issues. 2.3 This discussion document seeks to address these issues and ensure that existing tax settings appropriately cater to the gig and sharing economy in New Zealand. This chapter outlines options to address the identified issues. The options draw heavily on work by the OECD on taxation and information collection and exchange in the gig and sharing economy. 2.4 Addressing the issues identified is a crucial step in maintaining the social licence of the gig and sharing economy so that it can continue to develop and support New Zealand’s economy into the future. Making it easier to comply with income tax obligations 2.5 A key issue with the current tax settings is that they do not support sellers to comply with their income tax obligations. Many academic authors have commented on the tax compliance challenges facing sellers in the gig and sharing economy. 1 These authors have also expressed concern about the lack of data available in this area. To better understand the challenges they face, tax authorities throughout the OECD are taking steps to improve data collection. For example, a 2017 study prepared for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs revealed a lack of understanding on the part of sellers earning income through the United Kingdom gig and sharing economy about their tax obligations. 2.6 People participating in the gig economy can often be sole operators with little experience in business practices. The gig and sharing economy enables people to access paid work with relative ease. In most cases, simply signing up to a digital platform connects the seller with customers and potential revenue flows. However, once the seller is established on a digital platform, this initial simplicity can give way to complexity. This is because tax obligations remain the responsibility of individual sellers who will, to remain compliant with their tax obligations, need to keep records and set aside some of their earnings in anticipation of a future tax bill. 2.7 Those who earn income through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy have different obligations to those who earn income from investments 1 Bornman, M., & Wessels, J. (2018). The tax compliance decision of the individual in business in the sharing economy. eJTR, 16, 425; Migai, C. O., de Jong, J., & Owens, J. P. (2018); Oei, S. Y., & Ring, D. M. (2015). Can sharing be taxed. Wash. UL Rev., 93, 989. The sharing economy: turning challenges into compliance opportunities for tax administrations. eJTR, 16, 395. One study looked at conversations between ride-sharing sellers on various internet discussion forums. The authors found that the tax advice shared in these forums ranged in sophistication and accuracy. They concluded that non-compliance was likely to be at its lowest for expenses claimed by ride-sharing sellers: Oei, S. Y., & Ring, D. M. (2017). The tax lives of Uber drivers: Evidence from internet discussion forums. Colum. J. Tax L., 8, 56. 8 and through employment, as investment income payers and employers have obligations to provide Inland Revenue with income information (and withhold tax) which reduces compliance costs for these taxpayers, as they do not have to keep records and save for anticipated tax liabilities. 2.8 New Zealand’s administration of income tax means that a substantial proportion of individuals – wage and salary earners – do not need to prepare or file income tax returns. Instead, their income tax obligations are largely dealt with by withholding taxes through their employer (PAYE), bank (RWT), or KiwiSaver fund (PIE rules). These third parties also provide a significant amount of information to Inland Revenue which is then used to pre-populate income tax returns. These rules are designed so that individuals do not have to be experts on tax law and preparing tax returns. 2.9 As a result, most individuals do not typically need to access software products, accountants or other tax advisors who assist individuals in managing their tax affairs. Many of those who enter the gig and sharing economy may therefore have no, or limited, prior experience of managing their tax obligations outside of being an employee; their participation in the gig and sharing economy will be the first time the obligation to apply more complex rules falls on them. 2.10 Internationally, there are hundreds of thousands of sellers engaged in the gig and sharing economy. These sellers are linked directly to digital platforms that collate detailed information on their activities. There is a clear opportunity therefore to improve Inland Revenue’s visibility of income information held by digital platforms, which could be used to encourage sellers to comply with their tax obligations. Doing so would support the social licence of the gig and sharing economy in New Zealand. Improving fairness between similar service providers 2.11 Another issue with the current tax settings is that they do not always promote fairness between sellers in the gig and sharing economy and traditional suppliers. This is because the current rules do not create a level playing field between traditional suppliers and sellers operating in the gig and sharing economy. In this discussion document therefore, fairness refers to traditional suppliers and sellers in the gig and sharing economy facing similar GST rules. 2.12 New Zealand’s goods and services tax (GST) is a broad-based tax on the supply of goods and services in New Zealand. A comprehensive GST ensures that businesses face the same cost and pricing considerations as each other. This is important for maintaining fairness. However, the GST system recognises that imposing GST obligations on businesses increases their compliance costs. Hence suppliers are not required to register for GST if the value of their supplies made in a 12-month period is expected to be less than $60,000. This registration threshold generally strikes the correct balance between the compliance costs of smaller operators and maintaining fairness between suppliers by reducing competitive distortions. 2.13 Many sellers in the gig and sharing economy will not exceed the $60,000 registration threshold for GST. However, their sales will be charged and collected by a smaller number of digital platforms which collectively facilitate millions of sales of services in New Zealand. While GST is effectively collected on a portion of these sales by non-resident platforms under the remote services 9 rules, 2 those who receive services facilitated by digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy are not generally subject to GST themselves. 2.14 The current tax rules do not create a level playing field between gig and sharing economy sellers and their more traditional counterparts. While most sellers on digital platforms are not required to charge GST, competing suppliers such as taxi drivers, hotels and motels are generally charging GST. For example, taxi companies often require their drivers to register for GST regardless of whether they meet the registration threshold, as many of their clientele will be registered for GST and will expect to claim a GST refund for their taxi rides. 2.15 When considering the gig and sharing economy collectively then, the competitive distortions resulting from the $60,000 threshold applying become more concerning. As the gig and sharing economy continues to grow and more people start to earn income through digital platforms, there is a risk that this type of business model could erode the GST base. There is a question therefore of whether the GST registration threshold strikes the right balance in the context of the gig and sharing economy. Developing solutions that involve digital platforms 2.16 Many digital platforms are aware of the need to address issues related to tax compliance and fairness in the gig and sharing economy. At the international level they have shown a willingness to engage with jurisdictions to achieve practical outcomes, including those that will improve sellers’ compliance with their income tax obligations and improve fairness in the GST system. 2.17 Digital platforms have a significant amount of information about sellers that is useful in a tax context. This is because a large part of their business is facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers on their marketplace. There is scope therefore to involve them in measures to increase tax compliance and fairness in the gig and sharing economy. 2.18 Unlike traditional suppliers however, digital platforms often operate in many countries with differing tax rules and regulatory requirements. Some digital platforms are start-ups which are initially focused on improving their technology and growing their user-base, and they do not necessarily consider the tax implications of their business model until it has proven to be successful. 2.19 These issues may make it difficult for regulators to successfully impose new obligations on digital platforms, particularly if they are jurisdiction specific. If the compliance costs of meeting new regulations are too onerous for digital platforms, some may withdraw from the jurisdiction in question, or simply not comply with the new regulation. 2.20 An internationally agreed set of rules will help promote standardisation across the sector, which should result in lower compliance costs for digital platforms. This is what the OECD have sought to develop with their model rules (discussed in detail in chapter 3). 2 Digital platforms often charge sellers a fee for facilitating the transaction between the seller and the buyer. Unless these facilitation services are provided to GST registered recipients, they are subject to GST under New Zealand’s remote services rules which require non-residents (including offshore platforms) to charge GST on services provided to New Zealand residents. If the platform is New Zealand resident, they will be registered for New Zealand GST and responsible for returning GST on the facilitation fee under our domestic rules. 10 Other jurisdictions are also addressing these challenges 2.21 The Canadian Government introduced rules to deal with the expanding gig and sharing economy. The value-added tax (VAT) registration threshold no longer applies to sellers providing ridesharing services, so sellers must register for, and charge, VAT on their services. Digital platforms that facilitate taxable supplies of short-term accommodation in Canada are now required to collect GST on supplies made by sellers who are not registered for VAT themselves. 2.22 In 2020, reforms were implemented in Mexico to support gig and sharing economy sellers to comply with their tax obligations. The main change was to place withholding and reporting obligations on gig and sharing economy platforms for income tax and VAT owed by the seller. 2.23 Under these rules, the platform is required to withhold VAT at a rate of 8%. The rate is reduced to half the standard rate because VAT deductions are not available to sellers for the costs they incur in producing taxable supplies. This means that sellers do not have to register and account for VAT themselves. To ensure that supplies made by sellers are not over-taxed, the platforms charge VAT at the standard rate of 16% and return the 8% not withheld to individual sellers as a proxy for their VAT deductions. 2.24 This approach decreases the accuracy of the tax assessment; however, it significantly reduces the compliance costs on sellers. In cases where the seller fails to provide their tax identification number (TIN) to the platform, VAT is withheld at the standard rate of 16% so that the seller is effectively denied any VAT deductions. 2.25 The withholding rate for income tax varies depending on the earnings of the individual supplier. A higher rate is also imposed on sellers who fail to provide their TIN. 2.26 In July 2021, the United Kingdom Government released a summary of responses to a call for evidence on the VAT challenges created by the growth of the gig and sharing economy. The evidence obtained will be used by them to further develop their understanding of the gig and sharing economy and the potential case for reform to VAT. 2.27 The United Kingdom Government will implement the OECD model rules from January 2023. They have released a consultation document seeking views on the optional elements of the rules. The consultation closed on 22 October 2021. 2.28 The Australian Government currently collects data from ridesharing and accommodation sharing platforms that operate in Australia. A ridesharing data matching programme has been in place since 2015. Data is provided by platforms to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and used to identify individual sellers. Once identified, the ATO can support these sellers to meet their income tax and GST obligations. Where necessary, compliance action may be initiated based on the data collected. The GST registration threshold does not apply to ridesharing (or taxi) drivers, who are required to register for GST. 2.29 The Australian Government has also invited submissions on a proposed reporting regime for sharing economy platform providers. The reporting regime is separate to that proposed by the OECD. It would require platforms that allow buyers and sellers to transact electronically to report information on all transactions for services or the sharing and loaning of assets (unless an exemption applies). It would be mandatory to report information identifying the seller such as their Australian Business Number, and information about transactions in the reporting period such as total gross payments to the seller 11 and GST attributable to them. Reporting would initially be required on a biannual basis. 2.30 France has also imposed information sharing requirements on digital platforms whose sellers provide services or carry out sales in France. The digital platform is required to provide sellers with a summary of the transactions carried out by them for the given year. This information must also be passed to the tax authorities on an annual basis. The required information includes identification details of the seller, the number and value of transactions carried out by them that year, and the bank account into which the income is paid. The digital platform may incur a fine if they do not provide the necessary information in a timely manner. 2.31 In India, digital platforms facilitating ridesharing and food delivery services are liable to collect and remit GST on the supplies made by sellers operating on their platforms from 1 January 2022. Options have been developed by the OECD 2.32 The OECD has led work that considered the tax implications of the gig and sharing economy. They have produced a range of reports and guidance in this space, including model rules for reporting by platforms with respect to sellers in the gig and sharing economy (OECD model rules), 3 a report on the impact of the gig and sharing economy on GST policy and administration, 4 and a code of conduct for co-operation between tax authorities and gig and sharing economy platforms (Code of Conduct). 5 2.33 The OECD model rules were developed in response to calls for a global, standardised framework for reporting information relating to activities facilitated by digital platforms. The rules apply to digital platforms offering accommodation, transport, and personal services. They require digital platforms to collect information concerning income earned by sellers transacting on their platform and report it to the tax authority in the jurisdiction in which the platform is resident. The rules also have an optional module which extend the coverage of the reporting rules to cover the sale of goods and vehicle rental. 2.34 If all jurisdictions adopt the model rules, a digital platform will only need to report information once, to its own tax authority. The tax authority would then exchange that information with tax authorities in other jurisdictions to ensure that each jurisdiction receives information relevant to its residents. Implementation of the rules will thus limit the compliance costs imposed on digital platforms by ensuring consistency in reporting across jurisdictions. 2.35 There will be various benefits to tax authorities that choose to implement the model rules. The rules will reduce sellers’ ability to hide their income from the tax authorities. Tax authorities will be able to assist sellers with their tax 3 OECD. (2020).

Having a standardised set of reporting obligations will also benefit platforms as they will not have to comply to regimes with different rules and in different countries. The OECD model rules were developed with direct taxes such as income tax in mind, however they can also be used for GST purposes. The OECD has also developed an optional extension to the rules to align with developments in Europe. 6 If implemented, the extension would broaden the scope of the rules to cover the sale of goods and vehicle rental. 2.36 The OECD has also published a report that outlines the challenges facing GST/VAT policy and administration in the gig and sharing economy space, and policy options to respond to these challenges. It presents a useful framework from which tax authorities can develop a strategy for responding to the growth of the sharing economy. The report does not prescribe any one policy response to address issues with GST compliance and fairness in the sharing economy but recognises that the right policy response will be jurisdiction-specific and may entail a range of options working together. These options are discussed in the following section. 2.37 The OECD have also produced a Code of Conduct which is intended to facilitate co-operation between tax authorities and digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy. It sets out core elements of co-operation between tax authorities and platform operators (those who run the digital platforms). The purpose is to promote standardisation of ‘soft law’ approaches to the provision of information and to help sellers understand their obligations. Options for improving compliance and fairness 2.38 Education is one method by which to increase compliance of sellers with both their income tax and potential GST obligations. Many sellers are likely unaware of their obligations and may not have completed a tax return before. Some sellers may be deliberately non-compliant and not reporting their income to Inland Revenue to avoid having to pay tax on amounts earned from these activities. 2.39 Inland Revenue has information on its website directing sellers on their potential tax obligations, however there is scope to be more targeted in the delivery of this information. Another option is to work with digital platforms as distributors of educative material. Digital platforms are well-placed to deliver timely and accurate information to sellers concerning their tax obligations given the data they hold and their digital proximity to sellers. 2.40 Assisting sellers with their tax obligations and improving compliance could also be achieved through the provision of data to the tax authorities. Data collected by digital platforms and passed on to the tax authorities (under the OECD model rules, for example) could be utilised by tax authorities to improve compliance in two ways. Firstly, the data could be used to pre-populate income tax returns of sellers. Whether pre-population is a feasible option will depend on the accuracy of the data passed on by the digital platform, and the timing of data provision. Alternatively, tax authorities could inform identified sellers that they have data on them and that they expect to see incomes reported by them at the right time as part of the income tax return process. 6 The Council Directive (EU) 2021/514 (known as DAC7) sets out a reporting regime for platforms and will be implemented by EU members by 1 January 2023. DAC7 will be discussed more in chapter 3 but is very similar in function to the model rules (including optional extension). 13 2.41 A third compliance enhancing approach would be to involve digital platforms in collection of the tax. This could be achieved in several ways. For GST purposes, the digital platform could have a role of collecting GST on behalf of sellers in the gig and sharing economy and paying that to Inland Revenue. For income tax purposes, a withholding tax could be introduced. There are difficulties with implementing withholding taxes however, as they impose additional compliance costs on the person responsible for withholding and the rate is often difficult to determine. 2.42 Alternatively, the digital platform could be made jointly and severally liable for any GST undeclared by sellers on the platform, so that the platform must return tax in some cases where the seller has failed to. This liability could be triggered where Inland Revenue notifies the digital platform of an instance of non- compliance that it fails to follow up on, or where the digital platform has a reasonable expectation that a seller should be registered for GST but is not. 2.43 A problem with these options is that, for GST, the issue in many cases is not about compliance, but is about fairness, as many sellers do not meet the registration threshold while their more traditional counterparts do (for example, a hotel would charge GST on their rooms while an accommodation sharing host might not meet the threshold required to charge GST). 2.44 To address this problem of fairness, the registration threshold could be lowered to capture supplies made through the gig and sharing economy. However, the registration threshold is in place for a reason; the compliance and administration costs of imposing GST on low-value supplies are outweighed by the amount of GST that would be collected. One option that could be considered is to reduce the GST registration threshold specifically for sellers operating in the gig and sharing economy. However, this option would ignore the fact that there is a third party capable of collecting and returning GST on behalf of its users, which has the advantage of reducing compliance costs and greater accuracy. A solution that responds to this concern is to deem the digital platform to be the supplier of the goods or services provided by the seller. The platform would then be obliged to return GST on all supplies made through the platform. The registration threshold would apply to the digital platform, rather than the individual seller. 2.45 This has the benefit of addressing some of the fairness concerns, however it does not address issues with sellers’ compliance costs as; while GST on sales would be managed by the platform (likely increasing platform compliance costs), there is still an issue of how to ensure sellers are able to claim GST deductions in a manner that is easy to comply with. These problems will be discussed further in chapter four. 2.46 The options outlined are not mutually exclusive; they may be applied alongside one another. It is noted that any proposals need to be balanced against the impact of those changes on taxpayers’ compliance costs (including sellers and digital platforms), Inland Revenue’s administration costs, and the fairness, coherence, and efficiency of the tax system more broadly. Submissions are welcomed on whether the proposals discussed below strike the right balance between improving tax revenue and fairness but also not levying undue compliance and administration costs on the parties involved. Specific proposals are discussed in greater detail in the following chapters. Criteria for assessing the options 2.47 The remainder of this discussion document considers options to address some of these issues in greater detail. To determine the most appropriate response, 14 the options will be assessed against the following standard principles for assessing tax policy changes: • Fairness: Do the preferred options level the playing field between traditional suppliers and sellers in the gig and sharing economy? This is often described as horizontal equity: the idea that people in the same position should pay the same amount of tax. • Compliance: Do the preferred options encourage sellers in the gig and sharing economy to comply with their tax obligations with low compliance costs? • Administration: Are the preferred options possible for Inland Revenue to implement and administer without substantial ongoing administration costs? • Efficiency: Do the preferred options minimise impediments to economic growth? Do the options avoid distortions to taxpayer decisions? • Coherence: Do the preferred options make sense in the context of the entire tax system and New Zealand’s international tax relations? Are the preferred options consistent with New Zealand’s broad-base low-rate framework? • Sustainability: Are the preferred options future-proofed? Will the options be able to apply and extend to future developments in the gig and sharing economy space without the need for further regulatory change? 15 CHAPTER 3 Information reporting and exchange 3.1 Access to accurate and timely income information is crucial for the smooth and efficient running of the tax system. It allows Inland Revenue to check that people are paying the appropriate amount of tax and reduce opportunities for avoidance. 3.2 This chapter outlines proposals to increase Inland Revenue’s visibility over the activities of sellers on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy. Inland Revenue does not currently receive regular information from digital platforms about sellers’ activities on digital platforms. However, Inland Revenue can, and has, obtained information from digital platforms using its information collection powers. This approach lacks transparency and is inefficient for Inland Revenue and digital platforms, who may need to spend considerable time and energy to comply with an information request. 3.3 There is therefore an opportunity to improve the framework under which Inland Revenue accesses information held by digital platforms, improving transparency and making the model more efficient for digital platforms and for Inland Revenue. The benefits of a more transparent information reporting framework include providing Inland Revenue with more consistent access to information about sellers’ activities on digital platforms (and this information could be used by Inland Revenue to support tax compliance, such as by pre- populating sellers’ income tax returns), and improved certainty and lower compliance costs for digital platforms that are providing the information. 3.4 As noted in chapter 2, the OECD have developed rules that would help achieve these objectives. This chapter seeks public feedback on whether New Zealand should implement the rules developed at the OECD which would enable Inland Revenue to receive regular income information from digital platforms about their sellers’ activities and incomes. This chapter also consults on how the information could be used. 3.5 If implemented, the proposals discussed in this chapter would affect: • New Zealand resident digital platforms: They would be required to provide Inland Revenue with information about sellers’ incomes earned on those platforms by both New Zealand tax residents and non-residents. • Sellers on digital platforms: This includes both resident and non- resident sellers, as information provided by digital platforms could be included in sellers’ income tax returns, which would reduce their compliance costs and reduce possibilities for motivated sellers to conceal income information from Inland Revenue. Information reported by New Zealand digital platforms to Inland Revenue that related to non-resident sellers’ activities could also be shared with that sellers’ tax authority. • Inland Revenue: Under the OECD rules, Inland Revenue would be required to obtain information from New Zealand resident digital platforms, and then share relevant information about non-resident sellers with their tax authority. Inland Revenue would also use the information collected (and received) in its tax administration functions. 16 Why does Inland Revenue need more regular income information? 3.6 Inland Revenue does not receive regular information on income earned by sellers in the sharing economy like it does for those who earn salary and wages or investment income. As the introduction to this chapter mentions, Inland Revenue can obtain information from digital platforms using its information collection powers but this is cumbersome and inefficient. 3.7 The Government considers that there is currently a lack of transparency because tax reporting systems do not regularly or systematically capture information about transactions in this part of the economy. This transparency gap means that Inland Revenue often lacks information on the incomes earned by sellers on digital platforms, which increases the risk that sellers may not be paying the correct amount of tax. 3.8 The gig and sharing economy is expected to continue growing, taking a larger share of the economy. As such, failing to have adequate information on this sector could jeopardise the tax base. It is therefore important to increase Inland Revenue’s visibility over sellers’ activities on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy. This increased visibility could enable Inland Revenue to pre- populate sellers’ income tax returns, which would reduce compliance costs for sellers, and improve general compliance with income tax obligations more broadly. The OECD’s model reporting rules for digital platforms 3.9 The OECD worked with digital platforms and member jurisdictions to develop a standardised approach to information reporting and information exchange involving digital platforms. There are two main objectives of the OECD developed rules. • Ensure that sellers on digital platforms and tax authorities have access to relevant income information to support tax compliance. The model rules require digital platforms to provide tax authorities and sellers with information on sellers’ income earned through digital platforms. Access to this information helps sellers to comply with their own tax obligations and can also be used by tax authorities to enforce tax compliance and ensure that seller activities do not go undetected. • Create a standardised approach to information collection for digital platforms. A multilateral, standardised information exchange would result in reduced compliance costs for digital platforms compared with unilateral rules designed individually by jurisdictions. If jurisdictions designed their own rules, the variations between jurisdictions would result in increased compliance costs for digital platforms that had to design their information systems to satisfy the requirements designed by each individual jurisdiction. 3.10 The rules were published by the OECD in July 2020. Broadly, the rules require digital platforms to collect and report information on the income earned by sellers on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy. The areas covered include income earned through personal services and accommodation. 3.11 The exchange of information with other jurisdictions will primarily be conducted under the Multilateral Convention for Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the Multilateral Convention). New Zealand signed the Multilateral Convention in 2012, and it currently extends to 144 jurisdictions. Article 6 of the Multilateral Convention authorises automatic programmes of exchange of information at a high level, leaving the specific details of such exchanges to be 17 set out in a subsidiary instrument. The subsidiary instrument developed by the OECD for the gig and sharing economy is the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information on Income Derived through Digital Platforms (the DPI MCAA). 3.12 Shortly after the OECD published their model rules, the European Commission published a directive on reporting obligations for digital platform operators that led to the Council of the European Union formalising a directive known as DAC7. This directive builds on the OECD rules and requires all digital platforms that are active in the EU to report information about sellers to the relevant tax authority. The information that is required to be reported under DAC7 is broader than the model rules and covers the sale of goods and vehicle rental (in addition to personal services and accommodation as required by the model rules). EU member states have until 31 December 2022 to implement the DAC7 amendments into their national tax laws and the directive will apply from 1 January 2023 throughout the EU. 3.13 In June 2021, the OECD moved to complement the broader scope of DAC7 by including an optional module in the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information on Income Derived through Digital Platforms (the DPI MCAA) to cover jurisdictions with an interest in information relating to the sale of goods and vehicle rental (known as the extended model rules). How the model rules work 3.14 Jurisdictions which implement the rules are required to collect certain information about the activities of sellers on digital platforms that are tax resident in their country. This information must then be shared with tax authorities of other countries that have also implemented the rules to the extent that the information relates to persons resident in that jurisdiction. Tax authorities will also receive information from other jurisdictions’ tax authorities where the rules have been implemented. The model rules provide a standardised reporting framework and information exchange. 18 Figure 1: An example of the information flows under the model rules Offshore tax authority Offshore digital platform New Zealand seller New Zealand Inland Revenue New Zealand digital platform Offshore seller New Zealand seller Other jurisdiction New Zealand 12 3 4 65 7 Step Description 1 A New Zealand resident seller uses an offshore digital platform. 2 The offshore digital platform provides the offshore tax authority with information about the New Zealand resident seller. 3 The offshore tax authority then provides that information to Inland Revenue in New Zealand. 4 Inland Revenue could use that information in its compliance activities, including pre-populating the sellers’ income tax return with the information it received. 5 An offshore seller operates through a New Zealand digital platform. 6 The New Zealand digital platform provides information to Inland Revenue about all the sellers on that platform, including the non-resident sellers’ activities. 7 Inland Revenue shares that information with the offshore tax authority and that information could be used by them in their tax administration functions. 3.15 The information could be used in several ways to help sellers on digital platforms comply with their tax obligations. For example, the data provided to tax authorities will provide them with information that could be used to determine what, or whether, income should be included in an income tax return, and this would provide a good indication as to whether sellers should be registered for GST. 19 Example 1: The basic operation of the OECD’s model rules Smithy’s Rides is a successful ridesharing platform that is tax resident in jurisdiction A and has an international presence. If jurisdiction A had implemented the model rules, Smithy’s Rides would be obliged to provide jurisdiction A’s tax authority with information relating to all its sellers, including residents and non-residents. Jurisdiction A would then exchange this information with other jurisdictions that had implemented the model rules, where the information was about sellers who were resident in those jurisdictions it was providing the information to. This would mean that, if New Zealand had implemented the rules, Inland Revenue would receive information from jurisdiction A’s tax authority about New Zealand residents’ activities on Smithy’s Rides. 3.16 This way of operating supports the standardisation of reporting rules between jurisdictions and makes it easier for digital platforms to comply with their reporting obligations across jurisdictions. This is because information is only required to be disclosed to one tax authority rather than several. This also means that digital platforms will follow largely similar processes for gathering and reporting information on transactions, and means that digital platforms can avoid unnecessary compliance costs which might arise if each jurisdiction implemented its own rules with different data requirements and due dates. 3.17 The more jurisdictions that seek to implement the OECD rules, the more effective the rules will operate. This is because digital platforms are tax resident in various jurisdictions, and tax authority will have greater access to information the more jurisdictions seek to implement the rules and exchange information. 3.18 At a basic level, the model rules require digital platforms to provide the following information about each reportable seller: • The name, address, date of birth, and taxpayer identification number (TIN) – for New Zealand residents, the TIN would be their IRD number. • The total consideration paid or credited during each quarter of the reportable period. The rules define the reportable period as being a calendar year. • For the rental of immovable property, the address of that property. 3.19 In terms of timing, the model rules require digital platforms to provide information about a calendar year to the tax authority in the country that they are tax resident by the end of February following the end of that calendar year. The receiving tax authority would then have until the end of April to exchange that information with other tax authority. This reported information is required to be broken down into quarterly periods. 3.20 The rules also manage circumstances where there could be multiple digital platforms that have the same income information on sellers. These rules broadly allow a nominated digital platform to be the responsible platform for reporting this income information, and prevents digital platforms that operate in multiple jurisdictions from having to report the same income information more than once. 20 Implementing the extended model rules in New Zealand 3.21 The Government is consulting on whether New Zealand should implement the OECD’s extended model rules rather than developing its own rules. The model rules would require changes to New Zealand’s tax laws to require New Zealand tax resident digital platforms to provide Inland Revenue with information about sellers’ incomes earned through that platform for personal services, accommodation rental, the sale of goods, and vehicle rental. Inland Revenue would also receive information from other tax authorities about New Zealand tax resident sellers’ incomes in those categories. 3.22 The benefits of implementing the OECD’s model rules include consistency with international best practice and greater access to information for Inland Revenue in a compliance context. Digital platforms have also expressed support for the model rules at the OECD, and it is understood that the rules, or rules of equivalence, will be implemented by Europe, where a lot of digital platforms are tax resident. For New Zealand to benefit from the information collected under the model rules by European digital platforms, New Zealand would need to implement the extended model rules or rules of equivalence. 3.23 The implementation of DAC7 in European Union (EU) member states may already impose reporting obligations on some electronic marketplaces and digital platforms in New Zealand to the extent that they have any sellers who are tax resident in EU member states or other sellers for which they have facilitated the sale of goods, the rental of modes of transportation, personal services, or the rental of immoveable property in an EU member state. If New Zealand implemented the extended Model Rules, these electronic marketplaces and digital platforms would only have a reporting obligation to Inland Revenue which would then exchange information with EU member states as well as other countries which have adopted the model rules. In this regard, the affected electronic marketplaces and digital platforms may prefer to provide information to Inland Revenue rather than provide the information to potentially multiple European Union member tax authorities. How the information could be used in New Zealand 3.24 Implementation of the extended model rules in New Zealand would result in Inland Revenue receiving information about sellers’ activities on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy for accommodation, professional and personal services, the sale of goods, and vehicle rental. The first two categories correspond to the OECD’s model rules, and the second two categories correspond to the extended rules (designed to be rules of equivalence to the European DAC7 requirements). 3.25 Although the Government supports the adoption of the extended model rules in New Zealand, it is proposed that the information would be used in different ways depending on the category. 3.26 If the rules were implemented, Inland Revenue could seek to use the information about accommodation rental and professional and personal services in sellers’ income tax returns. The incomes earned through digital platforms in these circumstances would, generally speaking, be amounts that needed to be declared by sellers themselves for income tax purposes. That is, sellers are required to declare this income in their income tax returns and pay tax on any profits they make for these activities. 3.27 The sale of goods and vehicle rental are not traditional gig and sharing economy activity types. For the sale of goods, this is because it does not involve the sharing of assets, skills, or labour. It would also be unclear from a platform 21 perspective whether the sale of goods was part of a taxable activity of the seller or merely an individual selling personal items that would not attract GST. For vehicle rental, it is the digital platform that is the seller. This would be different if a digital platform offered a service of vehicle rental, with the vehicles themselves being provided by a seller. In this situation, the seller would be sharing an asset, and this would be a reportable activity. For these reasons, it is not proposed that income information in these areas would be used for pre- population of income tax returns. Timing and different options to address this 3.28 One of the obstacles with the OECD’s rules is that information is provided for each calendar year (as opposed to a tax year, which ends 31 March). This could make it difficult for tax authorities that have a tax year other than a calendar year to pre-populate sellers’ income tax returns. Example 2: Assumes OECD rules implemented in New Zealand and jurisdiction A Smithy’s Rides is a ridesharing digital platform that is tax resident in jurisdiction A. Kelvin earns income through the digital platform of $50,000 between 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2024 (the 2024 calendar year). The tax authority in jurisdiction A provides Inland Revenue with information about the $50,000 that Kelvin earned through Smithy’s Rides in April 2025. The information can be broken down on a quarterly basis. Some of the information Inland Revenue receives relates to the: • 2024 tax year – specifically, the information relating to the period between 1 January 2024 and 31 March 2024, and • 2025 tax year – the information between 1 April 2024 and 31 December 2024. Inland Revenue would not have complete information about Kelvin’s 2025 tax year until the following year, when it would receive information from jurisdiction A’s tax authority that covered the period between 1 January 2025 and 31 March 2025. 3.29 For Inland Revenue to pre-populate sellers’ income tax returns with information it receives from digital platforms in New Zealand (and other tax authorities who exchange information under the OECD’s rules) there are two different methods to explore that could achieve this. These methods are attributing calendar-year income to the New Zealand tax year and partial pre-population. Attributing calendar-year income to the New Zealand tax year 3.30 Under this method, income earned through digital platforms for a calendar year could be attributed to the corresponding tax year. This would mean, for example, that income information obtained under the model rules for the calendar year 2024 (1 January to 31 December) would be attributed to the 2024–25 tax year (1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025). This would result in a full years’ worth of income being pre-populated and would not rely on sellers doing an exercise apportioning and attributing incomes to different tax years. These rules could be designed based on similar rules that allow taxpayers to attribute 22 overseas income below $100,000 earned to a different balance date to be attributed to the New Zealand tax year. Example 3: Attributing calendar-year income to the New Zealand tax year Inland Revenue would receive information by 30 April 2025 for Kelvin’s activities on Smithy’s Rides for the 2024 calendar year. The income Kelvin earned through Smithy’s Rides in the 2024 calendar year would be attributed to the corresponding tax year – the 2025 tax year. Figure 2 New Zealand tax year 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 Calendar year 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024 The income information would then be included in Kelvin’s pre-populated account for the 2024–25 tax year along with any other income Kelvin had. Kelvin would then finalise his income tax return in the usual way. 3.31 The attribution method would need to be phased in. For example, during the first year that the rules were in force only nine months of income information could be pre-populated. This is because income information relating to the period for 1 January to 31 March would have been accounted for in the prior tax year and prior to these rules being in force. After this period of transition this measure would be largely effective at achieving complete pre-population of income derived through sharing economy platforms. Partial pre-population 3.32 Under this method, Inland Revenue would use the information from April to December to include in sellers’ income tax returns, and prompt sellers to include the income information that relates to the period between January and March themselves. This information should be readily accessible to sellers, however, as it is understood that most digital platforms provide regular information to their users. As Inland Revenue would receive information relating to the January to March period in the following years’ information exchange, Inland Revenue could use that information to ensure that sellers had declared the right amount of income. 23 Figure 3 New Zealand tax year 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 Calendar year 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024 31 March 2024 31 March 2025 April to December (nine months) 3.33 Pre-populating sellers’ income tax returns relies on the information exchanges containing high quality data which requires minimal processing. For example, if Inland Revenue received information where New Zealand resident seller IRD numbers were inaccurate, this would make it difficult for Inland Revenue to attribute income to the correct seller. This could mean more manual intervention from Inland Revenue given the need to then contact sellers to confirm that income information it received from other tax authorities should be attributed to them. 3.34 The clear advantage of pre-population is that it would make it easier for sellers to comply with their tax obligations and therefore reduce their compliance costs. It also makes it difficult for sellers to hide incomes earned on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy from Inland Revenue. Individuals would just need to confirm that the income information was correct and complete, and include any expenses incurred in the return. This would simplify the obligations for these individuals and would treat this income source like salary, wages, and investment income. Implications for digital platforms that are tax resident in New Zealand 3.35 The model rules would require digital platforms that were tax resident in New Zealand to collect and report to Inland Revenue information about sellers’ activities on those platforms to the extent that they related to accommodation rental, personal and professional services, and, if New Zealand implemented the extended rules, the sale of goods, and vehicle rental. 3.36 Digital platforms would need to collect information about New Zealand tax residents and non-residents. The information would need to be reported to Inland Revenue for the calendar year, by the end of February of the following year. That will enable Inland Revenue to share that information with other tax authorities where their jurisdictions had also implemented the OECD rules (and, if applicable, the extended rules). 3.37 Digital platforms tax resident in New Zealand that collected information about the activities of European sellers would also report information to Inland Revenue so this information could be provided by Inland Revenue to the relevant European countries. This would mean that platforms would not need to provide the information to those individual European countries themselves. Optional de minimis exclusion for small New Zealand resident digital platforms 3.38 Jurisdictions that implement the OECD’s model rules can implement a modification to the definition of “platform operator” which would exclude digital 24 platforms that operated below a threshold of €1 million in the preceding calendar year from the reporting requirements. 3.39 If New Zealand implemented this modification, the effect of it would be that smaller-scale New Zealand digital platforms that were below the threshold in the preceding calendar year would not need to provide Inland Revenue with information about the activities of sellers on its platform. 3.40 Implementing the modification may reduce upfront compliance costs for new digital platforms starting out in New Zealand. These compliance costs, however, would eventually be borne by the digital platform once it stopped meeting the criteria for exclusion. Further, the information held by these digital platforms would still be useful to Inland Revenue, which could use its information gathering powers to require the information be provided in an alternative format. For these reasons, an initial view is that this modification should not be implemented if the Government decided to implement the OECD’s model rules. Submissions on this point are encouraged. An alternative approach 3.41 Another option would be for New Zealand to design and implement its own rules for information collection and reporting. One clear advantage of developing bespoke rules is that we could prescribe the data we wanted to collect from platforms along with the frequency and timing of this information, which would allow for easier pre-population of income information. This advantage could be outweighed by the increased compliance costs on digital platforms that might end up needing to build their systems to be compliant with the OECD’s rules and bespoke New Zealand rules thereby significantly increasing compliance costs. 3.42 Table 1 summarises the advantages and disadvantages of both options. 25 Table 1: Summary of options to improve information collection on incomes earned through digital platforms Option Advantages Disadvantages Implement the extended OECD model rules • Reduced compliance costs: A standardised reporting regime across jurisdictions reduces compliance costs for digital platforms relative to several different bespoke reporting regimes. Further, many digital platforms have engaged in the design of the rules at the OECD and so are familiar with them. • International consistency and coherence: By implementing rules of equivalence with Europe to ensure exchange with digital platforms based in Europe. • Tax compliance, fairness, and horizontal equity: Tax authorities will have access to good quality and accurate information to support potential pre-population and drive tax compliance. • Sustainability: Internationally driven solution backed by the OECD ensures schema can be updated as and when required and remain fit for purpose. • Timing of information: The information will be received based on a calendar year not for the New Zealand tax year (to 31 March). This means modifications are required to enable pre-population of income information in sellers’ income tax returns. Bespoke reporting regime • Flexibility: A bespoke regime allows New Zealand to prescribe the timing, frequency and type of information required from digital platforms without having to follow the OECD schema. The main advantage this option offers relative to the OECD solution is that the reporting obligation could be made for the New Zealand tax year as opposed to the calendar year. • Increased compliance costs for digital platforms: This could result in digital platforms having to design systems to comply with New Zealand rules in addition to the OECD rules, which increases compliance costs. • A longer lead-in time would be required: Developing a bespoke regime would take longer and would require greater consultation with digital platforms compared to adopting an internationally agreed schema. 26 Questions for submitters • Should digital platforms be required to provide Inland Revenue with regular income information about sellers’ activities? Do you agree it is a problem Inland Revenue does not receive regular income information from digital platforms about sellers’ activities on those platforms? • Should the Government implement the OECD solution or design its own rules to ensure Inland Revenue receives regular income information from digital platforms? • If New Zealand did implement the OECD’s model rules, how should Inland Revenue seek to use the information it receives? Should pre-population of income tax returns which would require the seller to confirm the accuracy of information be the ultimate goal? • If the OECD solution were implemented, should smaller-scale New Zealand resident digital platforms be exempt from income reporting requirements? If so, on what basis? 27 CHAPTER 4 Goods and services tax 4.1 This chapter discusses whether, and how, services provided through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy should be subject to GST. It seeks submitters’ views on two key questions: whether services supplied through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy should be subject to GST, and if so, how GST should apply. Background 4.2 The rapid growth of the gig and sharing economy has resulted in a growing number of small suppliers, many of whom operate under the GST registration threshold of $60,000 in a 12-month period. Generally speaking, GST is not levied on the services they provide (unless these sellers have chosen to voluntarily register for GST). 4.3 The GST threshold recognises that the compliance costs for these small suppliers applying GST would be high, and that because of their size, exempting them from applying GST would not result in competitive distortions. However, viewed collectively, digital platforms facilitate millions of dollars of sales in New Zealand through individual sellers – most of which are not subject to GST. A competitive distortion therefore arises, as traditional suppliers who compete with digital platforms generally do charge GST. As the gig and sharing economy is expected to continue growing, it is timely to review whether supplies of goods and services made through digital platforms in the sharing economy should be subject to GST, putting sellers in the sharing economy on a more level playing field with other businesses. 4.4 In April 2021, the OECD published The Impact of the Growth of the Sharing and Gig Economy on VAT/GST Policy and Administration. This report outlines the impact that the growth of the gig and sharing economy has had on VAT and GST systems worldwide and sets out a broad range of options that countries could consider implementing to address these impacts. 4.5 The options included in the report include promoting education campaigns, developing new information-sharing protocols, and involving digital platforms in the collection of GST. These options all address different problems. For example, if countries wanted to promote compliance with existing GST settings, it might be appropriate to look at implementing education campaigns and new information-sharing protocols. On the other hand, if countries are concerned with the uneven playing field that exists for traditional suppliers and those sellers on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy, it could be more appropriate to examine whether it is appropriate for digital platforms to return GST on supplies made through them. The case for applying GST 4.6 The gig and sharing economy provides smaller-scale operators with the ability to earn income through a digital platform with relative ease. This is facilitated by platforms on a large scale and many of these supplies occur below our GST registration threshold and so are not subject to GST. Viewed collectively, the gig and sharing economy has had a disruptive effect on traditional business models who are generally charging GST. The gig and sharing economy has the potential to erode the GST base as more small suppliers shift to operate on 28 digital platforms. It is important we consider applying GST to activities facilitated through digital platforms to ensure that the GST base is protected against this new economic reality and ensure a level playing field with traditional suppliers. 4.7 New Zealand’s GST system has been expanded in the last decade to apply to offshore suppliers of remote services and low value imported goods. A key feature of these recent changes is the role of electronic marketplaces. Special rules treat electronic marketplaces as the supplier of goods or services provided through their platforms instead of the underlying suppliers who include the likes of software developers and goods sellers. These electronic marketplaces have similar characteristics to the digital platforms that facilitate activity in the gig and sharing economy. One view is that the existence of these digital platforms reduces the compliance and administration costs associated with collecting GST revenues for tax authorities. This is because digital platforms have a business model which necessitates them being able to deal with thousands of transactions on an on-going basis, and most digital platforms will already be registered for GST in New Zealand because of the remote services rules. 4.8 If sellers’ activities on digital platforms were to be subject to GST at the level of the digital platform, this would increase compliance costs for sellers who are not engaged in the GST system (to the extent that the sellers wanted to recover GST on the costs associated with making their supplies), and for digital platforms who would need to adjust their systems to ensure they were compliant with any new rules. The design of any new rules could mitigate these increased compliance costs, and this is explored in further detail later in the chapter. 4.9 Collecting GST on transactions facilitated by digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy would have impacts on the fairness of the GST system. Imposing GST on supplies made through these digital platforms could improve fairness in the GST system when making comparisons between sellers on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy and traditional suppliers (for example motel operators and taxi drivers) who are generally required to register for GST. However, if GST applied to platform supplies regardless of the supplier’s turnover, this could give rise to equity issues as GST would be imposed on sales made by small sellers that operate through digital platforms but not on other small sellers who make sales below the GST registration threshold. One justification for this is that compliance costs are still reduced for sellers, as it is the digital platforms themselves responsible for collecting GST and paying that to Inland Revenue. 4.10 The Government is interested in exploring how GST could apply in the context of the gig and sharing economy. This is for reasons noted earlier: it improves the fairness of the GST system and ensures it remains broad-based and sustainable. The two main options for ensuring activities in the gig and sharing economy are included in the GST base are modifying the GST registration threshold, or extending electronic marketplace rules to make digital platforms liable for the collection of GST. These options are discussed below. Modifying the GST registration threshold 4.11 One of the options that would support the objectives of maintaining a broad base GST, and fairness in the GST system, is lowering of the GST registration threshold. This could bring more sellers who operate in the gig and sharing economy within the GST system and level the playing field between them and other suppliers who are registered for GST. 29 4.12 This discussion document does not propose lowering the registration threshold for GST generally. This is for two reasons. First, any general changes to the GST registration threshold would have a broad impact across all sectors of the economy. It is noted that New Zealand’s GST registration threshold is in the middle of the range when compared with other countries’ VAT (value-added tax) systems. The current GST registration threshold seems to strike the right balance between supporting a GST system with a broad base and not biasing competition between suppliers with different business sizes and structures against compliance and administration costs. Second, lowering the GST registration threshold would create a different set of issues in terms of ensuring sellers were compliant with their GST obligations. 4.13 It would be conceptually possible to lower the GST registration threshold for sellers in the gig and sharing economy specifically This option has been implemented to some degree in other jurisdictions. For example, Australia and Canada require all ridesharing drivers to register for GST even if they are below the registration threshold. This option would ignore the fact that there is a third party capable of collecting and returning GST on behalf of their users which reduces the potential for sellers to inadvertently miss (or avoid) their GST obligations. 4.14 The option considered best at addressing the issues of ensuring a broad and sustainable GST base, increasing fairness between suppliers of the same (or similar) services, and reducing opportunities for sellers to avoid their GST obligations would be to extend the current marketplace rules that apply GST to supplies of remote services and low value imported goods provided to New Zealand residents so that these rules also apply to gig and sharing economy activities. Extended marketplace rules 4.15 Under extended marketplace rules, digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy would be responsible for collecting GST as if the digital platform itself had made the supply, even though the services were performed by the seller on the digital platform. For example, a digital platform that facilitated short- stay accommodation would be treated as the supplier of that short-stay accommodation even though the accommodation was provided by the seller on the digital platform. This would mean that the digital platform is solely responsible and fully liable for collecting and returning GST on the activity that occurs through the platform. To prevent over-taxation of sellers, a mechanism would need to be developed to enable sellers to recover the GST component of the costs incurred in making their supplies through the digital platforms. 4.16 GST would be collected on all in-scope services facilitated through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy where those services were supplied to customers in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. GST would also apply to supplies of services involving land in New Zealand. This is so short-stay accommodation provided in New Zealand would be liable for GST even if the underlying owner of the land was not a New Zealand resident. 4.17 The benefits of extending the existing marketplace rules to apply to digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy include a more level playing field with traditional sellers. It also reduces opportunities for non-compliance because digital platforms would be responsible for returning GST rather than the sellers themselves. Figure 4 illustrates a basic example of how extended marketplace rules for digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy could work. 30 Figure 4 Does not ret urn GST Payment for service s minus facilitation fee Pa ym ent fo r serv ice s GST Performance of serv ice s Seller Digital platform Inland Revenue Bu yer 4.18 The implications of extended marketplace rules for sellers and the digital platforms are further explained in the Table 2. Table 2: Implications of the extended marketplace rules Party Implications Sellers • Could have a deemed zero-rated supply of services to the digital platform. This would enable the seller to claim GST back on their costs associated with making supplies through the digital platform. • Would not return GST to Inland Revenue for supplies made through the digital platform. Digital platforms • Charges GST to buyers on all supplies made through the digital platform. Is deemed to be the supplier of services to the buyer. • Returns GST to Inland Revenue on a quarterly basis. • Continues to pass on revenues earned from services provided through the platform to sellers. Digital platforms 4.19 Under this approach, a digital platform could be defined consistently with the definition of “platform operator” in the OECD’s model rules which is: ...any software, including a website or a part thereof and applications, including mobile applications, accessible by users and allowing Sellers to be connected to other users for the provision of Relevant Services, directly or indirectly, to such users. The operations of the Platform may also include the collection and payment of Consideration in respect of Relevant Services. The term Platform does not include software exclusively allowing the: a) processing of payments in relation to Relevant Services; b) listing or advertising of Relevant Services; or c) redirecting or transferring of users to a Platform 31 without any further intervention in the provision of Relevant Services. 4.20 “Relevant Services” includes the rental of immovable property and personal services. Under the extended rules, “Relevant Services” also includes the rental of a means of transportation. These definitions are discussed further below. Platform supplies – what activities GST would apply to 4.21 The services that would be in scope of the extended marketplace rules are the rental of immovable property (this includes short stay accommodation services and excluding residential accommodation), the provision of personal services (this includes ridesharing and other gig work facilitated through a digital platform and is discussed further below) and vehicle rental (provided the digital platform itself is not the underlying supplier of the transportation). The definitions used in the OECD’s model rules for information exchange could be adapted for GST purposes (recognising that certain modifications would be necessary to maintain consistency with New Zealand’s GST framework). 4.22 The OECD’s model rules define “personal services” as: A “personal service” is a service involving time- or task-based work performed by one or more individuals at the request of a user, unless such work is purely ancillary to the overall transaction. A Personal Service does not include a service provided by a Seller pursuant to an employment relationship with the Platform Operator or a related Entity of the Platform Operator. 4.23 The OECD notes that a personal service usually falls into one of two categories. This includes work that can be carried out online and is capable of being delivered to other users anywhere in the world (examples include tutoring, IT services, data entry and copywriting). This also includes services that, while facilitated by a digital platform, are physically carried out offline, usually at a specific physical location (examples include transportation and delivery services, housekeeping, gardening, or renovation work). These are all types of services that would be subject to GST in New Zealand if the person performing the services were registered for GST. 4.24 The rental of immovable property includes both residential and commercial property, as well as other immovable property and parking spaces. The supply of accommodation is not always subject to GST in New Zealand (that is, sometimes the supply is exempt). If the OECD’s definitions were to be used in a GST context, certain modifications would be necessary to maintain consistency with New Zealand’s GST framework. 4.25 The rental of transportation means would cover situations where a digital platform facilitates transactions between vehicle owners and customers of the digital platform. It would not be in scope of the extended marketplace rules where the digital platform is the underlying supplier of the vehicle (that is, where the digital platform itself owned the vehicle). GST returns 4.26 If adopted, extended marketplace rules would require digital platforms to provide GST returns to Inland Revenue on a periodic basis. This could be aligned with the quarterly return periods for remote services and low value imported goods to reduce compliance costs associated with changing digital platforms’ systems. GST would also be payable to Inland Revenue in one lump-sum based 32 on the same rules that apply to GST due from electronic marketplaces under the remote services rules. It would not be necessary for digital platforms to provide Inland Revenue with schedules showing GST attributable to individual sellers, as this information could be obtained by Inland Revenue in another way (see chapter three). An example of the extended marketplace rules 4.27 Example 4 shows how extended marketplace rules would work in the context of digital platforms returning GST on behalf of sellers in the gig and sharing economy. For simplicity, the example ignores the fee the digital platform would charge the seller for connecting the seller with a buyer of the service. Example 4: Basic operation Smithy’s Rides is a digital platform that connects Kelvin (a driver and the “seller”) with Laura (a traveller and the “buyer”) from the airport to her home. Smithy’s Rides charges Laura $115 including GST for this ride. With extended marketplace rules, Smithy’s Rides would return GST of $15 to Inland Revenue on behalf of Kelvin. If Kelvin were registered for GST, he would not include the $115 of sales in his own GST return (to ensure GST is not collected for the same supply twice). Kelvin will also incur expenses in making his ridesharing sales and some of these expenses will include GST. These implications are discussed later in the chapter. Impact of extended marketplace rules on existing GST registered persons 4.28 If extended marketplace rules were adopted, this could have an impact on persons who are already registered for GST and who were currently returning GST for their platform supplies. Either the rules would allow those sellers to continue returning GST (and the rules would also enable other sellers to register for GST themselves and manage their own GST obligations) or the rules would not allow sellers a choice, and that would mean that digital platforms would be responsible for returning GST for all platform supplies. These two options are discussed further below. Sellers could opt to return GST for their platform supplies 4.29 This could allow sellers who were registered for GST (or who wanted to register for GST) to elect to collect GST for their platform supplies themselves. This would require digital platforms to be able to identify which sellers on their platform were registered for GST and which sellers were not, so that it could charge the correct GST itself. 4.30 The Government is interested in whether there would be practical issues for sellers and digital platforms in implementing this option. For example, would it increase compliance costs for digital platforms if required to determine the GST status of all sellers on the platform? Are there issues for sellers who would want to charge GST themselves? 33 Example 5 Graeme owns a holiday home in Queenstown that he rents out on the accommodation sharing platform Ben’s Baches (which is digital platform that connects sellers of short-term accommodation with buyers). Graeme’s bach is extremely popular and is booked through Ben’s Baches about 70 percent of the year. Graeme also runs a bed and breakfast through his own website. As Graeme’s holiday home is attached to his main home, he can offer a service to clients who book through his website where he provides them with breakfast. This allows Graeme to charge a higher price and, by advertising on his own website, he does not have to pay any fees to the digital platform. Graeme’s website does not generate much traffic and consequently the holiday home is only booked 20 percent of the year through his website. Graeme is currently registered for GST and returns GST on both his pl atform sales and bed and breakfast sales. 4.31 Allowing sellers to opt out of the extended marketplace rules could present compliance risks and result in GST not being collected that should be. This is because sellers could purport to be registered for GST to the digital platform to reduce their pricing (making them more competitive to potential buyers) even if they were not registered. There is also a risk that some sellers could register for GST and not comply with their GST obligations (for example they may not charge or return the correct amount of GST to Inland Revenue). Lastly, if the extended marketplace rules were elective then this would reduce the efficiency of these rules. This is because individual sellers would still be returning GST to Inland Revenue when GST collection could be more efficiently dealt with at an aggregate level by the platform. Digital platforms would return GST on behalf of sellers for all platform supplies 4.32 The other option is that digital platforms return GST on all supplies made through their platforms, irrespective of whether the sellers are registered for GST or not. GST registered sellers who make other supplies would still be responsible for accounting for GST on those supplies in the ordinary way, but would no longer be responsible for accounting for GST on supplies made through digital platforms. 4.33 Compared with option 1, this option seems to have reduced complexity. This is because digital platforms would not be required to determine the underlying GST registration status of the seller. Digital platforms would collect GST for all sales through the platform which simplifies processes for the digital platform. Requiring digital platforms to collect GST on all sales through the platform also means that sellers would not be able to avoid their obligation to charge GST on their supplies made through digital platforms. Digital platforms would need to determine whether GST applied or not 4.34 If digital platforms were involved in collecting GST on behalf of sellers, the digital platforms would need to know when to charge GST and at what rate. In many cases it would be clear that GST should apply as the services facilitated by digital platforms would be physically performed in New Zealand and would not be remote services (such as ridesharing services or short-stay 34 accommodation). Some personal services that fall within the scope of the extended marketplace rules would currently be caught under the remote services rules and would therefore already be subject to GST. If extended marketplace rules were implemented in the gig and sharing economy, the interaction between those changes and the existing remote services rules would need to be reviewed to address any overlap. 4.35 Extended marketplace rules would also need to come with rules that made it cle ar when digital platforms were required to charge GST and at what rate. For example, exported services through digital platforms would not be subject to GST at the standard rate and would instead be zero-rated. It is not the intent to change the GST treatment of exports. GST would apply at the standard rate to services provided in New Zealand – for example, short-stay accommodation and ridesharing services, irrespective of the tax residence of the recipient. Facilitation services 4.36 Extended marketplace rules would require digital platforms to return GST to Inland Revenue on all supplies made through the platform. One question that arises in this context is how to deal with the GST treatment of facilitation services provided by digital platforms to sellers, 7 a s fees for these services make up a component of the total price that is paid by buyers. 4.37 In the remote services rules, facilitation services provided to GST registered persons are generally non-taxable or zero-rated. If this rule were to be maintained in the context of extended marketplace rules that require platforms to withhold GST on sales made through their platforms, then this imposes compliance costs on the digital platform as they need to determine the GST registration status of sellers and charge different fees depending on whether the seller is GST registered or not. 4.38 It follows then that consistent treatment of the facilitation fee is desirable in the context of the extended marketplace rules to reduce compliance costs on platforms. To ensure consistency, facilitation fees charged by digital platforms to sellers could be zero-rated or standard-rated. Officials consider that zero- rating facilitation fees would be the preferable option but are open to submissions on this point. 4.39 In the context of the extended marketplace rules where GST is charged on the entire value of the supply by the platform, there is no risk of GST not being paid by zero-rating the facilitation fee. The advantage of zero-rating over standard rating is that platform sellers will have one less GST cost that they would need to recover. As one of the key questions of extending the marketplace rules to unregistered sharing economy sellers is how these sellers will recover their GST costs, removing the need for input recovery on the facilitation fee helps lessen this concern. 4.40 The way that this would work in the context of extended marketplace rules is that the platform, as the deemed supplier, would return GST on the entire supply in their GST return (including the facilitation component). The key point of difference is that GST would not be charged on the separate supply of the facilitation fee. Consider example 6. 7 A facilitation fee is a fee that digital platforms charge sellers for connecting them with buyers. 35 Example 6 Michelle pays $230 (including GST) to stay one night in Sam’s apartment and books her stay via the platform Hannah’s Hideaways. The platform returns $30 of GST to Inland Revenue for this transaction under the extended marketplace rules. If the facilitation fee charged by Hannah’s Hideaways is 20 percent and is subject to a zero-rate of GST, then the platform would charge Sam $40. As there is no GST cost on the supply of the facilitation fee, Sam will not be able to claim any GST costs for this supply. If the facilitation fee charged by Hannah’s Hideaways was standard rated, the digital platform would charge Sam $46 (including $6 of GST). Sam would be able to claim a GST deduction of $6 (being the GST component of the facilitation fee). This reflects the fact that the facilitation service is cost relating to the supply of guest accommodation. In both cases, the net amount of GST paid by the final consumer is 3/23rds (the tax fraction) of the $230 accommodation service, or $30. From the perspective of the seller, the advantage of the facilitation fee being zero-rated is that they will not need to claim their GST costs on this supply. From the perspective of the digital platform, it w ould not have to determine whether the hosts are registered for GST as the facilitation fee would always be zero-rated. 4.41 As example 6 demonstrates, zero-rating the facilitation fee means that platform sellers will not have to claim back the GST cost of the facilitation fee. Options to allow sellers to claim back their GST costs are considered in the next section of this chapter, but depending on what option was chosen the zero-r ating of the facilitation fee could provide some benefits. For example, if a seller was required to register for GST to claim inputs, they may not necessarily choose to do so (particularly if they only provided services through a digital platform on a part time basis and considered the compliance costs of registering was not worth any GST deductions they may recover). Zero-rating the facilitation fee means this particular GST cost would not be incurred by a seller who chose not to register for GST. 4.42 From the perspective of the platform, both options (either zero-rating or standard rating all facilitation fees) means platforms would not be charging a variable amount of GST depending on the GST registration status of the platform seller, and so is a reduction in compliance costs for the platform. 4.43 Submissions are welcome on whether the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should be amended to zero-rate facilitation services, whether to standard-rate facilitation services or whether the status quo should be retained. GST on sellers’ costs 4.44 If digital platforms start charging GST on supplies made through their platforms, sellers will still need a method for claiming back GST on their expenses. For example, a ridesharing driver will buy fuel and might buy a car on which they have been charged GST and a guest accommodation host will be charged GST on electricity, rates and insurance and cleaning, repairs, or property management services. If sellers are not able to claim back GST on 36 their inputs, then they would be over-taxed, and this would create a competitive distortion when comparing those sellers with traditional suppliers who are able to claim back GST on their costs. 4.45 The best method for sellers to claim back GST on their costs is difficult to determine and submissions on this point would be welcome. There are trade- offs between accuracy and simplicity. Some sellers, who are already registered for GST for example, might not experience an increase in compliance costs. However, for many sellers who have not needed to interact with the GST system in the past, if digital platforms were charging GST for their sellers’ activities, there will be an increase in compliance costs for sellers who want to claim back GST on their costs. There may be additional compliance costs if sellers need to account for GST and make adjustments for their private use of some assets they use in their activities in the gig and sharing economy such as holiday homes or a ridesharing vehicle (some options to reduce these costs are discussed in chapter 5). 4.46 There will also be an increase in administration costs faced by Inland Revenue if thousands of new digital platform sellers are brought into the GST system. 4.47 This chapter discusses three different methods for sellers to claim back GST on the costs of their expenses. None of these methods involve the seller being responsible for returning GST for supplies made through the digital platforms. The first method requires sellers to register for GST and file returns, claiming GST back on their expenses and applying the apportionment and adjustment rules if applicable. The second method is a flat rate scheme, which involves digital platforms charging GST at the standard GST rate and returning only a proportion of that to Inland Revenue, with the remainder being passed on to the seller in recognition of the fact that there will be unrecoverable GST on their costs. The third method involves sellers claiming GST back on their expenses through their end of year income tax return. Standard GST registration 4.48 Under this option, sellers would be required to register for GST and file GST returns in the usual way to claim back the GST on their expenses. Sellers would only be required to account for GST on sales made for other supplies off the digital platform, and provided they met the criteria for a standard GST registration. 4.49 New rules would need to be added to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to deem a zero-rated supply of services from sellers to the digital platform. This would be necessary to enable sellers to recover costs for making those supplies. Example 7 Carmen is a driver on a ridesharing platform San Diego Drivers. She earned $25,000 on the platform between April 2022 and March 2023. San Diego Drivers returned GST of $3,750 to Inland Revenue on behalf of Carmen. Carmen completes GST returns every six months. She claims GST on the expenses she incurs (such as car maintenance and petrol costs) in the normal way. 4.50 One clear advantage of this approach is that it provides the greatest level of accuracy as it allows sellers to claim a GST deduction for the GST incurred on their actual costs. This approach also achieves consistency with other GST 37 registered suppliers who also claim a GST deduction on the actual costs of their expenses through the same mechanism. This approach would also require the least amount of change for taxpayers who were already registered and filing returns for GST, and for Inland Revenue because GST returns, and registration processes already exist and would require few changes. 4.51 This option is expected to result in a significant increase in GST registrations. Sellers required to register for GST to recover costs related to their platform supplies would therefore face an increase in compliance costs relative to the status quo. Sellers already registered would change their practices in completing their GST returns from including standard-rated sales to zero-rated sales, and would otherwise face comparable compliance costs to now. 4.52 Another disadvantage of this option is that when a platform seller has some private or exempt use of their assets then they would need to apply the GST apportionment and adjustment rules to account for this private use. These rules are currently complex and have high compliance costs. Some options for simplifying these rules in the context of the gig and sharing economy are discussed in further detail in chapter 5. 4.53 With this option, it is possible that a special type of GST registration may need to be designed to make it clear that the GST registration was for the purposes of enabling sellers to recover GST on their platform-related costs. This would mean that sellers who registered for this purpose only would not then be required to return GST on supplies made provided they did not satisfy the standard GST registration criteria. For sellers that are already registered for GST, they would continue filing GST returns in the normal way (but would not account for GST on sales made through the digital platforms). Flat rate scheme 4.54 Flat rate schemes are not uncommon in countries with VAT systems. 8 New Zealand does not have one, but one could be considered in the context of the gig and sharing economy. 4.55 Under a flat rate scheme, suppliers collect GST at a rate determined specifically for the industry that the supplier operates in. The rate is lower than the standard GST rate. Where suppliers use a flat rate scheme, they are not able to claim GST deductions for expenses incurred in making their supplies. This is because the reduced GST rate should account for this these expenses to some degree. The supplier will still collect GST at the standard rate, but they will only remit the amount specified by the flat rate to the tax authorities. This means they can keep the difference between the standard rate and the flat rate as a proxy for the GST on their costs. In this sense, a flat rate scheme is less accurate than a scheme in which suppliers calculate their individual inputs, however, it does reduce the compliance costs of individual sellers. 4.56 In the context of the gig and sharing economy, a flat rate scheme could be designed that would require digital platforms to collect GST at the standard rate, with them only being required to return a proportion of this to Inland Revenue. The difference between the standard rate and the amount returned to Inland Revenue would then be passed on to sellers in recognition of the GST embedded in their costs. 8 The United Kingdom and Mexico are examples. 38 Example 8: A flat rate scheme If Smithy’s Rides drivers were subject to a flat rate scheme, a standard transaction could work as follows (for the purposes of this example it is assumed that the flat rate of GST that would apply is 10%): • Bradd pays Smithy’s Rides $115 (which includes GST of $15) for a ride from his place of business to his house. • The driver is not registered for GST and the flat rate scheme applies. For the sake of simplicity, the fees the digital platform charges the seller are ignored. This means that of the $15 GST collected by Smithy’s Rides for this ride: – $10 is paid to Inland Revenue, and – $105 is paid to the driver. • The extra $5 paid to the driver is intended to recognise the driver would have been able to claim GST on costs associated with the ride had the driver been registered for GST. 4.57 If a flat rate scheme were implemented, the effect on already GST registered sellers would depend on whether changes were made to require all supplies made through digital platforms to be subject to the flat rate scheme. For example, changes could be made to enable GST-registered sellers to continue filing their own GST returns, whereas the flat rate scheme would apply to unregistered sellers. 4.58 The advantage of a flat rate scheme is that it can reduce compliance costs for sellers who solely make supplies on digital platforms. In an apportionment context, a further advantage of a flat rate scheme is that sellers may not need to account for private use of assets as no GST deduction could be claimed. 9 As sellers do not claim inputs under a flat rate scheme, the risk of fraudulent input claims is eliminated. 4.59 The flat rate scheme concept is simple but a problem with it is determining the rate that should apply. Compared to a standard GST registration, the flat rate scheme would result in some sellers being over-taxed, and some sellers being under-taxed. 4.60 To determine a rate that approximates the amount of GST sellers would be able to claim back through a standard GST registration would be difficult, if not impossible. This is because different activities have different cost ratios, and different business set-ups have different cost profiles. For example, a ridesharing driver who leases their vehicle would have different GST costs to a driver who does not. Those who provide short-stay accommodation services will have different costs to those who provide web design services through a digital platform. 4.61 Furthermore, the goal of reducing complexities and compliance costs is compromised when sellers either are, or must be, registered for GST in terms of the standard rules. This might happen when a seller has off- platform 9 It is noted that this would require the design of the flat rate scheme to account for capital assets. Some flat rate schemes, such as those in the United Kingdom, do not account for GST deductions on capital assets as part of the flat rate scheme and allow actual input tax deductions to be claimed for them. 39 supplies. Examples of this include sellers who provide short-stay accommodation through a digital platform and run a bed-and-breakfast, along with sellers who provide ridesharing services who may also be required to be registered for GST for taxi rides they supply to passengers as a self-employed driver for a traditional taxi company. These factors complicate the operation of a flat rate scheme. 4.62 Some flat rate schemes overseas allow for actual GST to be claimed for assets over a certain cost threshold, despite the flat rate that applies. To improve the fairness of the flat rate scheme this would need to be considered further. Another key consideration is whether transitional rules would apply to those who had previously purchased assets for use in their taxable activity and are currently filing GST returns. The solutions to these issues could increase the complexity of the flat rate scheme. Refunding GST on costs as part of the annual income tax return process 4.63 This option would allow sellers who were not registered for GST to claim GST back on costs with a GST component as part of the process of filing their income tax returns. This would be achieved by enabling sellers to get a refundable tax credit, which represents the GST component of their income tax expenditure, when they file their income tax return. It would not apply to sellers who were registered for GST, because GST on their costs would be recovered using the GST return process. 4.64 This method could be compulsory or optional for sellers. If compulsory, sellers would only be able to recover GST on their costs associated with making platform supplies by claiming their credits through the income tax return process. If optional, sellers could opt-out of this process by registering for GST and accounting for GST on their expenses in the normal way. Example 9 Smithy’s Rides driver Kelvin supplies $50,000 of ridesharing services between 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. The platform returns $7,500 of GST to Inland Revenue for Kelvin’s ridesharing services. Even though Kelvin is not registered for GST, he still must complete an income tax return which shows his profit or loss from his ridesharing activities through the digital platform. Kelvin has kept track of his ridesharing expenses for income tax purposes. Some of these expenses do not include a GST component (such as interest) but most do. An additional box is included on the income tax return that enables Kelvin to claim back a refundable income tax credit that represents the GST component of the costs he has incurred in making platform supplies. This box could separate out costs for which Kelvin can claim a deduction for income tax purposes but for which he cannot claim GST for (such as interest). This would enable Inland Revenue to determine a refundable income tax credit which represents the GST component of Kelvin’s expenses from a GST perspective. 4.65 This method is intended to reduce compliance costs for sellers by integrating the method for claiming GST back on their expenses into the income tax return process. It means that sellers do not need to register for GST and comply with, GST rules. 40 4.66 This method could also reduce opportunities for fraudulent GST refund claims. This is because, to obtain a refund, the seller would need to demonstrate that expenses have been incurred for sales facilitated by a digital platform and include this information in their income tax return. 4.67 The main disadvantage with this method is that sellers would not get the benefit of the GST refund until they file their end of year income tax return. From a timing perspective this is less frequent than if the seller was registered for GST and filing returns on a monthly, two-monthly, or six-monthly basis. Table 3: Summary of options to claim GST on sellers’ costs Option Advantages Disadvantages Standard GST registration • Accuracy: Sellers would claim GST on actual costs rather than deemed amounts which may be inaccurate. • Consistency: Consistent treatment with other registered suppliers which reduces maintains the simplicity of the GST system. • Increased compliance costs: Sellers would need to register for GST to claim costs and may need to apply apportionment rules (to account for private use of assets) whether or not they exceeded the GST registration threshold. Flat rate scheme • Reduced compliance costs: Sellers would not be required to register for GST and comply with the associated obligations of being registered for GST. • Reduces the risk of fraudulent refund claims: This is because there is no ability to claim GST deductions and the flat rate of GST accounts for these GST costs. • Complexity: Hard to determine what rate should apply as businesses have different cost profiles and different rates could be required for different activities. • Treatment of those already GST registered: Flat rate option does not account for those who are required to be GST registered for their off- platform supplies. • Inaccuracy: Some sellers will be over or under taxed as a flat rate is an approximation. Refunding GST on costs as part of the annual income tax return process • Reduced compliance costs: Sellers would not be required to register for GST, keep records, claim back GST on expenses, or deal with apportionment rules. • Administrative efficiencies: Inland Revenue would be able to review a sellers’ position for income tax and GST at the same time. • Reduced opportunities for fraudulent refund claims: To obtain a refund, the seller needs to demonstrate expenses have been incurred for activities through a digital platform and include this information in their income tax return. • Timing of refund: Sellers would not get the benefit of a GST refund until their end of year income tax return was finalised. This would delay refunds compared to a standard GST registration in which the person could receive a refund based on their GST filing frequency (monthly, two monthly or six monthly). • Treatment of those already GST registered: This option does not account for those who are required to be GST registered for non-platform supplies. • Potential administrative complexity: This option could be difficult to incorporate into the income tax return. 41 Questions for submitters To help make your points clearly understood, please provide supporting rationale or examples with your answers. • Do you agree that supplies of goods and services made through digital platforms should be subject to GST? • What are your views on lowering the GST registration threshold specifically for sellers on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy? • If digital platforms are to be made responsible for returning GST on behalf of sellers, should sellers be able to opt to return GST themselves or should this be undertaken by the digital platform on a mandatory basis? • If digital platforms are to be made responsible for returning GST on behalf of sellers, what is the preferred method for enabling sellers to obtain GST refunds for their costs? Is there another method that could work better than those described in the chapter? • Are there other practical difficulties that might arise as a result of requiring digital platforms to collect and return GST no behalf of sellers in the gig and sharing economy? • Would you be opposed to facilitation services being standard rated under any future changes to the GST rules in the context of the gig and sharing economy? 42 CHAPTER 5 Other measures to reduce compliance costs 5.1 The Government is also interested in whether there are other changes that should be made to the tax system to reduce compliance costs associated with earning incomes and complying with tax obligations through the gig and sharing economy. For example, for sellers on ridesharing platforms, are there improvements that could be made to the rules for determining motor vehicle expenditure for income tax and GST purposes? For sellers on platforms that facilitate short-stay accommodation, are there changes that would be desirable from a compliance costs perspective? 5.2 There are a number of areas where changes to the tax system could be made to reduce compliance costs in the gig and sharing economy. Submitters views are welcome in this area along with any other initiatives that submitters consider beneficial. Standard costs for those who earn income through the gig and sharing economy 5.3 One of the options available would be to introduce new standard costs for those who earn income through the gig and sharing economy. This would involve the Commissioner of Inland Revenue being responsible for setting standard cost deductions so that taxpayers who did not want to keep actual expenditure records could claim a deduction that was calculated with reference to averages across the industry. 5.4 Inland Revenue determines annually standard costs for those providing home- based boarding services. If a person chooses to apply these standard costs in determining their tax obligations with respect to their home-based boarding services, as long as the income they receive is below the annually determined amount, the person does not need to declare this income (or expenditure) to Inland Revenue in their income tax return. A person who chooses this method will not be able to claim a loss. 5.5 It is expected that the individual income-earning circumstances of each seller through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy could differ quite substantially. Each seller could have completely different cost profiles (for example, a ridesharing seller who leases their vehicle to other drivers will have different costs to a person who pays to lease a vehicle; and a person who does not have a mortgage for a property they use in their short-stay accommodation activities will have different costs to someone who does). This would make it difficult for Inland Revenue to determine standard costs that catered for these variations. The determinations would therefore be unlikely to be a representative proxy for the actual costs incurred. 5.6 The Government is interested in submitters’ views in this area, and, whether standard costs could be determined in a sensible manner. Accounting for private use of assets used in the gig and sharing economy 5.7 If a seller on a digital platform in the gig and sharing economy platform becomes registered for GST to recover GST deductions, this will raise issues of how they should account for GST for an asset such as a holiday home or a ridesharing vehicle which would now be used to make both taxable supplies and 43 for private use. The apportionment and adjustment rules apply when a GST- registered person uses (or intends to use) goods and services for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. Following acquisition of an asset, the GST-registered person must annually compare the intended taxable use of an asset with the actual taxable use of an asset and apportion accordingly. 5.8 The current GST apportionment and adjustment rules which apply to such assets are complex and have high compliance costs as they require monitoring of the percentage of taxable use and annual adjustments. Imposing these rules on thousands of sellers in the gig and sharing economy who may have otherwise relatively simple tax affairs and may only participate temporarily in a taxable activity would exacerbate existing issues with tax compliance and compliance costs. Example 10 Svenja owns a beachside property that she rents out on a digital platform called ‘book-a-crib.’ Svenja usually only rents her place out for a couple of months of the year (the rest of the time it is used for her private use), and she has never previously registered for GST. This means that Svenja is not required to charge GST on the fees she charges for accommodation, but also means Svenja cannot claim GST deductions for her costs such as cleaning, power, internet along with rates and interest payments. If extended marketplace rules were implemented, the supply of accommodation would be subject to GST and ‘book-a-crib’ would be required to pay 15 % of the short-term accommodation hire to Inland Revenue. To avoid over-taxation, Svenja should be able to claim back the GST component of the costs she incurred in providing short term accommodation. This means she would also be required to apply GST ap portionment rules to account for her taxable and non-taxable use of the asset for these costs. 5.9 We are therefore interested in any specific considerations that may apply for apportionment and adjustment in the sharing economy context that could help lead to a reduction of compliance costs for sellers on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy. 5.10 Inland Revenue officials are currently consulting on options to simplify the GST apportionment and adjustment rules, set out in the officials’ issues paper GST apportionment and adjustment rules. 10 The proposed options would significantly reduce the number of registered persons who face compliance costs and unexpected liabilities under the current rules. The proposed options could be applied to holiday homes and ridesharing vehicles to help mitigate some of the compliance costs which would arise if sharing economy sellers were required to register for GST to claim GST deductions. Holiday homes 5.11 Because most owners of holiday homes are not currently registered for GST, they are unable to claim GST deductions for these properties and are not liable charge GST on the properties if they sell them. To maintain this treatment, it is proposed that GST registered owners of holiday homes would be able to elect to exclude their purchase and disposal of the holiday home from being 10 Inland Revenue. (2022). GST apportionment and adjustment rules – an officials’ issues paper. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2022/2022-ip-gst-apportionment-rules 44 considered part of their taxable activity (even if it is partly used to make taxable supplies of short-term guest accommodation services). 5.12 This means if an owner of a holiday house registers for GST, they would usually choose to not claim a GST deduction 11 for purchasing the holiday home or on capital spending on the house. GST would then not apply to any subsequent sale or disposal of the holiday home. However, the GST registered person would still claim GST deductions on operating expenses (cleaning, property managers, rates and insurance, repairs to the extent these costs are incurred in supplying short term accommodation services). Owners would not need to return GST on the income they received as this would be done by the digital platform. 5.13 Another option could be to introduce a special rule which would prevent GST deductions from being claimed 12 for the purchase of a holiday home (and any capital improvements) unless the registered person made at least $60,000 of supplies to guests (ignoring supplies made to associated persons such as the owners or close family members as this is more akin to private consumption rather than a commercial activity). Such a rule would only allow GST to be deducted on the land and capital of a holiday home when the holiday home operates on a similar scale to other commercial accommodation operators such as hotels or motels which would typically have more than $60,000 of supplies to guests. 5.14 In any case where a GST registered guest accommodation host had claimed a GST deduction for buying their holiday house, they would be liable for GST if they sold the house or stopped their taxable activity of selling guest accommodation. However, it is also proposed that if a GST registered person did not choose to claim a GST deduction for an asset, such as a holiday house, they would not be subject to output tax on disposal of that asset. Ridesharing vehicles 5.15 Most ridesharing vehicles are dominantly used to make taxable supplies, with occasional private use. To reduce compliance costs of apportioning GST deductions on the purchase of a vehicle by a registered person, it is proposed that if the vehicle is 80 percent or more used to make taxable supplies (based on mileage), then this could be rounded-up to a deemed 100 percent taxable use. This would mean a full GST deduction could be claimed on the purchase of the vehicle and the GST apportionment rules would not apply as long as the taxable use remained above 80 percent (and if the taxable use dropped below 80 percent, apportionment adjustments would then be required). 5.16 Many of the ridesharing vehicles would have been purchased prior to the driver becoming registered for GST. Under the current apportionment rules, a registered person needs to have had 100 percent taxable use of an asset at the end of two of their annual balance dates to perform a wash-up calculation to claim a full deduction of the GST incurred on the purchase price. It is proposed that the wash-up calculation be amended so it can be applied at the end of the current adjustment period if there has been a permanent change in use. If this proposal proceeds, a GST registered driver would be able to claim a GST deduction for the GST they incurred when they purchased the vehicle at the 11 Or make an adjustment to return output tax of plus 15% GST on the zero-rated purchase price in cases where they purchased the house as a zero-rated supply of land or a going concern from another registered person. 12 Or require an adjustment to return output tax of plus 15% GST on the zero-rated purchase price in cases where they purchased the house as a zero-rated supply of land or a going concern from another registered person. 45 end of their first adjustment period (their next balance date) after they become registered. 5.17 In any case where a GST registered driver claimed a GST deduction for t heir taxable use of the vehicle, they would need to account for GST if they sold the vehicle or stopped their taxable activity of ridesharing. However, it is also proposed that if a GST registered person chose to not claim a GST deduction for an asset such as a vehicle, they would not need to account for GST on disposal of that asset. 5.18 It is also proposed that if a GST registered person had less than 20 percent taxable use of their vehicle (for example because they use it privately and only operate as a ridesharing driver on Friday and Saturday nights) that the taxable use of the vehicle could be deemed to be 0 percent. This would mean they would be unable to claim any GST deductions, but would also not be liable to account for GST if they sold the vehicle or stopped their taxable activity of ridesharing. 5.19 It is proposed the above rounding rules would only apply to capital spending. This means that GST on operating expenses such as petrol, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and vehicle licencing could only be deducted to the extent they were used to make taxable supplies (generally apportioned based on mileage). Question for submitters • Are there other options that the Government should consider implementing to make it simpler for those with tax obligations as a result of earning income through the gig and sharing economy to comply?

Tax rates on other types of taxpayers, including companies and trusts, remain unchanged at 28% and 33% respectively. The motivation for this reform was to raise extra revenue in a way that is progressive and does as little as possible to increase taxes on low to middle income earners. The integrity measures proposed in this discussion document are intended to support this objective by limiting the ability of individuals to avoid the top 39% rate (or the second-highest personal income tax rate of 33%) by diverting their income through entities taxed at a lower rate. The Government’s work on integrity measures to support the 39% personal income tax rate is being progressed in tranches. Tranche one, which is the focus of this discussion document, concerns dividend integrity and income attribution measures. Tranches two and three will consider trust integrity and company income retention issues and integrity issues with the taxation of portfolio investment income. This discussion document proposes: • That any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder be treated as giving rise to a dividend to the shareholder to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has retained earnings. • That companies be required, on a prospective basis, to maintain a record of their available subscribed capital and net capital gains, so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. • That the “80 percent one buyer” test for the personal services attribution rule be removed. The closing date for submissions on the proposals in this discussion document is 29 April 2022. 1.1 The New Zealand economy is faring relatively well despite the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the ability to continue to face the challenges of COVID-19 and to rebuild the economy will in large part depend on a strong tax base. To continue to be able to provide much-needed support to individuals and businesses, it is crucial that tax revenues remain strong and stable. The Government’s objective is to ensure the continuity of revenue streams by ensuring that the tax system is a fair and progressive one, and that everyone pays their fair share of tax. 1.2 To this end, the Government introduced a new top personal tax rate of 39% for income earned over $180,000. For this and other tax rates to be effective, it is important that suitable integrity measures are in place to ensure the tax rules are not circumvented. 6 1.3 The level of taxes paid on income from an investment or activity can vary depending on the entity structure used. There are many good reasons for the use of entities, such as companies and trusts. However, using companies means high income taxpayers can sometimes reduce the amount of their income that is subject to either the 33% personal income tax rate or the new 39% top personal income tax rate. 1.4 Potential adverse integrity impacts arising from taxpayers structuring to avoid the 33% and 39% rates include reduced tax revenue, as well as a negative impact on voluntary compliance if taxpayers perceive that avoidance is widespread. 1.5 Some of the integrity impacts arise from a difference between the top personal tax rate and the company tax rate. Even with a top personal tax rate of 39%, the gap between the company tax rate and the top personal rate of 11 percentage points is smaller than the gap in most OECD countries. However, New Zealand is particularly vulnerable to a gap between the company tax rate and the top personal tax rate because of the absence of a general tax on capital gains. 1.6 There will always be an arbitrage incentive unless the company and personal tax rates are aligned. However, alignment of company and personal tax rates is not the norm internationally. The arbitrage incentive could instead be addressed by increasing the company rate to the level of the top personal rate, but this is not desirable for economic reasons. For this reason, integrity measures are needed. 1.7 The biggest area of concern relates to closely-held companies and trusts that are used to earn income on behalf of relatively high income individuals, particularly those who earn income that is taxed at the top personal tax rate of 39% (or who would have income taxed at the top personal rate if they earned the income directly rather than through an entity). 1.8 There is much less concern with widely-held and listed companies. This is because they are not under the control of an individual, and so generally cannot be used as a conduit to achieve a lower tax rate on what is really the individual’s own income. 1.9 The scale of the tax benefit for 33% marginal rate taxpayers is significantly smaller than for taxpayers on the top rate of 39% (a differential of five percentage points versus 11 percentage points). Individuals on the 33% personal tax rate also typically have less total income to divert through other entities than individuals on the top rate, and hence the integrity concerns in relation to the latter group are greater. While the Government’s main concern is the integrity of the 39% tax rate, the proposals in this document can affect taxpayers at any personal tax rate in situations where some of or all their income is being earned through entities. Problem 1.10 The bunching of self-employed people at the tax thresholds in Figure 1 suggests that structures may be currently used by some taxpayers to avoid the 33 % rate, although bunching at the $180,000 threshold for the 39% rate is not evident. 7 Figure 1: Taxable income distribution: PAYE and non-PAYE income (year ended 31 March 2020) 1.11 Inland Revenue analysed existing data it holds on 350 high wealth individuals (individuals and families with more than $50 million in net assets) and found that they used or controlled 8,468 companies and 1,867 trusts. 1 For 2018, these 350 individuals paid $26 million in tax, while their companies and trusts paid $639 million and $102 million respectively, showing a significant amount of income earned through lower tax rate entities. 1.12 The Government considers that the current tax settings will lead to further integrity pressures. Evidence to support that expectation comes from the increased avoidance of the top personal tax rate that occurred in 2000 in response to the increase in the top personal rate to 39%. 1.13 Increased structuring may have unintended impacts on: • Revenue: Tax collected is reduced by increased structuring activity. This is due to the direct impact of taxpayers being able to earn their income through lower-taxed entities, such as trusts and companies. It is also because an inconsistent rate structure makes it harder for courts to find tax avoidance when the different rates mean it is difficult to determine whether a structure undermines what Parliament contemplated. • Social capital and the integrity of the tax system: Perceptions of arbitrary outcomes, such as when some taxpayers can structure to avoid the 39% rate, will erode public confidence in the integrity of the tax system and the perception that all taxpayers are treated fairly. • Horizontal and vertical equity: In the absence of integrity measures, more income of high-wealth individuals and others with substantial capital income is likely to flow to lighter-taxed entities. This suggests that the impact of the 39% personal tax rate will disproportionately fall on less wealthy salary and wage earners. 1 This analysis on high wealth individuals was undertaken separately from the High Wealth Individuals Research Project and is less comprehensive. 0.0% 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 0 10,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,00080,00090,000 100,000110,000120,000130,000140,000150,000160,000170,000180,000190,000200,000210,000220,000230,000240,000250,000 Percentage of total PAYE/non -PAYE income Individual Taxable Income ($) PAYE-incomeNon-PAYE Income 8 1.14 In light of these integrity risks, the Government is reviewing the current settings to see if changes are required, particularly to support the integrity of the new top personal tax rate of 39%. Scope of review 1.15 Work in this area will focus on improving the integrity of the rules relating to sales of shares and the attribution of income from personal services. It will also consider how to improve the integrity of trust and company income retention rules. 1.16 The review of the current settings is being progressed in tranches. Tranche one, which is the focus of this discussion document, concerns dividend integrity and income attribution measures relating to the use of closely-held companies and trusts by high income individuals. 1.17 The policy options considered in this document for tranche one would not attribute all income earned through companies and trusts to individuals and tax it at their individual personal tax rates. However, they would create the potential for a significant amount of income (a large proportion of which is derived by comparatively few families and individuals) to be recharacterised and taxed at the appropriate rate. 1.18 Tranche two will consider trust integrity and company income retention issues. Inland Revenue will be receiving more specific information from trustees for the 2021–22 and later income years under provisions in the recently enacted amendments to the personal income tax rate legislation. This additional information could help to inform in more detail how trusts are used and what measures could be considered to prevent under-taxation from the use of trusts. 1.19 Income retention measures would address the current situation where taxpayers can achieve a deferral of tax by investing through a company (including in cases where eventual distributions are taxed at the 39% rate). 1.20 A possible tranche three could consider integrity issues for the taxation of portfolio investment income, such as Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) taxation. However, given that PIEs are used by large numbers of low- and middle-income New Zealanders, and their taxation is a component of savings policy as well as tax policy, this is not as urgent a concern as the tranche one and tranche two issues. 1.21 The motivation for the recent introduction of the 39% top personal income tax rate was to raise extra revenue in a way that is progressive and does not increase the tax burden on low to middle income earners. The Government intends that any legislative measures arising from the review of the integrity of the 39% rate will be broadly consistent with this objective and with current tax policy settings. 1.22 The current tax policy settings are a top personal income tax rate of 39%, a 28% company tax rate, a 33% trustee rate (pending the upcoming review as part of tranche two of the use of trusts to avoid the top personal tax rate) and no general capital gains tax. The integrity measures proposed in this discussion document are consistent with these broader settings. This document does not consider options such as aligning the top personal income tax rate with the company and trustee rates or introducing a capital gains tax. Rather, the measures proposed focus on mechanisms that divert the income of a taxpayer on the 33% or 39% rate through channels that allow it to be taxed at a lower rate. 9 Dividend integrity 1.23 This document firstly considers two issues with the current law and practice regarding income of companies received by shareholders. Distributions from companies are intended to be taxable income to the shareholders (dividends), unless excluded because they are either returns of contributed capital or a distribution on liquidation of net capital gains. Under the imputation system, taxable distributions from New Zealand companies can carry with them a credit for New Zealand income tax paid by the company. However, because the corporate tax rate is lower than the top personal tax rate and the trustee rate, there is often a residual tax liability for the shareholder (or the paying company, where RWT is imposed). 1.24 Current law and practice offer a number of routes for shareholders to directly or indirectly realise cash (or other property) relating to earnings of a company without triggering any tax liability. The first issue considered in this document is sales of shares. A sale of shares offers an alternative way for a shareholder to realise cash, often but not always representing the earnings or capital gains of the company, with no, or a substantially deferred, tax cost. 1.25 When a company is sold, the purchaser’s payment to the vendor includes the value of assets funded by retained earnings. Under current law, this payment is generally on capital account. Because a change of ownership will eliminate imputation credits, any subsequent distribution of the retained earnings will be taxable to the purchaser. However, if the purchaser adopts the simple expedient of acquiring 100 percent of the target using a holding company, this taxation is permanently eliminated by the inter-corporate dividend exemption. 1.26 Secondly, practical issues arise when a company cancels shares or is liquidated. At this point, the company’s available subscribed capital (ASC) 2 and (in the case of a liquidation) net capital gains need to be determined, in order to determine the amount of the dividend on liquidation. However, there is currently no requirement for a company to have kept any record of these amounts during its life. This can make accurately determining the amount of a dividend on share cancellation or liquidation highly problematic. Personal services attribution 1.27 This document also considers the scope of the personal services attribution rule and whether it may need to be expanded in light of recent developments such as the introduction of the new top personal tax rate of 39%. The personal services attribution rule applies in certain circumstances when income from “personal services” performed by an individual is earned through an entity, such as a company or a trust. The rule attributes the income from personal services to the individual who performs the services, thereby ensuring the income is taxed at the individual’s marginal rate of personal income tax, rather than at the company rate of 28% or the trustee rate of 33%. 1.28 There is a risk that taxpayers on the 39% personal tax rate will use trusts and companies to obtain a lower tax rate on what is in fact personal services income. This is an issue both for taxpayers providing personal services to a single customer and taxpayers providing personal services to multiple customers. In each case, the economic reality is that the taxpayer is performing work and being paid for it – the entity is a conduit for the taxpayer’s income-earning 2 “Available subscribed capital” refers to a company’s paid-up share capital and can be distributed tax free to shareholders on liquidation. 10 activity. Consequently, the taxpayer should be taxed on their personal services income at the applicable marginal rate. However, currently, the legal structure used allows tax to be paid at a lower rate. Proposed solutions 1.29 This discussion document suggests a number of ways to address these issues and improve the integrity of the 39% personal tax rate and the dividend definition. In particular, it proposes: • That any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder be treated as giving rise to a dividend to the shareholder to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has retained earnings. This will trigger a residual tax liability for the shareholder. The company should also have an increase in its ASC. This ASC increase will address a current inequity in the imputation credit continuity rules and prevent double taxation upon liquidation. • That companies be required, on a prospective basis, to maintain a record of their ASC and net capital gains, so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. These accounts would be similar to the imputation credit accounts already required to be kept but would have fewer entries. • That the “80 percent one buyer” test for the personal services attribution rule (that is, at least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to one buyer in particular and/or an associate of the buyer) be removed. 1.30 This discussion document also poses the following questions in relation to the personal services attribution rule: • Should the 80 percent threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test (that is, at least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services is derived from services that are performed by the working person and/or a relative of theirs) be reduced to 50 percent? • At what level should the threshold for the substantial business assets test (currently the lower of $75,000 or 25% of the associated entity’s income from personal services for the income year) be set?

This chapter describes the current law relating to dividend stripping and examines the wider international context. Background Causes 2.1 Where a shareholder owns a company that distributes dividends, there are two main levels of taxation. The first is the taxation of the profits of the company, and the second is the taxation of the income (dividend) of the shareholder. Different countries deal with these two levels of taxation in different ways, through a classical system, an imputation system, or a full integration system. 2.2 New Zealand’s imputation system allows shareholders to use imputation credits to offset tax paid by the company against their own personal income tax liability when they receive an imputed dividend. If a shareholder’s marginal tax rate is above the company tax rate, then the shareholder pays a top-up tax so that the profits originally generated by the company have tax paid on them equal to the marginal tax rate of the shareholder. The distribution of the dividend is therefore what triggers the requirement to pay the final amount of tax on the profits earned by the company. However, if a dividend is not distributed, the requirement for that top-up tax to be paid is not triggered. 2.3 A dividend is one way a company owner can realise the value generated by the company. Another is for the owner to sell the shares in the company. Under current law, a share sale would not usually trigger any top-up tax, and such transactions are therefore a way for the shareholder to realise the earnings of the company without paying any additional tax. 2.4 The degree to which dividend stripping via share sales is a problem depends on the difference between a shareholder’s marginal tax rate and the company tax rate. The increase in the top personal tax rate to 39% without any change to the company tax rate has made this issue more significant. 3 In the international context, dividend stripping may also refer to a number of slightly different situations. In Australia, the issue of dividend stripping is more concerned with the purchasing and selling of shares either side of the ex-dividend date. In some countries, dividend stripping refers to the payment of large dividends that reduce the value of shareholders’ stakes in a company, which in turn contributes to generating a lower capital gain/higher capital loss upon disposal of the shares. 16 2.5 There are some broad categories of solutions available to deal with integrity issues around share sales. At the highest level, having perfect alignment between corporate and personal tax rates would negate the need for any top- up tax to be paid and so there would be no tax to avoid. Alternatively, if dividends were generally exempt, this would also negate the need for any top- up tax to be paid. On the issue of share sales, a capital gains tax would also go some way to solving the problem of dividend stripping as some of the proceeds of a share sale would be taxable. However, the Government has already ruled out introducing a capital gains tax, and so neither of these solutions are within the scope of the current proposals. Current provisions and relevant cases 2.6 This section outlines the legislative provisions, interpretative publications, and the principles established from case law that have governed how, and contributed to the way in which, Inland Revenue deals with dividend avoidance arrangements involving the sale of shares. 2.7 Dividend stripping arrangements are mostly governed by anti-avoidance legislation. Such legislation can be complex to administer and costly to litigate. Legislation and interpretations Anti-avoidance provisions 2.8 Dividend stripping arrangements are mostly governed in statute by the general anti-avoidance provisions in section BG 1 (Tax avoidance) as well as the dividend anti-avoidance provisions in section GB 1 (Arrangements involving dividend stripping). 2.9 The two sections are clearly linked. Subsection BG 1(1) states that a tax avoidance arrangement is void for income tax purposes, while subsection GB 1(1)(b) conditions the application of the dividend anti-avoidance provisions on the disposal of shares being part of a tax avoidance arrangement. This suggests that a transaction is not a dividend stripping arrangement if it is a genuine sale of a company to a third party since that transaction would not be part of a tax avoidance arrangement, even if it did have the effect of transferring value from the company to the vendor of the company. 2.10 If a certain disposal of shares is considered to be a tax avoidance arrangement, the dividend anti-avoidance provisions in section GB 1 apply when some (or all) of the consideration that the person derived from the disposal is in substitution for a dividend. This amount derived in substitution for a dividend is then treated as a dividend of the person and therefore becomes taxable income. 2.11 Subsection GB 1(2) states that an amount is in substitution for a dividend if it is equivalent to, or substitutes for, a dividend that a person either would have (or would in all likelihood have) derived or be expected to derive. In circumstances where the question is whether a person would likely have derived or be expected to derive a dividend, this provision is subjective and can lead to inconsistency in self-assessment and application. 2.12 Between having to show that an amount of consideration is “in substitution for a dividend”, and the requirement to prove that a transaction constitutes a tax avoidance arrangement (that is, there is no genuine commercial rationale for the transaction), it can often be unclear to all parties whether the sale of shares in a given circumstance would be subject to these anti-avoidance provisions. 17 2.13 The inter-corporate dividend exemption 4 is one of the main mechanisms used to distribute dividends tax free from a target company to its original shareholder. A distribution from the target company to a holding company when both are effectively owned by the same natural person(s) falls under this inter- corporate dividend exemption. The natural person(s) can then extract the dividend through an existing loan arrangement or through a return of equity under the available subscribed capital (ASC) rules. Interpretation Statement 13/01 2.14 In 2013, Inland Revenue released Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 Tax avoidance and the interpretation of section BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This publication canvassed in depth the current anti-avoidance provisions and their interpretation, with specific reference to the judgment in Ben Nevis. 5 2.15 Dividend stripping is not explicitly referred to in IS 13/01, but the Statement provides detailed commentary on the concept of tax avoidance generally. These avoidance principles are entirely applicable to dividend stripping arrangements not within Parliament’s contemplation. Revenue Alert 18/01 2.16 Following the judgment in Beacham, 6 Inland Revenue issued Revenue Alert RA 18/01 Dividend stripping – some share sales where proceeds are at a high risk of being treated as a dividend for income tax purposes. 2.17 RA 18/01 deals exclusively with cases involving related entities where the economic effect of the transaction does not include a substantial change in ownership. This gives some indication of Inland Revenue’s focus when investigating cases of dividend stripping under section GB 1 or section BG 1. 7 The Alert considers that the greater the similarity between the original shareholder’s owner before and after the sale of shares in the target company, the higher the likelihood that the arrangement would be regarded as tax avoidance. RA 18/01 gives a number of examples pertaining to restructuring involving trusts, shareholder exits, and mergers. 2.18 The Alert focuses on Beacham to illustrate the kinds of transactions under scrutiny, but states that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view is that sections BG 1 and GB 1 can apply in a wider range of circumstances than in that case. 8 2.19 RA 18/01 notes that Inland Revenue (as of 2018) has begun undertaking investigations into taxpayers who have entered into the sorts of arrangements described in the Alert. Where Inland Revenue considers that some non-taxable transfer of value to a shareholder is in substance a dividend, it will reassess that shareholder on the relevant amount. 4 Section CW 10. 5 Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289. 6 Be acham v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] 26 NZTC 21-111. 7 RA 18/01 does, however, note that shares in a cashed-up target company sold for the purpose of avoiding tax on a liquidating distribution should be taxed as a dividend rather than be treated as an ordinary share sale. 8 Tax avoidance concerns may be raised, for example, when an arrangement creates ASC in a company despite the shareholder not providing anything in economic reality for the issue of shares by that company. 18 Case law 2.20 The following outlines the criteria that, following case law precedent, are used to determine whether a sale of shares is deemed to be a tax avoidance arrangement. • Firstly, it should be considered whether the buyer and seller of the shares are associated persons. For example, in the case where the owner of a target company forms another company to purchase shares in the target company, the economic ownership of the target company has not changed, yet the owner will be able to realise some of the value of that company through a capital sum (since they will be associated with the company they formed to purchase the shares). In this case, it is unlikely that there is genuine commercial motivation for the sale. • Secondly, it should then be considered whether the target company is cashed-up and whether the buyer can liquidate the company by either: – making use of the inter-corporate dividend exemption, or – taking a deduction if a loss is made upon the buyer’s future disposal of the shares. 2.21 Dividend stripping arrangements typically tend to involve some of or all the following: • Control of the target company is not transferred in the transaction. • There is no genuine commercial rationale for the sale of shares. • The buyer bears little or no financial risk in the transaction. • The arrangement appears to be artificial. New Zealand context 2.22 During the 1990s, the top personal rate and the corporate rate were both 33% (as well as the trustee rate). This reduced the need for any broader anti- dividend avoidance provisions. Since then, the company tax rate has fallen and the top personal tax rate has increased, so there is now an 11 percentage point difference making the issue more significant. 2.23 Since the first increase in the top personal tax rate to 39% in 2000, New Zealand has seen a notable increase in the imputation credit account (ICA) balances of non-listed companies. 9 This suggests that smaller or fewer dividends are being paid to shareholders. International context 2.24 The need that a country has for deemed dividend rules varies according to other tax settings within their country. Some countries do have rules for dealing with the types of dividend stripping outlined here. Those countries also typically have other tax settings that limit taxpayers’ ability to engage in types of dividend avoidance, such as capital gains taxes and, to a lesser extent, full integration of company and personal taxes. 9 At a high level, the ICA balance of a company represents the tax paid by that company minus the imputation credits attached to dividends the company has distributed to shareholders, as well as refunds received. Subpart OB and subpart OP of the Income Tax Act 2007 set out all the possible ICA adjustments. 19 2.25 Australia has legislation that details what sorts of payments, loans, and debt forgiveness arrangements are treated as dividends. There are also provisions outlining what is not a dividend for tax purposes. A dividend stripping operation is referred to in the legislation but does not have a precise legal meaning. Australian case law has referred to dividend stripping arrangements having some of the following features or characteristics: 10 • A target company with significant undistributed profits. • A sale of shares in the target company to another party. • A payment of a dividend to that other party out of the target’s undistributed profits that is exempt from income tax. 11 • The original shareholders receiving a capital sum for their shares in the target company. • The arrangement was carefully planned for the purpose of avoiding tax on the distribution of dividends. 2.26 In 2014, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) published a Taxation Determination on dividend access share arrangements. 12 This addressed circumstances where a company issued a new class of shares on which franked dividends were paid. These shares are often sold to a company owned by the original shareholder. The creation of a new class of shares is a variation on the dividend stripping arrangements referred to in this discussion document. The Taxation Determination ruled that a dividend access share arrangement is either a dividend stripping arrangement or is in the nature of dividend stripping. 2.27 The ATO also released a Taxpayer Alert in 2015 on dividend stripping arrangements. 13 This was with reference to the sale of private company shares to a self-managed superannuation fund, though the principles are equivalent to the concerns of dividend stripping in New Zealand (particularly with regard to the issue of the original shareholders avoiding the top-up tax on the dividend income). This issue arises because income from shares that supports the payment of pensions is exempt income of the self-managed superannuation fund. The Taxpayer Alert suggests that if a taxpayer enters into an arrangement with similar features to those described, the ATO may apply one or a combination of the main anti-avoidance provisions, the non-arm’s length income provision, and any other relevant compliance provisions. 2.28 The Netherlands has specific anti-dividend stripping rules that deny a reduction of withholding tax for dividends or deny a credit for withholding tax paid. To guard against the use of loans in these arrangements, an interest deduction may be denied if a related party grants a loan with respect to distributions of profit, repayments or contributions of capital, or to acquire shares in a company such that the target company becomes a related company after the acquisition. 2.29 Japan’s previous provisions for exempting inter-corporate dividends also created dividend stripping concerns. For example, a target firm may buy back 10 These characteristics are referred to in, Lawrence v Commissioner of Taxation \[2009\] FCAFC 29; (2009) 175 FCR 277; (2009) 2009 ATC 20-096; (2009) 75 ATR 306. 11 For example, a dividend paid to a non-resident or if it qualifies for the inter-corporate dividend exemption. 12 Australian Taxation Office.

Under the previous rules, the cost base of the sold shares did not account for the deemed dividend from the share buyback, meaning the capital gain (and subsequent tax liability) were smaller than they should have been. Recent amendments ensure that a deemed dividend calculated as a result of the share buyback will reduce the cost base of the remaining shares sold in a subsequent sale. This has the effect of increasing the taxable capital gain of the sale to account for the tax-exempt deemed dividend the shareholder received in the share buyback (accounting for any return of capital). 21 CHAPTER 3 Proposal to tax a deemed dividend portion of proceeds from selling shares Summary When a shareholder makes a gain on a sale of shares, it is in the form of a capital gain, which under current settings is usually not taxed. However, there are some cases where the sale also results in undistributed earnings of the company being realised by the shareholder in the form of part of the capital receipt. Some cases where this happens are referred to as “dividend stripping” and are potentially subject to recharacterisation as a dividend under section BG 1 or GB 1. As discussed in the previous chapter, the anti-avoidance approach to identifying and counteracting dividend strips results in uncertainty for taxpayers as to the tax consequences of some sales of closely-held companies. For the Government, the current approach does not capture the full range of transactions where the amount received from selling shares includes a component of compensation for undistributed earnings. For instance, a sale of an active company to a third party is the least likely to be a dividend stripping transaction, regardless of the level of undistributed earnings in the company at the time of sale. This means that the tax rate imposed when those earnings are eventually distributed is not the tax rate of the seller, who owned the company when that income was earned, but the tax rate of the purchaser. It also allows a further deferral of taxing company earnings at the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. In addition, if all the company’s shares are bought by a company, the undistributed earnings may never be taxed even after being distributed to the ultimate individual shareholder. This chapter proposes an objective approach which can provide more certainty to taxpayers and Inland Revenue. General scope of a rule 3.1 The objective approach proposed in this chapter involves recharacterising share sales as dividends in the hands of the selling shareholder. A fundamental question is which transactions should be subject to the proposed recharacterisation rule. A. Shareholder sells shares of a controlled company but retains economic ownership of the company 3.2 The clearest case of dividend stripping arises when a shareholder sells shares in a company it controls or owns for cash (or cash equivalent) but retains control or ownership. This is because, like a straightforward dividend, the shareholder has realised cash from selling the company but still owns or controls the company, as is illustrated in Example 1. 22 Example 1: Shares sold to company controlled by the shareholder A shareholder on the 39% marginal rate of personal income tax forms a company (Bullseye) by contributing $100 of capital. Bullseye earns $100 on which it pays $28 tax. It does not distribute the earnings. Bullseye is now worth $172 plus any value attributable to its imputation credits. The shareholder forms a new company (Purchaser) to hold the shares of Bullseye. The shareholder transfers the shares in Bullseye to Purchaser in exchange for a promise from Purchaser to pay $172 to the shareholder. Bullseye pays a $72 dividend to Purchaser. This is untaxed due to the inter- corporate dividend exemption. It could also be fully imputed. Purchaser pays $72 to the shareholder as partial repayment of the loan. The shareholder receives $72 cash from this transaction, paid out of the earnings of Bullseye, without paying any dividend top-up tax. While the shareholder also has the ability to receive an additional $100 from Purchaser Co without paying any tax, this is merely equivalent to what it could have received as ASC from Bullseye in a share repurchase or liquidation of Bullseye. In addition, the $28 in imputation credits are still available to Bullseye and Purchaser. 3.3 The type of transaction illustrated in Example 1 is the clearest case of converting a dividend into a capital receipt, as the shareholder has both received cash and retained the company, as it would have if Bullseye had paid a dividend. However, the shareholder is better off because it did not have to pay the “top-up” tax or use the imputation credits. In this case, current law will already treat the transaction as a dividend stripping transaction, and $72 of the sale proceeds should be taxable as a dividend. However, such transactions may not always be self-assessed and may also not be known or pursued by Inland Revenue. B. Shareholder sells shares of a controlled company to an unrelated company 3.4 Another dividend stripping scenario, Scenario B, is the essentially the same as Scenario A except: • An unrelated person seeks to acquire all the shares in the target company. • The unrelated person forms a new company to acquire all the shares in the target company. • The unrelated person contributes an amount of capital to the purchaser company that equals the amount the purchaser company will pay the shareholder of the target company to acquire all the shares in the target company. 23 Example 2: Shares sold to unrelated company A shareholder on the 39% tax rate forms a company (Bullseye) by contributing $100 of capital. Bullseye earns $100 on which it pays $28 tax. It does not distribute the earnings. Bullseye is now worth $172 plus any value attributable to its imputation credits. A person unrelated to the shareholder and to Bullseye seeks to acquire all the shares in Bullseye. The unrelated person forms a new company (Purchaser) for this purpose. They contribute $172 of capital to Purchaser. Purchaser pays the shareholder of Bullseye $172 to acquire 100 percent of the shares in Bullseye. The shareholder of Bullseye has received $172 cash. The shareholder’s capital gain on the share sale of $72 ($172 less the original $100 cost base) is a non-taxable capital gain. However, the $72 gain represents undistributed retained earnings of Bullseye. The shareholder of Bullseye has not had to pay any top-up tax as it would have if $72 were distributed as a dividend. The consequences for Purchaser and its shareholder are: • Purchaser has paid $172 (market value) for Bullseye. $72 of this represents undistributed retained earnings of Bullseye. • $28 of Bullseye’s imputation credits are cancelled on the share sale. • Bullseye has the potential to distribute the $72 of retained earnings to Purchaser without any tax liability in the future due to the inter- corporate dividend exemption. • In addition, Purchaser has the potential to distribute the $72 of retained earnings of Bullseye, as well as the additional $100 paid to acquire Bullseye, to its shareholder without any tax consequences on a share repurchase or on liquidation as a return of ASC. 3.5 The overall result obtained in Example 2 is that the shareholder of Bullseye has received the $72 value of Bullseye’s retained earnings as a capital receipt and has not paid the top-up tax on it. In addition, even though Bullseye’s imputation credits have been eliminated, it can distribute its $72 of retained earnings to Purchaser and eventually to Purchaser’s shareholder (via a share repurchase or a liquidation) without any additional tax being paid. C. Shareholder sells shares of a controlled company to an unrelated individual 3.6 his scenario is the same as Scenario B, except the shares of the target company are purchased by an unrelated individual instead of a company. 24 Example 3: Shares sold to unrelated individual A shareholder on the 39% tax rate forms a company (Bullseye) by contributing $100 of capital. Bullseye earns $100 on which it pays $28 tax. It does not distribute the earnings. Bullseye is now worth $172 plus any value attributable to its imputation credits. An individual pays the exiting shareholder $172 for all the shares in Bullseye. The results of this are: • The exiting shareholder has received $172, of which $72 is a non- taxable capital gain. • That same $72 of the purchase price represents the retained earnings of Bullseye. • The exiting shareholder has not paid any top-up tax on the earnings of Bullseye that have been received in the form of a non-taxable capital receipt. 3.7 Scenario C is not as favourable to the new shareholder as Scenario B. In Example 3, the new shareholder has paid $172 for Bullseye, but the ASC of Bullseye is still $100. In addition, Bullseye has lost its $28 of imputation credits. If the $72 of retained earnings of Bullseye are distributed, they would be taxed as an unimputed dividend. This would also apply if Bullseye were liquidated. 3.8 In practice, the sale is more likely to be carried out as described in Example 2 (Scenario B), in order to realise the tax benefit of that approach. On the other hand, if Purchaser acquired less than 100 percent of the shares in Bullseye, carrying out the transaction in the manner described in Example 2 would not protect Purchaser from tax on a distribution from Bullseye since the inter- corporate dividend exemption would not apply. 3.9 Alternatively, to avoid an outcome which benefits the seller but hurts the purchaser, the parties to a sale could agree, for example, that the target company would distribute a dividend before the sale (the shareholder of the target company would pay the 11% top up tax), and the purchaser would pay less for the company to reflect the fact that its earnings had been distributed. A second option is for a dividend to be declared and reinvested in the company – this means that the retained earnings are converted into additional ASC, an amount distributable to the purchaser tax free on a share repurchase or on liquidation. Another option would be to negotiate a purchase price that reflects that the exiting shareholder of the target company gets a benefit in not having to pay the top-up tax on a dividend, and the purchaser will have to pay a penalty in the future for the possibility of deriving an unimputed dividend. If the purchaser thinks this possibility is far enough in the future they may be able to agree on a price that makes them both better off. To which scenarios should a generic recharacterisation rule apply? 3.10 Of the possible scenarios for a rule to recharacterise a portion of the receipts from selling shares as a dividend, A is the narrowest in scope and C is the broadest in scope. 3.11 Scenario A is the one that most clearly looks like a transaction that results in the same outcome as if a dividend was paid. The shareholder receives value for 25 the retained earnings in the company in the form of cash or debt or some other consideration, and the shareholder retains economic ownership of the company (although the legal structure of the ownership changes). There are also significant tax advantages to this as not only are the earnings made available to the shareholder without any top-up tax being paid, the full imputation credits remain in the company and are available to be used later. 3.12 This sort of related party transaction is one where Inland Revenue often uses section BG 1 or GB 1 to treat the sale as a dividend stripping arrangement. This is also similar to a United States rule that treats part of the consideration for a controlled company’s shares as potentially a dividend from both companies if the shares are sold to another company that is also controlled by the selling shareholder. 14 3.13 Scenario B is also a way the selling shareholder can receive the value of the target company’s retained earnings in the form of a non-taxable capital receipt. The buyer obtains no great advantage but is also not disadvantaged, except to the extent it loses imputation credits so that it cannot distribute pre-acquisition earnings without the distribution being taxed as a dividend unless it is done as a share cancellation or liquidation (although it can pay dividends out of post- acquisition earnings which generate imputation credits). Applying the recharacterisation rule to this type of sale would expand the concept of recharacterisation beyond what is now thought of as “dividend stripping” subject to section GB 1. 3.14 Scenario C has the broadest application. While it provides the selling shareholder the same benefit as Scenarios A and B, it appears to disadvantage the purchaser so it is more likely the purchaser would use a structure, such as in Scenario B. However, the tax advantages in Scenario B are only available if all the shares in the company are being sold. In Scenario C, the purchaser may also seek to have the seller pay itself a dividend before the sale, with the sale price being adjusted for that. If this were to happen the dividend would be taxed, so there would be no dividend recharacterisation required. However, it is also possible the parties could try to negotiate a purchase price which would give them both an advantage resulting from the seller not realising a taxable dividend. 3.15 It is proposed that a dividend recharacterisation rule may be applied to Scenarios A, B and C. All scenarios have the same consequence for the seller, although they have different consequences for the buyer. It seems appropriate that the shareholder who owned shares in a company when the company earned income would be taxed on the income when shares are sold for a price that includes the value of the company’s retained earnings. Failure to tax the retained earnings component of the sale price would also allow deferral of the top-up tax to be extended for a potentially lengthy period. 3.16 Such a recharacterisation rule could encourage the parties to the sale to agree to terms such as the company paying a dividend to the selling shareholder before the sale, in exchange for the buyer paying a lower price for the shares. However, such a practice would produce an appropriate result from a tax perspective. 3.17 The remainder of this chapter will discuss how a recharacterisation rule could be designed, keeping in mind that it should apply to all three scenarios. 14 United States Internal Revenue Code section 304. 26 Details of a rule 3.18 The following criteria should all be considered in establishing a deemed dividend on share sale rule. • To what sales of shares should the rule apply? • How is the deemed dividend amount determined? • What other consequential implications flow from the rule? What share sales should the rule apply to? Type of shareholder 3.19 The proposal will only apply to shareholders who are New Zealand resident natural persons (including natural persons who recognise the income as beneficiary income), trustees, and companies. The proposal will not apply to sales by shareholders, other than companies, that are taxed at 28%, such as PIEs, superannuation schemes and group investment funds. The reason for applying this rule to shareholders that are companies is discussed under other issues. 3.20 If the shareholder is a partnership, including a limited partnership, this rule will apply as if the partners directly owned and sold the shares in the company. Type of company 3.21 Because the rule will require reference to the imputation credit account (ICA) balance to determine the deemed dividend amount, the Government proposes that this rule would apply only to sales of shares in companies that maintain an ICA. This would be New Zealand resident companies, and Australian resident companies that elect to maintain an ICA. Shareholding size and control criteria 3.22 The proposed recharacterisation rule would only apply when shares in a company are sold by the controlling shareholder. An important point to bear in mind is that a shareholder who owns more than 50 percent of the voting interests in a company controls that company. The Government do es not propose that a recharacterisation rule should apply to sales of shares in listed companies and sales by portfolio shareholders. This is because the shareholder may not have sufficient information about the tax attributes of the company in order to determine how much of the sale price should be recharacterised as a dividend (these will be discussed later in this chapter). Also, listed companies tend to have a high dividend payout rate anyway. Companies with low dividend payout rates tend to be closely-held companies. 3.23 The proceeds from a share sale would be recharacterised as a dividend if the shareholder (together with associates and other shareholders acting together) controls the company immediately before the sale. It should not matter how large the block of shares sold is, as long as the control criterion is met. This is so there is no ability to avoid recharacterisation by selling shares in small “drip feed” parcels. Look back rule 3.24 A specific anti-avoidance rule is also proposed, which is intended to capture someone selling first a controlling interest in a company (which would be subject to this rule), followed by selling more shares to the same person (or an 27 associate) after they have divested control. To cover this, it is proposed that the rule would also cover share sales when all the following apply: • The seller (together with associates) did not control the company immediately before the sale. • The sale is made within two years of a previous sale of the company’s shares by the seller, or an associate of the seller, to the same buyer (or an associate of that buyer). • The control criterion applied at that time to the earlier sale of shares (that is, the company was controlled by the seller, together with associates, immediately before the earlier sale). How much of the sale price should be taxable? 3.25 When shares of a company are sold, a number of different factors affect the value of the shares. These include the value of the underlying assets, including goodwill or capitalised expected future earnings. The value of shares in an operating company may be the higher of capitalised future earnings or the value of the company’s net assets (liquidation value). Assets of a company can be funded from a number of financing sources including paid- in capital, company debt, and retained earnings. Retained earnings may include taxable income, capital gains, and other forms of income that are not included in taxable income. 3.26 The tax treatment that applies on the liquidation of a company is instructive for determining how much of a share sale receipt should be treated as a dividend. When a company is liquidated, the shareholders dispose of their shares for the assets of the company (which could be cash if the company has already sold its assets). When a shareholder sells shares to another person, the shareholder disposes of their shares for, usually, a combination of cash and debt. 3.27 In a liquidation, the amount that is a dividend is determined as a residual amount, meaning that all amounts that are not a dividend are determined first and the rest is treated as a dividend. The following are subtracted from the value of the company’s property that was distributed in liquidation. • Available subscribed capital (ASC). • The portion of retained earnings that are from realised capital gains. • The value of property that represents unrealised capital gains. • The difference between the (accounting) retained earnings derived from foreign portfolio shares subject to the fair dividend rate (FDR) regime and historic undistributed FDR income. 3.28 What remains is deemed to be a dividend. Imputation credits may be available to use against tax on this income. 3.29 Putting it another way, the dividend amount is taxable income plus income (other than capital gains and the FDR adjustment) that is not included in taxable income. In other words, it includes a clawback of preferences (other than capital gains) as does an operating dividend. The clawback of preferences is usually the amount of the dividend that is not fully imputed. With capital gains and an FDR adjustment specifically excluded from this amount in a liquidation, the potential clawback of preferences may not be significant. It may include things such as dividends from non-portfolio shares in a foreign company. 3.30 The Government do es not propose duplicating the liquidation calculation for determining the dividend amount from the sale of shares. This is too complex 28 and uncertain. Determining the unrealised capital gain component if shares of an operating business are sold would be especially difficult, as there would likely be a significant goodwill component which could have increased in value over time. 3.31 Using an accounting concept of retained earnings is possible. This could be adjusted to remove capital gains . Accounting earnings could potentially also capture more earnings than taxable income and so pick up a clawback of preferences amount. However, a disadvantage is accounting standards are more flexible than tax rules, so the standards could vary by taxpayer. However, the degree of variability is still limited by the application of accounting standards, such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 3.32 Another option is to refer to the company’s ICA balance at the time of the sale in order to calculate the amount of undistributed taxable income that it represents. For example, a $28 ICA balance could be deemed to represent a $72 net dividend or a $100 gross dividend implicit in the price paid for the shares. 3.33 We recognise that this is not a perfect measure. The ICA balance is broadly tax paid less tax refunds and imputation credits distributed. Typically, imputation credits are generated when provisional tax payments are made, and these could be a little higher than the actual tax liability if the uplift method is used to ensure the taxpayer is not charged use of money interest before the final instalment. On the other hand, the payments could be lower than the actual liability. Also, some adjustments, such as the shareholding change debit, could cause the grossed-up ICA to be unrepresentative of undistributed taxable income more significantly. 3.34 Both the accounting retained earnings and grossed-up ICA approaches have strengths and weaknesses. The Government therefore proposes to make the undistributed earnings portion of the grossed-up deemed dividend amount the higher of the grossed-up accounting retained earnings (less non-taxable capital gains) or the grossed-up ICA at the time of sale. Consequences to seller 3.35 When a shareholder that (together with associates) controls a company sells shares in the company, a portion of the sale proceeds would be treated as a dividend. That portion is: • the grossed-up undistributed earnings of the company at the time. This is the higher of: – the accounting retained earnings (less non-taxable capital gains) grossed-up to a pre-tax amount (by adding the ICA balance), or – the ICA balance divided by the company tax rate • pro-rated to the proportion of shares sold (the income interest of the shares sold as a percentage). 3.36 This is the amount of gross dividend income included as part of the sale price. If the sale price is less than the corresponding net dividend amount, then the sale price is the net dividend, and that must be grossed up by the amount of imputation credits that are or could be attached to determine the gross dividend. 3.37 The allocated ICA amount is then available to the shareholder to use as a credit. This is illustrated by way of examples later in this chapter. The effect is the 29 shareholder must pay the top up tax if its personal tax rate is higher than the company tax rate. Consequences to the company 3.38 Since the retained earnings out of which the dividend is deemed to be paid remain in the company, the seller is treated as if it received the net dividend and immediately returned it to the company as additional capital. To reflect this, the ASC of the company is increased by the deemed net dividend. 3.39 If the ICA balance is not forfeited on sale (which would be the case if the shareholder sells the company to another company that it controls or the sale does not result in a 34 percent change in ownership since the credits arose), then the ICA balance is reduced by the amount of imputation credits used by the seller to reduce its tax on the deemed dividend. Consequences to the buyer 3.40 There are no special consequences for the buyer. The buyer is treated as buying the shares for the price it paid for them, but it does get the benefit of additional ASC in the company generated by the deemed dividend. Example 4: Calculation of deemed dividend and change in ASC Shareholder S (an individual on the 39% marginal tax rate) forms company T by contributing $1,000 to a newly incorporated company. T earns $100 over the year. It pays $28 in provisional tax. It does not pay a dividend. It has retained earnings of $72 and an ICA balance of $28. S sells all the shares in T to P for $1,072. The grossed-up deemed dividend is the ICA balance at the time divided by the company tax rate. $28÷ .28 = $100. The grossed-up retained earnings are also $100. $72 + 28 = $100 S is deemed to derive a grossed-up dividend of $100. This is the same amount of income S would have received if S had been paid a fully imputed cash dividend of $72. Tax on this is $39. The $28 imputation credit reduces the net tax to $11. Company T must eliminate its ICA balance due to breaching the shareholder continuity requirement for carrying forward imputation credits. Even if that rule didn’t apply, Company T would decrease its ICA by the amount of imputation credits attached to the deemed dividend. In this case, the ICA balance is reduced from $28 to nil. The ASC of company T is increased by the amount of the deemed net dividend. The deemed net dividend is the deemed gross dividend reduced by the attached imputation credits. $100 − $28 = $72. After the sale, the ASC of T is $1,072. 30 Example 5: Calculation of deemed dividend and change in ASC Pepperidge Profit Accumulating Biscuits Ltd. (PPAB) makes biscuits. It is owned by the Pepperidge family, Peter and Patty Pepperidge and their children Paul and Pam. Peter and Patty own 30 percent each and the children each own 20 percent. PPAB was founded 15 years ago with a capital contribution of $1 million. It has since made $3 million from making and selling biscuits and has paid tax on that income. It has never paid a dividend. Some of its profits were reinvested in the business and some were used to invest in foreign shares. PPAB has earned $300,000 from the investment in foreign shares, but the taxable income from the shares was $250,000 under the FDR method. PPAB has paid company tax on the FDR income. Paul has indicated he wants to sell out of the family business so he can start a new business making corn bread and grits. The family agreed the business was worth $8 million and so he would sell his 20 percent interest to Pam for a payment of $1.6 million. He acquired his shares as a gift from his parents and they have the original cost base of $200,000. Paul has a capital receipt of $1.6 million. There is a $1.4 million capital gain which is not taxable. The retained earnings at the time of the sale are $2,390,000 and Paul’s 20 percent share of that is $478,000. The ICA balance at the time of the sale is $910,000 and Paul’s 20 percent share of that is $182,000. Paul’s gross deemed dividend is the higher of $182,000 ÷.28 = $650,000, and $478,000 + 182,000 = $660,000. It has a deemed attached imputation credit of $182,000. Paul’s gross tax on the deemed dividend is $660,000 × .39 = $257,400. After deducting the imputation credit of $182,000 he must pay additional tax of $75,400. As the sale of shares was less than 34 percent, the ICA balance was not forfeited. However, as $182,000 in imputation credits were attached to the deemed dividend, the company’s ICA balance is reduced to $728,000. The net dividend is $660,000 − $182,000 = $478,000. As the deemed net dividend amount was retained in the company, it is treated as if it were immediately contributed to capital. The ASC of the company is increased by $478,000. This will prevent double taxation in the event of a liquidation since that amount has already been treated as a dividend. Other issues Should the amount of the deemed dividend be limited to the gain on the sale? 3.41 The Government does not propose to limit the deemed dividend to the gain on sale (rather, it should be limited to the total sale proceeds). This is because limiting it to the gain on sale would effectively allow a deduction for a capital loss. 3.42 If a company has accumulated $100 over a year, you would expect it to appreciate in value by $100 over the year. However, if the company only appreciates in value by $50, it means some other asset or part of the business (such as goodwill or land) has depreciated by $50 over the year. This means the deemed dividend amount should not be limited to the gain, as that would 31 implicitly allow the deemed dividend (which should be the entire $100 of retained earnings) to be reduced by the capital loss. Why apply the rule to sales by companies? 3.43 If the rule did not apply to sales by companies, it may be possible to prevent a deemed dividend from arising by using a holding company structure. Consider the following fact scenario: • A shareholder may own a holding company which owns an operating company. • The operating company has retained earnings, but it never paid a dividend to the holding company. • The holding company sells shares in the operating company, realising a capital gain (not taxed). • The shareholder then sells the holding company (which holds the value of the company that was sold). The ICA balance of the holding company is nil, so this rule would not deem a dividend to arise to the shareholder from the second sale. 3.44 Applying the rule will address this issue because the first sale would result in a deemed dividend to the holding company, and this would transfer the ICA balance to the holding company. When the shareholder then sells the holding company, this rule would apply to deem a dividend arising to the shareholder. Corporate groups 3.45 If a shareholder is selling shares in a parent company of a corporate group (a group being at least 50 percent common ownership), the ICA amount on which the deemed dividend is based should be the net of all ICA debits and credits of each company in the group, as well as the consolidated imputation group if there is one. For companies less than 100 percent owned, the individual ICA amounts should be pro-rated by the portion of ownership. 32 Example 6: Calculation of deemed dividend and change in ASC for group of companies Parent $1,000 Cr ICA $500 Cr ICA $100 Dr ICA$500 Cr ICA $800 Cr ICA 80% 100%50%49% Parent, a company, has an ICA balance of $1,000. It has subsidiaries with the following ICA balances: • A company it owns 80 percent of with a $500 balance. • A company it owns 100 percent of with a $100 debit balance. • A company it owns 50 percent of with a $500 balance. • A company it owns 49 percent of with an $800 balance. If a shareholder sells its shares in Parent and this rule applies, the ICA balance used for determining the deemed dividend amount is calculated by summing the following amounts: • $1,000 (being Parent’s ICA balance) • $400 ($500 × 80%) • -$100 • $250 ($500 × 50%) • Zero (the 49 percent-owned company is not taken into account). The above calculation gives a total of $1,550. If Parent has consolidated its accounting earnings with its subsidiaries, this amount should reflect the retained earnings of the group (so that would be the amount of retained earnings used without looking through to each underlying company). ASC adjustments would apply for all companies that contributed to the calculation of the deemed dividend amount because they had retained earnings or a non-zero ICA balance. This would be the net dividend paid from their own retained earnings or grossed-up ICA, plus any amounts deemed on-paid by subsidiaries. The parent company would have an ASC adjustment of the entire net dividend amount deemed to have been derived by the shareholder. Another approach may be to take the total deemed dividend amount, and pro-rate it among contributing companies in proportion to their respective ICA balances or retained earnings (with parents of subsidiaries also including their subsidiaries’ amounts). 33 Sales of shares in a controlled company to another company controlled by the same shareholder 3.46 If shares in one controlled company are sold to another controlled company that also has retained earnings or an ICA balance, the amount received is potentially in substitution for dividends paid by both companies. Not only is the amount received by the shareholder potentially a payment for the retained earnings of the sold company, the purchasing company may pay for the shares out of its own retained earnings. 3.47 United States legislation provides that in this case, a dividend is deemed to be paid first by the purchasing company, and if that does not account for all that is paid for the shares, another dividend is deemed to be paid by the target company. This is because the cash or other consideration is being paid by the purchasing company to its shareholder, so it is the purchasing company’s earnings that are being transferred to its shareholder. To the extent the purchase price exceeds this amount, it would be paid from the capital reserves of the purchasing company. However, as with the more general rule, if that amount is compensation for the retained earnings of the target company, that would be treated as a dividend from the target company. 3.48 In this case, it is proposed to follow the order used in the United States law (the amount received is first deemed to be paid out of the retained earnings of the purchasing company). This is calculated by grossing up the ICA balance or retained earnings of the purchasing company (or group) as described earlier in the context of determining the amount of a deemed dividend with respect to the sold company. As the purchasing company is paying cash or equivalent to the seller (consideration paid in the form of shares in the purchasing company is not taken into account in determining the amount of the deemed dividend), no amount is deemed to be recontributed to the purchasing company, and there is no adjustment to the ASC of the purchasing company for the deemed dividend amount. 3.49 However, the shareholder should still be entitled to the protection of the ASC of the target company in the case of a liquidation or share repurchase of the group, including the purchasing and target companies, as that ASC would have been available to reduce those amounts if the target company had continued to be owned directly by the shareholder. To reflect this, the ASC of the purchasing company should be increased by the lesser of the market value of the shares it acquired in the target company, and the ASC of the target company. 3.50 If the deemed dividend from the purchasing company does not account for the en tire amount paid for the shares, then the amount of a deemed dividend from the target company is determined as described earlier, but this time it is limited to the amount paid after subtracting the deemed dividend from the purchasing company. The ASC of the target company is increased as described earlier. This increase in the ASC of the target company is deemed to happen immediately before the acquisition by the purchasing company, so the increase may also apply to the ASC of the purchaser (that is, an ASC increase of the lesser of the market value of the target company and the ASC of the target company). 34 Example 7: Sale of controlled company to another controlled company A shareholder owns all the shares in two companies, Left Pocket Ltd (LPL) and Right Pocket Ltd (RPL). LPL has ASC of $3,000,000 and retained earnings of $1,440,000. Its ICA balance is $560,000. RPL has ASC of $1,000,000 and retained earnings of $940,000. Its ICA balance is $560,000. RPL had earned $2,000,000 in taxable income but it has also had a $500,000 capital loss. The shareholder has decided that it prefers structure diagrams that look vertical instead of horizontal. It has decided that it will sell all the shares in RPL to LPL for its net asset value of $1,940,000. Consequences for LPL In this situation, if there is a deemed dividend, it is deemed to arise first from the purchasing company. The ICA of LPL is $560,000. Dividing this amount by the company tax rate gives a potential gross deemed dividend of $2,000,000 and a net dividend of $1,440,000. As the net dividend amount is less than the amount paid for RPL, the entire $2,000,000 is deemed to be a gross dividend the shareholder derived from LPL. The shareholder’s tax on the deemed dividend from LPL is $2,000,000 × .39 = $780,000. After claiming the imputation credit of $560,000, the shareholder must pay additional tax of $220,000. Since the entire ICA balance of $560,000 was deemed to be attached to the dividend, LPL’s ICA balance is reduced to nil. So that the shareholder is left in the same position from liquidating the parent company as if it liquidated the two companies separately (before reorganisation), the ASC of LPL is increased by the lesser of the value of the shares it received in RPL and RPL’s ASC. This would increase the ASC of LPL by $1,500,000 to $4,500,000, taking into account the increase in the ASC of RPL discussed below. Consequences for RPL Since the amount paid for RPL was more than the net deemed dividend from LPL, it is necessary to see if there is also a deemed dividend from RPL. The net deemed dividend from LPL was $1,440,000. Since it paid $1,940,000 for the shares in RPL, there is a remaining $500,000 that could potentially be a net deemed dividend from RPL. Dividing RPL’s $560,000 ICA balance by the company tax rate gives a maximum gross deemed dividend of $2,000,000 and a maximum net dividend of $1,440,000. Since the $500,000 residual (from the amount paid by LPL for the shares in RPL) is less than the maximum net deemed dividend of RPL, the $500,000 is deemed to be a net dividend derived by RPL’s shareholder. A net dividend of $500,000 is equivalent to a gross dividend of $694,444. 35 The shareholder is deemed derive a gross dividend of $694,444 from RPL. Tax at 39% is $270,833. After taking into account the attached imputation credit of $194,444, the shareholder has additional tax to pay of $76,389 (in addition to the tax on the deemed dividend from LPL). Since the ultimate shareholder of RPL has not changed as a result of the sale, RPL’s ICA is not forfeited. However, it must debit its ICA account by the amount deemed attached to the dividend. This is $194,444, so the ICA balance of RPL is reduced to $365,556. Questions for submitters Submissions are sought on all aspects of this proposal, but in particular on the following questions: • Is deeming a dividend to arise when shares are sold (while the company has retained earnings) an appropriate policy outcome? • Should the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule cover all of scenarios A, B, or C, or only one or two of these scenarios? • Is limiting the scope of the proposed recharacterisation rule to sales of shares by a controlling shareholder appropriate, or do you think this is too broad or too limited? • Is the conceptual basis for quantifying the deemed dividend (that is, undistributed income, not including untaxed capital gains) appropriate? • What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of the suggested dividend quantification approaches (grossed-up ICA, retained earnings, or a combination of the two), and which of these approaches do you prefer? Is there an alternative approach you would suggest? • Do you agree with the proposed approach (outlined in Example 3) for calculating dividends and ASC adjustments for corporate groups? • Is the approach outlined in Example 4 for a sale of one controlled company to another (existing) controlled company (potentially generating a deemed dividend from both companies) correct conceptually? 37 Part II: ASC and ACDA tracking accounts 39 CHAPTER 4 Current practice and issues Summary Distributions by a company are not taxable to the extent they are: • a return of capital subscribed by shareholders (referred to as “available subscribed capital” (ASC)) on a liquidation or share cancellation, or • a net capital gain of the company distributed in a liquidation. When there is a share repurchase or liquidation, determining the dividend amount requires subtracting the ASC and the capital gain amount. Because a company may have been in existence for a long time before liquidation and these amounts may not be relevant before then, it is sometimes difficult for the company to determine them (going through historical records) and for Inland Revenue to verify them. There are different ways to improve the reliability of this information. This chapter and the next consider two possible options: • Option one: Require the amount of ASC and the capital gain amount to be determined annually and reported to Inland Revenue. • Option two: Require taxpayers to record the information to evidence that they have calculated the dividend amount correctly (with Inland Revenue determining the amounts in the absence of reliable evidence), with no annual reporting requirement. 4.1 The determination of a company’s ASC and available capital distribution amount (ACDA) is provided for in sections CD 43 and CD 44 respectively. 4.2 The calculation of these amounts is not straightforward. The ASC definition has 40 subsections and comprises approximately 2,820 words. Although the core definition (amounts received for the issue of shares less amounts returned on the cancellation of shares) is simple enough, complexities arise by reason of the tax treatment of (among other things): • taxable bonus issues • share for share exchanges • shares issued as part of an employee share scheme, and • amalgamations. 4.3 In relation to ACDA, the calculation requires: • capital gains and losses to be calculated • an understanding of whether the transaction was with a related party or not, and • special calculations in relation to foreign investment fund (FIF) interests. 4.4 Not only are the rules complex, they change from time to time, meaning that the appropriate treatment of a transaction depends on the year in which it takes place. 40 4.5 An example of the kind of issue that can arise is where a company (the acquirer) issues its shares in exchange for 100 percent of the shares in another company (the target). From an accounting perspective, the acquirer will generally take the target into its books at the purchase price paid, and the increase in the acquirer’s shareholders’ equity will reflect the market value of the issued shares. However, for tax purposes, the ASC is limited to the historic amount paid to the target for the issue of its shares, whenever that occurred. Currently, there is no explicit requirement for any contemporaneous record of this discrepancy to be maintained. 4.6 In relation to both ASC and the ACDA, many years may pass between the occurrence of the transactions giving rise to positive or negative entries in the account, and the time when a distribution is made for which those entries are relevant. And in relation to ASC in particular, in many cases the figure will never be relevant. If the company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company at the time it is wound up, its ASC will be essentially unused. This may be the case for a company that is always part of a corporate group, or for a company initially owned by individuals or trusts and then sold to a corporate group. 4.7 In cases where a company does have to determine its ASC or ACDA, unless it has been very well run, the determination will often be extremely difficult, as it requires a careful record of both the law and transactions going back to the formation of the company. 4.8 There does not appear to be any explicit requirement for a company to keep records in relation to its ASC or ACDA. Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) does not apply, since these amounts are not required for the calculation of the company’s own income or deductions (see section 22(2)(g) and (h) of the TAA). Nor are they otherwise specifically dealt with in that section. 4.9 Section 22AAB(2) of the TAA does require a person who is liable to pay RWT for resident passive income paid to another person to keep proper records relating to the income paid by them, sufficient to enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to ascertain the information set out in Schedule 3 table 2. Row 5 of table 2 refers to the amount of resident passive income. When a company makes a payment in consideration for the cancellation of shares, or makes a liquidating distribution, in order to ascertain the amount of a dividend (which could be zero) the Commissioner would require information about the company’s ASC and ACDA. It is therefore arguable that section 22AAB(2) imposes a requirement to keep records. However, the section seems primarily directed to the ascertainment of information about who has received a dividend and when, rather than the ascertainment of whether a distribution to a shareholder is a dividend in the first place. 4.10 Despite the lack of any explicit requirement, a company that does not have records to substantiate its ASC and ACDA will effectively lose those amounts, as it will not be able to satisfy the burden of proof required to take a position that some or all of a distribution is not a dividend. This issue is considered in draft operational statement ED 0239, released in December 2021. 41 CHAPTER 5 Policy options Summary There is a strong case for amending the TAA to deal specifically with record keeping requirements in relation to ASC and ACDAs, and maintaining tracking accounts for ASC and ACDA, similar to those that are maintained for imputation credits. Such accounts would prompt companies to keep contemporaneous records, and this would significantly improve the reliability of the figures. Contemporaneous accounts would also create an opportunity for the Commissioner to make a contemporaneous challenge to an ASC or ACDA increase, rather than having to wait until a distribution occurs to do so. There is a question as to whether taxpayers should be required to submit these tracking accounts to Inland Revenue each year as part of the return filing process (similar to the IR4J process for imputation credit accounts), or if taxpayers should only be required to record the information and keep adequate supporting records to evidence that they have calculated the dividend amount correctly. In the event of an audit, Inland Revenue would determine the company’s ASC and ACDA if the taxpayer cannot provide reliable evidence to support its calculations. Record keeping 5.1 Dealing first with record keeping, the requirement would be for a company to keep sufficient records to enable the ready ascertainment by the Commissioner of the company’s ASC and ACDA. These records would have to be maintained for the life of the company, rather than the usual seven-year period. 5.2 There is a question as to whether compliance with these requirements would be mandatory. Many companies have for their entire existence no more than nominal ASC. For companies which are wholly-owned subsidiaries, ASC is irrelevant (though ACDA is not). Accordingly, compliance with this record keeping requirement could be optional, with companies electing not to comply being entitled to no credit to their ASC or ACDAs for the relevant years. Memorandum accounts 5.3 Like an imputation credit account (ICA) the account would be a running total, with each year’s closing balance forming the opening balance for the next. As noted above, there are two possible approaches in relation to tracking accounts for ASC and ACDA. The first is to require taxpayers to submit these accounts to Inland Revenue on an annual basis. If these accounts are not prepared for a year on a timely basis, the company would then have no ASC or ACDA for that year. The second is to require taxpayers to keep and maintain these accounts if they do not wish to have their ASC or ACDA be deemed to be zero, but without requiring taxpayers to submit these accounts to Inland Revenue. Under each option the company would still need to maintain sufficient records to evidence the amounts entered in the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts. It would not be sufficient simply to maintain the memorandum account without retaining the records substantiating the account entries. 42 Option one: Accounts are reported to Inland Revenue annually 5.4 One benefit of requiring taxpayers to maintain tracking accounts and submit them to Inland Revenue annually is that this would serve as a prompt to taxpayers to maintain records. It would also provide Inland Revenue with information on a contemporaneous basis regarding movements in the account and allow it to investigate those movements. 5.5 Under this option, failure to submit a return of the tracking accounts by the due date would mean a taxpayer could not later increase the account balance by an y amount for that period, except with the Commissioner’s approval and if the required contemporaneous records were able to be provided. A hard time limit (for example, five years after the due date) might also be appropriate. 5.6 A further question is whether the return would be able to be re-opened by the Commissioner. The purpose of the return would be to assist taxpayer compliance. Its purpose would not be to place an onus on the Commissioner to audit the return. Accordingly, the Government does not propose placing a time limit on the Commissioner’s ability to challenge a return in relation to the ACDA and ASC memorandum accounts. As a practical matter, the maintenance of contemporaneous records would make challenge at the time of a distribution relatively unlikely. Challenges would instead be made to entries in the accounts, within a relatively short time of those entries being made. The current time limit would continue to apply to assessments of shareholders in relation to distributions from the company, which would effectively mean the time bar applying from the point in time when the determination of a company’s ASC or ACDA amounts became relevant for tax obligations. 5.7 As with the proposed record keeping requirement, compliance with a requirement to maintain tracking accounts could be optional, on the basis that companies that do not choose to maintain accounts would then have no ASC or ACDA. Option two: Accounts required to be kept and maintained but not required to be reported to Inland Revenue annually 5.8 Under this option, rather than requiring tracking accounts for ASC and ACDA to be submitted to Inland Revenue annually, taxpayers would only be required to provide these accounts (along with supporting records) to Inland Revenue when this information is specifically requested, such as in the event of an audit. Similar to option one and the proposed record keeping requirement, maintenance of these tracking accounts could be optional (again, on the basis that companies that do not choose to maintain accounts would then have no ASC or ACDA). 5.9 The main benefit of not requiring tracking accounts to be submitted each year, but instead only requiring them to be kept by taxpayers would be lower compliance and administration costs in respect of amounts that do not affect taxable income for that particular year. The disadvantages of this from Inland Revenue’s perspective would be reduced visibility of amounts being claimed by taxpayers as ASC and ACDA, and potentially reduced incentives for businesses to maintain accounts (although the potential loss of ASC and ACDA might provide sufficient incentive on its own). 5.10 Submissions are invited on whether tracking accounts should be required to be reported to Inland Revenue annually, or whether it would be sufficient to just require these accounts to be kept and maintained if a company does not want to have deemed ASC and ACDA of zero. 43 Transitional 5.11 The transitional issue here is considerable. Many, perhaps most, existing companies have not maintained contemporaneous ASC or ACDAs, relying instead on calculating the figure on a retrospective basis if it ever becomes necessary to do so. Requiring all existing companies to undertake a retrospective calculation would be onerous, and in many cases ultimately pointless, as the company will be wound up when wholly owned by another company, or with no amount returned to the shareholders. 5.12 Accordingly, the Government proposes that any change to the rules would only take effect for transactions occurring after the law is enacted. To the extent a company’s ASC and ACDA figures rely on transactions occurring before that date, the current law would continue to apply. A company will have the onus of proof in establishing the amount of ASC and ACDA (as is the usual case for tax matters), but this burden can be satisfied at the time the ASC and ACDA accounts become relevant (that is, when shares are repurchased or liquidating distributions are made to shareholders). 5.13 Over time a greater and greater percentage of the total amount of ASC and ACDA will be under the new rules. This will make the calculation of dividends on liquidation of a company, for instance, much easier to determine. 5.14 Thought will need to be given as to the order in which credits to the ASC account can be used. For example, suppose a company formed in 1990, which issues $1 million of shares after the introduction of tracking accounts. The company then returns $750,000 to its shareholders in a share repurchase transaction. Should this first be debited against ASC arising before the tracking account was set up, with any excess recognised in the new account, or should it first be debited against the amount in the account (which in this case would mean the historic ASC would remain untouched, but the ASC subject to the new rules would be only $250,000)? 5.15 In favour of debiting the ASC tracking account is the fact that it will be well documented. On the other hand, debiting historic ASC would support the gradual elimination of such ASC. Questions for submitters Submissions are sought on all aspects of this proposal, but in particular on: • Whether the proposed transitional rule is appropriate. • Whether the Commissioner should be able to reopen a return and on what basis. • Whether the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between compliance costs and tax integrity. • Whether the ASC and ACDA memorandum accounts should be reported in annual returns. 45 Part III: Personal services income attribution 47 CHAPTER 6 Current law and problems Summary This chapter examines the current law concerning the attribution of personal services income. First, it looks at the personal services attribution rule, which applies in certain circumstances when income from “personal services” performed by an individual is earned through an entity, such as a company or a trust. It then examines the precedent set by the Penny and Hooper case and the challenges for Inland Revenue in applying this precedent to cases where a taxpayer uses an associated entity as a conduit for selling personal services. Attribution rule for income from personal services 6.1 The Income Tax Act 2007 contains an attribution rule for income from personal services. The attribution rule, contained in sections GB 27 to GB 29, prevents an individual avoiding the top personal tax rate by diverting income to an associated entity. A typical scenario is where an individual incorporates a company to contract for services. The company contracts with the customer and pays the 28% corporate tax rate on its fee income. The company then employs or sub-contracts with the individual to provide the service, often at a below-market rate. The company can either retain its profit or pass the profit back to the taxpayer in a tax-advantaged manner (for example, through a trust). 6.2 The attribution rule for income from personal services applies when an individual (the working person), who performs personal services, is associated with an entity (the associated entity) that provides those personal services to a third person (the buyer). The rule only applies when various threshold tests are met, most notably: • At least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to the buyer or an associate of the buyer (or some combination thereof). This is referred to throughout this chapter as the “80 percent one buyer” rule. • At least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from services that are performed by the working person or a relative of theirs (or some combination thereof). This is referred to as the “80 percent one natural person supplier” rule. • “Substantial business assets” are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the associated entity’s income from personal services. 6.3 The combination of these tests targets the rule at individuals who, using an interposed entity, sell their labour to a buyer in the specific situation where these individuals would likely have traditionally supplied their labour as employees, rather than as independent contractors. 48 Background and current law Personal services attribution rule 6.4 The top personal tax rate was first increased to 39% in the year 2000. This provided an incentive for some employees and contractors to arrange their affairs so that they avoided paying the 39% rate. One of the responses was that simple avoidance schemes were targeted at people who would normally be regarded as employees. The policy response to this problem was to introduce the personal services attribution rule in 2000, shortly after the increase in the top personal rate took effect. 6.5 Under the personal services attribution rule, an amount of income of an associated entity is attributed to the working person, provided that: • during the income year, the buyer acquires services from the associated entity • the services are personally performed by the working person • the working person is associated with the associated entity at the time the services are personally performed by the working person (using the general definition of “associated persons” in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007) • the two 80 percent tests (referred to above) are both met • the working person’s net income for the income year – assuming the personal services attribution rule applies to attribute the income of the associated entity to the working person – is more than $70,000, 15 and • as mentioned above, “substantial business assets” are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the associated entity’s total income from personal services. 16 6.6 In relation to the last of these conditions, “substantial business assets” means depreciable property that, at the end of the associated entity’s corresponding income year, has a total cost of more than either $75,000 or 25 percent of the associated entity’s total income from services for the income year. 17 In the case of depreciable property subject to a finance lease or hire purchase agreement, the cost of the property includes the consideration provided to the lessee, including expenditure or loss incurred by the lessee in installing the asset for use unless the lessee is allowed a deduction for the expenditure or loss. 18 6.7 Section GB 27(3) provides a number of exemptions from the personal services attribution rule. Under the listed exemptions, the attribution of personal services income does not occur: • if both the associated entity and working person are non-residents or, in some circumstances, if the associated entity is a controlled foreign company 15 Previously $60,000, being the income threshold above which the former 39% marginal rate applied in 2000. 16 Section GB 27(1) and (2). 17 Section GB 28(6). 18 Section GB 28(7)(a). 49 • if the associated entity is a natural person and neither a partner of a partnership nor the trustee of a trust • if the total amount of personal services income to be attributed to the working person is less than $5,000, or • to the extent to which the services personally performed by the working person are essential support for a product supplied by the associated entity. Penny and Hooper v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 6.8 The top personal rate of 39% when viewed against the trustee and company tax rates (both of which remained at 33% in 2000 following the increase in the top personal rate) also provided an incentive for people who were not employees but who were instead operating small and medium businesses to arrange their affairs so that they avoided paying the 39% rate. 6.9 The most well-known of these cases, Penny and Hooper v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 19 (referred to onwards as Penny and Hooper), concerned two orthopaedic surgeons who had both previously operated their surgery practices as sole traders – and who both (independently of one another) switched to operating their practices through a company they had incorporated before the increase in the top personal tax rate from 33% to 39%. Once the increase in the top personal tax rate took effect, each of the surgeons received a salary from his company that was well below the amount of income he had earned previously and was found to be well below market rates. The balance of the annual net income derived by each company from its surgery practice was distributed to the surgeon’s family trust and taxed at the trustee rate of 33%. The effect of this arrangement was to avoid paying the top-up tax of six cents in the dollar. 6.10 Having been introduced in 2000, the personal services attribution rule was in place during the income years that were at issue in Penny and Hooper. However, as the personal services attribution rule was introduced for a different purpose (being to address the specific issue with contractors who were similar to employees arranging their affairs to avoid the top personal tax rate), it did not apply to the facts of that specific case. 6.11 The case instead centred around whether the taxpayers’ use of corporate and family trust structures, combined with the “artificially low” salaries was tax avoidance for the purpose of the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1. In its ruling, the Supreme Court recognised there may be legitimate reasons for taxpayers to structure their business affairs using entities such as companies and trusts, but as the salaries were considered “contrived and artificial”, the Court upheld the earlier decision of the Court of Appeal that the arrangements in question were tax avoidance arrangements. Issue 6.12 Now that a new top personal rate has been introduced at 39%, the Government is considering whether the current settings of the personal services attribution rule are still appropriate or if they might need to be updated. 6.13 As part of this, consideration is being given to whether the fundamental rationale and design of the personal services attribution rule should be shifted 19 Penny and Hooper v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2011\] NZSC 95 50 from its original purpose of capturing employment like situations to instead apply more broadly to help to support the integrity of the 39% personal tax rate. This is because there is some concern that the rule in its current form may apply too narrowly, and therefore may not be effectively supporting the 39% personal tax rate as it is too easy for taxpayers to work around the rule. 6.14 There is a risk that taxpayers on the top personal tax rate of 39% will use trusts and companies to obtain a lower tax rate on what is in fact personal services income. This is an issue both for taxpayers providing personal services to a single customer (in which case the personal services attribution rule may apply) and taxpayers providing personal services to multiple customers (in which case the personal services attribution rule will not apply). In both cases, the economic reality is that the taxpayer is performing work and being paid for it – the entity is effectively just a conduit for the taxpayer’s income-earning activity. Consequently, the taxpayer should be taxed on their fee income at the applicable marginal rate. However, the legal structure used allows tax to be paid at the lower corporate rate. As such, there may be grounds in some instances for attributing the personal services income to the individual taxpayer and taxing it at their marginal rate. 6.15 The precedent set by the Supreme Court’s decision in Penny and Hooper covers similar ground to the personal services attribution rule. In some respects, the potential application of the Penny and Hooper precedent is broader than that of the personal services attribution rule, as the former is not constrained by the various threshold tests that limit the scope of the latter. 6.16 At the same time, reliance on the Penny and Hooper precedent has significant limitations from Inland Revenue’s perspective, owing to the fact that it is premised on the application of the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1. In particular the Penny and Hooper precedent will only apply to arrangements where there is an evident purpose of tax avoidance. It is not always obvious whether arrangements have such a purpose, and it can be time consuming and resource intensive to prove that there is one. The general experience has been that, when there is a specific and identifiable situation where avoidance is a concern, it is usually better to have a specific rule that addresses that concern than it is to rely on the general anti-avoidance rule. Further, the policy concern about the derivation of personal services income through companies is not restricted to arrangements with a purpose of tax avoidance. Therefore, it is preferable to have a specific “black letter” rule dealing with personal services rather than relying on section BG 1. 51 CHAPTER 7 Proposal Summary This chapter suggests a number of options for broadening the scope of the personal services attribution rule. If implemented, the changes suggested in this chapter would represent a shift in the focus of the rule from narrowly targeting taxpayers who are similar to employees, towards capturing a wider array of scenarios where an individual may use an associated entity as a conduit for selling their personal services to one or more customers. “80 percent one buyer” rule 7.1 The “80 percent one buyer” rule described in the previous chapter narrowly targets the personal services attribution rule at taxpayers that are dependent on a single customer (and so are closer to employees). However, as also mentioned in that chapter, the problem is not limited to just those taxpayers that are dependent on a single customer. Example 8 illustrates how there might also be an issue when a taxpayer that performs personal services has multiple customers. Example 8: Personal services business with multiple customers Bill is an accountant who is the sole employee and shareholder of his company, A Plus Accounting Ltd. The company pays the 28% corporate tax rate on the income from accounting services provided to clients and pays a salary to Bill of $70,000. Any residual profits are either retained in the company or are made available to Bill as loans. Suggested solution 7.2 In light of this issue, the Government is proposing that the 80 percent one buyer rule be removed altogether. Submissions are invited on this proposal and whether there would be any issues if it proceeds into legislation. 52 Example 9: Effect of removing 80 percent one buyer rule Consider Bill in Example 8. Assuming the 80 percent one buyer rule is removed, the personal services attribution rule would apply so that the income of A Plus Accounting Ltd (the associated entity) is attributed to Bill (the working person). This is because: • During the income year, the buyers (clients) acquire services from the associated entity (A Plus Accounting Ltd). • The services are personally performed by the working person (Bill). • Bill is associated with A Plus Accounting Ltd at the time the services are personally performed by Bill. • More than 80 percent of A Plus Accounting Ltd’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from services that are performed by Bill. • Bill’s net income for the income year – assuming the personal services attribution rule applies to attribute the income of A Plus Accounting Ltd to Bill – is more than $70,000. • Substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive A Plus Accounting Ltd’s total income from personal services (the only business assets of A Plus Accounting Ltd are basic office furniture and equipment, which only cost $20,000 in total, easily below 25 percent of the amount of income A Plus Accounting Ltd derives annually from personal services). “80 percent one natural person supplier” rule 7.3 As described in the previous chapter, the “80 percent one natural person supplier” rule requires that at least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from services that are performed by the working person or a relative of theirs, or some combination thereof. 7.4 In some circumstances, this rule might potentially be seen as too restrictive. Conceivably, there may be another individual (unrelated to the working person from whose efforts most of the associated entity’s income from personal services is derived) whose labour contributes more than 20 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services. There is a question as to whether it is correct from a policy perspective that attribution does not apply even if the associated entity’s income from personal services is mostly derived by the efforts of one person and/or a relative of theirs, simply because the entity’s income from personal services is not almost entirely derived by the person’s and/or a relative’s efforts. This is essentially a question about where the threshold for attribution should be for the level of contribution of the working person, rather than a significant change in intended scope. Suggested solution 7.5 One possible option the Government is considering is lowering the 80 percent threshold for the test to 50 percent. In other words, the personal services attribution rule would apply if the associated entity’s income from personal services is mostly derived by the efforts of one person and/or a relative of 53 theirs, rather than almost all the entity’s income from personal services being derived by the person’s and/or a relative’s efforts. 7.6 Submissions are invited on whether this suggestion is a sensible one, and whether there are any foreseeable problems with it. Substantial business assets test 7.7 As outlined in the previous chapter, the threshold for the substantial business assets test is currently the lower of $75,000 or 25 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services for the income year. This threshold has not changed since the introduction of the personal services attribution rule in 2000. There is a question as to whether the $75,000 threshold in this test should be revised upward so that it is set at a level that more accurately reflects the cost of business assets today. Suggested solution 7.8 The Government suggests two possible options for increasing the threshold: • Option one: The lower of $200,000 or 25 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services for the income year, excluding the cost of passenger or luxury vehicles unless the entity’s business is a transportation business. • Option two: The lower of $150,000 or 25 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services for the income year, excluding the cost of passenger or luxury vehicles unless the entity’s business is a transportation business. 7.9 The suggested exclusion of passenger and luxury vehicles for the purposes of determining whether the cost of the associated entity’s depreciable property exceeds the substantial business assets threshold is in recognition of a number of factors. Namely, vehicles are not always purely business assets; they can cost substantially more than is necessary for a business purpose; and they are often more incidental rather than integral to the work performed by the working person (in that they are how the person travels to the work in a lot of cases, rather than how they do the work). 7.10 Any increase in the threshold will not affect taxpayers whose business assets cost more than 25 percent of their income. The effective threshold will therefore only be greater than $75,000 where the income from personal services for the income year is greater than $300,000. Submissions are invited on whether the suggested thresholds are appropriate, and whether there is a better option for increasing the threshold for the substantial business assets test. Net income of working person test 7.11 For the personal services attribution rule to apply, the working person’s net income for the income year must be more than $70,000. In determining whether the $70,000 threshold is exceeded, it is first assumed that the personal services attribution rule applies to attribute the income of the associated entity to the working person. 7.12 Given the main purpose of a possible expansion of the personal services attribution rule is to ensure the integrity of the top personal tax rate of 39%, some parties may see a rationale for increasing the $70,000 threshold. However, it is noted that a five percent differential still exists between the 33% personal tax rate (which applies to each dollar of income earned between 54 $70,001 and $180,000) and the company tax rate (currently 28%). As such, there may be a tax deferral benefit or incentive in relation to income earned between $70,001 and $180,000. Accordingly, the Government does not propose to increase the $70,000 threshold. However, feedback on this point is welcome. Questions for submitters • Do you agree with the proposed removal of the “80 percent one buyer” test? Why/why not? • Do you agree with the suggested decrease in the threshold for the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test from 80 percent to 50 percent? Why/why not? Can you foresee any problems arising from the suggested change? • Are the suggested thresholds for the substantial business assets test appropriate? Why/why not? • Which of options one and two do you consider to be preferable? Is there another option that you think would be better than either of the thresholds suggested in this chapter? • Do you consider the net income threshold should be increased from $70,000 per year to $180,000?

They provide that the Commissioner sets the economic depreciation rate that applies to an item of depreciable property by issuing a determination under the Tax Administration Act 1994. 1.2 The Commissioner in April 1993 issued Depreciation Determination 1 (DEP 1) and determined the depreciation rates for all depreciable property 1 in the schedule to DEP 1 (Depreciation Schedule). In relation to distribution networks (for example, electricity reticulation (distribution) networks) the Depreciatio n Schedule provides depreciation rates for specified component items (such as poles, switches and cables) and a def ault rate that applies to network items not separately identif ied. It has never included a depreciation rate for an electricity (or any other) distribution network. DEP 1 is based on an assumption that an electricity network itself is not depreciable property, but the components of it are. 1.3 Owners of electricity (and other) distribution networks have been depreciating component items of networks in accordance with the Depreciation Schedule and f or the most part treating the component items as the relevant item of property f or repairs and maintenance purposes since the current rules were introduced on 1 April 1993. This has meant that the cost of installing replacement components has been capitalised and depreciated, rather than deducted as repairs and maintenance. 1.4 Inland Revenue was required to review the correctness of the component approach to electricity distribution networks ref lected in the Depreciatio n Schedule. Following a review of relevant case law, Inland Revenue has concluded that the ‘component items’ approach f ollowed by distribution network owners is not legally correct. 2 For the purposes of the depreciation rules and f or determining whether expenditure on repairs and maintenance is deductible or depreciable, the legally correct position is that a network (and not its component items) is the relevant depreciable property (network interpretation). The network interpretation by extension impacts the approach to the depreciation and repairs and maintenance treatment of all other distribution networks (other examples include telecommunications and gas). Summary of proposals 1.5 Of f icials intend to recommend legislative amendments to change the law to conf irm that the component items approach applies to distribution networks f rom 1 April 1993. The legislative amendments will: • def ine a “distribution network”, and • provide that f or a distribution network: 1 Other than for fixed life intangible property and excluded depreciable property. 2 See Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1999\] 2 NZLR 438 and Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685 and the cases referred to in these decisions. 6 – the items of depreciable property are its component items, as identif ied in a depreciation determination and not the network itself, and – that component items are the relevant items of property f or determining whether repairs and maintenance expenditure is deductible. 1.6 The proposed legislative amendments are likely to have no material impacts on owners of distribution networks. The proposed amendments simply conf irm that the component approach is the correct approach and thus retains that long- standing practice, which has been, f or the most part, consistently applied by owners of distribution networks since 1 April 1993. 1.7 Officials seek your views on whether the proposed amendments are appropriately targeted and whether they could materially impact owners of distribution networks. Inland Revenue’s operational approach 1.8 While the policy proposals described above are considered, it is Inland Revenue’s operational intention to continue to accept returns f rom distribution network owners using component items depreciation rates and treating component items as the relevant item of property for repairs and maintenance purposes.

Any inf ormation withheld will be determined using the Of f icial Inf ormation Act 1982. 7 CHAPTER 2 Historical context and current policy and law Historical context 1894 – 1976: depreciation at Commissioner’s discretion 2.1 A deduction f or depreciation was f irst introduced into the income tax legislatio n in 1894 (applicable f rom 1 April 1893). The provision granted the Commissioner a discretion to allow a deduction f or the depreciation of implements, utensils , or machinery in respect of diminished value by reason of f air wear and tear that could not be made good by repairs, or such assets being rendered obsolete or useless. 2.2 Numerous amendments f ollowed, primarily to allow deductions for obsolescence of plant and equipment and to recapture excess deductions on disposal. The basic structure of the depreciation provision however remained unchanged through to and including the Income Tax Act 1976. 2.3 To f acilitate administration, the Commissioner published a schedule of depreciation rates. The Commissioner periodically added assets and accompanying rates to the schedule to ensure the schedule provided rates for the capital assets being used in the economy. 1987: ESAs enter tax system and Commissioner issues Depreciation Guidelines 2.4 In line with Government policy of bringing public agencies providing goods and services on a commercial basis into the income tax base, electricity supply authorities (ESAs), the owners of electricity distribution networks, became subject to income tax f rom 1 April 1987. 3 2.5 On entering the income tax base, ESAs f aced the problem of not being able to establish, for depreciation purposes, the cost and adjusted tax-values of the component assets of their networks. This arose, in large part, because ESAs had not previously needed to maintain taxation based fixed assets registers. In response to the problem, the Commissioner in 1987, provided comprehensive depreciation guidelines to ESAs. The guidelines provided that the component assets of an electricity distribution network f ell into two groups – assets owned on 31 March 1987 and assets acquired after that date. 2.6 For assets owned on 31 March 1987, the Commissioner permitted the use of a globo (pool) accounting method under which separate assets were pooled and treated as one. This method allowed ESAs to treat the entirety of an existing network as a single asset (at a value agreed by the Commissioner) and to depreciate the single asset over a 20-year period on a straight-line basis. 2.7 For assets acquired after 31 March 1987, ESAs were required to calculate depreciation for each component item at the depreciation rates set out in the guidelines. This treatment f or assets acquired af ter 31 March 1987 was in line with the policy position that component items of networks have dif f erent economic lives and that a component items approach provides a more accurate 3 The 29 electricity distribution businesses currently operating in New Zealand are (in broad term s) descended from electricity supply authorities, which were corporatised (under electricity sector reforms in the early 1990s) with effect from 1 April 1993. 8 measure of economic depreciation than a globo/pool approach, due to the dif f iculty of estimating the usef ul lif e of an electricity network. 1987 – 1993: review of depreciation 2.8 The Government in December 1987 announced the Commissioner was going to undertake a review of depreciation rates, which had not been comprehensively reviewed since 1957. The Commissioner commenced the review. However, it was placed on hold pending the outcome of the Valabh Committee’s review of depreciation (which did not include the review of rates) as part of the Committee’s wider review of the income tax system. 2.9 The Valabh Committee in its February 1991 discussion paper 4 recommended depreciation be a statutory entitlement and that a comprehensive statutory depreciation regime should be enacted. It recommended that the statutory regime provide a definition of depreciable property, specify the permitted depreciation methods, provide that depreciation rates align with economic rates of depreciation, and that depreciation rates be set by the Commissioner. The Committee also recommended that repairs and maintenance be subject to the ordinary deductibility provisions of the Act and not a specif ic provision. 2.10 In its paper, the Committee noted that the Commissioner employed a wide range of depreciation methods in determining annual depreciation allowances, including the “pool asset” or “globo accounting method” aimed predominantly at low value assets of less than $1,000 per asset. It also noted that most of the pool accounts covered assets with similar economic lives, but ESAs were being allowed to maintain globo accounts containing assets with dif f ering economic lives and with per asset values exceeding $1,000. 2.11 The Government in the 1991 Budget accepted the Valabh Committee’s recommendations. It announced it would legislate to introduce a depreciatio n regime and that it did not wish to hold up the Commissioner’s comprehensive review of rates. 2.12 The Commissioner resumed the review of depreciation rates, and a new depreciation schedule was developed. In December 1992, Inland Revenue released a draft of the new schedule f or consultation. As a result of consultation, minor amendments were made to the schedule, and it was finalised as the schedule to DEP 1 (that is, the Depreciation Schedule). 1993 to the present 2.13 The current depreciation rules came into force on 1 April 1993. They are in subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 2007 and in sections 91AAF – 91AAM of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2.14 Key features of the depreciation rules: • Def initions of what is, and what is not, depreciable property. • Depreciable property is defined as property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is being used, or is available f or use, in deriving income. 4 Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital Tax Accounting Issues (31 January 1991). 9 • Taxpayers have an amount of depreciation loss (a statutory entitlement) f or an item of depreciable property for an income year unless they elect the property is not depreciable. • The amount of depreciation loss is calculated by reference to the value or cost of an item of depreciable property and the economic depreciation rate that applies to a kind of item of depreciable property. • The economic depreciation rate for a kind of item of depreciable property is calculated by reference to the item’s estimated useful (economic) life. • The permitted depreciation methods are the diminishing value method, the straight-line method, and the pool method. • Rules f or calculating amounts of depreciation loss under the three depreciation methods. • An item of depreciable property must have a value of $5000 or less to be included in a pool (unless a higher value is set in a determination). • The globo method is not permitted as a depreciation method f or an item of depreciable property unless the item was accounted for at the end of 1992-93 income year using this method – with the Commissioner’s permission. • The Commissioner sets economic depreciation rates from time to time by f ollowing specif ied procedures and issuing a determination under section 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994. • The depreciation determinations are secondary legislation under section 91AAF(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. • Taxpayers may apply to the Commissioner for the issue of a determination allowing them to use for an item of depreciable property: – a special rate higher or lower than the economic rate set by the Commissioner under section 91AAF f or the item, or – a provisional rate when no applicable rate, other than a default rate, has been set in a determination under section 91AAF. • Taxpayers may apply to the Commissioner for the issue of a determination allowing them a maximum pooling value f or an item of depreciable property greater than the value currently available to them. • Taxpayers may dispute and challenge a determination of a special rate or a provisional rate. 2.15 The Commissioner on 5 April 1993 issued DEP 1 and determined the basic depreciation rates for items of depreciable property to be the rates specified in the Depreciation Schedule. The Commissioner has issued more than 100 f urther general depreciation determinations, which amend the Depreciation Schedule. It specifies depreciation rates for specified component items of electricity (and other) distribution networks. The Depreciation Schedule has never included a depreciation rate f or an electricity (or any other type of ) distribution network. 10 Network interpretation 2.16 As discussed in paragraph 1.4, Inland Revenue has recently concluded that for distribution networks, the ‘component items’ approach reflected in the Depreciation Schedule is not legally correct. 5 Accordingly, f or the purposes of the depreciation rules and f or determining whether expenditure on repairs and maintenance is deductible, a distribution network (and not its components) is the relevant asset. 2.17 Under the network interpretation the existence of a rate for an item in the Depreciation Schedule does not identify the item as depreciable property. Instead, the identif ication of depreciable property is determined by applying the “combined asset versus component item” approach from case law. This approach concentrates on identif ying “what is the asset” by determining whether an item is connected to or separate from a larger asset. If the item is connected to a larger asset, the larger asset (and not its component items) is the relevant asset for depreciation purposes and for determining whether expenditure on repairs and maintenance is deductible. 2.18 The network interpretation by extension impacts the approach to the depreciation and repairs and maintenance treatment of other networks – such as telecommunications and gas. Issues with network interpretation 2.19 The network interpretation can operate successf ully and coherently as an approach to the tax treatment of network expenditure. Of f icials understand that it is the approach taken in Australia, f or instance. However, it has a number of drawbacks, particularly in the current New Zealand context. 2.20 Identif ying an appropriate rate f or a distribution network is dif f icult. With regular repairs and maintenance, the physical lif e of a network could be indef inite, and thus the economic lif e is more likely to be constrained by factors of obsolescence or technical advance. These f actors are long term and dif f icult to predict, making identif ication of the usef ul lif e problematic. Components of a network are likely to have a much more predictable economic lif e, which allows the depreciation rate for them to be more accurate. The component items approach therefore provides a more accurate measure of economic depreciation than a network approach. 2.21 Turning to the particular New Zealand context, there are two f actors in favour of a component approach. First it is simpler to continue with the component items approach, since components have shorter lives and rates have already been identified for components. 2.22 Second, transitioning to a network interpretation would also raise some signif icant and dif f icult tax issues f or electricity distribution network owners and the Government. In relation to networks already owned, the historical use of the component interpretation is likely to mean that the tax book value of networks is understated as compared to the tax book value that would have resulted had the network interpretation always been applied. Even though the network interpretation gives rise to greater deductions for on-going expenditure in relation to a network already owned, this ef f ect is likely to be smaller than the effect of the higher depreciation rates under a component approach. Allowing owners to simply shif t to the network interpretation without 5 See Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1999\] 2 NZLR 438 and Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685 and the cases referred to in these decisions. 11 recognising this understatement would mean an inappropriate pattern of deductions f or network expenditure (including both acquisition and on-going costs). These difficulties are avoided by retaining the component items approach. 2.23 There may also be other practical dif f iculties which of f icials are not aware of arising f rom changing the current tax treatment by network owners of their network expenditure. 12 CHAPTER 3 Proposals 3.1 Of f icials intend to recommend legislative amendments to conf irm the component items approach to distribution networks that has applied in practice since 1 April 1993. The legislative amendments, which are intended to apply retrospectively f rom 1 April 1993, will: • def ine a “distribution network”, and • provide that f or a distribution network: – the items of depreciable property are its component items and not the network itself, and – component items are the relevant items of property for determining whether repairs and maintenance expenditure is deductible. Definition of distribution network 3.2 Of f icials propose that a def inition of “distribution network” be inserted into section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3.3 It is proposed that the def inition would cover electricity networks as well as gas, telecommunications and water networks. Def initions of each of these networks could be based on those in existing legislation including: • Electricity Act 1992 • Electricity Industry Act 2010 • Gas Act 1992 • Telecommunications Act 2001 • Water Services Act 2021 Identification of network components 3.4 Amending the legislation to conf irm that the assets of distribution network owners are components rather than the network would not in itself provide statutory guidance as to the identif ication of components and the appropriate level of itemisation. 3.5 The Depreciation Schedule currently contains depreciation rates f or various specif ied component items of distribution networks (and a def ault rate f or items not separately identif ied). The long-standing in-practice acceptance of the specified component items suggests the current identification and itemisation of components are appropriate. The Depreciation Schedule, however, can be changed, through determinations, to ensure that depreciation rates are provided f or the relevant and appropriate component items. If taxpayers and the Commissioner disagree on what are the relevant and appropriate component items (and depreciation rates), this can be resolved through the challenge procedure. 3.6 We welcome submissions as to how much guidance should be provided by the legislation as to what component assets must be identif ied. 13 Application date and savings provisions 3.7 Of f icials understand that the vast majority of owners of distribution networks have always applied a component items approach f or purposes of both depreciation and repairs and maintenance. The proposals in this document should have no impact on them other than conf irming their longstanding treatment. A commencement date of 1 April 1993 would require related changes to the Income Tax Act 1976, 1994, 2004 and 2007. Networks already applying the network approach 3.8 Of f icials are aware of the possibility that a small number of distribution network owners may be applying a network approach f or the purpose of identif ying repairs and maintenance expenditure. This could only be achieved by identif ying dif f erent assets f or, on one hand, repairs and maintenance purposes and, on the other hand, f or depreciation purposes or by applying the def ault rate to depreciate a network. Neither of these approaches is consistent with the intended operation of the relevant provisions. 3.9 If the law is changed with ef f ect f rom 1 April 1993 this would leave previous returns f rom these network owners as non-compliant. However, the majority of income tax returns since 1993 are now time-barred and any remaining non- time barred returns would need to be considered by the Commissioner as to whether resources should be allocated to amending these positions. 3.10 For the reasons set out in the two paragraphs above, officials do not propose a savings provision f or network owners in this situation. However, we welcome submissions on any specific circumstances where f urther consideration may be worthwhile. We also welcome submissions on any transitional provisions that may be necessary to support these taxpayers. Consultation 3.11 Officials seek your views on whether the proposed amendments are appropriately targeted and whether they could materially impact owners of distribution networks.

This is known as an input tax deduction. However, where an asset is used for both business use (known as taxable use) and non-taxable use (that is, private use or making exempt supplies, such as financial services or residential accommodation), the person can only deduct a percentage of the total input tax. The percentage that is deductible is based on the person’s estimate of the percentage of taxable use. Consequently, GST is collected on the non-taxable use of an asset by denying a portion of the input tax deduction. This is known as apportionment. 1.3 Once a taxpayer has apportioned their input tax deduction based on their estimated taxable use, they are required to monitor their actual use of the asset over time. If the actual use differs from the estimated use, the taxpayer must account for this difference annually in their GST return. This is known as an adjustment or change in use. Issues with the current apportionment and adjustment rules 1.4 We understand there are two main issues with how GST applies to assets that are used in a GST-registered business and also for non-taxable use (private use or to make exempt supplies). 1.5 First, the current GST apportionment and adjustment rules are complex and have high compliance costs. They require the registered person to monitor whether they use any of their business assets for non-taxable use and to make annual adjustments if there has been any change of use. 1.6 Second, unexpected liabilities and compliance costs can arise because GST applies to private assets that have some business use and are owned by a GST- registered person. 1.7 The GST system does not tax most private assets, such as dwellings. This is because they are not part of a registered person’s taxable activity (that is, their business). However, some private assets may also be used by a GST-registered person to make taxable supplies. For example, a GST-registered contractor may work from a home office, or a GST-registered person may own a holiday home they stay in but which they also rent as a taxable supply of guest accommodation. In such cases, the use, and disposal, of the private asset may be in the course and furtherance of the registered person’s taxable activity. This can lead to a GST liability or adjustment if the asset is sold or there is a decreased percentage of taxable use of the asset. The GST liability on a dwelling or land can be significant as land is a high-value, appreciating asset that is often held for long periods before disposal. 1.8 We understand that many registered persons are unaware that GST consequences can arise if their dwelling is partly used to make taxable supplies. Consequently, they are not accounting for GST on their dwelling on its disposal. 6 1.9 The issue with dwellings only arises if the dwelling is owned by a GST-registered person who uses the dwelling for both a taxable and a non-taxable use. Under slightly different fact scenarios, such as when the GST-registered person does not own the dwelling (for example, the GST-registered business is a company or partnership, or the house is owned by a company or trust that is not registered for GST), there may be no need to apportion or account for GST on disposal. The current rules may therefore impose higher liabilities and compliance costs on some taxpayers when compared to those imposed on other taxpayers in similar situations. 1.10 The current GST apportionment and adjustment rules may create uncertainty, complexity, unintended consequences, or undue compliance costs. This issues paper seeks input on these issues and various reform options that could mitigate the issues and simplify the application of the rules. One constraint is that the reform options should not undermine the overall purpose of the GST system, which is a simple, broad-based tax on the private consumption of goods and services by New Zealand consumers. 1.11 We consider the best way to simplify the apportionment and adjustment rules is to target their application. 1.12 The main reform options proposed in this issues paper are intended to substantially reduce the number of registered persons who are required to apportion GST on their business or private assets. To address some of the gaps and weaknesses in each option, a reform package, with a combination of potential solutions, may be required. On the other hand, some of the options discussed in this issues paper may increase the complexity of GST by creating new boundaries and definitions, so these may not be progressed if alternative options are simpler or more effective. 1.13 Apportionment and adjustment rules may still be required for high-value business assets that are clearly used to make taxable supplies while also having a significant amount of non-taxable use. This issues paper discusses options for reducing compliance costs for these assets, such as reducing the need to closely monitor their use and make annual adjustments. Summary of reform options 1.14 Chapter 2 discusses an option that would enable registered persons to elect to exclude certain capital assets from their taxable activity. These excluded assets would not be subject to GST. This would provide the same GST outcome as the situation where an asset is purchased by an unregistered person, such as an unregistered shareholder of a business, rather than directly by the GST- registered business itself. This chapter also proposes two potential integrity measures that would apply to assets included in a registered person’s taxable activity at the time of acquisition. These measures would better ensure GST was properly accounted for when the taxable activity ceased or the assets were sold. 1.15 Chapter 3 discusses rounding-based options for removing most assets from the apportionment and adjustment rules. They include: • A principal purpose test for assets purchased for less than $5,000 (GST exclusive). • A 20 percent de minimis. If the registered person’s taxable use of the asset was less than 20 percent, the asset would be regarded as non- taxable. No input tax deduction could be claimed on purchase and no GST would be accounted for on disposal. 7 • An 80 percent rounding-up rule. Assets with 80 percent or more taxable use would be deemed to have 100 percent taxable use. This would allow a full input tax deduction for most business assets with only small amounts of non-taxable use. • Input tax deductions would still be apportioned on assets purchased for $5,000 or more (GST exclusive) with between 20 percent and 80 percent taxable use. However, a 20 percent change threshold is proposed to ensure adjustments would only be made if a major change in use occurred. For example, if the initial taxable use was 66%, an adjustment would only be made if the taxable use fell below 46% or increased above 86%. 1.16 GST apportionment issues arise when the same premises are used to make a combination of supplies of commercial guest accommodation and private use or residential rental. The GST treatment in such cases depends on the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”, which can overlap and be uncertain. Chapter 4 seeks submissions on potential options for improving these definitions. 1.17 Chapter 5 discusses another potential reform option that would involve developing a new set of special rules for house sales. The special rules could make house sales (including owner-occupied houses, residential rental properties and holiday homes) by a registered person who is not a property developer an exempt supply. This would require new definitions and could add complexity and uncertainty to the GST rules for land. We are therefore interested in submitters’ views on whether other reform options, such as the election discussed in chapter 2, may be a simpler or more effective way to remove mainly private dwellings from the GST system. 1.18 Chapter 6 discusses some potential rules for applying GST to land that is developed and sold by property developers. This includes an option of allowing a full input tax deduction for land that a registered person commenced developing with the intention to sell as a taxable supply. This would be bolstered by some integrity rules to manage the fiscal risk that can arise when a GST- registered person claims an input tax deduction for purchasing land because of an initial intention to develop the land, but the land is not subsequently developed or sold. Under any of the proposals discussed in this issues paper, land that was developed and sold by a GST-registered property developer would remain a taxable supply subject to GST on sale. 1.19 Chapter 7 discusses a range of minor or incremental ways to reduce compliance costs in those cases where apportionment would still be required. This includes expanding eligibility to use the “wash-up” rule and reducing the required number of adjustment periods to allow the use of an asset to be monitored for fewer years. 1.20 We invite submissions on the various options proposed – in particular, their design, effectiveness and compliance costs. We also welcome submissions on any alternative options submitters may identify. How to make a submission 1.21 Submissions are invited on the proposed reform options in this issues paper. 1.22 Your submission should include a brief summary of your main points and recommendations.

Questions for submitters • In your view, what are the problems with the GST apportionment and adjustment rules? • Have we identified the correct range of policy reform options to focus on? Are there other options we should consider? 9 CHAPTER 2 Election to exclude assets from a registered person’s taxable activity 2.1 Some dwellings (and other mainly private assets) are owned by GST-registered persons who use part of the asset (such as a home office) to conduct their business of making taxable supplies. Under the current GST rules, this can lead to unexpected liabilities and compliance costs. 2.2 One option that could address this issue would be to allow GST-registered persons to elect to treat the affected assets as being separate from their taxable activity. The design and impacts of this election method are discussed in this chapter. 2.3 This chapter also proposes two potential integrity measures. The first would involve requiring registered persons to provide information to Inland Revenue if they acquire land, aircraft or pleasure craft that they intend to use to make taxable supplies. The second would apply if a registered person had claimed taxable use when acquiring an asset and would clarify that the future disposal of that asset would be deemed to be a taxable supply made in the course or furtherance of the registered person’s taxable activity. Allowing registered persons to elect to exclude an asset 2.4 The UK’s and Singapore’s GST rules allow GST-registered persons to elect to exclude an asset from their taxable activity (and therefore ensure the asset is not subject to GST) by not claiming input tax deductions for the purchase of the asset. New Zealand could consider introducing a similar rule. 2.5 The proposed election would allow GST-registered owners of private and appreciating assets (such as home offices or holiday homes) to treat these assets as being separate from their taxable activity at the time of purchase. This means they would be unable to claim GST input tax deductions on the purchase of, or capital improvements to, the asset, and they would not return GST when they disposed of the asset. 2.6 This would provide the same GST outcome as the situation where an asset is purchased by an unregistered person, such as an unregistered shareholder of a business, rather than directly by the GST-registered business itself. In these circumstances, the purchaser of the asset cannot deduct GST input tax on the purchase of the asset and does not account for GST output tax on any subsequent disposal – their purchase is the final consumption. 2.7 We propose that the election should only be available for assets held on capital account (which could include goods, land or intangible assets). The sale of revenue account property, such as trading stock, would normally relate to the registered person’s core business or taxable activity so should remain a taxable supply on sale or disposal. 2.8 We also propose that a registered person would be unable to make the election for an asset they had acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 2.9 The effectiveness of such an election option would ultimately depend on the extent to which the affected registered persons chose to adopt it. If the majority made the election, this could reduce compliance costs and remove GST 10 liabilities on private assets. However, if the number of registered persons making the election was low, the compliance costs and liabilities would remain. 2.10 We expect it is already a common practice to not claim an input tax deduction for the purchase of, or capital improvements to, a dwelling (even though part of the house, such as a home office, may be used to make taxable supplies). If this is accurate, the proposed election should mean most registered person’s houses would be excluded from their taxable activity. An election option could also allow GST-registered persons to choose to exclude their capital asset of a holiday home or apartment from being part of their taxable activity, while still applying GST to their taxable supplies of short-term accommodation services. 2.11 Under the proposed election option, if the registered person claimed GST input tax deductions for a portion of the operating or holding costs of owning a house (such as insurance, local authority rates or utilities) to the extent that these services were used to make taxable supplies, this would not automatically lead to the house being regarded as part of the person’s taxable activity. Only if the registered person had claimed a GST input tax deduction for the purchase of, or capital improvements to, the dwelling would it be a taxable supply when sold. 2.12 In addition to dwellings and holiday homes, some registered persons may also prefer not to claim input tax deductions on other types of land or appreciating assets. This is because this would remove any future obligation to charge and return GST output tax if they subsequently disposed of the asset. 2.13 However, other registered persons may not intend to dispose of the asset and therefore may still prefer to claim an input tax deduction on purchase. This may be because the initial deduction for their taxable use of the asset would exceed their expected compliance costs from the apportionment rules. Others may simply prefer the upfront cashflow benefit of claiming a GST input tax deduction (or from paying a GST-exclusive price) at the time they purchase the asset, as this can then be used to help fund their business. 2.14 For depreciating assets such as vehicles, it seems likely that most registered persons would prefer to continue to claim input tax deductions to the extent the asset is used to make taxable supplies. This is because any corresponding output tax liability on the disposal of the depreciating asset would be less than the input tax claimed on purchase. Applying the election to purchases of zero-rated land and going concerns 2.15 For most capital assets, the registered person would exercise the proposed election by choosing not to deduct input tax for the purchase price of the asset (or any subsequent capital improvements to the asset) at the time these were purchased or used to make taxable supplies. 2.16 However, some assets may have been zero-rated (that is, 0% GST was charged by the vendor) at the time they were acquired because they involved a business-to-business supply of land or a supply of business assets as a going concern. Land that will be used as a principal place of residence for the purchaser, or a close relative, is not a zero-rated supply. 2.17 For assets that were acquired as zero-rated purchases, if the purchaser wanted to elect to remove the asset from their taxable activity, they would be required to make an adjustment to return output tax of 15% of the zero-rated purchase price. This 15% output tax adjustment would ensure the purchaser incurred the same GST cost as that incurred where the same asset was not purchased to make taxable supplies or was purchased by an unregistered person. 11 2.18 We note that a GST-registered purchaser of zero-rated land is already required to make an output tax adjustment for any non-taxable use of the land under section 20(3J) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act). The proposed election would simply require the purchaser to make an output tax adjustment for the full purchase price of the land (rather than for the percentage of expected non-taxable use) to exclude the land from their taxable activity. 2.19 This requirement to make an output tax adjustment on purchases of zero-rated assets could represent a significant upfront tax liability. It would also require the registered person to make an active choice to return GST output tax for any taxable use, rather than the passive choice of simply not claiming an input tax deduction. This could reduce the number of registered persons who make the election for zero-rated assets. 2.20 On the other hand, in most cases where the supply of an asset is zero-rated, this is because the asset is predominantly used as a business asset. In these cases, it seems an appropriate policy outcome for the asset to remain part of the registered person’s taxable activity (assuming they did not make an output tax adjustment). Retrospective application date 2.21 We recognise that, for the proposed reforms to be effective, a retrospective application date may be needed, such as 1 April 2011. This would accommodate GST positions that some of the affected registered persons may have already taken for assets they have disposed of before the enactment of any proposed reforms. 2.22 A retrospective application date would mean that if a registered person had previously taken a tax position consistent with the proposed election option (such as regarding a dwelling as not being part of their taxable activity even though it may have been partly used to make taxable supplies), this tax position would become correct. 2.23 A savings provision may also be necessary to preserve tax positions taken in accordance with the current GST law. Transitioning pre-application date assets 2.24 A transitional rule may also need to be considered to allow affected registered persons to apply the proposed new election option to pre-reform assets they had purchased before the application date of the election (assuming it was enacted). 2.25 A potential transitional rule could apply to assets purchased before 1 April 2023 (assuming the relevant legislation was enacted in early 2023 and applied from this date). The transitional rule would allow a registered person who has claimed input tax deductions for the purchase of, or capital expenditure on, an asset before 1 April 2023 to notify Inland Revenue that they were electing to exclude the asset from their taxable activity. They would then have to return output tax equal to those input tax deductions in their next GST return. We propose a 12-month period between 1 April 2023 and 1 April 2024 during which 12 such registered persons could apply this transitional rule to assets purchased before to 1 April 2023. 1 2.26 The main disadvantage of this proposed transitional rule is that it could create negative cashflow issues because the repayment of the input tax would need to be funded by the registered person. We acknowledge that this could reduce the adoption, and effectiveness, of the transitional rule. We expect it would mainly be used when the registered person was planning to sell or dispose of an asset that had appreciated in value. Disclosure of information about high-value land, pleasure craft or aircraft 2.27 Under the current GST rules, a person can register for GST because they have an intention to develop a property or use a high-value asset to conduct a taxable activity, and they can then claim GST input tax deductions on the purchase of the land or asset. Sometimes, however, the person’s plans change, and the property development or other taxable activity is abandoned before it starts. In such cases, the person is required to deregister for GST and pay output tax on disposal of their assets. However, this relies on the person self- assessing their tax at a time when they may no longer be in business or using a tax advisor or accountant. The result is that often no output tax is accounted for on disposal of the assets. 2.28 To help mitigate this fiscal risk, we propose that registered persons be required to notify Inland Revenue when they acquire certain high-value assets and provide certain information. This proposed information disclosure rule would apply when a registered person: • acquires land, a pleasure craft 2 (for example, a yacht or launch) or an aircraft for an amount of consideration exceeding $150,000 (GST exclusive), and • intends to use the high-value asset to make taxable supplies, and • does not make the proposed election (discussed above) to treat the asset as being separate from their taxable activity. 2.29 The information disclosed could include the amount of consideration paid for the asset, the initial amount of GST input tax deducted on purchase (or the nominal GST amount that would otherwise have been charged if the asset was purchased from another registered person as a zero-rated supply of land or a going concern) and a statement of how the asset will be used to make taxable supplies. 2.30 This type of information could assist Inland Revenue to better monitor and promote compliance by registered persons who have previously claimed large GST input tax deductions (or acquired zero-rated land) but no longer appear to be proceeding with, or carrying on, a taxable activity (for example, they have been continuously filing GST returns with no or low sales). 1 This proposed rule would be like the temporary elections that were previously available under sections 5(19) (which applied to dwellings not principally used to make taxable supplies) and 20(3KB) (which applied to assets not used in a non-profit body’s taxable activity) of the GST Act. These elections provided asset owners with one or two years to repay input tax deductions previously claimed on the asset so that GST output tax would not apply to a subsequent disposal of those assets. 2 ‘Pleasure craft’ is already used in section 11 of the GST Act and adopts the meaning set out in section 2 of the Maritime Transport Act 1994. 13 2.31 In cases where a registered person is regularly buying and selling land as part of their taxable activity of selling land, the compliance costs of requiring GST information to be disclosed each time they purchase land could outweigh their risk of non-compliance. For this reason, there could be an exception to the disclosure requirement for certain GST-registered persons. We are interested in submissions on the best way to identify low-risk registered persons who could be excluded from the proposed requirement. One possibility is to exclude GST- registered persons or GST groups who have made taxable supplies (sales) of land of more than $5 million in a 12-month period. 2.32 The information disclosure requirement proposed above would be more targeted than the requirement in Australia’s GST system, which requires all GST-registered persons to report on the total value of their capital purchases in their activity statements (GST returns). 2.33 The proposed information disclosure requirement would apply prospectively to assets purchased after a certain date. Deeming the disposal of an asset to be a taxable supply 2.34 In general, supplies of goods or services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity are taxable supplies. This includes selling or otherwise disposing of assets used by the registered person in their taxable activity. 2.35 In cases where a registered person never commenced a taxable activity or ceased their taxable activity many years ago, they should have made an output tax adjustment for such assets at the time their taxable activity was abandoned or ceased. They may not have done so because they were unaware of their obligations or because they believed they were still carrying on, or intending to commence, a taxable activity. They may also fail to return GST when they sell or dispose of the relevant assets. 2.36 To reduce this risk, we propose that when a registered person purchases an asset they intend to use to make taxable supplies, the future disposal of that asset would be deemed to be a taxable supply made in the course or furtherance of the registered person’s taxable activity. This rule would only apply where the registered person did not elect to treat the asset as separate from their taxable activity under the proposed election option (discussed above) or had not previously made an output tax adjustment to account for the fact the asset was no longer being used to make taxable supplies. 2.37 This proposal would make it clear that a registered person is required to return output tax on the disposal of assets they previously considered would be used to make taxable supplies, even if they no longer have a taxable activity or if their taxable activity never commenced in the first place. This would align with the proposed election option discussed above as the output tax position on disposal would depend on whether the registered person had claimed an input tax deduction on the purchase of the asset. 2.38 This proposed deeming rule would effectively broaden the existing deeming rule in section 5(16) of the GST Act that currently applies to dwellings for which a registered person has claimed an input tax deduction. A similar rule would therefore apply to all types of assets (including purchases of zero-rated land and going concerns). The proposed deeming rule would also be similar to the existing deeming rule in section 20(3K). That section applies to assets acquired by non-profit bodies and deems the relevant assets to have been acquired in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the non-profit body and therefore subject to GST on disposal. 14 2.39 This proposed new deeming rule could apply to assets disposed of on or after 1 April 2023 (assuming the relevant legislation was enacted in early 2023 and applied from this date). Questions for submitters • What are the current practices of registered persons? How do they account for GST on dwellings and other mainly private assets? • What are the potential impacts of introducing an election to allow registered persons to exclude an asset from their taxable activity? Are there other options we should consider instead? • What type of assets should be eligible for the proposed election? • How should the proposed election apply to past GST positions and assets acquired before the proposed reform? • What are the potential impacts of the proposed requirement to provide information to Inland Revenue about acquisitions of high-value land, pleasure craft and aircraft? What is the best way to identify low-risk taxpayers who could be excluded from this requirement? • What are the potential impacts of the proposed rule deeming a disposal to be a taxable supply? Would it improve compliance? • Are there other options for improving GST compliance on land and other high- value assets we should consider instead? 15 CHAPTER 3 De minimis and other rounding options 3.1 The current GST apportionment and adjustment rules generally require GST- registered persons to monitor their business assets for any private or exempt use and to make an annual adjustment for any change of use. This has high compliance costs. 3.2 This chapter discusses some potential policy reforms aimed at reducing the need, in most circumstances, for a registered person to closely monitor the percentage of taxable use and to make an annual adjustment. Principal purpose test for low-value assets 3.3 The current apportionment rules apply to any asset that is not 100 percent used to make taxable supplies. 3.4 Many low-value business assets, such as smartphones, computers and tools, may have a minor amount of private use that needs to be monitored and accounted for under the current apportionment rules. This results in high compliance costs for little GST revenue benefit. 3.5 To reduce these compliance costs, we propose that a new principal purpose test could apply to assets purchased for less than $5,000 (excluding GST). If such an asset was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, a full input tax deduction could be claimed and there would be no requirement to apportion or make GST adjustments. If such an asset was not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, no input tax deduction could be claimed. 3.6 This test would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by reducing the number of assets subject to the apportionment and adjustment rules. A GST adjustment would only be made if the principal purpose the asset was acquired for changed (which should be uncommon). A change from a taxable to non-taxable purpose would require an output tax adjustment to repay the input tax previously deducted on purchase, while a change from non-taxable to taxable purpose would allow a deduction to be claimed for the input tax incurred when the asset was purchased. 3.7 A principal purpose test would be much less accurate than the current apportionment rules. Some private use of relevant business assets could be undertaxed, and some business use of private assets could be overtaxed. However, with a $5,000 threshold, the maximum GST adjustment would be $750 per asset. This may be an acceptable loss of accuracy when compared with the potential compliance cost savings. 3.8 Furthermore, some GST-registered persons may already be claiming full input tax deductions on low-value work assets, rather than applying the apportionment and adjustment rules. This may be because the non-taxable use is minimal, or because they think the pre-2011 principal purpose test still applies. 3.9 This proposed principal purpose test would apply to low-value assets purchased on or after 1 April 2023 (assuming the relevant legislation was enacted in early 2023 and applied from this date). This is because, for assets acquired for less than $5,000 before this date, GST-registered persons would already have 16 estimated an initial expected taxable use percentage on acquisition and the existing $5,000 de minimis in section 21(2)(b) of the GST Act means no further adjustments would be performed unless the asset was sold or disposed of. In these circumstances, the compliance costs of transitioning all existing low-value assets into the proposed new principal purpose test would be higher than continuing with the current rules for those assets. No adjustments for less than 20 percent change in use 3.10 For assets purchased for $5,000 or more (excluding GST), we propose that an adjustment would only be made if the difference between the estimated taxable use (or previous actual use) and the actual taxable use exceeded a 20 percent threshold. 3 For example, if an asset had an initial apportionment of 66 percent business use, then an adjustment would only be made if the business use dropped below 46 percent (−20 percent) or increased above 86 percent (+20 percent). 3.11 A 20 percent threshold has been proposed as we understand that a deliberate change in use of an asset has likely occurred, rather than an unintended change, where a registered person experiences a 20 percent change in use of an asset. Consequently, a 20 percent threshold should remove most compliance costs associated with closely monitoring and maintaining records on the use of each asset and making adjustments each year. 3.12 In cases where an asset had a more than 20 percent reduction in taxable use, the registered person could face a potentially large output tax liability in their next GST return, which could create cashflow difficulties. Similar cashflow difficulties can already arise in other situations, such as when a person deregisters from GST or when the wash-up rule in section 21FB of the GST Act has applied to require an output tax adjustment – although these situations are more within a registered person’s control. 20 percent de minimis and rounding up 3.13 In theory, a registered person should try to accurately estimate their percentage of taxable use and then claim that percentage of input tax deductions to reduce the likelihood of requiring an adjustment. However, the proposed 20 percent threshold above may encourage “cherry-picking”, whereby registered persons may claim a higher percentage of taxable use for depreciating assets and a lower percentage for appreciating assets that they intend to eventually sell (such as land). 3.14 For example, a registered person with more than 80 percent taxable use of an asset may prefer to claim 100 percent of their input tax deduction and rely on the 20 percent threshold to support this larger tax deduction. A different registered person with less than 20 percent taxable use of an appreciating asset (such as land) may prefer to claim they have 0 percent taxable use and rely on the 20 percent threshold to disregard their taxable use, so they do not need to return output tax when they dispose of the land. 3 A 10 percent threshold for adjustments exists under the current apportionment rules, but this can only be used if the actual adjustment would be less than $1,000. This means the existing rule only allows a full 10 percent change in use if the actual asset was purchased for less than $76,666. For assets valued above this, the threshold is less than 10 percent. Under this proposal, the $1,000 limitation would be removed, and a more generous threshold of 20 percent would be introduced. 17 3.15 For this reason, it may be simpler and more consistent to bolster the 20 percent threshold with mandatory rules for assets that are more than 80 percent used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes. These rules could include: • A new 20 percent de minimis. If the taxable use of an asset is 20 percent or less, then the asset would be deemed to be non-taxable when used or disposed of by the registered person. This would mean no input tax deduction on purchase of the relevant asset or output tax on its disposal. • Rounding up to 100 percent taxable use where an asset is used 80 percent or more to make taxable supplies. • Registered persons with assets used between 21 to 79 percent for taxable use would continue to apply the existing apportionment and adjustment rules to claim input tax deductions on the basis of their estimated intended taxable use percentage. However, subsequent adjustments would only be required if the percentage use changes by plus or minus 20 percentage points (as per the 20 percent threshold outlined above). 3.16 These proposals are summarised in Table 1. Table 1: Summary of proposals Percentage estimated or actual taxable use Percentage used for GST purposes 0 to 20 percent 0 percent (de minimis) 21 to 79 percent The estimated intended taxable use percentage, with subsequent adjustments only required if the percentage use changes by plus or minus 20 percentage points 80 to 100 percent 100 percent (rounding up) 3.17 Canada’s GST rules follow a similar approach to the above table for apportioning GST inputs on real property (land and buildings), except they use a 10 percent threshold, rather than 20 percent. In Canada, any taxable use of a building of less than 10 percent is treated as 0 percent and use of 90 percent or more is treated as 100 percent. No input tax adjustments are made unless the taxable use of the land or buildings has changed by 10 percent or more compared to its original use. 20 percent de minimis could exclude some homes 3.18 The proposed 20 percent de minimis appears consistent with current practices, whereby most registered persons would not regard their home as a business asset, even though it may be partly used to make taxable supplies. We anticipate that the business use of a house or farmhouse that is owned by a GST-registered person would often be 20 percent or less where one room is used some of the time as a home office for the registered person’s taxable activity. 3.19 However, in some situations the business use of a dwelling will exceed 20 percent, for example, a small property where a GST-registered independent contractor mainly works from home. In addition, many holiday homes owned by GST-registered persons would have more than 20 percent taxable use if they 18 are regularly rented out to make taxable supplies of short-term commercial accommodation. 4 3.20 These cases suggest another policy reform option, such as those discussed in chapter 2 (the election method to remove an asset from a registered person’s taxable activity) or chapter 5 (a potential new exempt supply rule for the sale of dwellings), may also be required if the policy objective is to exclude a greater range of assets from being treated as taxable when owned and used by a registered person to make taxable supplies. Rounding up percentage of taxable use 3.21 Rounding up taxable use of 80 percent or more to 100 percent could significantly reduce the number of assets for which registered persons would need to apportion GST input tax. It would also reflect a practical reality that some business assets may occasionally be used privately and that the compliance costs of preventing this, or accounting for it, may outweigh any GST recoverable for the private use. 3.22 On the other hand, allowing GST-registered persons, particularly sole traders and closely-held businesses, to enjoy up to 20 percent private use of their business assets without incurring GST costs may be viewed as concessionary. This is because unregistered persons are charged GST on almost all the goods and services they purchase. Work-related vehicles with limited private or non-taxable use 3.23 Currently, the usual apportionment and adjustment rules apply where a registered person utilises a motor vehicle as part of their taxable activity, with registered persons able to refer to the vehicle logbook 5 to determine the extent of taxable use. 3.24 We anticipate that many registered persons will have recorded an intended and actual taxable use of 80 percent or more. This would generally be because the vehicle has a high business mileage during working hours and only minimal private use. 3.25 If there are a high number of vehicles with 80 percent or more taxable use, the proposed rule to round up taxable use to 100 percent could reduce compliance costs by removing annual apportionment monitoring and adjustments for these vehicles. However, taxpayers would still face some compliance costs from recording actual use or maintaining a logbook for income tax deductions and depreciation. 3.26 We are therefore interested in submissions on how many work-related vehicles would have 80 percent or more taxable use and whether the proposed 80 percent rounding-up rule for GST would be effective at reducing overall tax compliance costs for vehicles. We also welcome submissions on other potential methods for apportioning GST on motor vehicles that could reduce compliance costs while ensuring a fair and reasonable apportionment between taxable and non-taxable use. 4 For some holiday homes, the taxable use could be less than 20 percent because of more private use or use in making exempt supplies of residential accommodation during the period the property was owned. 5 The logbook method is set out in sections DE 6 to DE 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 19 A transitional wash-up calculation 3.27 Some registered persons may currently have assets they use between 21 and 79 percent for making taxable supplies, and those assets would continue to be subject to apportionment under the option described above. 3.28 We are considering whether to give registered persons the ability to choose to permanently change how they use such an asset so that their taxable use of the asset would be either 20 percent or less or 80 percent or more for all future years. They would then perform a wash-up calculation under section 21FB of the GST Act based on: • 0 percent taxable use (if they have chosen to have 20 percent or less taxable use). The wash-up calculation would require them to pay output tax equal to any input tax deduction previously claimed. • 100 percent taxable use (if they have chosen to have 80 percent or more taxable use). The wash-up calculation would allow them to claim an input tax deduction based on the tax fraction of the original cost when they acquired the asset. 3.29 We welcome feedback on whether affected registered persons would change their behaviour and taxable use to be able to use such a wash-up calculation. Application date and transitional rules for applying rounding rules 3.30 The proposed rounding options discussed above would apply to assets purchased on or after 1 April 2023 (assuming the relevant legislation was enacted in early 2023 and applied from this date). 3.31 To provide sufficient time for registered persons to understand and apply the proposed rounding rules to assets acquired before 1 April 2023, we propose allowing registered persons to transition assets purchased before that date into the proposed new rules within the next two adjustment periods. Any assets purchased after the application date of the provisions would be subject to the new rules in the adjustment period they are purchased in. 3.32 However, given the proposed new rules would be designed to be more effective and reduce compliance costs for registered persons, some registered persons may want to apply the new rounding rules sooner than the end of the second adjustment period. Therefore, we propose to allow registered persons to optionally elect to apply the new rounding rules to pre-reform assets at the end of the adjustment period in which the date of application of the new rules occurs (the first adjustment period). 3.33 Registered persons may apply the new rounding rules in either the first or second adjustment period on an asset-by -asset basis. However, by the end of the second adjustment period, the expectation is that all assets (both pre- and post-application date assets) would adhere to the new rules. 20 Questions for submitters • What are the potential impacts of a principal purpose test for low-value assets? How would it align with current business practices? • What are the potential impacts of only making GST adjustments for assets if there has been a more than 20 percent change in use? • What type of assets would be either above 80 percent taxable use or below 20 percent? • Would removing these assets from the GST apportionment and adjustment rules be effective at reducing overall tax compliance costs, given any private use may still need to be monitored for income tax purposes? • How can we best reduce GST compliance costs on work vehicles that have only a small amount of non-taxable use? • What are the potential impacts of the proposed application date and transitional rules? • Are there other options we should consider for removing most assets from the compliance costs associated with tracking modest changes in use? 21 CHAPTER 4 Accommodation services supplied in dwellings and commercial dwellings 4.1 GST apportionment issues can arise when the same premises are used to make taxable supplies of commercial accommodation as well as being used for private use or to make exempt supplies of accommodation in a dwelling. 4.2 The GST treatment of such supplies can depend on the GST Act definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”. This chapter seeks submissions on whether new definitions could be developed that are more certain and easier to apply than the existing definitions. 4.3 We also welcome submissions on any alternative definitions or possible amendments that submitters consider may make the dwelling and commercial dwelling rules easier to apply. Current issues 4.4 If a person lives in their own house, no rent is charged for this accommodation and accordingly no GST is paid on these accommodation services. There is no supply for GST purposes. 4.5 To ensure the GST system does not favour owner-occupied housing over renting a house, the service of accommodation in a dwelling is an exempt supply. This means no GST is charged on a residential tenancy and similar long-term accommodation services, but also no input tax deductions can be claimed by the landlord on the purchase price of the rental property or on any expenses incurred in providing the exempt accommodation service. 4.6 The definition of “dwelling” in the GST Act uses the definitions of “premises” and “quiet enjoyment” in section 2 and section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 respectively. The definition also excludes “commercial dwellings”, such as hotels, motels and boarding houses. 4.7 The interaction of the “dwelling” definition with the “commercial dwelling” definition can be difficult to determine in certain scenarios. For example, it may be unclear whether land and buildings is a “dwelling”, a “commercial dwelling” or a combination of both that requires apportionment. 4.8 This difficulty is partly because the definition of “dwelling” is based on the nature of the accommodation services received by the occupant and determining whether an occupant has “quiet enjoyment” can sometimes be difficult to assess. In contrast, the definition of “commercial dwelling” is simply a list of different types of premises – hotels, motels, homestays, farmstays, B&Bs, inns, hostels, boardinghouses, serviced apartments, convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes, hospices, camping grounds and premises of a similar kind. 4.9 The definition of “dwelling” excludes a commercial dwelling. This exclusion can create issues where the same premises (such as a homestay or farmstay) are used to provide commercial accommodation services to guests but are also the residence or abode of other persons (such as the owner and their family or residential tenants). 22 Residential accommodation services 4.10 We propose that the current definition of “dwelling” be replaced by a new definition of “residential accommodation services”. This could be defined as “accommodation provided in premises or part of premises to a person who occupies, or will occupy, the premises (or part of the premises) predominantly as their place of residence or abode and includes any appurtenances belonging to, or used with, the premises”. This is similar to the pre-2011 definition of “dwelling”. Commercial accommodation services 4.11 Several alternative options exist for defining the “commercial accommodation services” that would remain taxable supplies when supplied by a GST-registered person. 4.12 The first option would be to retain the existing definition of “commercial dwelling” but clarify how premises that are both dwellings and commercial dwellings should be treated. As mentioned above, there are cases where the same land, building or premises are used to provide either private accommodation to the owners or exempt residential accommodation services as well as commercial accommodation services to guests. In such cases, the private or residential tenancy accommodation services should still qualify as exempt supplies of residential accommodation. This outcome could be achieved by excluding “the supply of accommodation services in a commercial dwelling” from the proposed new definition of “residential accommodation services” (rather than the current approach of simply excluding commercial dwellings from the definition of “dwelling”). 4.13 However, another issue with the existing definition of “commercial dwelling” is that it uses a list of specified kinds of premises. To apply this definition, taxpayers and Inland Revenue need to subjectively assess whether a particular property fits within the specified kinds of premises on the list. 4.14 The list may also become less relevant and harder to apply over time as new types of accommodation are introduced or changes to how guest accommodation is provided are made. To some extent, the list is future-proofed because a property can qualify as a commercial dwelling if it is “premises of a similar kind” to one or more of the types of premises specified on the list. However, applying this test can be subjective, which creates uncertainty. 4.15 For these reasons, an alternative option would be to replace the current list of commercial dwellings with a new, more general, definition that describes some key features of commercial accommodation services – namely that the accommodation is usually short term or is bundled with additional regular services. Such a new definition of “commercial accommodation services” could include: • Short-term accommodation services that are ordinarily intended to be provided to the recipient for periods of less than 28 days at a time. This would ensure short-term accommodation services are a taxable supply, regardless of the type of premises (such as a holiday home or hotel) they were provided in. To clarify, if a visitor was provided accommodation services for more than 28 days, these services could still be a taxable supply if they represented services that were ordinarily intended to be provided for less than 28 days. • Serviced accommodation that includes certain regular services (such as meals, cleaning or care services) being provided to the recipient as part 23 of the supply of accommodation services. In other words, the regular services are not provided as an optional extra or for a separate amount of consideration. This is intended to ensure serviced apartments, rest homes and certain types of student accommodation that include additional services remain taxable supplies. 4.16 Either of these new types of commercial accommodation services could be subject to the valuation rule in section 10(6) of the GST Act if they were, in fact, provided to a recipient for more than 28 days. Section 10(6) currently applies when a guest stays more than four weeks in a commercial dwelling, and the section effectively reduces the GST rate to 9% (by applying the 15% GST rate to 60 percent of the value of the supply). This valuation rule reflects the fact that longer-term stays can become a closer substitute for a residential tenancy so 40 percent of the consideration paid becomes exempt. However, 60 percent remains taxable as it may be for other domestic services, such as cleaning, electricity or telecommunications. Land satisfying both definitions 4.17 Even under the proposed changes to the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” discussed above, an overlap and uncertain boundary between these two types of accommodation services would still exist. 4.18 One option that could address this uncertainty would be to allow GST-registered persons who own a single piece of land, building or premises used predominantly to provide one type of accommodation services to make an irrevocable election to deem all the accommodation services to be of that type. 4.19 For example, a retirement village will often have a mix of independent care units (exempt) and serviced units (taxable). This proposed option would allow some retirement village operators to choose either to exempt all their units (if they only make a small percentage of taxable supplies) or, alternatively, to treat all their units as taxable (if they predominantly have serviced units). 4.20 Similarly, a hotel or motel may provide staff accommodation in one part of their site. The hotel or motel could choose to treat this staff accommodation as a taxable commercial accommodation service. This would mean they would not need to apportion the land and other inputs, but they would also return output tax on the accommodation service and the sale of the hotel or motel complex. 4.21 This option could also potentially apply to temporary accommodation services provided to fixed-term or seasonal workers. Applying the election would typically clarify these are a taxable supply of commercial accommodation services based on the predominant type of accommodation services provided on these premises. 4.22 In cases where emergency social housing accommodation services are provided in premises usually intended for short-term occupancy, such as motels, hotels and hostels, this option could be used by the supplier to treat these accommodation services as either an exempt or taxable supply, depending on the predominant use of their premises. 4.23 Note, however, that if a change in use occurs such that premises that had been previously used by the registered person to make taxable supplies are now used to make exempt supplies, GST output tax adjustments would need to be returned for the capital cost of the premises. 24 Application date and transitional rule 4.24 If changes were made to the “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” definitions, these changes would apply to accommodation services supplied on or after 1 April 2023 (assuming the relevant legislation was enacted in early 2023 and applied from this date). 4.25 The proposed changes in this chapter are intended to clarify and simplify the boundary and overlap between the current definitions rather than change the GST treatment of the relevant accommodation services. However, a transitional rule, similar to the rule in section 21HB of the GST Act, could be used to preserve the current GST treatment of dwellings or commercial dwellings if they are altered as a result of the proposed new definitions. Questions for submitters • What issues or uncertainties arise due to the current GST definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”? • Should the “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” definitions be replaced to address these issues? • What are the potential impacts of the options discussed in this chapter? • Are there other options we should consider to make the dwelling and commercial dwelling rules easier to apply? 25 CHAPTER 5 Should the sale of a dwelling be an exempt or separate supply? 5.1 As discussed in chapter 1, under the current GST rules, when a GST-registered person owns land they use to make taxable supplies, the sale of that land can itself be a taxable supply. This is even though the land may include a house that has predominantly non-taxable use (such as a private residence, family use of a holiday home for no consideration, or exempt rental accommodation) and only a modest amount of taxable use. 5.2 One way to allow GST-registered persons to remove houses (and other assets) from their taxable activity is the election option discussed in chapter 2. An alternative option would be to make the sale of a house an exempt supply of land. This chapter discusses whether sales of dwellings should be made an exempt supply of land. However, note that if a registered person had developed the land with an intention to sell it (such as in the case of a property developer), the supply of the land would remain a taxable supply. Some potential rules for property developers are discussed in chapter 6. 5.3 This chapter also discusses how the GST rules should apply on the sale of land and buildings containing a combination of a dwelling and other types of spaces used to make taxable supplies. In general, we propose that when land that includes a dwelling is sold, the dwelling could be treated as a separate supply from other land or buildings contained on the land. This proposal is relevant even if house sales themselves are not made an exempt supply. This is because it could be used to identify the relevant premises (or part of the premises) that the proposed election option in chapter 2 or the rounding options in chapter 3 should be applied to. Potential option of making the sale of a dwelling an exempt supply 5.4 Australia and Singapore have specific exemptions in their GST rules for sales of existing residential premises (as opposed to new builds or developments, which are subject to GST). 5.5 New Zealand could consider adding a new exemption to the GST Act so that sales of dwellings by registered persons who had not developed the property would become an exempt supply. There would therefore be no GST output tax on disposal of the property, and no input tax deduction for the purchase of, or capital improvements to, the property. A dwelling would include a person’s principal place of residence, residential rental properties, and holiday homes. 5.6 A new exempt supply rule for houses could help align the GST rules with current practices. This is because GST-registered persons who are only using part of a house (such as for a home office) to make supplies of goods or services are unlikely to consider their house to be a business asset or the sale of the house as being in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. It also achieves similar GST outcomes for GST-registered persons (such as sole traders) who own their house and use it in their business when compared to other GST- registered business owners who are separate to the person or entity who owns the house. 5.7 An exempt supply rule would prevent most registered persons from claiming an input tax deduction on purchases of dwellings. Such registered persons would also be prevented from claiming input tax deductions for capital expenses, such 26 as improvements to the dwelling. They would still be able to claim and apportion input tax for operating expenses, such as electricity or internet services provided to a home office, to the extent to which they are used to make taxable supplies. This could potentially add complexity by introducing a capital/revenue expenditure boundary into the GST Act, although the boundary could be the same as that used for income tax purposes. This would mean that if an input qualified as a revenue expense for income tax (as opposed to a capital improvement to the dwelling), an input tax deduction could be claimed for GST purposes to the extent the input was used to make taxable supplies. 5.8 This option would require new definitions of dwellings that are exempt when sold and dwellings that remain taxable supplies when sold (for example, properties that have been developed or built by property developers). We acknowledge these new definitions would add complexity and uncertainty to the GST rules for land. 5.9 A new type of exempt supply for the sale of a dwelling may not be necessary if the election option discussed in chapter 2 is introduced to allow GST-registered persons to exclude houses (and certain other assets) from their taxable activity. We are therefore interested in submitters’ views on whether developing the option of a new exempt supply rule for sales of dwellings is worthwhile. Defining dwellings for exemption 5.10 The current GST Act definition of “dwelling” appears unsuitable for applying an exemption to the sale of houses as it is based on the nature of the accommodation services received by the occupant rather than the type of property sold. For example, it would exclude houses, such as holiday homes, that are not used as a principal place of residence. 5.11 Accordingly, we consider a new definition of “dwelling” would be needed to identify land and buildings that could be an exempt supply when sold. This definition could be based on the characteristics of the building and would apply to owner-occupied houses and to properties that are close substitutes for owner-occupied housing (that is, they would be suitable for a person to move into and live permanently as their principal place of residence). This would include holiday homes. 5.12 The new definition could be based on paragraph (a) of the Income Tax Act definition of “dwelling”, which is “any place configured as a residence or abode, whether or not it is used as a place of residence or abode, including any appurtenances belonging to or enjoyed with the place.” This is similar to Australia’s GST Act definition of “residential premises”, which is “a building which can be occupied, is occupied, or is intended to be occupied, predominantly as a dwelling.” 5.13 Any land (including dwellings) that was developed and sold by a GST-registered property developer would remain subject to GST on disposal as a taxable supply. Some potential rules for applying GST to land that is developed and sold by property developers are discussed in chapter 6. Guest accommodation provided in holiday homes 5.14 If an exempt supply rule was introduced for the sale of houses by registered persons, we propose that the sale of a holiday home by a registered person could qualify as an exempt supply. However, any short-term accommodation services supplied when leasing a holiday home to a guest would remain a taxable supply for GST. 27 5.15 In cases where a GST-registered person uses part of their home or a holiday home to make taxable supplies of short-term guest accommodation services, we propose that the entire sale of the home or holiday home could still be a non-taxable or exempt supply of a private house, rather than being treated as a taxable supply or a partly taxable supply. This is because the home or holiday home would be a close substitute for owner-occupied housing, which would not typically be a taxable supply on sale (unless it was developed and sold by a property developer). 5.16 Alternatively, if the election method discussed in chapter 2 was introduced, that method could be used by GST-registered owners of holiday homes to exclude their purchase and disposal of the holiday home from being considered part of their taxable activity (even if it is partly used to make taxable supplies of short- term guest accommodation services). 5.17 Under either of these options, we anticipate that most GST-registered owners of a holiday home would not claim input tax deductions on the purchase of the holiday home or for capital spending on the house. GST output tax would then not apply to any subsequent disposal of the holiday home. However, the GST- registered person would still charge GST on their taxable supplies of leasing the holiday house as commercial accommodation and claim GST input tax deductions on operating expenses used to make these taxable supplies (for example, cleaning, property managers, rates and insurance, repairs). 5.18 Another possible option could be to introduce a special rule that would generally prevent input tax deductions from being claimed 6 for the purchase of a holiday home (and any capital improvements) unless the registered person supplied taxable accommodation services to guests of at least $60,000 per annum. Supplies made to associated persons, such as the owners or close family members, would be ignored, as they would be more akin to private consumption than a commercial activity. Such a rule would only allow input tax to be deducted on the purchase of, or capital improvements to, a holiday home when the holiday home operated on a similar scale to other commercial accommodation operators, such as hotels or motels (which would typically make more than $60,000 per annum of taxable supplies to guests). 5.19 In any case where a GST-registered guest accommodation host had claimed input tax deduction in respect of buying their holiday house, they would be liable for GST output tax if they sold the house or stopped their taxable activity of selling guest accommodation. Sales of land and buildings with a mix of dwellings and commercial spaces 5.20 Another key question is how the GST rules should apply on the sale of land and buildings that contain a combination of dwellings and other types of spaces used to make taxable supplies. This question is relevant even if house sales themselves are not made an exempt supply. This is because it could be used to identify the relevant asset (is it all the land or just the dwelling?) that the proposed election option in chapter 2 or the rounding options in chapter 3 should be applied to. 5.21 In general, we propose that when land that includes a dwelling is sold, the dwelling would be treated as a separate supply to other land or buildings contained on the land. Section 5(15) of the GST Act already achieves this for 6 Or require an adjustment to be made to return output tax of 15% GST on the zero-rated purchase price in cases where they purchased the house as a zero-rated supply of land or a going concern from another registered person. 28 dwellings that are a principal place of residence or have been exclusively used to make exempt supplies of accommodation in a dwelling for at least five years. Section 5(15) could be expanded to apply to a wider range of dwellings, such as holiday homes. 5.22 Such a rule would mean that farmhouses and curtilage would continue to be regarded as the supply of a separate asset that could be a non-taxable or exempt supply, while the surrounding farmland, which is used to make taxable supplies, would be a taxable supply of land. 5.23 Another common example is a residential dwelling with an attached retail shop or medical practice. In these cases, the intended policy outcome would be that the dwelling part of the building should be considered a separate supply to the business premises. This is because significant physical modifications would have been made to construct a shop or medical practice that make these spaces separate and different to the private rooms in the dwelling. 5.24 In contrast, a home office is often not physically separate or objectively different to other rooms within the dwelling. It is likely to closely resemble a study or bedroom. The policy intention would be to allow such home offices to be treated as the same supply as the other parts of the dwelling when the dwelling is sold. 5.25 Another common scenario is worker or employee accommodation provided on business premises. For example, a farmer may provide accommodation for seasonal workers, or there may be a unit or building within a hotel complex that a hotel manager or other staff members use as their principal place of residence. In these cases, we propose that the GST treatment of the dwelling would follow the GST treatment of the accommodation services. We note that chapter 4 discussed the option of allowing registered persons to elect to treat the accommodation services in these cases as being either all taxable or all exempt supplies based on the predominant type of accommodation provided. Application date and dwellings purchased before that date 5.26 If the proposed new exempt supply rule for sales of dwellings was implemented, it would apply prospectively from a certain date after the new rules were enacted, such as 1 April 2023. 5.27 The potential option to exempt the supply of a dwelling would not apply to dwellings owned by registered persons where they had claimed an input tax deduction for the purchase of the dwelling before the application date of the new exempt supply rule. 7 However, if such registered persons wanted to exclude a house from their taxable activity, we propose that they could choose to use the proposed election option in chapter 2. Paragraphs 2.24 to 2.26 of chapter 2 explain how this option could be applied to assets, such as dwellings, that were purchased before the application date of the proposed reforms. 5.28 If a new exempt supply rule was introduced, some dwellings purchased before the application date of the reforms would remain taxable supplies when disposed of, while other dwellings would qualify as exempt supplies. Managing these differences could be complex and confusing for taxpayers, tax advisors and Inland Revenue, which means this option could be difficult to implement. 7 It would also not apply to dwellings where the registered person had purchased the house as a zero-rated supply of land, or a going concern from another registered person, before the date the new exempt supply rule applied. 29 Questions for submitters • What are the impacts of potentially making the sale of an existing dwelling an exempt supply? • If a new exempt supply rule was introduced for the sale of an existing dwelling, how should a dwelling be defined? • How should GST apply to the rental and sale of holiday homes? • How should GST apply to sales of land with a mix of dwellings and commercial spaces? • Would there be a practical way to transition into an exemption for sales of existing dwellings? • Are there other options for simplifying GST on sales of existing dwellings we should consider instead? 30 CHAPTER 6 Land developed and sold by residential property developers 6.1 Under any of the proposals discussed in this issues paper, land that was developed and sold by a GST-registered property developer would remain subject to GST on sale as a taxable supply. 6.2 This chapter discusses the option of allowing a full input tax deduction for land when a registered person has commenced a housing development with the intention to sell the land as a taxable supply. 6.3 The proposals in this chapter would not apply to developers of commercial land, as such developers would typically only be making taxable supplies (the sale or lease of commercial land) so would not need to apply the apportionment and adjustment rules. 6.4 Under both the current and proposed GST rules discussed in this issues paper, there is a risk that a GST-registered person could claim a full input tax deduction on the purchase of land they intend to develop and sell as new or improved housing, but they do not proceed with the development and end up holding the property for a long time rather than selling it and returning GST. 6.5 This chapter discusses some options that could mitigate this risk. These include requiring the registered person either to have an existing business of developing land or for their development activity to have commenced before an input tax deduction could be claimed for the purchase of the land. A time limit could also be introduced that would require the housing developer to sell the land within 36 months of claiming a full input tax deduction or apply to Inland Revenue for an extension. 6.6 Finally, this chapter invites submissions on how GST should apply to build-to- rent developers. Full input tax deduction for land used for housing developments 6.7 The current GST apportionment rules are complex to apply if the land is being developed to be sold as a taxable supply of new or improved housing but also has some non-taxable use (such as owner-occupation or a residential tenancy) during the period of the registered person’s ownership. Some developers may be able to use the existing de minimis in section 20(3D), which provides that they do not need to apportion input tax for an adjustment period if the total value of their exempt supplies will not exceed the lesser of $90,000 or 5 percent of the total consideration for all their taxable and exempt supplies for the adjustment period. 6.8 To reduce compliance costs for housing developers with a greater amount of non-taxable use of land, we propose that instead of applying the apportionment rules to such land, a full input tax deduction could be claimed by the GST- registered property developer for the purchase of the land and for other capital development costs once the development activity has commenced. This would simplify GST compliance for residential property developers. 6.9 The proposal could also ensure build-to-sell developers face a similar GST treatment, regardless of whether they are building new houses on vacant land or replacing or renovating existing buildings, which may be tenanted until the major development work commences. This could encourage more efficient use 31 of housing. For example, property developers may currently prefer to have vacant properties rather than letting them to a residential tenant until they are ready to be developed or sold. This is because having vacant properties ensures the developer gets a full input tax deduction and simpler GST compliance, whereas if the property is let, that non-taxable use would mean GST apportionment would apply to the land. 6.10 Under the proposal a property developer’s holding costs (such as insurance and local authority rates) would still need to be apportioned between taxable and non-taxable use. Expenses directly attributable to providing an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling (such as a property management service, cleaning services used between tenants, repairs to damage caused by tenants) would remain non-deductible for GST input tax purposes. 6.11 A possible way to further simplify the rules could be to provide an option for property developers to return (but not charge) GST on the rent paid for the exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling (or the market value rent that could have been charged if an owner-occupied property had instead been tenanted). If this option was implemented, it would allow the GST-registered property developer to claim a full input tax deduction for all their input costs. We are interested in submissions on whether this method should be extended to other types of registered persons (not just property developers) who have concurrent use of land, as it appears simpler than using the current concurrent use of land rules. This could be implemented by allowing such registered persons to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to agree an alternative apportionment method. This is further discussed in chapter 7. Defining land used for housing developments 6.12 If special GST rules were introduced for land that will be developed and sold as new or improved housing by registered persons, then the land these rules would apply to would need to be defined. 6.13 One option could be to define the land using the descriptions of this type of land recently included in proposed provisions in Supplementary Order Paper No 64 to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill. These descriptions are used to exempt from the income tax interest limitation rules land that is part of a land business or is being developed for new housing. These descriptions are: • land that the person holds as part of a business described in section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (Disposal: land acquired for purposes of business relating to land), and • land that is subject to the person’s undertaking or scheme involving development, division, or building for the purpose of creating new build land. 6.14 The GST reform options that are proposed in this chapter could apply to similar housing developments. That is, a full GST input tax deduction could be claimed on the purchase of land by a GST-registered person if that person buys the land as part of a business described in section CB 7. Note that the definition in section CB 7 includes land acquired by persons who are associated with an existing business that meets the eligibility requirements if the land will be used in the land development business. This means that if an existing business establishes a new GST-registered person, such as a company or partnership, to buy and develop the land, the new registered person could still be a business described in section CB 7 due to being associated with the existing business relating to land. 32 6.15 A full input tax deduction could also be claimed on land that is subject to the person’s undertaking or scheme involving development, division, or building for the purpose of creating new build land. However, such an input tax deduction would only be claimed from the time that the undertaking or scheme commenced (rather than the date of purchase). This is intended to mitigate the potential fiscal risk that a purchaser of land could register for GST and claim GST input tax deductions because they intend to develop the property, but then the development does not commence and the registered person fails to make output tax adjustments to reflect their non-taxable use of the land. 8 6.16 If a GST-registered person did not buy the land as part of an existing business of land described in section CB 7, we propose that they would not be able to claim an input tax deduction for the cost of the land at the time of purchase. However, once they started developing the land and had an intention to sell the land when they finished the development, they would then be able to claim a full input tax deduction on the purchase price of the property in their next GST return. Evidence that they had commenced the development activity could include that they had lodged a building consent or a resource consent with the local authority for a development, or that they had begun to incur development costs, such as expenses for draftspersons, surveyors or engineering services. Time limit to sell land intended for residential development 6.17 The proposed rules would need to address the risk that a GST-registered person claimed a full input tax deduction for the purchase of the land, but then did not proceed with the development and continued to hold the property for a long period, rather than sell it and return GST. 6.18 We therefore propose that a time limit could be introduced for the property development. More specifically, if a registered person claimed a full input tax deduction for land under the proposed new property development rules but does not sell the land within 36 months, there would be a deemed disposal of the land for its current market value. 6.19 We acknowledge that a deemed sale would create cashflow difficulties. To mitigate this, we propose that the GST-registered person could apply to Inland Revenue to request an extension to the 36-month time limit. The person would have to provide sufficient evidence that they have developed the property, or are continuing to develop it, and that they intend to sell the property within a certain timeframe. Evidence of this might include that they are actively marketing the land for sale. At the end of any such extension period given, if the registered person has not already disposed of the property, they would either need to reapply for a further extension or face a deemed disposal. Application date 6.20 If the proposed options discussed above were implemented, they would apply prospectively to land purchased from a specified date after the new rules had been enacted, such as 1 April 2023. 8 Alternatively, a GST-registered purchaser may buy land from another registered person, who sells it as a zero-rated supply of land under section 11(1)(mb), and the purchaser does not make an adjustment for non-taxable use under section 20(3J). 33 Build-to-rent developers 6.21 Rather than selling land as a taxable supply, build-to-rent developers buy land and develop new and improved housing to make long-term exempt supplies of accommodation in a dwelling (as a residential landlord). Accordingly, build-to- rent developers are charged GST on their inputs, such as land purchases and construction costs, and are generally unable to register for GST or claim input tax deductions to recover the GST on their development costs. This is because these costs are connected to making exempt supplies, rather than taxable supplies. 6.22 We understand that some build-to-rent developers consider the current GST settings to be a barrier to investment, as the GST cost on their expenses leads to higher upfront costs and increases the amounts that build-to-rent developers need to borrow or finance for their projects. 6.23 From a GST policy perspective, there does not appear to be a good rationale for build-to-rent developers being able to deduct their input tax and receive a GST concession that is not available to other residential landlords or owner- occupiers (who are charged GST on their costs). Questions for submitters • What are the potential impacts of allowing a full input tax deduction (instead of applying apportionment and adjustment rules) for land and capital improvements purchased by housing developers who intend to sell new or improved housing? Are there other options we should consider instead? • What are the potential impacts of requiring the registered person to have an existing business of land development or to wait until their development activity has commenced before claiming an input tax deduction for purchasing land? • How should land developed for the purpose of sale be defined? • What are the potential impacts of the proposed 36-month time limit for developers to develop and sell residential land? • Are there other options for simplifying GST compliance for housing developers and encouraging housing developments to commence and be sold within a reasonable timeframe? • How should GST apply to build-to-rent developers? What issues arise with the current settings? 34 CHAPTER 7 Other options for simplifying the GST apportionment rules 7.1 The previous chapters in this issues paper discussed major policy reform options that, if progressed, could allow registered persons to exclude certain assets from their taxable activity or be deemed to have 100 percent taxable use of an asset. 7.2 These major reform options could greatly reduce the number of situations where registered persons would need to apply the apportionment rules to as sets, in particular for dwellings. 7.3 However, various assets would remain subject to apportionment calculations and adjustments, and therefore it makes sense to consider some smaller changes that may improve the apportionment rules. This chapter discusses some of these potential improvements. 7.4 We invite submissions on these proposals or other suggestions for simplifying the current apportionment rules for those registered persons who may need to continue to apply them and make annual adjustments. Reduce the required number of adjustment periods 7.5 Under the current GST apportionment rules, registered persons estimate their percentage taxable use at the time they acquire an asset and are then generally required to monitor for any changes in the percentage taxable use for either two, five or ten adjustment periods (up to ten years) after an asset is purchased. A de minimis applies, so that for assets purchased for less than $5,000 (excluding GST) no subsequent adjustment is required unless the asset has been disposed of. 7.6 To reduce compliance costs for lower-value assets, we propose that the required number of adjustment periods should be reduced to two for assets acquired for less than $20,000 (excluding GST). Thus, the actual use of these assets would only need to be monitored for two adjustment periods. This would be in addition to the proposed principal purpose test for assets acquired for less than $5,000 (discussed in chapter 3) that, if introduced, would mean a subsequent adjustment would only be required when such assets are sold. 7.7 For land, a registered person must currently monitor their taxable use every adjustment period (that is, every year) until disposal. To reduce compliance costs, we propose that a ten-period limit could be introduced for land – the same limit that currently applies to other types of assets acquired for $500,000 or more. 7.8 Table 2 shows how the current rules compare to the proposals in this issues paper. All values exclude GST. 35 Table 2: Comparison of the current rules and the proposed changes Required number of adjustment periods (that is, annual balance dates) Current rules Proposals in this issues paper None (just estimated percentage taxable use when purchased) Less than $5,000 New principal purpose test for assets less than $5,000 Two $5,000 to $10,000 $5,000 to $20,000 Five $10,000 to $500,000 $20,000 to $500,000 Ten $500,000+ $500,000+ and all land Unlimited Land Not applicable Expand the wash-up rule eligibility 7.9 Section 21FB of the GST Act contains a wash-up calculation that applies when a registered person has experienced a change to either 100 percent taxable use or 100 percent non-taxable use of an asset during the current adjustment period and for all the following adjustment period. This is measured at two consecutive annual balance dates. If their use has changed to 100 percent taxable use, the wash-up rule requires the registered person to claim a full input tax deduction for the input tax they incurred at the time they acquired the asset. If, instead, their use has changed to 100 percent non-taxable use, they are required to make an output tax adjustment to repay input tax previously deducted. 7.10 Some taxpayers may purchase business assets before they are GST registered that they subsequently use to make taxable supplies after they register for GST. If they had been registered for GST at the time they purchased the business asset, they would have been able to claim an input tax deduction in their next GST return to the extent to which they used the asset to make taxable supplies The apportionment and adjustment rules allow such taxpayers to gradually claim input tax deductions on such assets after they have registered for GST. They may also be able to claim a full input tax deduction if the wash-up rule in section 21FB applies. This is because they would have had two adjustment periods where they had 100 percent taxable use of the asset. However, this delays their ability to claim a full input tax deduction for assets used to make taxable supplies. To address this issue, we propose that a registered person should not have to wait two adjustment periods to use the wash-up rule if their use has permanently changed to 100 percent taxable use. Instead, we propose they should be able to make the adjustment to the new percentage at the end of the current adjustment period. 7.11 Another potential improvement to the wash-up rule would be to allow it to be used for any permanent change to a particular fixed percentage use (as op posed to only those cases where the use has permanently changed to 100 percent taxable or 100 percent non-taxable). For example, if a person’s use changed to 50 percent taxable and they expected this percentage to remain stable for the foreseeable future, they would be able to perform the wash-up calculation to claim 50 percent of the input tax deductions. It is also proposed that, in these circumstances, the registered person would be able to perform the wash-up calculation at the end of the adjustment period when the permanent change in use occurred, rather than having to wait two adjustment periods. 36 Repeal the mixed-use asset rules in section 20G 7.12 The mixed-use asset rules in section 20G of the GST Act add the complexity of another potential formula but have limited application. The rules only apply to certain assets, such as holiday homes, aircraft and yachts, and only when their use is a mixture of private days, taxable days and at least 62 unused days. 7.13 In addition, it is likely that many of the assets currently subject to these mixed- use asset rules could be excluded from a registered person’s taxable activity as a result of the major policy reforms discussed in this issues paper. For example, a registered person could use the election method proposed in chapter 2 to exclude a holiday home from their taxable activity, or they could deem an aircraft or pleasure craft to be non-taxable if their taxable use was less than the 20 percent de minimis proposed in chapter 3. 7.14 For these reasons, we propose that the current mixed-use asset rules in section 20G should be repealed. In those cases where GST apportionment continued to apply to a registered person’s mixed-use assets, their GST input tax deductions and adjustments would instead be calculated using the same general GST apportionment rules that apply to other assets. Repeal the concurrent use of land rules in section 21E 7.15 As discussed in chapter 6, we propose that some special rules be introduced for land developed by residential property developers. These rules would replace the concurrent use of land rule for property developers, as they would be able to claim a full input tax deduction for the purchase of land once they commenced developing the property. 7.16 Accordingly, we propose that the concurrent use of land rules in section 21E of the GST Act could be repealed, as other situations where land is used to make both taxable and non-taxable supplies by a registered person are usually able to be apportioned on a time and/or space basis. Alternatively, such registered persons could apply to Inland Revenue for approval to use a more practical alternative apportionment method (as discussed in the next section below). 7.17 If the concurrent use of land rules were repealed, thought would need to be given to how GST-registered persons who are currently using this calculation method would transition into the new rules. One option would be to allow such registered persons to apply the proposed special rules for residential property developers that would allow a 100 percent deduction for land that is being developed but generally requires the land to be sold within 36 months of claiming the full deduction. If those rules were not applicable because, for example, the registered person’s taxable use of the land did not involve developing and selling the land (for example, they could be in the process of converting a residential property into a commercial building or clearing it to build / widen a road), they would also be able to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to agree an alternative apportionment method. 7.18 In addition, we are interested in submitters’ views on whether grandparenting provisions would potentially be required for land that the concurrent use of land rules currently apply to, and if so, what period for grandparenting would be appropriate? Allowing a wider range of approved apportionment methods 7.19 Sections 20(3EB) and 21(4B) of the GST Act allow registered persons to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to approve an alternative 37 apportionment method. This is intended to reduce compliance costs, as an alternative apportionment method could produce similar GST outcomes to the default apportionment rules but with much lower compliance costs. 7.20 Currently, any alternative apportionment method is required to have regard to the tenor of the default apportionment rules and formula in the relevant sections 21A to 21H. This requirement may limit alternative methods to those methods that are based on the default rules and formula rather than other methods that may be more practical and provide a fair and reasonable method of apportionment but that use a different methodology. 7.21 For example, where residential rental income is received for a limited period and is incidental to a much larger taxable use of the land, it could be more practical for the registered person to return (but not charge) GST output tax on consideration received for an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling. They would then claim full input tax deductions for associated expenses, rather than making annual adjustments under the default apportionment rules and formula. 7.22 To accommodate a wider range of methods, we propose removal of the requirement that the alternative method has to “have regard to the tenor of” the default apportionment rules and formula. We would retain the more general requirement that the alternative method simply provides “a fair and reasonable method” of apportionment. 7.23 This proposed change would be complementary to an existing proposal included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill to remove the current $24 million turnover threshold in section 21(4B). If enacted, that proposal will allow all GST-registered persons to apply to the Commissioner to use an alternative apportionment method. Application date 7.24 If the proposed options discussed in this chapter were implemented, they would apply prospectively from a specified date after the new rules have been enacted, such as 1 April 2023. Questions for submitters • What are the potential impacts of reducing the number of adjustment periods for assets acquired for less than $20,000 and for land? • What are the potential impacts of expanding eligibility for the wash-up calculation? Are there other options we should consider instead? • Should the mixed-use asset rules for GST be repealed? What are the potential impacts of this? • Should the concurrent use of land rules be repealed and replaced with rules for property developers? What are the potential impacts of this? • If the concurrent use of land rules were repealed, how should GST-registered persons who are currently using this calculation method transition into the new rules? • Are there other ways of simplifying the current apportionment rules we should consider?

Two. Model Rules: A 10-chapter document setting out model legislation for governments wishing to enact the GloBE rules domestically. Pillar Two: One half of a 2-pillar solution formulated by the OECD-sponsored Inclusive Framework to address tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. Pillar Two is comprised of the GloBE rules (see above) and the Subject to Tax Rule, a treaty-based rule designed to allow jurisdictions to impose a top-up withholding tax on certain types of outbound payments that are made between related parties and are taxed at a nominal rate of less than 9%. 9 PART I: General 11 CHAPTER 1 Background 1.1 This document provides the basis for consultation on whether New Zealand should adopt GloBE tax rules and how it should implement those rules, if it does decide to adopt them. The rules are the main component of Pillar Two of the G20/OECD 2 Pillar solution to reform the international income tax framework in response to the challenges posed by the increasing globalisation and digitalisation of the economy. 1.2 In October 2021, this 2 Pillar solution was endorsed by over 130 countries in the OECD-sponsored Inclusive Framework, including New Zealand (this endorsement is referred to as the October Statement). This endorsement did not bind any country to adopt either Pillar. The Government has not decided whether to adopt either Pillar One or Pillar Two and has not ruled out adopting a digital services tax. 1.3 This is an officials issues paper, rather than a Government discussion document. The views expressed in this document are those of officials, and not necessarily those of the Government. Officials will report on submissions to the Government, and will consider the submissions when formulating their recommendations. What are the GloBE rules? 1.4 The purpose of the GloBE rules is to ensure that in-scope multinational groups (MNEs) pay at least a 15% tax on their income in each country where that income is reported for financial reporting purposes. The rules operate not by way of a multilateral instrument but by incorporation by countries in their domestic law. They are intended to apply to every in-scope MNE in the world, no matter where it has its headquarters, operations or sales. The design of the rules means this intention can be achieved even if many or indeed most countries do not adopt the rules. But the design does require implementation by a critical mass of countries. 1.5 An important aspect of the rules is that they only apply to income in excess of the substance-based income exclusion (“excess income”). The exclusion is calculated under a formula which gives a percentage return on the value of tangible assets and payroll expense in the country. The exclusion is intended to focus the rules on the taxation of more mobile forms of income, such as interest or the return to intellectual property. 1.6 An MNE is in scope if its annual turn-over exceeds €750 million pa in two of the last four years. This scope means the rules are estimated initially to apply to approximately 1,500 MNE groups worldwide, of which 20–25 are based in New Zealand. 1.7 National sovereignty and competition for capital means it is not realistic to achieve the objective of the GloBE rules by getting all countries in the world to simply impose the required level of tax on entities over which they have residence or source taxing rights. The rules have to work on the basis that they will not be implemented by all countries. 12 1.8 There are two GloBE rules, each of which would require implementation into domestic law: • An income inclusion rule (IIR). This rule imposes a top-up tax on the top company in an MNE (or in some cases lower tier holding companies) so that at least 15% tax is paid on the company’s share of the excess income of its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and branches in each country where that income is reported. The IIR is similar to a CFC rule in that it imposes tax on a company in relation to the profits of its foreign subsidiaries (and branches), though there are also important differences. Countries that wish to adopt Pillar Two are supposed to bring this rule into ef fect in 2023. • An undertaxed profits rule (UTPR), designed as a back-up to the IIR, intended to apply to the low tax excess income of an MNE group member in a country when that income is not subject to an IIR (because no direct or indirect group company shareholder of that group member is subject to an IIR with respect to the income). Like the IIR, this rule would impose sufficient additional tax on the group to increase the tax rate on that income to 15%, but the tax would be imposed on all group members resident in countries with a UTPR, in proportion to their substance in each country. This rule is supposed to be effective in 2024 for countries that wish to adopt Pillar Two. 1.9 A key aspect of the GloBE rules is that they apply on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Tax paid in a country where the rate is above 15% cannot be used to credit the liability for a country where the rate is below 15%. 1.10 The template for both rules is the Model Rules approved by the Inclusive Framework in December 2021. 1 By approving the Model R ules, Inclusive Framework countries have not agreed to implement the GloBE rules (though many are expected to do so), but rather have agreed that if they implement them, that will be in accordance with the Model Rules. This is critical to ensuring that the rules operate in a co-ordinated way to achieve the desired tax outcomes. The Inclusive Framework has also agreed a Commentary supporting the Model Rules. 2 The OECD plans to undertake further work in 2022 to develop a detailed Implementation Framework to deal with the practical implementation and co-ordination of the GloBE rules enacted by countries. The OECD has estimated global revenue gains under Pillar 2 to be USD$130-185 billion, or 6- 7.5% of global corporate income tax revenues. Aspects of this consultation 1.11 While the Model Rules with which each country’s own IIR and UTPR must conform have been agreed, as has the accompanying commentary, there is still a degree of uncertainty in relation to the proposal: • Areas of detail remain to be agreed, for example the nature of a safe harbour from the rules, and many of the issues that will be required to co-ordinate the application of the rules by different countries. • It is not certain how many countries will be able to meet the 2023 and 2024 effective dates, nor how they will do so (for example, on a balance 1 The Model Rules can be found here: https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/tax-challenges-arising- from-the-digitalisation-of-the-economy-global-anti-base-erosion-model-rules-pillar-two.htm 2 The Commentary can also be found using the above link. 13 date basis, or applying a hard date for all MNEs regardless of balance date). • There are some issues which have the potential to either defeat or substantially delay the implementation of the GloBE rules, for instance resolving the interaction of Pillar Two with the US global intangible low- taxed income (GILTI) rules. The GILTI rules are similar in their intent to the IIR rule, and the US is expected to continue to apply them rather than adopting an IIR. 1.12 Despite these uncertainties and continuing developments, officials are consulting now on the basis that if the required critical mass of other countries does adopt GLoBE rules, the Government will need to decide whether to join them in doing so. If the Government does decide to adopt the rules, then consistent with the October Statement it may be desirable for the IIR to apply in New Zealand from 2023 and it will certainly be desirable for it to do so from 2024. A similar approach is being taken by Canada (which included its proposal to implement the GloBE rules in its 2022 Budget), the United Kingdom (which published a consultative document in January 2022) and the European Union. Even if the rules applied from 1 January 2023, the first return would not need to be filed until sometime after the first quarter of 2025. 1.13 The purpose of this document is to consult on: • Whether New Zealand should adopt the GloBE rules, assuming that a critical mass of other countries also does so. • When any adoption should be effective, particularly in relation to the IIR. • How best to translate the rules into New Zealand law. • What areas of uncertainty there may be in applying the rules to New Zealand tax law, and how to resolve these. • Whether tax paid to the Zealand Government under the rules should give rise to imputation credits. • Administrative aspects, for instance return filing and timing of payments. 1.14 Although much of this document is devoted to explaining how the rules work, officials are not consulting on the elements of the rules which have been definitively agreed by the Inclusive Framework. This is for 2 reasons: • New Zealand is part of the IF consensus which has approved the Model Rules and Commentary. • If New Zealand does not have a complying IIR in place by 2024, it is likely that New Zealand headquartered groups will have to pay tax on any low-tax excess income under the GloBE rules in any case, by virtue of other countries enacting UTPRs. As a general proposition, an IIR will not be complying if it does not follow the Model Rules. 1.15 We are also consulting on whether New Zealand should apply the IIR to New Zealand source income of in-scope multinationals, by way of a domestic minimum top-up tax. 1.16 This consultation document is long and detailed. That is not surprising, given that it is attempting to both explain and consult on an entirely new income tax system. That system is designed to apply to the most complex businesses in the world, to be overlaid on top of every domestic income tax system in the world without giving rise to double taxation, and intended to be applied by 14 potentially scores of tax administrations at the same time. Furthermore, it is a system which reflects its genesis in a consensus-based project involving over 130 different countries. Officials hope that readers find this document helpful, but expect it will take most some time to get to grips with what is being proposed and its implications.

It also explains how this issues paper is organised. Purpose of the GloBE rules 2.2 As set out in Chapter 1, the GloBE rules are aimed at ensuring every in-scope group in the world pays tax at a rate of at least 15% on excess income in each country where income is reported. They do this by imposing a ‘top-up tax’ if an MNE’s effective tax rate in a country is below 15%. 2.3 The purpose of the rules is to significantly reduce the opportunity for groups to avoid tax by moving mobile income into countries with low tax rates or with rules which allow that income to enjoy a low effective tax rate. The rules are not intended to prevent countries from providing tax incentives in relation to a reasonable return on tangible investment and activities. This is the reason for the substance-based income exclusion. 2.4 The GloBE rules are not concerned with the allocation between countries of taxing rights on the income of multi-national groups. That is the subject of Pillar One of the 2 Pillar solution. Overview of the GloBE rules 2.5 This chapter provides a high-level overview of the GloBE rules, and an outline of the rest of this consultation document. The OECD has also produced an “Overview of the Key Operating Provisions of the GloBE Rules”, 3 the first page of which is in Appendix 1. 2.6 Chapter 3 discusses whether New Zealand should adopt the GloBE rules and the timing of that adoption if it does. 2.7 The GloBE rules only apply to MNEs whose consolidated annual revenues in two of the previous four years are at least €750 m illion. Details of the scope rules and exclusions are set out in Chapter 4. 2.8 The GloBE rules do not look at nominal or statutory tax rates, but effective rates. To work out if an MNE is subject to any top-up tax, the MNE has to calculate its effective tax rate (ETR) by comparing its tax in a jurisdiction with its accounting profit (with adjustments) for that jurisdiction. Chapter 5 explains how an MNE’s ETR is calculated, including how certain tax credits, such as Research and Development (R&D) tax credits and tax credits for supplementary dividends, are treated. 2.9 If an MNE’s ETR in a jurisdiction is less than 15%, it must calculate the top-up tax it has to pay with respect to each group member in that jurisdiction. It does this by taking its adjusted accounting profit for the jurisdiction, subtracting the 3 The full 6- page document is available at https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/pillar-two-GloBE- rules-fact-sheets.pdf 16 substance-based income exclusion (broadly, a 5%return on the tangible assets and payroll expenses in the jurisdiction 4 ), and multiplying the result by the difference between its ETR and 15%. The resulting amounts are then allocated to the profitable group members in the country. These rules for calculating the top-up tax ar e explained in Chapter 6. 2.10 The obligation to pay top-up tax is then allocated between the MNE’s entities in countries that have implemented the GloBE rules according to the rules explained in Chapter 7. In combination, these rules ensure that any top-up tax arising is paid by the MNE, without causing double taxation. In summary, the key rules are: • Income Inclusion Rule (IIR). The IIR works on a ‘top-down’ basis, by imposing top-up tax on a parent entity in an MNE. The top-up tax will usually be imposed on the MNE’s ultimate parent entity (UPE), if that parent is resident in a jurisdiction that has a qualified IIR. 5 There are also ordering rules that may apply if it does not, or if the group’s low-taxed entities are more than 20% owned by minority investors outside the group. • Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR). The UTPR is a backstop to the IIR. If top- up tax is not fully allocated to parent entities under a qualified IIR, the top-up tax may instead need to be paid by the group’s other entities, located in jurisdictions with a UTPR. This ensures that if a jurisdiction decides not to implement the GloBE rules, MNEs cannot avoid paying the minimum 15% tax simply by moving their headquarters to that jurisdiction. 2.11 Chapter 8 explains the transition rules that apply when the GloBE rules first come into effect, and when an MNE first comes within scope of the rules. 2.12 The OECD is expected to develop some simplification measures, including possible safe harbours, in 2022. Chapter 9 covers this work, including a safe harbour based on Country-by -Country Reporting (CbCR) that has previously been discussed. Implementation of the GloBE rules in New Zealand 2.13 Chapter 10 discusses the options for how the GloBE rules could be implemented into New Zealand’s domestic law and whether implementation should be by way of amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. 2.14 Chapter 11 discusses options for how the tax allocated to New Zealand under the UTPR should be brought to charge. 2.15 Chapter 12 considers how the rules will be administered in New Zealand. It contains proposals for the returns required to be filed, as well as how and when the tax payable under the rules should be paid. 2.16 Chapter 13 explains how the GloBE rules are proposed to interact with New Zealand’s imputation system. 2.17 Chapter 14 discusses a possible domestic minimum top-up tax, which would apply to low-tax New Zealand profits made by in-scope MNEs. 4 For an initial 10-year period the figures are higher than 5% and reduce over time to 5%. 5 A qualified IIR is, broadly, an IIR or similar set of rules that conforms with the requirements of the OECD GloBE rules. 17 2.18 Chapter 15 discusses how GloBE taxes paid to other countries should be treated for purposes of calculating income and tax liabilities of NZ taxpayers, on the basis that this may require some amendment to current law, whether or not New Zealand adopts GloBE rules. 18 CHAPTER 3 Should New Zealand adopt GloBE rules Overview 3.1 This chapter considers whether or not New Zealand should adopt GloBE rules, if a critical mass of other countries does so. It also briefly considers the issue of timing. Whether New Zealand should adopt GloBE rules 3.2 The GloBE rules will only work as intended if they are adopted by a critical mass of countries. A critical mass would be sufficient to ensure that MNEs generally cannot avoid the minimum tax by choosing where to locate themselves. This will be achieved, in relation to a particular MNE group, if the amount of tax that can be raised under the UTPR (that is, by denying deductions in Pillar 2 countries) is at least equal to the required amount of top-up tax. Therefore officials currently do not see much benefit in New Zealand “going it alone” and adopting GloBE rules without that critical mass. 3.3 The question of whether New Zealand should adopt GloBE rules therefore presents a somewhat different set of issues from those that usually arise in considering the desirability of a tax measure. Generally the issues involve a comparison between a world with and without the measure. This requires consideration of the position of both affected taxpayers (and potential taxpayers) and New Zealand as a whole. However, the GloBE rules, and particularly the UTPR, are designed so that all MNEs will be subject to the rules, regardless of whether the top entity in the group, or any other group entity, is incorporated or tax resident in a country that has adopted the rules. 3.4 Accordingly, in-scope MNEs, including those headquartered or operating in New Zealand, will have the same liability under the GloBE rules whether New Zealand adopts the rules or not. Provided a critical mass of other countries adopt the rules, for in-scope MNEs, there is no world without the tax and compliance costs imposed by the rules. 3.5 The only impact for New Zealand from not adopting GloBE rules is that it forgoes the possibility of receiving any revenue from them. Non-adoption will not increase the competitiveness or reduce the compliance costs of New Zealand headquartered groups. Nor will it make New Zealand a more attractive destination for foreign MNE investment. 3.6 The amount of direct revenue at stake for New Zealand may be modest. Officials expect that around 20-25 New Zealand groups will be in scope, and that there will be relatively few foreign MNEs with a material portion of their employees or assets in New Zealand that are not already subject to an IIR or the US GILTI regime. 6 However, while few in number the in-scope New Zealand groups are very large businesses in a New Zealand context. And they may find it much easier to pay Pillar Two tax only to New Zealand under the IIR than to many other countries under their UTPRs. 6 It is likely that the GILTI regime will be treated as equivalent to an IIR, if the United States makes certain amendments to its regime. If it does not GILTI may instead be treated as a kind of CFC regime. 19 3.7 The same feature of the GloBE rules means that the rules will also provide a significant benefit to New Zealand even if we do not adopt them. This is the benefit of reducing the incentive for MNEs to shift profits out of New Zealand. Currently, MNEs can save as much as 28 cents in the dollar by moving income out of New Zealand into a zero tax country (imputation reduces the incentive for New Zealand groups to shift profits out of New Zealand, but has no effect on foreign groups operating in New Zealand). The GloBE rules should reduce this tax saving to a maximum of 13 cents in the dollar, and should thus reduce the incidence of such profit shifting. This is the main benefit of GloBE rules for New Zealand. 3.8 The above analysis assumes that GloBE rules will be enacted by a critical mass of countries, so that the UTPR is indeed an effective back-stop. The UK, Canada and EU countries are taking steps towards adopting the rules. If Australia also adopts the rules, that may constitute a critical mass, at least for New Zealand headquartered MNEs. 3.9 Another relevant consideration, particularly if there is some uncertainty about whether a critical mass of countries will adopt the rules, is that the GloBE rules are consistent with New Zealand’s approach to taxation of corporate income generally. The effect of the GloBE rules in reducing profit shifting is clearly in New Zealand’s interests, and this suggests that if New Zealand’s participation is of any significance, it should do its part to support adoption of the rules by enacting them itself. 3.10 Equity considerations may also be relevant. Both the current proposals, and the first round of BEPS reforms, are focussed on removing or reducing the tax planning opportunities enjoyed by MNEs by virtue of the fact that they are multinational, and can take advantage of tax-favourable regimes in a wide range of countries, as well as gaps where country rules are not co-ordinated. This is not the case for other businesses. The GloBE rules will reduce (though they will still not eliminate) the tax advantages enjoyed by MNEs over purely domestic New Zealand businesses. Reinforcing corporate taxation of MNEs will also play a role in ensuring that shareholders in these companies shoulder (indirectly) a greater share of national tax burdens. Officials’ view 3.11 The Government has not decided whether to adopt GloBE rules. Officials’ current view is that if a critical mass of countries adopts, or is highly likely to adopt, GloBE rules, we would recommend that New Zealand take steps to join them. This will ensure New Zealand rather than other countries collects the revenue from any undertaxed constituent entities of New Zealand headquartered groups. It will also ensure that New Zealand is seen to be playing its part in the global minimum tax project, which New Zealand can expect to benefit from significantly. Timing of adoption 3.12 According to the October statement, countries that wish to adopt Pillar Two should bring the IIR into law in 2022, to be effective in 2023, with the UTPR coming into effect in 2024. 3.13 If New Zealand decides to adopt GloBE Rules, legislation would need to be passed to incorporate the rules into domestic law. Options for how GloBE rules could be so incorporated are set out in Chapter 10. 20 3.14 It is hoped that a Bill would be enacted in 2023 following New Zealand’s generic tax policy process and legislative process, if the decision is made to adopt the rules. Questions for submitters • Do you think New Zealand should adopt the GloBE rules, if a critical mass of other countries does or is likely to do so? • Do you have any comments about what a critical mass of countries would be? • Do you have any comments on the timing of adoption? 21 PART II: Explaining the Model Rules 23 CHAPTER 4 Scope Overview 4.1 The GloBE rules only apply to MNEs that meet the €750 million revenue threshold (“large MNEs”). This is because large MNEs are generally more able to shift income to low-taxed jurisdictions. Limiting the scope of the rules to large MNEs can significantly reduce administration and compliance costs, while retaining most of the benefits. 4.2 The GloBE rules do permit New Zealand to apply the IIR to MNEs headquartered in New Zealand that fall below the €750 million revenue threshold. New Zealand could choose to apply a lower revenue threshold, or adopt an additional threshold based on other criteria such as assets or taxable income. The Government does not propose doing this. However, submitters’ views are sought on the issue. 4.3 Even when an entity is a member of a group that is within scope of the GloBE rules, the entity itself may be excluded (meaning both that its low-tax income is not subject to top-up tax, and that the entity will not have GloBE tax imposed upon it). Examples of excluded entities are governmental entities, non-profit organisations and some investment funds. The gross revenue of these group entities is still counted for purposes of determining whether the group exceeds the threshold or not. MNE groups and their members 4.4 An ‘MNE group’ is a group with at least one entity or permanent establishment (PE) that is not located in the jurisdiction of the UPE. A large group that is located entirely within one jurisdiction with no offshore subsidiaries or PEs is therefore outside the scope of the GloBE rules. On the other hand, a single company could be an MNE group if it has an offshore PE. 4.5 A member of an MNE group is referred to as a ‘constituent entity’ of the group. A PE can be a constituent entity, even though most PEs are not legally entities. In this consultation document, the term ‘entity’ includes PEs. 4.6 The UPE of a group is the entity that owns, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in any other entity, but is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by another entity. The UPE is important because the IIR is applied at the UPE level in the first instance (if the UPE’s jurisdiction has a qualified IIR), and the UPE’s consolidated financial statements determine what entities are within the group. 4.7 Entities that are related through ownership or control such that their financial results are included in the UPE’s consolidated financial statements on a line-by - line basis are included in an MNE group. 7 Interests in entities that the UPE does not control will therefore not be included in the UPE’s MNE group (there are some special rules for joint ventures and minority owned entities). 7 An entity that is excluded from the UPE’s consolidated financial statements will still be part of the UPE’s MNE group if it is excluded on materiality grounds, or if the entity is treated as being held for sale. 24 Revenue threshold 4.8 The GloBE rules apply to MNEs that have consolidated annual revenues of at least €750 million in at least two of the last four fiscal years. The fiscal year is the period covered by the group’s consolidated financial statements. 4.9 The €750 million revenue threshold is the same threshold used to determine whether an MNE group has to comply with Country-by -Country Reporting (CbCR) rules. So MNEs that have to comply with CbCR will have to apply the GloBE rules. 4.10 Special rules exist to address situations where: • an MNE does not prepare consolidated financial statements • an MNE does not have four years of consolidated financial statements • one of the preceding fiscal years taken into account for the revenue threshold is for a period other than 12 months, and • an MNE has undergone a merger or demerger. Alternative domestic threshold 4.11 Although the GloBE rules apply to MNEs that meet the €750 million revenue threshold, the October statement allows countries to apply the IIR to MNEs headquartered in their own country, even if they do not meet this €750 million threshold. New Zealand could therefore choose to set a lower revenue threshold (likely denominated in NZD), or a threshold based on different criteria altogether (for example, total assets or taxable income). 4.12 Setting an alternative domestic threshold would mean that if an MNE headquartered in New Zealand had foreign subsidiaries or PEs that were taxed below 15%, New Zealand could apply a top-up tax under the IIR to bring their effective tax rate up to 15% as long as that MNE met the alternative domestic threshold. 4.13 However, a key reason for implementing the IIR is to prevent other countries from taxing the profits of New Zealand MNEs under the UTPR or their own IIR. This reason does not apply to MNEs that do not meet the €750 million revenue threshold, as their profits would not be subject to another country’s UTPR or IIR even if New Zealand did not apply the IIR. 4.14 Many countries considered that the €750 million revenue threshold struck the right balance between achieving Pillar Two’s policy objectives and reducing compliance and administrative costs involved in applying the GloBE rules. For MNEs below the €750 million revenue threshold, these costs are more likely to be disproportionate to the tax revenue raised, particularly as these MNEs may not have developed systems for CbCR and applying the IIR is likely to be harder without such systems in place. 4.15 In addition, New Zealand has controlled foreign company (CFC) rules that already tax some profits of New Zealand MNEs’ foreign subsidiaries as they are earned. Income taxed under the CFC rules is taxed at ordinary New Zealand income tax rates (28% if earned in a company), rather than the minimum 15% set by the GloBE rules. 4.16 The CFC rules balance competing considerations. On one hand, they reduce incentives for New Zealand MNEs to move profits that could be earned in New Zealand offshore. On the other hand, they seek to ensure that they do not 25 disincentivise MNEs from being based in New Zealand. If it is considered that New Zealand MNEs’ foreign subsidiaries are not sufficiently taxed, it may be better to amend the CFC rules than to create an alternative domestic threshold for the IIR. 4.17 Officials consider that applying the common €750 million revenue threshold, instead of an equivalent NZD threshold would improve co-ordination amongst countries. 4.18 For the above reasons, officials consider the €750 million revenue threshold is appropriate for applying the IIR in New Zealand and do not propose an alternative domestic threshold. Questions for submitters • Do you agree that New Zealand should not use an alternative domestic threshold to apply the IIR to MNEs headquartered in New Zealand? Why or why not? • If you think New Zealand should use an alternative domestic threshold, what should the threshold be based on and why? • Are there any difficulties in adopting a Euro threshold, rather than an equivalent NZ dollar threshold? Excluded entities Which entities are excluded 4.19 The following types of entities are excluded from the GloBE rules: • Governmental entities • International organisations • Non-profit organisations • Pension funds • Investment funds that are UPEs • Real estate investment vehicles that are UPEs 4.20 An entity owned by an excluded entity can also qualify as an excluded entity if it meets certain criteria relating to its ownership, assets and income. 4.21 An entity can elect not to be an excluded entity. An MNE may choose to do this so that the entity can apply the IIR to its subsidiaries instead of applying the UTPR to its constituent entities. Reason for exclusions 4.22 Governmental entities, international organisations, non-profit organisations and pension funds are excluded because for various reasons they are often afforded tax exemptions or other benefits, so they may have a low ETR for reasons unrelated to tax competition and profit shifting. 4.23 The reason investment funds and real estate investment vehicles are excluded entities if they are UPEs is because they are passive investment vehicles whose purpose is not to make profits from operating a business, but rather to pool 26 funds for investment purposes. Tax should be imposed either on the underlying businesses or on the real investors, rather than on the pooling vehicle. Generally tax on investment funds and vehicles is imposed at the investor level, rather than at the fund level. Effect of exclusion 4.24 Excluded entities are not subject to the IIR or UTPR. If an excluded entity is the UPE of the MNE, the IIR must be applied by the next entity in the ownership chain that is not an excluded entity. 4.25 An excluded entity’s financial results (including its profits, losses, taxes paid, tangible assets and payroll expenses) are also removed from most calculations required under the GloBE rules, including the ETR calculation. The exception to this is the revenue threshold described above. 4.26 The exclusions work on an entity basis, not a group basis. Other (non-excluded) entities in the same group as an excluded entity will still have to apply the GloBE rules if the group is in-scope. But if a group consists entirely of excluded entities, the group would not have to apply the GloBE rules at all. International shipping exemption 4.27 The GloBE rules exempt international shipping. The exemption applies to shipping income, rather than to shipping entities or groups (though entities or groups whose income is solely shipping income will effectively fall outside the rules). 4.28 The reason for the exemption is because in many jurisdictions, international shipping income is taxed under a special tax regime (for example, tonnage tax) rather than under the corporate income tax. The OECD Model Tax Convention similarly has a separate Article for international shipping income, which provides for taxation on a residence basis only. 4.29 The effect of the exemption is that international shipping income, as well as taxes paid in respect of that income, is excluded from the ETR calculations. However, international shipping income is still taken into account for purposes of determining whether an MNE meets the €750 million revenue threshold. 27 CHAPTER 5 Calculating the effective tax rate Overview 5.1 Pillar Two charges top-up tax where a MNE’s excess profits in a jurisdiction are taxed below the minimum 15% rate. Calculating the ETR requires first a calculation of the income in a jurisdiction, and second a calculation of the tax on that income. 5.2 This chapter explains the different components of the ETR calculation in Chapters 3 and 4 of the Model Rules. It sets out the main features of the rules and notes special rules that apply in particular circumstances. The Effective Tax Rate 5.3 The ETR for a jurisdiction is the total tax divided by the total profit in that jurisdiction. There are detailed rules prescribing what taxes can be included in this calculation, which are referred to as ‘covered taxes’, and how to calculate the profit in the jurisdiction, which is referred to as ‘GloBE income’. 5.4 In-scope MNEs must calculate their ETRs for each jurisdiction annually. Calculating the ETR for a jurisdiction broadly involves four steps. 5.5 First, the MNE has to identify its constituent entities in the jurisdiction. The Model Rules set out how to work out which jurisdiction an entity is located in. 5.6 Second, the MNE has to work out the GloBE income or profit of each constituent entity in the jurisdiction. This starts with an entity’s accounting profit. Adjustments are then made to the accounting profit to reflect the agreed GloBE base. Some adjustments are mandatory while others are elective. There are also rules for allocating income between jurisdictions. 5.7 Third, the MNE must determine the covered taxes of the constituent entities in the jurisdiction. This requires consideration of the types of taxes that count as ‘covered taxes’, and which year those taxes are allocated to. The starting point for calculating covered taxes is the accounting current tax expense. Adjustments are then made to the current tax expense, including an adjustment based on deferred tax to address timing differences between accounting and tax. There are also rules for allocating covered taxes between jurisdictions. 5.8 Lastly, the ETR is derived by aggregating covered taxes, and GloBE income and losses, of the constituent entities in a jurisdiction. The total taxes are divided by the total net GloBE income to get the ETR for the jurisdiction. 5.9 These steps are discussed in more detail below. Step 1: Identifying the constituent entities in a jurisdiction 5.10 The GloBE rules calculate the ETR for a jurisdiction as a whole. This ensures that a MNE with a high ETR in a jurisdiction does not suffer a top-up tax because of an isolated low-tax entity whose low level of taxation could be a function of its relationship with other entities in the jurisdiction. 5.11 Chapter 10 of the Model Rules determines where an entity is located. Most constituent entities will be located in the jurisdiction where they are tax 28 resident. Where a constituent entity is not tax resident in a jurisdiction, it will be located in the jurisdiction where it was created, for instance where it was incorporated. 5.12 Specific rules locate tax transparent entities, like partnerships and permanent establishments (PEs), for the purposes of the ETR calculations and charging provisions. 5.13 The Model Rules distinguish between transparent entities and their owners. Transparent entities are treated as constituent entities in the Model Rules and are generally treated as ‘stateless’ entities. This means their ETR is calculated separately and without blending their income or tax with other entities. There is an exception to this rule where the transparent entity is required to apply an IIR, or it is located at the top of the MNE group. 5.14 While transparent entities are treated as separate entities and included in the MNE group, there are rules for allocating their income and taxes which are covered below. 5.15 Permanent establishments are generally located in the jurisdiction where they are treated as a PE and subject to net basis taxation, but there are rules to address exceptional situations. 5.16 The Model Rules include a tie-breaker provision if a constituent entity would otherwise be located in more than one jurisdiction. Step 2: GloBE income for each constituent entity 5.17 The next step is to calculate a constituent entity’s GloBE income. The starting point is the entity’s financial accounting profit, which is then subject to adjustments that Inclusive Framework countries agreed are desirable to reconcile the most important differences between accounting and tax definitions of profit. These adjustments are intended to bring the GloBE base more into line with a measure of taxable profit so that the ETR provides a reasonable measure of the level of effective taxation in that jurisdiction. 5.18 There are also rules to appropriately allocate certain types of income between jurisdictions. Accounting profit 5.19 The calculation of a constituent entity’s GloBE income starts from its financial accounting income. The general rule is that this income should be calculated according to the accounting standard of its UPE and therefore reflects the amount which feeds into the UPE’s consolidated financial statements before consolidation adjustments. 5.20 This is subject to a requirement that the UPE prepares its accounts under an acceptable accounting standard, or that it adjusts any material differences in its accounting treatment of an item that could result in the MNE obtaining an unfair competitive advantage when compared with the IFRS treatment. NZ IFRS is an acceptable accounting standard for the purposes of the GloBE rules. 5.21 The Model Rules recognise there are situations where it may not be practicable to accurately calculate the entity’s accounting profit in the UPE’s accounting standard. 5.22 In these cases, the MNE is permitted to calculate the entity’s income based on the accounting standard it uses to prepare its own financial statements. This is 29 subject to the information being reliable, and an adjustment being made for any permanent differences in excess of €1m between the entity’s accounting standard and the accounting standard of the ultimate parent. Question for submitters • Do you have comments on the practicalities of using a constituent entity’s accounting profit as the starting point for calculating Globe income? Adjustments to accounting profit 5.23 Once the MNE has computed the financial accounting income of the constituent entity, the next step is to make the required adjustments. 5.24 These adjustments generally reflect significant differences between accounting and tax measures of profit which do not reverse out over time. There are separate rules to address timing differences in when income and expenses are recognised for accounting and tax, which are covered further below. Mandatory adjustments 5.25 These adjustments include: • Adding back covered taxes, and some other amounts of tax, accrued as an expense. • Removing dividend income from >10% shareholdings and <10% shareholdings which are held for more than 12 months. • Removing gains or losses from changes in fair value of >10% shareholdings. • Removing the profit or loss from an equity interest accounted for under the equity method. • Removing gains or losses from the sale of >10% shareholdings. • Including any revaluation gains or losses that are reported in other comprehensive income, where those gains and losses are on property, plant and equipment that is accounted for under the revaluation model. • Removing gains and losses in relation to a reorganisation where the gain or loss is deferred for local tax purposes. • Adjustments to deal with foreign exchange gains and losses created by differences between the tax and accounting functional currencies. • Removing any deductions for illegal payments such as bribes and kickbacks, as well as fines or penalties greater than or equal to €50,000. • Including prior period adjustments to accounting profit to correct accounting errors, provided the correction does not result in a material decrease in a prior year tax liability, and including prior period adjustments relating to a change in accounting principle or policy. • Adjustments to address differences between the tax and accounting treatment of defined benefit pension schemes. 30 Elective adjustments 5.26 There are also certain elections available to the MNE group. These include elections to: • Remove profits and losses from intragroup transactions within the same jurisdiction between entities included in a tax consolidated group. • Replace the accounting expenses in relation to share-based payments (for example, for employee remuneration paid in share options) with the deduction for tax purposes in the relevant jurisdiction. • Include gains and losses on assets and liabilities subject to fair value or impairment accounting on a realisation basis, and exclude any pre- realisation gains and losses from fair value movements or impairments. • Offset a net realised gain on local tangible assets against a net realised loss on local tangible assets in the 4 preceding years, and spread any remaining net realised gain equally over the current year and 4 preceding years. 5.27 The election to spread back a net realised gain on local tangible assets should be useful in a jurisdiction such as New Zealand that does not tax some capital gains (though gains on sales of shares in companies more than 10% owned are already excluded from the GloBE base). The election will allow untaxed gains to be matched against prior year untaxed losses. It will also allow the imposition of tax in excess of the 15% rate in the look back years to reduce or eliminate any GloBE liability that would otherwise arise from the untaxed gain. 5.28 The policy justification for this election is that the increase in value of the asset likely accumulated over a period of years and therefore, spreading the gain over a maximum period of five years, and matching it with losses from similar property, provides a better measure of whether the MNE has been subject to a minimum level of tax in a jurisdiction over that period. Special rule for incentive tax credits 5.29 There is a special rule that prescribes the treatment of government incentives delivered as credits via the tax system. This rule is intended to apply to incentives to engage in certain activities such as research and development. 5.30 Where an incentive tax credit is designed so that it must be paid in cash or cash equivalents within four years it can be treated as income for Pillar Two purposes instead of as a reduction to covered taxes. The policy reason for this is that these types of refundable tax credits share features of government grants which form part of income, and they should be treated in the same way given that they are in effect government support for a certain type of activity that can ultimately be received in cash or cash equivalents. This treatment results in a higher ETR than if the credit is treated as a negative tax. If a tax credit is designed so that it must partially be refunded within four years, it is only treated as income to the extent the refundability design requirement is satisfied. Whether a tax credit is designed so that it must be refunded within four years is determined under the laws of each jurisdiction at the time the credit is granted. 5.31 New Zealand’s research and development tax credit is designed so that it must partially be refunded within four years. The portion that must be refunded within four years is the amount calculated under section LA 5(4B)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and referred to as the ‘maximum limit of the person’s refundability cap’ for the year in which the associated research and 31 development expenditure is incurred. Officials’ view is that under the Model Rules this amount can be treated as GloBE income and any remaining credit must be treated as a reduction to covered taxes (even if it gives rise to a tax reduction or other benefit within the 4- year period). This treatment is not expected to have a significant impact on the New Zealand ETRs for locally headquartered MNEs. Therefore we do not expect the GloBE rules to undermine the benefit of our R&D tax credit for locally headquartered MNEs. Special rule for intra-group financing arrangements 5.32 The rules include an anti-avoidance rule designed to counter intra-group financing arrangements that attempt to inflate the ETR in a low-tax jurisdiction without increasing the taxable income in the other jurisdiction (for example, through exploiting mismatches in the accounting treatment in the debtor and creditor). 5.33 The remaining adjustments are described in Chapter 3 of the Model Rules. Special rules for acquisitions and disposals 5.34 Articles 6.2 and 6.3 of the Model Rules provide special rules for calculating GloBE income (and covered taxes) when a constituent entity joins or leaves a group and when there are transfers of assets or liabilities. Special rules for Ultimate Parent Entities that are subject to a tax neutrality regime 5.35 There are also special rules in Chapter 7 of the Model Rules for calculating the GloBE income of a UPE that is subject to a tax neutrality regime, that is, a regime that achieves a single level of taxation on business income. Article 7.1 applies to a UPE that is a flow through entity and Article 7.2 applies to a UPE that is subject to a deductible distribution tax regime. 5.36 Article 7.2 will be relevant to a New Zealand co-operative UPE. It allows such a UPE to reduce its GloBE income (but not below zero) by the amount that is distributed as a deductible dividend within 12 months of the end of a f iscal ye ar if the dividend recipient is: • subject to tax on the dividend at a nominal rate that equals or exceeds 15% within 12 months of the end of the group’s fiscal year • a natural person that is a tax resident in the UPE country and holds an ownership interest in the UPE of 5% or less, or • resident in the UPE country and is a Governmental Entity, International Organisation, Non -profit Organisation or Pension Fund that is not a Pension Services Entity. Questions for submitters • Do you have comments on the practicalities of using a constituent entity’s accounting profit as the starting point for calculating Globe income? • Do you have comments on the adjustments made to the accounting profit? • In particular, are there any uncertainties that could be clarified in New Zealand’s domestic legislation while respecting the intended outcomes in the Model Rules? 32 Allocating income between jurisdictions 5.37 The GloBE rules are designed to ensure that MNEs pay tax at a rate of 15% on their profits in each jurisdiction (after taking into account a substance-based carve-out). This means tax imposed at a high rate on profits in one jurisdiction cannot be used to credit low-taxed profits in another jurisdiction. Allocating profits appropriately between jurisdictions is consequently integral to the GloBE rules. 5.38 The Model Rules achieve this through: • Valuing cross-border intragroup transactions in accordance with the arm’s length principle, where this is different to the transfer price used for accounting. • Requiring financial accounting profits to be allocated between a PE and its head office entity based on the attribution of income and expenses to the PE for tax purposes (there are special allocation rules that apply to PEs of entities subject to a worldwide tax system such as New Zealand’s). • Allocating the income of a tax transparent constituent entity (when not attributable to a PE) to its owners to the extent that the owners also treat the entity as tax transparent (that is, tax the income) or are not members of the MNE group. 5.39 Further work is still to be done at the OECD to determine the interaction of Pillar 1 and the GloBE rules. The issue is deciding the jurisdiction in whose ETR taxes imposed on Pillar One income should be included, and ensuring that they are matched so far as possible with the income on which the taxes are imposed. Allocating Pillar 1 income to the country where the tax permitted under Pillar 1 is imposed would be the same treatment as applies to income earned through a branch. A possible objection to this is that it may not be possible to identify the entities whose income should, for GloBE ETR purposes, be reduced to compensate for this allocation. On the other hand, if it is not possible to identify those entities, then it seems difficult to envisage how double taxation of income taxed under Pillar One will be avoided. Officials welcome submissions on this issue. Questions for submitters • Do you have comments on the rules for allocating profits between jurisdictions including whether there are any uncertainties around how the rules operate that could be further clarified in domestic law? • Do you have any comments on whether profits that have been reallocated for Pillar 1 purposes should be similarly reallocated under the GloBE rules? Step 3: Determine the taxes paid by constituent entities Covered taxes 5.40 The next stage in the ETR calculation is to determine the taxes paid by the constituent entity. These are referred to as covered taxes in the Model Rules and are generally limited to taxes on net income. 5.41 This limitation reflects that the GloBE rules are intended to ensure a minimum level of tax is paid on the profit in each jurisdiction. It follows taxes should only be included in covered taxes when they are levied on a measure of income. 33 5.42 This means corporate income taxes will generally be covered taxes. However, where an income tax is refundable or creditable to the beneficial owner of a dividend distributed by a constituent entity (for example, by way of imputation) it will only qualify as a covered tax if the credit is provided: • under a foreign tax credit regime by a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction which imposed the income tax • to a beneficial owner of the dividend that is subject to tax on the dividend, at a rate that equals or exceeds the minimum rate, in the jurisdiction which imposed the corporate income tax • to an individual beneficial owner of the dividend who is tax resident in the jurisdiction which imposed the income tax and who is subject to tax on the dividend, or • to a governmental entity, international organisation, resident non-profit organisation, resident pension fund, resident investment entity that is not a group entity, or a resident life insurance company to the extent that the dividends are received in connection with a pension fund business and subject to tax in a similar manner as a dividend received by pension fund. 5.43 The Model Rules refer to an income tax that is charged under a qualifying imputation system as a Qualified Imputation Tax. New Zealand’s corporate income tax meets the definition of a Qualified Imputation Tax and is therefore a covered tax. Australia’s corporate income tax is similarly a covered tax. 5.44 Withholding taxes and other taxes which are imposed in lieu of a corporate income tax are also covered taxes. Taxes on payroll or sales will not be counted. New Zealand’s goods and services tax is not a covered tax, as it is not charged on a measure of income. Calculating covered taxes for the relevant year 5.45 Having established which taxes qualify, the next step is to determine the amount of those taxes in the relevant year. The Model Rules look first to the current tax expense recorded in the financial statements to determine the amount of covered taxes that have been paid. 5.46 This amount is adjusted , for example to exclude any tax which is paid in respect of income that has been excluded from GloBE income, to exclude current tax accrued in relation to an uncertain tax position, and to add any covered taxes that have been treated as an expense in the accounts. 5.47 An adjustment is also required where an amount of covered tax is refunded or credited to a group entity and the refund or credit is not treated as a reduction to the current tax expense in the financial accounts. An example of this in a New Zealand context is a tax credit for a supplementary dividend which is typically accounted for directly in equity instead of as a reduction to the current tax expense. An adjustment will be required for GloBE purposes to reduce the current tax expense by the amount of this credit. 5.48 The remaining adjustments are described in Chapter 4 of the Model Rules. Refundable tax credits 5.49 As discussed above, the treatment of incentive tax credits in the Model Rules depends on their refundability. Tax credits that are designed in such a way that they must be refunded within four years are referred to as a Qualified Refundable Tax Credit and are treated as GloBE income. Refundable tax credits that do not satisfy this refundability requirement are referred to as Non- 34 Qualified Refundable Tax Credits and are treated as a reduction to covered taxes. 5.50 This means an adjustment must be made to increase covered taxes where a Qualified Refundable Tax Credit is accounted for as a tax credit or to reduce covered taxes where a Non-Qualified Refundable Tax Credit is accounted for as income. Questions for submitters • Do you have comments on the rules on Covered Taxes including whether there are any uncertainties around how the rules operate that could be further clarified in domestic law? • Do you have any comments on the views outlined above on how tax credits for supplementary dividends are treated under the Model Rules? Timing differences 5.51 The Model Rules also include rules that are designed to address circumstances where profits are taxed in a different period to when they are recognised in GloBE income. These differences typically arise from differences in when income and expenses are recognised for accounting and tax purposes. For example, capital assets are often depreciated at different rates. 5.52 Without rules to address these differences, a MNE could suffer a top-up because it appears to be low-taxed, when in fact the income has been taxed in a different period from the one in which it has been recognised for purposes of the ETR calculation. While this deferral can be of significant benefit if it is long term, the Model Rules have been designed generally (but not always) so that timing benefits do not give rise to the imposition of tax. At least in part this was to avoid the need to provide refunds of GloBE tax. 5.53 The Model Rules address this issue using an approach based on deferred tax accounting. Deferred tax accounting is an accounting concept which seeks to match taxes to the period when the income or expenses are recognised for accounting purposes. It does this by shifting the tax expense from the year the tax is paid to the years in which the income or expenditure is recognised in the financial statements. 5.54 In the Model Rules, this means the covered taxes are adjusted by the constituent entity’s deferred tax income or expense in the period. Example 1: Timing differences A constituent entity accrues a current tax expense of $10 for Fiscal Year 1 and a deferred tax expense of $5 due to a temporary difference between accounting and tax which resulted in a deferred tax liability of $5 being recognised. The deferred tax expense of $5 is added to the current tax expense of $10 to give $ 15 of covered taxes for Fiscal Year 1. The temporary difference reverses in Fiscal Year 2 resulting in an increase to the current expense for this year of $ 5 and a decrease to the deferred tax expense of $5, that is, the deferred tax liability of $5 unwinds. The decrease in the deferred tax expense in Fiscal Year 2 offsets the increase 35 in the current tax expense. So if there was a current tax expense for year 2 of $10, the decrease in the deferred tax expense in that year would be deducted from this to give covered taxes of $5. Recognising the deferred tax expense in each year effectively brings forward the $5 of tax relating to the temporary difference to the year when the deferred tax liability is first recognised (rather than the year when the tax is actually paid). 5.55 There are some modifications to an entity’s deferred tax accounting used in its financial statements, which ensure the outcomes are appropriate for the GloBE. Revaluing deferred taxes 5.56 The Model Rules require the deferred tax expense for financial reporting purposes to be valued at the lower of the minimum rate and the applicable tax rate. This ensures that there is no top-up in respect of the timing difference where the local tax rate is above the minimum rate, without enabling additional upfront credits for DTLs to shelter other exempt income in that year. Example 2: Revaluing deferred taxes A constituent entity has a temporary difference between accounting and tax of $100 for the Fiscal Year due to immediately expensing an asset under the local tax rules where it is resident. The local tax rate is 28% so the constituent entity recognises a deferred tax liability of $28 for accounting purposes which increases the deferred tax expense by $28. This deferred tax expense must be recast to the minimum rate for GloBE purposes ($100 temporary difference x 15% = $15) which means covered taxes can only be increased by $15 due to deferred tax. 5.57 The Model Rules also exclude certain types of deferred tax movements. These include deferred tax movements in respect of income or expenses that are excluded from GloBE income and deferred tax from uncertain tax positions. The recapture 5.58 There is a recapture rule for deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) which applies when a DTL has not unwound within five years of the Fiscal Year in which the DTL was originally recognised. 5.59 When the recapture applies, the MNE group is required to recompute its ETR in the year the DTL was originally recognised. This ETR is recalculated without the DTL. If the revised ETR results in a top-up, this top-up is added to the top-up in the current year. 5.60 Some types of timing difference are exempt from the recapture rule. These include those in respect of: • Accelerated depreciation on tangible assets. • Fair value accounting. • Research and development expenses. 36 These timing differences do not need to be recaptured even if it takes longer than five years for the DTL to unwind. Losses 5.61 The timing difference rules also address tax losses. These rules are similarly based on deferred tax accounting, which means covered taxes are reduced (potentially to a negative number) in the year the local tax loss arises and a deferred tax asset (DTA) is recognised. Covered taxes are then increased in the year that the loss is utilised, and the DTA unwinds. This is done by taking account of the deferred tax expense accrued in the financial accounts, which could be a positive or negative figure. Example 3: Losses A constituent entity has a tax loss and GloBE loss of $100 in Fiscal Year 1. The local tax rate is 15% so the constituent entity recognises a loss deferred tax asset in this year of $15 ($100 tax loss x 15%). In Fiscal Year 2, the constituent entity earns $100 of net income for local tax purposes (before tax losses brought forward) and $100 of GloBE income. For accounting purposes, there is no current tax expense in Fiscal Year 2 because the tax loss brought forward of $100 reduces taxable income to zero, but a deferred tax expense of $15 is recognised because the loss deferred tax asset is written off when the tax loss is used. The deferred tax expense increases covered taxes by $15 in Fiscal Year 2. As a result, there would be no top-up tax in Fiscal Year 2 (or Fiscal Year 1) 5.62 As the DTA is based on the tax loss available under the tax rules of the local jurisdiction, there are further rules to ensure the appropriate relief is given. 5.63 For example, the DTA could be based on an economic loss which would also be recognised in the GloBE income or loss. These losses are rightly recognised in the Model Rules to prevent top-up taxes being applied in a later (profit) year when the MNE has not made an economic profit over time. The loss could also be created by a timing difference between the accounts and the local tax system, in which case the accounting will recognise both a DTA and a DTL. Again, it is appropriate to recognise this. 5.64 However, the local tax loss could also be caused by certain features of that jurisdiction’s tax rules – for instance, if the jurisdiction exempted certain types of income from tax or provided tax deductions in excess of the cost incurred (‘super deductions’). 5.65 These local tax concessions are not intended to be recognised in the GloBE base and should ordinarily reduce the ETR when there is net GloBE income in the jurisdiction. However, without further rules, they would be incorporated in the GloBE base if they produced a local tax loss and the related DTA could be used for GloBE purposes. 5.66 There is consequently a special rule which identifies the amount of loss relief that would have been available in the jurisdiction if the DTA was based on the GloBE base rather than the local tax rules. Any losses in excess of that are deemed to be losses arising from permanent differences and give rise to an additional top-up for that year. 5.67 This ensures that MNEs receive appropriate relief in the GloBE rules for economic losses and for those created through timing differences, while preventing excessive relief when the loss arises from a permanent difference. 37 Example 4: Losses and permanent differences An MNE has one constituent entity in a jurisdiction which has a tax rate of 15%. This constituent entity has a GloBE loss for the Fiscal Year of $100 but a local tax loss of $200 because $100 of income earned is exempt for local tax purposes. The constituent entity recognises a DTA of $30 ($200 tax loss x 15% tax rate) in the Fiscal Year. Absent an adjustment, this DTA would increase covered taxes by $30 for GloBE purposes (when the tax loss is used in the future), sheltering $200 of GloBE income. This would not be appropriate because the constituent entity has only suffered an economic loss of $100. The Model Rules address this issue by charging additional top-up tax of $15 in the Fiscal Year (that is, in the year there is $100 of exempt income for local tax purposes). 5.68 There is also an election which allows an MNE to create a DTA for the purposes of the GloBE rules based on the GloBE loss in the jurisdiction multiplied by the minimum rate. This may be useful for MNEs with operations in zero tax countries, where the MNE would get no benefit under a system based on deferred tax. Questions for submitters • Do you have comments on the rules to address timing differences including whether there are any uncertainties around how the rules operate that could be further clarified in domestic law? Assigning taxes to a jurisdiction 5.69 As with the rules allocating income between jurisdictions, the Model Rules contain similar rules allocating certain covered taxes. These generally seek to assign the tax to the jurisdiction to which the income is allocated so that all of the taxes paid on this income are taken into account. 5.70 For example, taxes paid by a (head office) entity on the profits of its permanent establishments are assigned to the jurisdiction where the permanent establishment is located. Similarly, CFC charges are ‘pushed down’ to the CFC so that the tax and income are aligned. There are similar rules to assign taxes for transparent entities, hybrid entities and reverse hybrids. 5.71 There is a limit on the extent to which CFC tax charges and taxes on hybrid entities can be pushed down where the tax is charged in respect of passive income. In these cases, the tax can only be pushed down to achieve the minimum rate on that income. Any tax that is not pushed down is included in the covered tax calculation for the owner that was subject to the tax charge. 5.72 Withholding taxes are generally assigned to the constituent entity who recognises the income in its financial accounts rather than the entity that deducts the tax on payment. There is an exception for withholding taxes on dividends paid to other constituent entities, which also applies to net basis taxes on dividend income. Both of these taxes are assigned to the entity that paid the taxable distribution. The logic is that these taxes can be seen as an additional tax on the profit of the distributing entity. 38 Question for submitters • Do you have comments on the rules for assigning Covered Taxes to a jurisdiction? Step 4: Calculate the ETR 5.73 Finally, the ETR for a jurisdiction is calculated by dividing the total covered taxes for a jurisdiction (the aggregate of covered taxes in Step 3 for each constituent entity) by the total GloBE income in that jurisdiction ( the aggregate of the GloBE income or loss in Step 2 for each constituent entity). Example 5: The ETR calculation An MNE has two constituent entities in Jurisdiction A. Constituent Entity 1 has covered taxes of €6 million and GloBE income of €80 million for the current Fiscal Year, and Constituent Entity 2 has covered taxes of €4 million and GloBE income of €20 million. The MNE’s ETR for Jurisdiction A is 10% (covered taxes of €10 million/GloBE income of €1 00 million). On a standalone basis, Constituent Entity 1’s ETR is 7.5% (€6 million/€80 million) and Constituent Entity 2’s ETR is 20% (€4 million/€20 million). Constituent Entity 1’s low ETR is due to tax concessions in Jurisdiction A that apply to its business activity. The GloBE rules permit outcomes within a jurisdiction to be blended which means Constituent Entity 2’s excess taxes (that is, taxes in excess of 15%) are used to increase the ETR for jurisdiction A. Further special rules for calculating ETRs 5.74 There are special rules for calculating the ETR of stateless entities, joint ventures and minority-owned constituent entities. Stateless entities 5.75 The ETR is calculated for each individual stateless entity (for example, a reverse hybrid) without any blending with other entities. Investment entities 5.76 Chapter 7 of the Model Rules provides different rules for calculating the ETR of investment entities (that is, investment funds, insurance investment entities and real estate investment entities) which do not qualify as excluded entities. 5.77 Investment entities are required to calculate their ETR on a standalone basis without aggregating their results with other constituent entities in the jurisdiction. There is an exception to this standalone treatment – where more than one investment entity is located in the jurisdiction their results must be combined to compute the ETR for those entities. 5.78 The ETR calculation is also based on the MNE’s share of the GloBE income and covered taxes of the investment entity, and therefore excludes any income or taxes which belong to minority shareholders. 39 5.79 The MNE can elect to treat the investment entity as a transparent entity for the purposes of the GloBE where the owner of the investment entity is subject to tax on a mark to market basis on the fair value of its interest in the entity. Where the election is made, the income and any taxes associated with that income will be included in the owner jurisdiction’s ETR calculation. 5.80 Alternatively, an MNE can elect to apply the Taxable Distribution Method to investment entities. Under this method, an investment entity owner includes distributions it receives of the investment entity’s income in its GloBE income, and undistributed income is included in the GloBE income of the investment entity and subject to top-up tax at a rate of 15%. Further details of this method are in Article 7.6 of the Model Rules. Joint ventures 5.81 The GloBE rules also apply to Joint Ventures which are at least 50% owned by the MNE group, unless the Joint Venture is an excluded entity or is itself an MNE group in scope of the GloBE rules. 5.82 Article 6.4 of the Model Rules requires the Joint Venture to calculate the ETR and any top-up taxes of its Joint Venture subsidiaries which together are referred to as the JV group. This includes the entities which are consolidated in the Joint Venture’s consolidated financial statements or that would be if such statements were prepared. 5.83 The profits and taxes of the JV group are not blended with other constituent entities in the MNE group. The ETR of the JV group is calculated separately from the rest of the MNE group to address the practical challenges both the MNE Group and the Joint Venture would experience in computing a full jurisdictional ETR for entities both within and outside of the JV. Minority owned constituent entities 5.84 Financial standards can require entities to be consolidated even though the parent has less than 50% of the rights to profits. 5.85 For example, a UPE could own 51% of a constituent entity which owns 51% of a second constituent entity, giving the UPE control of the second constituent entity for accounting purposes despite only owning 26%. 5.86 The Model Rules include special provisions for entities where the ultimate parent holds 30% or less of the ownership rights in an entity it consolidates. 5.87 These rules require the ETR of these entities and their subsidiaries to be calculated separately from any other constituent entities in the MNE group. 40 CHAPTER 6 Calculating the top-up tax Overview 6.1 When the ETR in a country is below the 15% minimum rate, the next step is to determine how much top-up tax is owed in respect of each entity in the country. 6.2 To do this, MNEs must work out the top-up tax percentage, which is the difference between the minimum rate and the ETR in the jurisdiction. That top- up tax percentage is applied to the MNE’s GloBE income in the jurisdiction, after deducting a substance-based income exclusion, to calculate the jurisdictional top-up tax. Finally, the jurisdictional top-up tax is allocated amongst the constituent entities located in the jurisdiction. 6.3 This chapter explains these rules for calculating the top-up tax and allocating it amongst low tax constituent entities, which are in Chapter 5 of the Model Rules. The steps 6.4 There are several steps in the top-up tax calculation in the Model Rules: • Identify whether there is net GloBE income in a jurisdiction. • Calculate the ETR in jurisdictions with net GloBE income to identify low tax jurisdictions. • Compute the top-up tax percentage. • Calculate the substance-based income exclusion. • Deduct the substance-based income exclusion from the net GloBE income in the jurisdiction to determine the excess income. • Calculate the top-up tax in the jurisdiction by: – multiplying the excess income by the top-up tax percentage – adding any additional top-up tax calculated in respect of earlier years, and in respect of current year permanent differences when there is a GloBE loss in a jurisdiction, and – subtracting any taxes charged under a Qualified Domestic Minimum Tax in that jurisdiction. • Allocate the top-up tax for the jurisdiction among the constituent entities in that jurisdiction. 6.5 These steps are explained in more detail in the remainder of this chapter. Identifying the net GloBE income 6.6 As the GloBE rules apply a minimum tax on the profits in each jurisdiction, the first step is to determine the profit in a jurisdiction. This is calculated by simply adding together the GloBE income and GloBE losses of all the constituent entities in the jurisdiction. 41 6.7 If the result is positive, the ETR will need to be calculated for that jurisdiction. The only exceptions to this are when the jurisdiction qualifies for the de minimis exclusion (which will be the case when the average GloBE revenue (that is, gross income before expenses) and GloBE income (that is, net income) in the jurisdiction for the current and 2 prior years are below €10 m illion and €1 m illion respectively) or when the jurisdiction qualifies for a GloBE safe harbour (in Chapter 8 of the Model Rules and not yet developed). Calculating the ETR 6.8 The next step is to calculate the ETR for the jurisdiction following the process discussed in the previous chapter. The top-up tax percentage 6.9 The top-up tax percentage must be calculated when the ETR is below the 15% minimum rate. It is calculated simply by subtracting the ETR from the minimum rate and represents the additional tax rate that needs to be charged on the low taxed profits to bring the tax on those profits up to the minimum. Example 6: The top-up tax percentage This example is a continuation of example 5 in the previous chapter involving a MNE that has two constituent entities in Jurisdiction A. Constituent Entity 1 has covered taxes of €6 million and GloBE income of €80 million for the current Fiscal Year, and Constituent Entity 2 has covered taxes of €4 million and GloBE income of €20 million. The MNE’s ETR for Jurisdiction A is 10% (covered taxes of €10 million / GloBE income of €100 million). The top-up tax percentage for Jurisdiction A is calculated by subtracting the ETR of 10% from the GloBE tax rate of 15%. This results in a top-up tax percentage for Jurisdiction A of 5 %. Substance-based income exclusion 6.10 The top-up tax percentage is applied to the net GloBE income in the jurisdiction in excess of the substance-based income exclusion. This approach ensures that the substance-based income exclusion does not inappropriately increase the ETR in the jurisdiction. 6.11 The substance-based income exclusion is a formulaic carve out which excludes from top-up tax a reasonable return to the level of substance in the jurisdiction. This is based on a percentage of the MNE’s payroll costs and tangible assets in the jurisdiction, on the grounds that employment costs and tangible assets tend to be relatively immobile factors of production and are therefore reasonable proxies for substantive economic activities. The percentage 6.12 The substance-based income exclusion, or “ carve-out” will be 5% of the carrying value of the payroll costs and tangible assets in the jurisdiction. There is an increased amount in the transition period which begins from 1 January 2023 and lasts for 10 years. In this period, the carve-out for payroll costs is 42 10% in the first year and then is reduced by 0.2% per year for the first 5 Fiscal Years and 0.8% per year for the remaining 5 Fiscal Years. 6.13 The carve out for tangible assets is 8% in the first year and then is reduced by 0.2% in the first 5 Fiscal Years and 0.4% for the remaining 5 Fiscal Years. Payroll costs 6.14 The payroll carve out for a jurisdiction is based on payroll costs for a constituent entity that is located in the jurisdiction, for employees and independent contractors that perform activities for the MNE in that jurisdiction. 6.15 For this purpose, independent contractors include only natural persons and may include natural persons who are employed by a staffing or employment company but whose daily activities are performed under the direction and control of the MNE. Independent contractors do not include employees of a corporate contractor providing goods or services to constituent entities in the jurisdiction. 6.16 The payroll costs include employee benefits that provide a direct personal benefit to the employee like health insurance and pension contributions as well as wages and salary costs. Payroll taxes and social security contributions borne by the employer are also included. Tangible assets 6.17 The tangible asset carve out is based on the average of the opening and closing carrying value (net of accumulated depreciation) of tangible assets in the financial statements. The tangible assets which qualify include property, plant and equipment, natural resources (including land not held for sale, lease or investment) as well as licences for the use of immovable property or exploitation of natural resources. The asset must be located in the jurisdiction of the constituent entity that owns it. 6.18 Assets which are leased also qualify for the lessee, which provides consistency between owned and leased assets. Where an asset is leased from another group member, the asset will only be included in the jurisdiction of the lessee. 6.19 There are special rules to determine how the carve-out is allocated for permanent establishments in Article 5.3.6 and for transparent entities in Article 7.4.6 . Example 7: Calculating the substance-based income exclusion Continuing example 6, Constituent Entity 1’s payroll costs for activities performed in Jurisdiction A is €30 million for the current Fiscal Year, and its tangible assets located in Jurisdiction A have an average accounting carrying value for the current Fiscal Year of €170 million. Constituent entity 2 has no payroll costs or tangible assets. The substance-based income exclusion for Jurisdiction A is calculated as follows\* ((payroll costs of €30 million x 5%) + (tangible assets of €170 million x 5%)) = €10 million. Therefore €10 million would be deducted from the MNE’s GloBE income for Jurisdiction A for the purposes of calculating the income subject to top-up tax. \* The carve-out percentages have reduced to 5% in the year of the example. 43 Computing the top-up tax in the jurisdiction 6.20 The top-up tax for the jurisdiction is calculated by deducting the substance- based income exclusion from the Net GloBE income in the jurisdiction and then multiplying the result by the top-up tax percentage. Example 8: Computing the top-up tax Continuing example 7 , the MNE’s top-up tax for Jurisdiction A for the current Fiscal Year equals €4.5 million ((net GloBE income of €100 million – the substance-based income exclusion of €10 million) x the top-up tax percentage of 5%) 6.21 If an adjustment is made that results in a decrease to the liability for covered taxes in a prior year (for example, when a tax return is reassessed resulting in a reduction to the tax liability for a prior year), the GloBE rules require the ETR in the earlier year to be recalculated unless the decrease is less than €1 million, in which case it can be included in the current year. This includes when the recapture rule is applied to deferred tax liabilities which have not unwound within five years. When these recalculations result in an ETR falling below the minimum rate, the additional top-up tax for that year is added to the current year’s top-up and charged in the current Fiscal Year. Example 9: Decrease in covered taxes for a prior year Continuing example 8 , Constituent Entity 2’s Jurisdiction A income tax return for a prior year has been reassessed, resulting in a reduction in its local tax liability for the prior year of € 1.2 million but no change in its GloBE income for that year. The Jurisdiction A ETR and top-up tax is recalculated for this prior year resulting in additional GloBE top-up tax for the year of €1 million.\* This additional top-up tax of €1 million is added to the €4.5 million top-up tax for the current Fiscal Year resulting in total top-up tax for the current Fiscal Year of €5. 5 million. The GloBE return for the prior Fiscal Year is not reassessed. \* The reduction in the prior year local tax liability doesn’t result in a Euro-for -Euro increase in top-up tax because of the impact of the substance-based income exclusion in the prior year. 6.22 Some countries may decide to introduce a domestic minimum tax, or DMT, in response to Pillar Two, in order to collect themselves any top-up tax imposed on the profits of a group’s domestic entities. The top-up collected under a qualifying DMT is subtracted from the top-up tax charged under the GloBE rules. This means the DMT has a very different place in the rules from ordinary income taxes, which are included in the ETR calculation. A qualifying DMT reduces any top-up tax on a dollar-for -dollar basis whereas ordinary taxes are diluted by the substance-based income exclusion. 6.23 A DMT will be qualifying if it imposes an additional top-up tax to domestic entities and the top-up is calculated on the same basis as the GloBE rules. The possibility of a DMT for New Zealand is discussed in chapter 14. 44 Allocation of a jurisdiction’s top-up tax to constituent entities 6.24 The final step is to allocate the jurisdictional top-up tax to the individual constituent entities in the low tax jurisdiction. This paves the way for the final step in the process, which is for the tax allocated to the low tax entities to then be allocated under Article 2 of the Model Rules to the entities required to pay tax under the IIR and UTPR. 6.25 This allocation amongst the low tax constituent entities is necessary to deal with situations where some of the top-up tax is charged to an entity which is not the UPE. For example, if the UPE is not subject to a qualified IIR, the top- up tax may be collected through a combination of the IIR applied at different levels of the group structure and the UTPR (as described in the next chapter). Allocating the top-up tax to individual constituent entities ensures the different charging rules can be coordinated. 6.26 It is also necessary because the IIR is intended to collect top-up tax from a parent entity based on its interest in a low-taxed constituent entity. This means that where a parent applying the IIR does not wholly own a low-taxed constituent entity, it will only bear the cost of its proportional share of top-up tax. Allocating top-up tax to low tax constituent entities is an important step in achieving this outcome. 6.27 The GloBE rules generally allocate the top-up tax for a jurisdiction between the constituent entities located in the jurisdiction based on their proportion of the jurisdictional GloBE income. Example 10: Allocating top-up tax to constituent entities Continuing example 9 , the total top-up tax for Jurisdiction A for the current Fiscal Year of €5.5 million is allocated to each constituent entity located in Jurisdiction A based on its proportion of the net GloBE income for Jurisdiction A. Constituent Entity 1 is allocated €4. 4 million (Constituent Entity 1 GloBE income of €80 million / jurisdictional GloBE income of €100 million x top- up tax of €5.5 million). Constituent Entity 2 is allocated €1.1 million (Constituent Entity 2 GloBE income of €20 million / jurisdictional GloBE income of €100 million x top- up tax of €5.5 million). 6.28 There are special rules to deal with situations when top-up taxes are payable when there is no GloBE income in the jurisdiction, for example when all the top- up tax for the year relates to a recalculation of the ETR from an earlier year. Question for submitters • Do you have comments on the process for calculating top-up tax and attributing it to entities in a particular low tax jurisdiction? 45 CHAPTER 7 Imposition of top-up tax Overview 7.1 As outlined in Chapter 2, the IIR and the UTPR both allocate the liability to pay top-up tax between the MNE’s entities. 7.2 The 2 rules are designed to work together and are also coordinated to ensure the right amount of top-up tax is collected when multiple IIRs or UTPRs are applied at the same time in different jurisdictions. Therefore, both rules start from the same top-up tax calculation explained in Chapter 6, which allocates top-up tax amongst constituent entities in a low tax jurisdiction. 7.3 This chapter sets out the ordering rules that prescribe how the IIR and UTPR operate together, and how top-up tax is imposed on an MNE’s entities. The rules are in Chapter 2 of the GloBE rules. IIR ordering rules 7.4 The IIR takes the top-up tax calculated for a low-taxed constituent entity (LTCE) and then imposes this tax on a parent entity in the LTCE’s group. 7.5 When a parent applies the IIR, the amount of top-up tax it is charged is based on the amount of top-up tax calculated for the relevant LTCE multiplied by the parent’s allocable share of the LTCE’s income. 7.6 The allocable share is a measure of the parent’s rights to the profit of the LTCE and is calculated based on accounting principles. The test works by determining the proportion of the LTCE’s GloBE income that is attributable to the parent (that is, after adjustment for interests held by other owners). 7.7 The IIR is conceptually similar to a Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rule in that it charges a parent company tax which is calculated by reference to its subsidiary’s profits. However, the IIR is different from a CFC rule in a number of important ways. The top-down approach 7.8 There will often be MNE structures where more than one group entity has an interest in the LTCE. The GloBE rules establish: • which entities in the group apply the IIR, and • if more than one group entity applies the IIR in respect of the same LTCE, what adjustments are made to avoid over-taxation. Which entities apply the IIR 7.9 The GloBE rules include a priority order for applying the IIR. 7.10 The basic structure is a top-down approach. This means the UPE jurisdiction will usually have the first priority to charge the top-up tax in relation to low tax jurisdictions (other than the UPE jurisdiction itself, unless it is in a country that has adopted a domestic IIR). If the UPE is not subject to a qualified IIR, intermediate parent entities located in other jurisdictions and held directly by it (second tier entities) will apply the IIR to LTCEs in other jurisdictions to the 46 extent of their direct and indirect interest in those LTCEs. To the extent that this step does not result in the imposition of the full amount of top-up tax calculated under chapter 5 of the GloBE rules, third tier intermediate parent entities may have an IIR liability, and so on. Intermediate parent entities are entities that are controlled by the UPE and have an ownership interest in the LTCE, but investment entities are excluded. 7.11 Unless the split ownership rules apply (see below at \[7.14\]-\[7.17\]), an intermediate parent entity (lower IPE) will not apply its IIR if: • the UPE is subject to a qualified IIR, 8 or • another intermediate parent entity (higher IPE) that owns, directly or indirectly, a ‘controlling interest’ 9 in the lower IPE is subject to a qualified IIR. 7.12 If the higher IPE does not have a controlling interest in the lower IPE, the lower IPE’s IIR will not be switched off. As explained below, the lower IPE will charge its IIR, but the higher IPE must reduce its share of the top-up tax by the tax charged by the lower IPE. Adjustments if more than one group entity applies the IIR 7.13 If more than 1 parent entity in a group applies the IIR with respect to a LTCE, parent entities applying the IIR must reduce their own top-up tax liability by any top-up tax allocated to a parent entity further down the group structure. This prevents double allocation of the same top-up tax amount. Example 11: Multiple intermediate parents The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s low-taxed constituent entity (LTCE) is $100. The LTCE is 100% directly owned by Parent B. Parent A owns 20% of Parent B – it does not have a controlling interest. Both Parent A and Parent B are in jurisdictions with a qualified IIR. The UPE of the group is not in a jurisdiction with a qualified IIR. Since Parent A does not have a controlling interest in Parent B, both parents apply the IIR. However, since Parent B’s IIR will charge the full $100 of top-up tax, Parent A’s share of the top-up tax is reduced from $20 to nil. The full amount of top-up tax is charged to Parent B under the IIR. Exception: the split ownership rules 7.14 The split ownership rules are an exception to the IIR’s general top-down approach. Under the GloBE rules, an intermediate parent entity that is more than 20% owned by minority investors outside the MNE group is called a partially-owned parent entity (POPE). The POPE definition is satisfied even if minority investors indirectly own more than 20% of the ownership interests in 8 The exception to this is when there is a partially-owned parent entity (POPE), lower down the group structure. A POPE is a parent entity where at least 20%is held by minority shareholders. The split ownership or POPE rules are explained at paragraphs 7.14 to 7.17. 9 ‘Controlling interest’ is defined in the GloBE rules. Broadly, the GloBE definition means an ownership interest such that the parent is required to consolidate the subsidiary’s financials on a line-by-line basis in accordance with an acceptable financial accounting standard (or would have been required to, had it prepared consolidated financial statements). It does not mean an ownership interest over 50%. 47 the parent entity. A parent entity owned by a POPE will therefore usually also be a POPE. 7.15 POPEs have the priority rights to apply the IIR notwithstanding the general top- down approach. The reason for this is that, where there are substantial minority interests, some amount of the top-up tax would not be collected at all if the IIR were only applied by parent entities higher up the ownership structure. Example 12: Partially-owned parent entities (POPEs) The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s LTCE is $100. The UPE indirectly owns the LTCE through A Co. The UPE owns 60% of A Co and A Co owns 100% of the LTCE. Under the GloBE rules, A Co (and not the UPE) would apply the IIR and pay $100 of top-up tax. By charging all the top-up tax to A Co, the top-up tax is effectively borne 60% by the UPE and 40% by the minority shareholders. If this were not the case and only the UPE applied the IIR, the UPE would only be charged $60 of the top-up tax based on its allocable share. The remaining $40 would not be collected under either the UTPR or the IIR. 7.16 The ordering rules for POPEs require a lower-tier POPE to switch off its IIR only if it is wholly-owned by a higher POPE which is subject to the IIR. Example 13: POPE rules and corresponding tax reductions The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s LTCE is $100. The UPE indirectly owns the LTCE through a chain of POPEs. The UPE directly owns 75% of POPE A, with the remaining 25% held by minority investors outside the MNE group. POPE A directly owns POPE B (ownership percentage varies under the two examples below). POPE B directly owns 100% of the LTCE. POPE A owns 100% of POPE B If POPE B is 100% owned by POPE A, POPE A would apply the IIR and be charged $100 of top-up tax. POPE B would not be required to apply the IIR. UPE POPE A POPE B LT CE 100% Top-up tax = $100 75% ownership (25% minority owned) 100% 48 POPE A owns 90% of POPE B, with remaining 10% owned by outside investors If POPE B is only 90% owned by POPE A, both POPEs would apply the IIR. POPE B would be charged $100 of top-up tax. POPE A would also apply the IIR but its top-up tax liability will be reduced to zero by the amount of tax charged to POPE B. 7.17 As noted above, if a parent entity further down the group structure has applied the IIR, the liability of any parent further up the group applying the IIR must be reduced. The amount of the reduction is the top-up tax paid by the lower parent under an IIR multiplied by the higher parent’s ownership interests in the low taxed entity held indirectly through that lower parent. So for example if the lower parent pays top-up tax of $100 in respect of a low tax entity and the higher parent indirectly holds a 60% ownership interest in that same low taxed entity through the lower parent, then the amount of the reduction is $100 x 60% = $60. Example 14: Reduction for top-up tax charged to lower parent The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s LTCE is $100. The UPE indirectly owns the LTCE through a POPE Assume the POPE directly owns 100% of the LTCE, and the UPE directly owns 60% of the POPE, with the remaining 40% held by minority investors outside the group. UPE POPE LT CE Top-up tax = $100 60% ownership (40% minority owned) 100% Both the UPE and the POPE apply the IIR: • The POPE’s allocable share of the top-up tax is $100. • The UPE’s allocable share is initially $60 but this is reduced by the top- up tax paid by the POPE multiplied by the UPE’s ownership interest in the LTCE held indirectly through the POPE. This reduction equals $60 ($100 x 60% = $60), meaning the UPE has zero allocable share. This is appropriate because the top-up tax has already been fully charged to the POPE. 49 The UPE owns the LTCE both directly and indirectly through a POPE Assume the POPE owns 50% of the LTCE, and the UPE owns the other 50%. AS above, the UPE also directly owns 60% of the POPE with the remaining 40% held by minority investors outside the group. UPE POPE LT CE Top-up tax = $100 60% ownership (40% minority owned) 50% 50% Again, both the UPE and the POPE apply the IIR: • The POPE’s allocable share of the top-up tax is $50. • The UPE’s allocable share is initially $80, being $50 from its direct interest in the LTCE plus $30 from its indirect interest through the POPE (60% \* $50 = $30). The UPE reduces its top-up tax liability by $30 to $50, as the $30 from its indirect interest through the POPE has already been charged to the POPE. • The result is that the full $100 of top-up tax is collected. UTPR interaction with IIR 7.18 Like the IIR, the UTPR allocates top-up tax. The UTPR primarily functions as a backstop to the IIR. 10 It aims to ensure that top-up tax for an LTCE is paid even if its parent entities are located in jurisdictions without a qualified IIR. This eliminates the incentive for an MNE to headquarter in a country without an IIR. 7.19 As the UTPR is a backstop, the GloBE rules give the IIR priority over the UTPR in charging tax on low-taxed profits outside of the UPE jurisdiction. The UTPR therefore does not apply when all of the interests in the LTCE are held by parent entities subject to a qualified IIR. 7.20 The UTPR applies if some of the interests in an LTCE are not held by parent entities which are subject to a qualified IIR. However, any top-up tax collected under the UTPR is reduced by the amount which is charged under an IIR. This ensures the IIR takes priority. 10 It also ensures that any LTCEs in the UPE’s jurisdiction are subject to top-up taxation. 50 Example 15: Interaction between IIR and UTPR The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s LTCE is $100. The MNE’s UPE indirectly owns 100% of the LTCE, through two companies – A Co (which owns 60%) and B Co (which owns 40%). A Co is in a jurisdiction with a qualified IIR, B Co and the UPE are not. Applying the IIR, A Co’s allocable share of the top-up tax is $60. The remaining $40 of top-up tax is allocated to the MNE’s constituent entities under the UTPR. How the UTPR allocates top-up tax to different jurisdictions 7.21 Unlike the IIR which allocates top-up tax to entities by allocable share or ownership, the UTPR allocates top-up tax to jurisdictions based on where the group’s tangible assets and employees are located. 7.22 The UTPR uses an allocation key to allocate the top-up tax between the different jurisdictions in which the MNE has constituent entities. The top-up tax is only allocated to jurisdictions that have implemented a qualified UTPR (a ‘UTPR jurisdiction’). 7.23 The allocation is calculated at a jurisdictional level. The top-up tax is allocated based on the proportion of the tangible assets and number of employees in each UTPR jurisdiction. There are equal weights for the asset and employee factors. Example 16: UTPR allocation An MNE consists of one company (ParentCo) in jurisdiction P with permanent establishments in jurisdictions A, B, C, D and E. Jurisdiction P has not adopted the GloBE rules. Jurisdictions A, B, C, D and E have all adopted the GloBE rules and implemented the UTPR. The value of tangible assets and number of employees owned by the MNE located in each jurisdiction are: • Jurisdiction A: $400 million tangible assets, 500 employees • Jurisdiction B: $400 m illion tangible assets, 300 employees • Jurisdiction C: $100 m illion tangible assets, 200 employees • Jurisdiction D: $100 m illion tangible assets, no employees • Jurisdiction E: No tangible assets or employees. The MNE’s total value of tangible assets in all UTPR jurisdictions is $1 billion, and the total number of employees in all UTPR jurisdictions is 1,000. 51 Jurisdiction P has not adopted the GloBE rules. J urisdictions A, B, C, D and E have all adopted the GloBE rules and implemented the UTPR. The PE in Jurisdiction A is low tax, having a top-up tax amount under Article 5 of $100,000. The share of Jurisdiction A top-up tax allocated to Jurisdictions A, B, C and D under the UTPR is calculated as follows: • Jurisdiction A: 50% x (400m/1b) + 50% x (500/1,000) = 45% • Jurisdiction B: 50% x (400m/1b) + 50% x (300/1,000) = 35% • Jurisdiction C: 50% x (100m/1b) + 50% x (200/1,000) = 15% • Jurisdiction D: 50% x (100m/1b) + 50% x 0 = 5% • Jurisdiction E will not be allocated any top-up tax as it has no tangible assets or employees, even though it is a UTPR jurisdiction. 7.24 The data for this allocation can be taken from the MNE’s CbC report, provided the report is prepared in accordance with the GloBE rules’ definitions for Number of Employees and Tangible Assets. This will minimise the additional compliance burdens on MNEs and improve coordination by basing the calculation on existing, readily available, and objective data. 7.25 Once top-up tax has been allocated to a jurisdiction under the UTPR, the jurisdiction must decide in its own domestic laws how to collect that top-up tax from the MNE’s constituent entities in that jurisdiction. A proposal for how this could be done in New Zealand is outlined in Chapters 11 and 12. Questions for submitters • Do submitters have any comments on how the IIR ordering rules should be implemented in New Zealand? • Do submitters have any views on information or administration challenges with the split ownership POPE rules and how these challenges could be addressed in the implementation framework? • Do submitters have any comments on the interaction between the IIR the and UTPR and how it should be addressed in implementation? 52 CHAPTER 8 Transition Overview 8.1 Chapter 9 of the Model Rules sets out transitional rules. Some of these rules apply to all MNEs as they address transition issues arising from the fact that the GloBE rules are new. Other transitional rules apply to entities and groups when they first come within scope of the GloBE rules (for example, through organic growth or a merger), even if that occurs after the GloBE rules have been in place for some time. 8.2 An MNE’s transition year is determined on a jurisdictional basis. For a jurisdiction, the first fiscal year that the MNE comes within scope of the GloBE rules in respect of that jurisdiction is a “Transition Year”. An MNE may therefore have different Transition Years in respect of different jurisdictions. 8.3 The transitional rules described in this chapter: • Allow higher percentages to be used in calculating the substance-based income exclusion in the first 10 years of the GloBE rules. • Allow for a longer filing deadline in an MNE’s Transition Year. • Address the treatment of losses and other timing differences. • Provide temporary relief from the UTPR for MNEs in the initial phase of international activity. Substance-based income exclusion 8.4 As described above in Chapter 6 the percentages used in the substance-based income exclusion are higher for the first 10 years of the GloBE rules. 8.5 The percentages start at 10% for payroll costs and 8% for tangible assets, and taper down to the 5% rates over a 10-year period. For the fiscal year beginning 2033, the percentages are both 5%. Longer filing deadline in Transition Year 8.6 An MNE is normally required to file its GloBE return and other notifications within 15 months after the end of its accounting period. In an MNE’s Transition Year, this deadline is extended to 18 months. Losses and timing differences 8.7 Once an MNE becomes subject to the GloBE rules it will have to calculate its ETR in each jurisdiction where it operates. There may be losses and accounting- tax timing differences occurring before an MNE’s Transition Year that affect its ETR calculation in its Transition Year and later years. 8.8 For example, if an MNE’s pre-Transition Year losses were not taken into account at all, the MNE could have an inappropriately low ETR in a year when those losses are used to reduce local taxable income. 53 8.9 To prevent this, where there are losses and other timing differences arising before a Transition Year the MNE will generally be treated as though it were already subject to the GloBE rules at the time the losses or timing differences arose. This is done by taking into account existing deferred tax accounting attributes (including deferred tax assets from earlier losses) in the ETR calculation described in Chapter 5. Consistent with that treatment, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are generally taken into account at the lower of 15% and the applicable domestic tax rate. 11 8.10 The treatment of losses under the GloBE rules is described at paragraphs 5.61 onwards in Chapter 5. 8.11 Deferred tax assets generated after 30 November 2021 from items that are excluded from the GloBE base must be disregarded for GloBE purposes. In addition, the GloBE tax basis in assets acquired in an intragroup transaction after 30 November 2021 must be based on historical carrying values and related deferred tax assets and liabilities must similarly be determined based on historical carrying values. The purpose of this is to defeat inappropriate tax planning transactions. MNEs in the initial phase of international activity 8.12 There is temporary relief from the UTPR for MNEs in the initial phase of international activity. An MNE is in its “initial phase of international activity” if it has constituent entities in no more than six jurisdictions and has less than €50 m illion of tangible assets (by book value) outside of the jurisdiction in which it has the most tangible assets (again, by book value). The relief applies on an annual basis. 8.13 Because it does not apply for the IIR, this relief is only relevant for groups that are headquartered in a country that does not have an IIR, and even then, will be somewhat undercut if the group has a lower tier parent company in a country with an IIR. 8.14 The temporary relief expires after the MNE has been in scope of the GloBE rules for five years. This five-year period is not suspended if, for example, the MNE’s revenues decline so that it falls outside the scope of the rules during those five years. Example 17: Five-year limit to initial phase relief A multinational group (NewGroup) crosses the €750 million consolidated annual revenue threshold for the first time in its fiscal year ended 31 December 2030. Its consolidated annual revenues for the following four fiscal years are as follows: • 2031: €780 million • 2032: €600 m illion • 2033: €640 million • 2034: €720 million 11 If a deferred tax asset is recorded at a rate less than 15%, it may be taken into account at 15% if the MNE demonstrates that it was attributable to a loss under the GloBE base. 54 As explained in Chapter 4, the GloBE rules apply to MNEs that have consolidated annual revenues of at least €750 million in at least two of the last four fiscal years. The first year in which the GloBE rules apply to NewGroup is therefore 2032. Assuming NewGroup meets the other requirements for the initial phase relief from the UTPR, it will qualify for the relief in 2032 and the last year it can obtain the relief is for the 2036 year. It does not matter that NewGroup’s annual revenues fell below the €750 million threshold from 2032 to 2034. Optional provisions 8.15 The Model Rules contain an optional provision in Article 9.3.5 for implementing jurisdictions that is intended to reduce the risk of locally-headquartered MNEs establishing a new UPE in a jurisdiction without an IIR in order to take advantage of the initial phase relief. 8.16 Because the temporary relief only applies to the UTPR, a New Zealand- headquartered MNE in the initial phase of its international activity with LTCEs would still be charged top-up tax in New Zealand under the IIR (if New Zealand were to adopt one). If, however, it established a new UPE in a jurisdiction without an IIR, and transferred the LTCEs to that new UPE, it might not be charged top-up tax in respect of its LTCEs at all during the 5-year period it qualified for temporary relief. 8.17 The optional provision is intended to address this risk. If an MNE in the initial phase of international activity has most of its tangible assets in New Zealand, New Zealand would be the “Reference Jurisdiction” of the MNE Group. T he optional provision would allow the Reference Jurisdiction (that is, New Zealand) to collect the full amount of top-up tax arising in a low tax jurisdiction under the UTPR, no matter where the UPE is located. This is shown in example 18. Example 18: Inversion risk from initial phase relief NZGroup is a multinational group that started out in New Zealand. The UPE of the NZGroup is in New Zealand. Most of the group’s tangible assets by value are also in New Zealand, such that New Zealand is the Reference Jurisdiction for the group. The UPE of NZGroup has two wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, Sub A in Jurisdiction A and Sub B in Jurisdiction B. NZGroup becomes subject to the GloBE rules for the first time for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2030 and qualifies for initial phase relief. Sub B is a low-taxed entity and the top-up tax for Sub B is $100. Assume that New Zealand and Jurisdiction A have implemented the GloBE rules (both the IIR and the UTPR) but Jurisdiction B has not. If NZGroup’s UPE remained headquartered in New Zealand, the full $100 of top-up tax would be charged to the UPE under New Zealand’s IIR. 55 Assume NZGroup moved its UPE to Jurisdiction B: • If New Zealand did not adopt the optional provision in Article 9.3.5, NZGroup could avoid all liability for top-up tax during the initial relief phase. The IIR would not apply (as Jurisdiction B has not implemented the GloBE rules), but New Zealand and Jurisdiction A would not be allowed to collect the top-up tax in respect of Sub B under the UTPR either if NZGroup qualifies for initial relief. • If New Zealand adopted Article 9.3.5, New Zealand could collect the full $100 top-up tax under the UTPR as it is the Reference Jurisdiction for the Group. Moving the UPE to Jurisdiction B therefore does not change group’s top-up tax liability – it just means the top-up tax will be collected under the UTPR rather than the IIR. 8.18 Officials consider the optional provision in Article 9.3.5 should be adopted to mitigate the risk of New Zealand MNEs establishing UPEs in low-tax jurisdictions to take undue advantage of the temporary relief. Further sub-option 8.19 If New Zealand decides to adopt the optional provision in Article 9.3.5, there is a further sub-option in Article 9.3.5(a) of the Model Rules for New Zealand to limit the application of the UTPR to top-up tax arising in jurisdictions other than New Zealand. Adopting this sub-option would mean that, where New Zealand is the Reference Jurisdiction for an MNE, New Zealand will be able to collect top-up tax under the UTPR in respect of the MNE’s low-taxed entities located in any jurisdiction other than New Zealand. But top-up tax in respect of any low- taxed entities in New Zealand will not be collected by New Zealand, or any other jurisdiction. 8.20 The effect of this sub-option is to preserve the tax outcomes that arise under New Zealand tax law, even if those outcomes mean that a New Zealand MNE’s ETR is less than 15%. If this sub-option were not adopted, top-up tax arising in New Zealand during an MNE’s initial phase would be collected by New Zealand under the UTPR, even though no other country would be allowed to collect that tax. This is illustrated in example 19. Example 19: Effect of further sub-option in Article 9.3.5(a) • Assume the same facts as in Example 18, with the UPE in Jurisdiction B. • Sub B is still a low taxed entity and the top-up tax for Sub B is $100. However, assume now that Sub A is located in New Zealand and is also a low-taxed entity with top-up tax of $50. This happened even though New Zealand’s 28% company tax rate is well above the minimum 15% rate, because Sub A earned capital gains that are treated as GloBE income but are not taxed in New Zealand. • If New Zealand adopted Article 9.3.5 without the sub-option in paragraph (a), New Zealand would collect top-up tax for both Sub A and Sub B, totalling $150, under the UTPR as it is the Reference Jurisdiction for the Group. This effectively taxes the capital gains earned by Sub A. 56 • If New Zealand also adopted the sub-option in paragraph (a), New Zealand would collect $100 of top-up tax in respect of Sub B only. The top-up tax calculated for Sub A would be reduced to zero, because Sub A is also located in New Zealand. This preserves the non-taxation of the capital gains for Sub A. 8.21 Given the reality of the New Zealand economy and tax system, whether or not this provision should be adopted is a largely academic question. Officials suggest that in the interests of simplicity it be adopted, since it produces the same result as would have applied if the MNE were headquartered in New Zealand (the UTPR would not have applied due to 9.3.1, and the IIR does not apply to domestic profits). This is without prejudice to the question of whether New Zealand should adopt a domestic top-up tax, considered in a later chapter. Questions for submitters • Do submitters have views on how the transitional rules work? • Do submitters agree that New Zealand should adopt the optional provision in Article 9.3.5? If no, why not? • Do submitters agree that, if New Zealand adopted the optional provision, it should also adopt the further sub-option in Article 9.3.5(a) if it does not adopt a domestic top-u p tax? Why or why not? 57 CHAPTER 9 Simplification 9.1 The OECD will be developing an implementation framework for the GloBE rules during 2022. Part of this work will consider the possible use of safe harbours to simplify both compliance by MNEs and administration by tax authorities. 9.2 The general idea would be that where a business qualifies for an agreed safe harbour, the MNE group would not need to provide the full ETR calculation for a jurisdiction but would instead provide a simpler computation or certain information to evidence eligibility for the safe harbour. 9.3 The programme of work on the implementation framework is still to be agreed, but this chapter explains one of the simplification approaches that have been considered in OECD discussions. 9.4 Submissions received in response to the questions raised in this Chapter will assist in upcoming OECD discussions on simplification measures. However final decisions on safe harbours will rest with Inclusive Framework and not the New Zealand Government alone. Officials do not propose to consult again on simplification measures once the OECD has finished designing them, but will discuss the measures further with affected taxpayers. A safe harbour based on CbCR 9.5 There have previously been discussions about using a simplified ETR calculation based on data in a MNE’s CbC report to approximate the risk the full GloBE ETR is below the minimum rate. 9.6 The group would qualify for this safe harbour when the simplified ETR is above a certain CbCR safe harbour minimum rate. This could be higher than the 15% minimum rate in the GloBE rules to reflect the risk that the CbCR ETR is different because of differences in how the GloBE income and adjusted covered taxes are calculated. 9.7 There is an important policy design question whether that risk should be addressed solely through increasing this rate premium over 15% or whether there should also be adjustments to the CbCR figures to bring the ETR calculation closer into line with how the GloBE ETR is calculated. 9.8 There is a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity here. Increasing the number of adjustments reduces the risk that a MNE inappropriately qualifies for the safe harbour. Equally, it reduces the risk a MNE is inappropriately excluded from the safe harbour. 9.9 However, it also increases the complexity of the calculation, and therefore reduces some of the simplification benefits the safe harbour is intended to provide. 9.10 The adjustments that could be made broadly fall into two categories. 9.11 The first would mirror some of the adjustments made to GloBE income in Chapter 3 of the Model Rules. So, for example, the CbCR profit could be adjusted where this includes gains and losses from the sale of >10% shareholdings, so the figure more accurately represents the profit in the GloBE base (and in most cases also the taxable profit in the local tax jurisdiction). 58 9.12 These adjustments wouldn’t necessarily need to reflect all of the adjustments in the GloBE rules but could identify those which are most significant or are most likely to lead to the ETR being inappropriately inflated (those which might lead to it being deflated could be optional). 9.13 The second category would be intended to reflect timing differences and bring the CbCR ETR closer into line with the outcomes achieved by the timing differences rules in Chapter 4 of the Model Rules. 9.14 Without these adjustments, a taxpayer could have a low ETR in the CbCR even though this low ETR is simply a consequence of the taxpayer having used losses from earlier years to offset its profits. 9.15 The design could also seek to reduce some of the complexities in the jurisdictional blending rules. For example, there may be limited risk a branch is low-taxed when it is taxed in the head office jurisdiction at a high rate. 9.16 There may be scope to consider whether the safe harbour could be designed to take account of this and reduce the allocations between jurisdictions required under the main rules. Questions for submitters • Do you have any comments on a CbCR based safe harbour and how it could be designed? • What adjustments do you think should be made to give an appropriate approximation of the full ETR calculation? • How could timing differences be addressed within a CbCR safe harbour design? Do they need to be? Other safe harbours 9.17 A key feature of the Model Rules is that ETRs and top-up tax are calculated on a jurisdictional basis – in other words, covered tax and GloBE income from different jurisdictions cannot be blended. During OECD discussions it has been clear that safe harbours will only be available on a jurisdictional basis to support the jurisdictional design of the rules. 9.18 Officials welcome ideas on other safe harbours that could be developed for application on a jurisdictional basis. Question for submitters • Do you have any suggestions about alternative safe harbours that could be developed for application on a jurisdictional basis? 59 PART III: Explaining New Zealand-specific Pillar Two issues 61 CHAPTER 10 Mode of Implementation in New Zealand Overview 10.1 This chapter considers what form enactment of the GloBE rules in New Zealand should take. Aligning NZ law with OECD Model Rules 10.2 One of the most important aspects of Pillar Two is the status of the rules. The Inclusive Framework has agreed that the GloBE rules are a common approach. This means that jurisdictions that choose to implement the GloBE rules must implement them in line with the Pillar Two agreement. 10.3 There are good reasons for this. The Pillar Two agreement was reached after extensive negotiations and consultation with businesses and other stakeholders and represents a compromise agreed between over 130 jurisdictions. Consequently, it is important that jurisdictions respect it. The effectiveness of the GloBE rules also depends on a high degree of consistency in the implementation in different jurisdictions. 10.4 For example, there would be a high risk of double taxation or double non- taxation if implementing jurisdictions adopted different rules to measure the level of taxation and top-ups required in each jurisdiction. Similarly, there could be significant double taxation and disputes between jurisdictions and taxpayers if some countries do not respect the agreed rule order. 10.5 Therefore if the Government decides to adopt GloBE rules, it will implement them in New Zealand as closely to the OECD Model Rules as possible. There may be limited areas where the rules need to be adapted, for example to reflect concepts in New Zealand law, but the general approach will be to follow the agreed OECD Model Rules where possible. If changes are required, these will respect the intended outcomes agreed in the OECD. How to best implement the Model Rules 10.6 Adopting the Model Rules will require government to pass a Bill incorporating the rules into New Zealand law. The method used for this incorporation is a decision for New Zealand. Previous OECD tax reforms have been legislated in New Zealand using one of the following methods: • Repetition: OECD rules are rewritten into New Zealand legislation in full, with adaptations in limited areas, for example to reflect concepts in New Zealand law. This was generally the approach taken to the anti-hybrid rules in subpart FH of the Act, though reference was made to the OECD’s Hybrids Report in a number of places. • Incorporation by reference: New Zealand legislation provides the legal scaffolding necessary to support the OECD rules but gives effect to them by reference to the rules themselves, rather than re-writing them in the legislation. Even in this case, it is likely that some amendment to particular OECD rules might be desirable, to ensure that they are interpreted consistently with their intention and the Commentary. 62 10.7 Each method has its pros and cons. Repetition is better at allowing legislation to be adapted to reflect New Zealand circumstances when that is appropriate. However, it creates a far greater administrative burden in terms of initial drafting and for updating any changes than direct incorporation. It also creates risk that some aspects of the rules may be translated inaccurately and not reflect the intent of Pillar Two. And the use of local translations increases the risk that administrators or courts in different countries will come to different views on the application of the rules. Pillar Two like many OECD initiatives is likely to be subject to a peer review process whereby its implementation by countries is reviewed to ensure correct translation has taken place. 10.8 If New Zealand decides to incorporate the Model Rules directly, there is also a decision on how adaptable we want our legislation to be to changes made at the OECD level, either explicitly or through changes to interpretation. Again, there are broadly two options: • Fully ambulatory: any changes made to the Model Rules at the OECD will automatically be adopted into New Zealand law. • Partially ambulatory: changes made to the Model Rules at the OECD may be adopted into New Zealand law pending action by the New Zealand government, for example, passing an Order in Council to enact the changes. 10.9 New Zealand has used a partially ambulatory, direct incorporation approach to enact recent OECD tax reforms like the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) multilateral agreement and Transfer Pricing guidelines. This approach has been generally well received and has functioned well in retaining New Zealand’s legislative sovereignty while reducing the administrative burden of enacting and updating laws. For these reasons it is officials’ preferred approach if New Zealand were to adopt Pillar Two. Updating mechanism 10.10 If New Zealand chooses to adopt a partially ambulatory approach, there is also a decision to be made on mechanically how any OECD changes could come into force in New Zealand. 10.11 AEOI and the Transfer Pricing guidelines use different approaches. For AEOI, changes flow through to New Zealand law automatically, but this can be prevented by the passing of an Order in Council. New Zealand's Transfer Pricing legislation on the other hand refers to a specific version of the OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines, and so requires legislation to be passed to incorporate any updates to the guidelines into New Zealand law. 10.12 There are pros and cons to each of these approaches. A ‘negative-update’ approach as for AEOI keeps New Zealand law aligned as closely as possible with international norms and best practice and reduces administrative burden if changes are usually likely to be ones New Zealand agrees with. However, this administrative burden is flipped if changes are more likely to be ones New Zealand does not agree with. A ‘positive-update’ approach grants greater legislative sovereignty to New Zealand and allows interested parties the ability to submit on any potential changes that may be made in future to Pillar Two through the New Zealand legislative process. 10.13 In the interest of maintaining international best practice and based on the experience of the AEOI regime, officials’ view is that a ‘negative-update’ approach may be the best option for New Zealand to adopt. This would mean that any changes to Model Rules were automatically incorporated into New 63 Zealand law unless action to prevent that is taken. This would not preclude other (positive) amendments being made to the application of the rules in New Zealand, where that was necessary to improve international consistency of the rules. For example, it may be that where there are gaps in the Model Rules, or further developments make aspects of those rules seem undesirable, it may be that at an Inclusive Framework level, the matter is easier to resolve through changes to the Commentary rather than the Model Rules themselves. Changes of this sort could be expressly incorporated into New Zealand law. Whether to exist in the Income Tax Act (ITA) 10.14 The GloBE rules tax income, but they do so in a very different way from New Zealand’s existing income tax. Other taxes which also are income tax related but differ in some way (for example, Fringe Benefit Tax, Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax) are imposed by provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 but their different status is recognised by their being listed in subpart BF of the Income Tax Act. Officials propose a similar approach is taken for the IIR and UTPR under Pillar Two. They would be included in the Income Tax Act, but would be imposed under separate provisions from income tax. Questions for submitters If New Zealand were to adopt the Pillar Two Model Rules: • Should New Zealand use repetition, incorporation by reference, or some other method to implement Pillar Two into our domestic legislation? • If incorporation by reference is used, is a fully or partially ambulatory approach the best approach? • If a partially ambulatory approach is used, what type of updating mechanism should be used? • Is there a reason for not imposing them using the Income Tax Act 2007? 64 CHAPTER 11 Undertaxed Profits Rule implementation in New Zealand Overview 11.1 As explained in Chapter 6, the UTPR primarily functions as a backstop to the IIR and aims to ensure that top-up tax for an LTCE is paid even if its parent entities are located in jurisdictions without a qualified IIR. 11.2 The UTPR also ensures that any LTCEs in the UPE’s jurisdiction are subject to top-up taxation, to prevent distortions and level playing field concerns that could arise if those entities were outside the GloBE rules. 11.3 This chapter discusses how top-up tax allocated to New Zealand under the UTPR should be brought to charge. How top-up tax allocated to New Zealand under the UTPR should be brought to charge 11.4 The Model Rules do not prescribe how tax allocated to a jurisdiction by the UTPR should be brought to charge. This is left to individual jurisdictions. The outcome must be to produce an additional cash tax impost in that jurisdiction equal to the top-up tax allocated to it. The amount of this impost in a particular year is subject to the limit that it should not exceed the tax benefit of tax deductions otherwise available to constituent entities in that country in that year. 11.5 While the top-up tax allocated to a jurisdiction will be charged to the MNE’s constituent entities in that jurisdiction, an MNE may have multiple constituent entities and countries are free to determine how that liability is allocated and charged between them. 11.6 The tax administration aspects of Pillar Two are discussed in more detail in Chapter 12, however, one key issue is what approach to take to charging the top-up tax under the UTPR. Officials are interested in submitters’ views on the preferred approach. Option 1: Denying a deduction 11.7 The first approach which is set out in the Model Rules would be to deny an income tax deduction on otherwise deductible expenses of the MNE group. 11.8 The top-up tax allocated to New Zealand would be converted to denied deductions by dividing the top-up tax allocated to New Zealand by the company tax rate. For example, a top-up tax liability of $1,000 would be converted into denial of a deduction for $3,571 of otherwise deductible expenditure, in the year the top-up tax relates to. This would cap the top-up tax based on the total deductions of the entity. If deductions in that year were less than $3,571, the shortfall would be carried forward and used to reduce deductions in the next year. 11.9 As the top-up is allocated for the jurisdiction as a whole, there would need to be rules to specify how the MNE should apply the adjustment when there are multiple entities within New Zealand. 11.10 This could be achieved by specifying that the deductions should be denied first in the constituent entity in the group with the highest taxable income (ignoring any deduction denial) and then continue on to the constituent entity with the 65 next highest taxable income if that is still insufficient to collect the tax and so on. Example 20: Ordering of denied deductions under UTPR An MNE has its UPE in a jurisdiction that does not have an IIR. T op -up tax of $100 has been allocated to New Zealand under the UTPR for the MNE’s 2030 Fiscal Year. At a 28% company tax rate, the $100 of top-up tax converts to $357 of denied deductions ($100 / 0.28). The MNE has 3 New Zealand subsidiaries. Before denying any deductions under the UTPR, the subs have the following gross income, deductions and taxable income: • Sub A has gross income of $300, deductions of $250 and taxable income of $50 • Sub B has gross income of $140, deductions of $100 and taxable income of $40 • Sub C has gross income of $200, deductions of $170 and taxable income of $30 If New Zealand chose to collect tax under the UTPR by denying deductions, first in the constituent entity with the highest taxable income (and so on), Sub A would be denied deductions of $250, Sub B would be denied deductions of $100 and Sub C would be denied deductions of $7. 11.11 There are a number of disadvantages to this approach in the New Zealand context: • Denying deductions to taxpayers would have flow on effects to provisional tax liabilities of the company. • Denying a deduction will not result in an additional cash tax expense when the relevant New Zealand entity is in a loss position. While the additional cash tax expense may materialise at a future point if the entity becomes profitable, this may not occur for a long time. This is inconsistent with the OECD’s intention that the UTPR should give rise to an additional cash tax expenses as early as possible. • Denying a deduction would result in a company paying more income tax, which would result in more credits to its imputation credit account. For the reasons set out in Chapter 13, this seems particularly inappropriate in relation to tax imposed under the UTPR. • New Zealand allows a relatively long period for taxpayers to file tax returns compared to other jurisdictions. However, the filing dates for these income tax returns is still before the filing date for the GloBE information returns. This could result in a taxpayer having to limit deductions in an income tax return that is due for filing prior to the taxpayer calculating that denial of expenditure in their subsequent GloBE information return. For example, a taxpayer with a 31 March 2024 balance date would generally have to file its tax return for that income year by 31 March 2025 but the GloBE information return would be due on 30 June 2025. This could result in taxpayer having to request reassessments 66 which will also have flow on impacts for use of money interest charges (UOMI) and compliance costs for taxpayers. Option 2: Separate tax liability 11.12 The second approach would be to treat the GloBE calculation and any resulting tax liability as a separate tax liability independent of income tax. This would apply to the UTPR as well as the IIR. 11.13 The tax would be a joint and several liability of all New Zealand constituent entities. 11.14 In relation to the UTPR, this charge would still be capped by reference to deductions in order to meet the “equivalent adjustment” requirements in the Model Rules. But it will be capped by the total deductions claimed by all New Zealand constituent entities. 11.15 Officials see this approach as avoiding the disadvantages of using the income tax system to account for the UTPR as this will not impact provisional tax and being a stand-alone tax will not have flow on effects to other taxes. Officials consider that the UTPR’s type of calculation and payment is better dealt with as a separate tax type. 11.16 It will also eliminate some of the complexity of using the income tax system such as having to identify entities with the most capacity to absorb any top-up and creating ordering rules where deductions are subject to some sort of limitation under other tax rules or where the group or a member of it has losses. Therefore officials currently prefer Option 2. 11.17 Other tax administration aspects of GloBE reporting are covered in Chapter 12. Questions for submitters • Do you prefer Option 1 (denying a deduction) or Option 2 (separate tax liability) for implementing the UTPR in New Zealand? Why? • If you prefer Option 1, do you have suggestions to resolve the issues outlined in this chapter? 67 CHAPTER 12 Tax administration impacts 12.1 Chapter 8 of the Model Rules provides a coordinated and standardised approach to reporting which is designed to reduce the compliance burden for businesses and facilitate the effective administration of the GloBE. 12.2 The model rules place an obligation on each constituent entity to file a GloBE information return with the local tax administration. However, a constituent entity is discharged from this obligation when the UPE or a designated filing entity files the GloBE information return with the tax administration of the jurisdiction where it is located and the Competent Authority of that jurisdiction has an agreement in effect to automatically exchange the GloBE information return with the Competent Authority of the jurisdiction of the constituent entity. 12.3 Under this approach a New Zealand resident UPE of an MNE Group (or other New Zealand resident designated filing entity) will be required to submit a GloBE information return providing detailed information to support their GloBE calculation, including information about the calculation of their ETR, any top-up tax liabilities and how they are allocated between different jurisdictions. 12.4 In addition, a New Zealand GloBE tax return will be filed with the calculation and assessment of any top-up tax liabilities by the New Zealand UPE of an MNE group (or other New Zealand resident designated filing entity) and any constituent entities in New Zealand with a UTPR liability. 12.5 The GloBE information return will need to be provided in a global standardised return which is to be developed as part of the Implementation Framework for Pillar Two. A standardised return will enable the smooth transfer of information between various tax authorities ensuring that the same information is provided to every tax authority which will reduce the scope for error and help to reduce compliance costs across jurisdictions. 12.6 The Model Rules allow for GloBE information returns to be exchanged between tax authorities using a similar approach to the framework developed for CbC reporting. 12.7 GloBE information returns must be filed within 15 months of the end of the fiscal year although for the initial reporting year this has been extended to 18 months. If New Zealand enacted GloBE rules at the end of September 2023, effective for income years beginning after enactment, the first full year GloBE information return would be due in March 2026 (for taxpayers balancing at 30 September 2024). This initial extended date would allow affected taxpayers more time to establish reporting systems and processes for the new returns. 12.8 The due date for the New Zealand GloBE tax returns required is proposed to be one month (two months in the initial year) after the GloBE information return due date to allow foreign groups to arrange filing of the New Zealand GloBE tax return. If New Zealand enacted GloBE rules at the end of September 2023, effective for income years beginning after enactment, the first New Zealand GloBE tax return would be due in May 2026 (for taxpayers balancing at 30 September 2024). 12.9 This proposed timeframe reflects the fact that completing the New Zealand GloBE tax return should be relatively straightforward and is likely to be little more than transposing facts or figures from the GloBE information return. 68 12.10 If New Zealand does not enact the GloBE rules effective from 2024, New Zealand headquartered MNE groups may still have to file GloBE information returns by no later than 18 months after their balance date for that year, under GloBE rules enacted by other countries. Filing the returns 12.11 Taxpayers subject to the GloBE will have the associated tax type set up as a new IRD number or separate tax type within its existing IRD number depending on the final system design. Registration 12.12 Taxpayers will be required to notify Inland Revenue that they are within the scope of the GloBE through a new annual registration process. It is proposed that taxpayers would be given 6 to 9 months from the end of their income year to complete this annual registration. This process would apply to both New Zealand headquartered MNEs and foreign MNEs with constituent entities located in New Zealand. 12.13 Part of this registration will be informing Inland Revenue of the identity and location of the UPE or the designated filing entity that will be filing the GloBE information return. This will provide Inland Revenue with notice of where it will receive the GloBE information return from (that is, directly or through information exchange channels. 12.14 As most of the taxpayers subject to the GloBE requirements will already be subject to CbC reporting Inland Revenue can work with those taxpayers to assist in the registration process The GloBE information return 12.15 The current reporting model for CbC used within New Zealand is not suitable for GloBE information reporting as the CbC model involves the collection of a wider range of financial information to facilitate the risk assessment of particular taxpayers by tax administrations. It is not designed specifically to contribute to a tax assessment for a liability whereas the GloBE information reporting could result in the assessment of a tax liability in the New Zealand GloBE tax return and therefore a more tailored process is appropriate. 12.16 Because of the proposed internationally standardised nature of the GloBE information return, to enable the sharing of these between tax authorities, it is also proposed that the GloBE information return is filed electronically with Inland Revenue in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) format which is the standard used to exchange CbC reporting between tax authorities. The New Zealand GloBE tax return 12.17 The New Zealand GloBE tax return will contain the calculation of any top-up tax required and will be filed as a separate tax return. 12.18 Given the preference to treat the GloBE as a separate tax type an assessment will result from the New Zealand GloBE tax return filed by taxpayers as with any other tax type. Returning and paying tax under the UTPR 12.19 As noted in Chapter 11 there are two approaches being considered to bring the UTPR top-up tax to account. The first is the denial of expenses of liable entities 69 which would result in increased income tax paid by the entity equating to the minimum tax (subject to the limit imposed by the amount of otherwise- deductible expenses). 12.20 The second option is a stand-alone tax liability dealt with independently from any other income tax liability of the New Zealand constituent entities, but again limited by reference to their deductions in the relevant year. As outlined in Chapter 11 officials’ preference is for this second option which avoids many of the complexities of denying deductions. 12.21 In the New Zealand context there are several additional complications that make this second option more workable: • Denying deductions to taxpayers would have flow on effects to provisional tax liabilities of the company. By isolating any top-up as a separate tax liability this impact is eliminated. • New Zealand allows a relatively long period for taxpayers to file tax returns compared to other jurisdictions. However, when considering the filing dates for the GloBE information returns compared to the filing dates for New Zealand income tax returns this could result in a taxpayer having to limit deductions in an income tax return that is due for filing prior to the taxpayer calculating that denial of expenditure in their GloBE information return. • Denying deductions would prima facie mean the additional tax would give rise to imputation credits. As set out in Chapter 13, officials do not think this would be appropriate. 12.22 Given these issues, this chapter proceeds on the basis that GloBE information return and any resulting tax liability in the New Zealand GloBE tax return, both under the IIR and the UTPR, will be treated as a separate tax type and charged independently from income tax. Proposal for change to CbC Reporting process 12.23 As part of the introduction of GloBE information reporting for Pillar Two Inland Revenue also consider that the CbC reporting process should be modernised by moving to electronic filing using the XML format. This will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and administration costs for Inland Revenue and bring New Zealand into line with other jurisdictions such as Australia and the United Kingdom who also require CbC reporting electronically in XML format. 12.24 The current process for CbC reporting can be cumbersome and result in queries to taxpayers and rework by Inland Revenue. Streamlining the process into a single XML electronic filing process will reduce these costs for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. 12.25 Officials also see benefits in aligning these two processes as the simplification measures discussed in Chapter 9 may allow CbC information to be used as the basis for the ETR calculations required for GloBE reporting. Penalties for late filing The GloBE information return and CbC reporting 12.26 The due date for the GloBE information return will be 15 months after the end of the income year of the taxpayer (18 months in the initial reporting year). 70 12.27 For the exchange of information with other tax authorities it is important that Inland Revenue receives the GloBE information return on time and in the correct format to give time for the information to be checked before it is provided to other jurisdictions. 12.28 In comparison with international standards, New Zealand has relatively low penalties for the late filing of information. For example, a significant global entity in Australia who does not file a tax return (including CbC reports) by the due date could be liable for a late filing penalty of between $111,000 to $555,000 depending on how overdue the return is. 12.29 Because the taxpayers subject to GloBE information reporting are MNEs it is considered that the current penalties for late filing are not appropriate for GloBE information returns or CbC reporting. 12.30 Officials are considering an appropriate level for a late filing penalty and seek submitters’ views on this. To be effective such a penalty should be sufficient to deter MNEs from not filing on time. 12.31 Section 139AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a penalty for large multinational groups failing to provide information required under section 17 of $100,000. This provides a useful point of comparison, and may also be appropriate for GloBE information and CbC reporting. 12.32 The current rules around the imposition of late filing penalties would apply in that Inland Revenue would have to advise the taxpayer that a penalty may be imposed if a return is not filed prior to the penalty being applied. 12.33 A return not filed electronically in the XML format would not be treated as filed for this purpose. The New Zealand GloBE tax return 12.34 To give foreign headquartered groups time to arrange filing of any required New Zealand GloBE tax return, officials propose that this return would be due for filing on the last day of the month following the due date for GloBE information return for that MNE Group. 12.35 There is a natural incentive for taxpayers to file their New Zealand GloBE tax return on time because as the consequence of not doing this the Commissioner could make a “default” assessment in the absence of a return. 12.36 Given this the current penalties in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for late filing returns would seem appropriate for the GloBE New Zealand tax return. Paying the tax 12.37 As the GloBE liability would be a separate tax type, payment of the tax would be due separately from any income tax liability of the company and have its own payment date. 12.38 It is envisaged that any payment would be due on the same date as the New Zealand GloBE tax return is due with Inland Revenue (that is, the last day of the month following the date the GloBE information return is due). This should give sufficient time for foreign headquartered groups to arrange filing of a New Zealand GloBE tax return. Payments under GloBE would not be subject to provisional tax. 71 12.39 The standard rules in Parts 7 and 9 (Interest and Penalties) within the Tax Administration Act 1994 w ould apply to GloBE payments that are paid after the due date. Example 21: Reporting dates World is my Oyster Limited (WOL) is the New Zealand resident UPE of a MNE that produces specialist Oyster fishing equipment. It has operations in 15 countries and meets the requirements to be subject to the GloBE. WOL has a June balance date and the first fiscal year it will be required to report under GloBE will be for the year ended 30 June 2025. WOL has a New Zealand tax agent and an extension of time to file its New Zealand income tax return. WOL’s reporting dates for the initial 30 June 2025 year will be as follows: • New Zealand Income Tax return – due 31 March 2026. • GloBE information return – due 31 December 2026 (18 months after balance date – normally this will be due 15 months after balance date on the 30 September). New Zealand GloBE tax return – due 28 February 2027 (20 months after balance date – normally this will be due on 31 October). Joint and several liability 12.40 Officials propose that all New Zealand resident entities of the MNE group will be jointly and severally liable for any top-up payments that are charged to any one New Zealand resident entity of the MNE group under GloBE reporting. This approach is also proposed in the United Kingdom. 12.41 Officials consider this is appropriate given these liabilities result from undertaxed profits of the MNE group measured on a jurisdictional basis. 12.42 As all groups with liabilities in New Zealand will have a New Zealand tax presence it would not be necessary to extend this joint and several liability to non-resident members of the MNE group. Other provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 12.43 As a preliminary position, officials envisage that other provisions within the Tax Administration Act 1994 (as applicable) will apply to the New Zealand GloBE tax return and any tax liability as with any other tax liability (for example, disputes and recovery processes). However, there may be matters where closer examination suggests this is not appropriate. The OECD work on an Implementation Framework may also require a particular approach to be adopted to these matters. 12.44 Officials are interested in submitters’ views as to whether there are any areas of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that would need modification to deal with the specialised nature of GloBE taxation. 72 Questions for submitters • Is treating GloBE as a separate tax type appropriate? • Do submitters see any issues with filing GloBE information returns and CbC reports in an electronic XML format? • Do submitters think that payment of any top-up should be aligned with the due date for the New Zealand GloBE tax return? • Is the end of the month following the due date for the GloBE information return a suitable due date for filing the New Zealand GloBE tax return? • What level of monetary penalty do submitters consider appropriate for late or non-electronic filing of GloBE information returns? • Do submitters consider any of the other provisions in the TAA may require modification to deal with the new GloBE reporting and associated local tax returns? • Are there any other practical tax administration issues submitters see with the proposals for GloBE reporting outlined in the chapter? 73 CHAPTER 13 Interaction with imputation 13.1 Generally New Zealand income tax paid by a New Zealand company gives rise to an imputation credit, which can be passed on to the company’s shareholders when the company pays a dividend (including a taxable bonus issue). This includes tax paid on income recognised under the controlled foreign company rules. 13.2 However, the payment of foreign income tax does not give rise to imputation credits. The issue considered in this chapter is whether tax paid under the GloBE rules should give rise to an imputation credit or not. Purpose of imputation 13.3 The broad purpose of the imputation credit regime is to ensure that income earned through a company is taxed at the shareholder’s marginal rate. The exclusion of foreign income tax from the regime reflects a policy choice not to give shareholders in New Zealand companies a credit for foreign income tax paid, even though a foreign tax credit generally is available on income earned by the shareholders directly. This can be justified on the following basis: • The payment of foreign taxes does not benefit New Zealand, as those foreign taxes are not available for the Government to spend on services here. Accordingly, providing a deduction rather than a credit for foreign taxes maximises national welfare and encourages companies to pay taxes in New Zealand rather than offshore. • Foreign tax credits are also not available for New Zealand shareholders in foreign companies with respect to underlying foreign tax, that is, tax paid by the company. • When a foreign company earns income and pays tax in New Zealand, no foreign country gives a credit to the foreign company’s shareholders for the New Zealand tax paid. There is an argument that a country should only give residents tax credits for another country’s taxes if the other country reciprocates (though New Zealand gives a unilateral foreign tax credit on directly earned income). 13.4 Tax imposed in New Zealand under the IIR is clearly New Zealand tax, which does benefit the New Zealand economy, and therefore presents a prima facie case for an imputation credit. However, there are also a number of arguments against giving a credit. Reasons Pillar Two tax should not give rise to imputation credits 13.5 First, the reason for the imposition of the IIR is that insufficient tax has been paid in a country outside New Zealand. The purpose of the GloBE rules is to correct that insufficiency. If the IIR gives rise to an imputation credit, this policy is significantly undermined. Although sufficient tax is paid at a corporate level, the entire top-up amount is available as a dollar for dollar tax reduction to the shareholder. This means the imposition of the IIR would be unwound on distribution. 74 13.6 This is conceptually different from the imposition of tax under the CFC regime. Our CFC regime generally only taxes mobile, passive income, which could as easily have been derived in New Zealand as overseas. So the kind of income on which CFC tax is imposed does not have a sufficiently strong connection with the foreign country where it prima facie is taxable to justify exempting it from New Zealand tax. The amount of foreign tax paid on the income is generally not relevant to making this determination (though it will affect the amount of New Zealand tax). Since the income is treated effectively as income directly earned by the New Zealand shareholder, it is logical to provide an imputation credit in that case. The same analysis does not apply to IIR tax. 13.7 Consistent with this line of reasoning, the GloBE rules seem explicit that if the payment of tax under New Zealand’s IIR gives rise to an imputation credit, it will not be a Qualified IIR. This means that other countries’ UTPRs would still apply to New Zealand headquartered MNEs (in addition to our IIR). This is an unacceptable result, meaning we are effectively required by the Model Rules not to allow an imputation credit. 12 13.8 Third, allowing an imputation credit for tax paid under the IIR would be complex due to the rate at which such tax is imposed. Generally, the maximum rate at which imputation credits can be attached to a dividend reflects the rate of corporate tax. When that rate changes, the maximum rate also changes. The rate of tax imposed under the IIR depends on the rate of tax imposed in the relevant country. For example, if there is $100 of excess income in a foreign country, and $10 of tax, the IIR liability will be $5, representing a tax rate of 5.2%. Any credit that did arise from the payment of this tax should only be creditable at a rate of $0.052 of credit for each $0.948 of cash distributed. Setting up a system to achieve this, or a reasonable approximation of it, would be complex. 13.9 Fourth, allowing an imputation credit for tax paid under the UTPR seems particularly anomalous. Tax paid under the UTPR will often be paid by a MNE member other than the shareholder of the low tax member. So there will be no cash earnings included in the paying company’s assets (either directly owned or through participation in lower tier companies) corresponding to the tax paid. 13.10 Accordingly, officials do not propose that tax paid in New Zealand under the GloBE rules gives rise to an imputation credit. Question for submitters • Do you agree that tax paid in New Zealand under the GloBE rules should not give rise to an imputation credit? If not, please explain. 12 The definition of a Qualified IIR excludes an IIR where the country provides benefits relating to the IIR. The Commentary says that if a jurisdiction provides a tax credit equivalent to a portion of the tax paid under an IIR to be used against other taxes, that will not be a Qualified IIR. This is explained on the basis that the intention of the rules is to provide a level playing field among all jurisdictions to avoid inversions incentivised by differences in the implementation and application of the GloBE rules. Clearly if the payment of IIR tax by a New Zealand company generates an imputation credit for a New Zealand shareholder, whereas the payment of IIR tax by a non-New Zealand company does not, that will provide some incentive for an inversion, that is, corporate migration to New Zealand (for companies with a substantial New Zealand shareholder base). While other factors might make that unlikely in the context of New Zealand, it might be much more likely for other countries if they were to give a shareholder level credit. Obviously it is not possible for one rule to apply to New Zealand while another applies to a country which is a more likely destination for inversions. 75 CHAPTER 14 Domestic minimum tax 14.1 The GloBE rules contemplate that countries may introduce a domestic minimum top-up tax (DMT), which would use the same tax base as the GloBE rules but take priority over them. For New Zealand, this tax would be closely based on the GloBE rules but would apply to undertaxed profits in New Zealand. It would mean that New Zealand would collect all of the top-up tax on such profits, rather than sharing it with other countries with Pillar Two rules. So there would be no additional tax cost for MNEs subject to the tax, just a change in what country they pay the tax to. 14.2 A DMT could be imposed solely on New Zealand headquartered in-scope MNEs. For these MNEs, top-up tax on undertaxed New Zealand profits would ordinarily be collected under the UTPR. The UTPR allocation mechanism (based on tangible assets and number of employees in each UTPR country) means that in many cases much of this tax would be allocated to New Zealand, but this would depend on the level of overseas assets and employees. A DMT would avoid them having to pay any part of the Pillar Two tax on undertaxed New Zealand income in other countries under the UTPR. This would benefit New Zealand, by allowing us to retain all of the tax that our MNEs would otherwise need to pay offshore under the UTPR. 14.3 A DMT could be expanded to apply also to foreign headquartered in-scope MNEs operating in New Zealand. In this case it would allow New Zealand to collect a tax equivalent to the Pillar Two tax on any low-tax New Zealand income that would otherwise arise under either another country’s IIR (in most cases) or other countries' UTPRs. 14.4 Given New Zealand’s small Pillar Two population, relatively high tax corporate income tax rate and general lack of tax preferences (other than for capital gains) it may be that there is insufficient benefit from a DMT to make it worthwhile implementing. In considering the size of any benefit, it also needs to be remembered that the DMT would be determined after taking into account not just New Zealand tax, but also foreign taxes (primarily CFC taxes and taxes imposed by worldwide taxing regimes) imposed on New Zealand income, since these are included in the ETR numerator. 14.5 In favour of adopting a DMT, it: • Would mean that any tax on undertaxed profits is paid in New Zealand rather than offshore. • Would largely rely on rules already developed to impose tax on non-New Zealand income. • Would not impose any additional tax or compliance burden on MNEs. • Might in fact simplify compliance for New Zealand headquartered groups at least, where it allows tax to be paid in New Zealand under the IIR rather than to multiple other countries under their UTPRs. 14.6 Another issue to consider is that the introduction of a DMT would mean capital gains made by in-scope groups would be taxed to the extent they resulted in 76 an ETR below 15% for the New Zealand group. 13 As set out above, the nature of the GloBE rules means that this tax will apply whether New Zealand enacts it or not. However, submitters may feel that there is a point of principle regarding capital gains taxes which would be contravened if New Zealand were to enact a DMT. Domestic minimum tax and initial phase relief 14.7 There is a question as to whether a DMT should apply to a group which is entitled to initial phase relief. Officials propose that if the group is headquartered in New Zealand, a DMT would not apply to it during the initial phase. That is because any undertaxed New Zealand profits would not be subject to any other country’s UTPR or IIR during the period. If the group is not headquartered in New Zealand, another country’s IIR could apply, so the rationale for a DMT (to allow New Zealand priority in collecting top-up tax on low tax New Zealand profits) would potentially still apply. Domestic minimum tax and imputation 14.8 The interaction between imputation and GloBE taxation considered in chapter 13 takes on a different aspect when the GloBE taxation is applying to New Zealand income. The Model Rules do not treat the existence of a shareholder level credit as inconsistent with the recognition of the corporate level tax as a covered tax for GloBE purposes if the tax is imposed pursuant to a Qualified Imputation Tax such as New Zealand’s. This suggests that the credit also should not prevent a domestic minimum tax being a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top- up Tax (QDMTT), and thus as reducing any GloBE tax liability on a dollar for dollar basis. 14.9 However, there are some issues. • Paragraph (c) of the definition of a QDMTT excludes a tax where the jurisdiction provides any benefits that are related to the rules. Providing a shareholder-level credit could be such a benefit. This would likely need to be discussed at an Inclusive Framework level. • As discussed in chapter 13, the maximum rate at which such credits should be able to be attached to dividends is not clear. Possibly a 15% rate would make sense. This would require treating the DMT tax credit as different from ordinary imputation credits, which would require redesign of the relevant forms and other administrative and legislative measures. Given the relatively low amount of DMT likely to be imposed, it may not be worth bringing the tax into the imputation regime. Officials welcome submissions on this issue. Questions for submitters • What are your views on whether or not New Zealand should adopt a DMT? • If so, should it be limited to New Zealand headquartered MNEs? • Should a DMT give rise to a credit under the imputation system. 13 There are also timing rules, which spread the capital gain over the preceding five years, and allow any tax paid over the 15% minimum in those earlier years to be counted. In addition, capital gains from the sale of <10% shareholding interests are excluded. So we expect that capital gains will not be taxed in most cases. 77 CHAPTER 15 Treatment of foreign GloBE taxes in determining New Zealand income tax liability 15.1 Whether or not New Zealand adopts GloBE rules, if other countries do so, the status of GloBE tax for purposes of calculating New Zealand tax on foreign earnings will need to be dealt with. Should GloBE tax be creditable, deductible, or neither when determining New Zealand income tax liability? 15.2 The design of the GloBE rules makes it clear that GloBE taxes should not be either creditable or deductible for non-GloBE income tax purposes. The rules impose a top-up tax on a per-country basis. The top-up tax is determined after taking into account income tax imposed on the income attributable to the country, whether that tax is imposed by the country itself or a third country. Tax may be imposed by a third country: • By way of withholding tax imposed on a cross border payment. • Under a worldwide taxation regime, or a CFC regime. 15.3 Given that the GloBE top-up tax is calculated after taking into account tax imposed under a worldwide or CFC tax regime, it would clearly not be appropriate for the GloBE top-up tax to be creditable when calculating those taxes. Example 22: New Zealand tax treatment of foreign GloBE taxes Suppose New Zealand does not adopt GloBE rules, and that a New Zealand company has a subsidiary X Co tax resident in Country X which has adopted GloBE rules. X Co in turn owns 100% of Y Co, which has an ETR below 15%. Country X imposes GloBE tax on X Co with respect to that undertaxed income of Y Co. Suppose also that the income of both companies is in part subject to New Zealand’s CFC rules, so that New Zealand tax is also paid on that income. The New Zealand CFC rules should give a credit against the CFC tax for income tax paid by X Co and Y Co in their respective countries of incorporation. The GloBE ETR calculation for Country X and Country Y will include the New Zealand CFC tax in the numerator, subject to the limit in Article 4.3.3. The IIR liability of X Co in Country X with respect to the undertaxed income of Y Co will therefore take into account the New Zealand CFC tax with respect to Y Co. It would clearly not be appropriate then for that IIR liability to give rise to a credit in determining the New Zealand CFC liability in relation to either X Co or Y Co. Nor would it be appropriate for that tax to be deductible in determining the income subject to the New Zealand CFC rules in either country. If New Zealand does adopt GloBE rules, this issue can still arise. Referring to the example in the above paragraphs, suppose X Co were 25% owned by another shareholder. Under the partially owned parent entity rule, this means X Co would be responsible for paying the top up tax with respect to Y Co, despite New Zealand having an IIR. 78 Question for submitters • Do you agree that GloBE tax imposed by other countries should not give rise to a tax credit or tax deduction in New Zealand? If not, please explain. 79 APPENDIX 1 Overview of the key operating provisions of the GloBE rules 14 14 OECD.
