Voluntary disclosures (WITHDRAWN)
=================================

SPS 09/02 sets out guidelines for making a voluntary disclosure, the timing of notification and what constitutes a voluntary disclosure.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) applies to a voluntary disclosure that is made under section 141G or section 141J of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") on or after 17 May 2007 and for the purpose of entitlement to a reduction in shortfall penalty. It provides guidelines in respect of:
    1.  how to make a voluntary disclosure;
    2.  when a taxpayer is treated as having been notified of a pending audit;
    3.  what constitutes a full voluntary disclosure;
    4.  what rate of reduction will apply if a taxpayer is liable for a shortfall penalty.
2.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the TAA.
3.  This SPS should be read in conjunction with _SPS 07/02 Notification of a pending audit or investigation_ (or any subsequent replacement).

### Application

4.  This SPS replaces _SPS INV-251 Voluntary Disclosures_ and applies to taxpayers who have made voluntary disclosures on or after 17 May 2007.

### Summary

5.  A taxpayer can make a full voluntary disclosure for the purpose of a shortfall penalty reduction, either:
    1.  before the taxpayer is first notified that a tax audit is pending ("pre-notification disclosure"), or
    2.  after the taxpayer is first notified of a pending audit but before the audit starts ("post-notification disclosure").
6.  See _SPS 07/02 Notification of pending audit or investigation_ published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol.19, No.3 (April 2007) which provides details regarding when notification that an audit is pending will occur and the form in which that notification must be provided.
7.  Section 141G(1) does not apply unless the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure. Section 141G(2) allows the Commissioner to specify what information must be provided by the taxpayer to be a full disclosure and the form in which the disclosure must be provided (see the discussion in paragraphs 38 - 49).
8.  Where a taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure a reduction will be allowed in the shortfall penalty rate as follows:
    1.  by 100% under section 141G(3)(a)(i) if the taxpayer makes a pre-notification disclosure, and:
        *   the shortfall penalty is for not taking reasonable care (section 141A); or
        *   the shortfall penalty is for taking an unacceptable tax position or is an unacceptable interpretation (section 141B); or
    2.  by 100% under section 141J(2)(a)(i) if:
        *   a taxpayer makes a pre-notification disclosure, and
        *   the shortfall penalty is imposed under either section 141A or 141B and relates to a temporary tax shortfall, or
    3.  by 75% under section 141G(3)(a)(ii) if:
        *   the taxpayer makes a pre-notification disclosure, and
        *   the shortfall penalty is for gross carelessness (section 141C), an abusive tax position (section 141D), evasion or similar act (section 141E) or a promoter penalty (section 141EB), or
    4.  by 75% under section 141J(2)(b) if:
        *   the taxpayer makes a pre-notification disclosure and the shortfall penalty is imposed under any of sections 141C to 141EB and relates to a temporary tax shortfall, or
        *   makes a post-notification disclosure and the shortfall penalty is imposed under any of sections 141A to 141EB and relates to a temporary tax shortfall, or
    5.  by 40% under section 141G(3)(b) if the taxpayer makes a post notification disclosure.
9.  When a taxpayer makes a pre-notification disclosure, the Commissioner's practice is not to consider subsequent prosecution action against them in respect of the tax shortfall that they have voluntarily disclosed. However, Inland Revenue may consider prosecution action when a taxpayer makes a post-notification disclosure that involves evasion or similar offending.

### Background

10.  The New Zealand tax system is based on voluntary compliance and most taxpayers voluntarily meet their obligations under the tax laws, for example, by filing tax returns on time and returning all income.
11.  The voluntary disclosure rules provide an incentive to taxpayers to determine their correct tax liability. The rules also reflect the savings to Inland Revenue from voluntary admissions of irregularities and other benefits of co-operation by taxpayers. By making a full voluntary disclosure, a taxpayer will attain the advantage of either a full or partial reduction of any shortfall penalty for which they are liable and may also avoid prosecution action.
12.  Section 141G(3)(a) has been amended to increase the reduction rate of certain shortfall penalties when a pre-notification disclosure is made. The amended section 141G applies to voluntary disclosures that are made on or after 17 May 2007.
13.  Section 141J has been amended to increase the reduction rate of certain shortfall penalties when a disclosure is made in respect of a temporary tax shortfall.

### Legislation

14.  The relevant legislative provisions are sections 141G and 141J.
15.  Section 141G reads as follows:

*   ### 141G Reduction in penalty for voluntary disclosure of tax shortfall -
    
    1.  A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141EB may be reduced if, in the Commissioner's opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall, either -
        1.  Before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation (referred to in this section as "pre-notification disclosure"); or
        2.  After the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, but before the Commissioner starts the audit or investigation (referred to in this section as "post-notification disclosure").
    2.  The Commissioner may from time to time -
        1.  Specify the information required for a full voluntary disclosure; and
        2.  The form in which it must be provided.
    3.  The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced -
        1.  For pre-notification disclosure is -
            1.  100%, if the shortfall penalty is for not taking reasonable care, for taking an unacceptable tax position, or for an unacceptable interpretation; or
            2.  75%, if subparagraph (i) does not apply,
        2.  For post-notification disclosure is 40%.
    4.  A taxpayer is deemed to have been notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started, if -
        1.  The taxpayer; or
        2.  An officer of the taxpayer; or
        3.  A shareholder of the taxpayer, if the taxpayer is a close company; or
        4.  A tax adviser acting for the taxpayer; or
        5.  A partner in partnership with the taxpayer; or
        6.  A person acting for or on behalf of or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer, -is notified of the pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started.
    5.  An audit or investigation starts at the earlier of -
        1.  The end of the first interview an officer of the Department has with the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and
        2.  The time when -
            1.  An officer of the Department inspects information (including books or records) of the taxpayer after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and
            2.  The taxpayer is notified of the inspection.

16.  Section 141J reads as follows:

*   ### 141J Limitation on reduction of shortfall penalty -
    
    1.  This section applies to a shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer if -
        1.  the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure; and
        2.  the shortfall penalty is payable in respect of a temporary tax shortfall; and
        3.  the shortfall penalty would be reduced under section 141G or 141H in the absence of this section.
    2.  The shortfall penalty is reduced by -
        1.  100%, if -
            1.  the shortfall penalty is for not taking reasonable care, for taking an unacceptable position, or for taking a tax position involving an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law; and
            2.  the tax shortfall is voluntarily disclosed under section 141G before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation; or
        2.  75%, if paragraph (a) does not apply.
    3.  A shortfall penalty to which this section applies is not reduced under any other section.

### Discussion

#### Voluntary disclosure methods

17.  A taxpayer can make a voluntary disclosure:
    1.  in person at an Inland Revenue office, or
    2.  by telephone, or
    3.  in writing, or
    4.  during the first interview that forms part of the audit.

#### Making a voluntary disclosure in person

18.  A taxpayer can make a voluntary disclosure in person at an Inland Revenue office during the normal business hours. If the taxpayer cannot make the voluntary disclosure in writing, an Inland Revenue officer will record the voluntary disclosure details on an Inland Revenue form (_IR281 Voluntary disclosure_) and ask that the taxpayer sign it.

#### Making a voluntary disclosure by telephone

19.  A taxpayer can make a voluntary disclosure by telephoning Inland Revenue. The taxpayer should provide as much information as possible when making the disclosure including the types of information that are required by the Commissioner (see paragraphs 46 to 49).
20.  If the tax shortfall and the facts are straightforward, Inland Revenue will accept the taxpayer's verbal disclosure without asking them to make the voluntary disclosure in writing. Inland Revenue will make a record of the matters disclosed.
21.  However, if the tax shortfall and the facts are complex, an Inland Revenue officer will endeavour to record all the details of the tax shortfall and ascertain whether there has been a full voluntary disclosure.
22.  If the information is unclear, the taxpayer may be asked to make the full voluntary disclosure in writing. This may include completing an Inland Revenue form (_IR281 Voluntary disclosure_).

#### Making a voluntary disclosure in writing

23.  A taxpayer can make a voluntary disclosure in writing by:
    1.  completing an Inland Revenue form (_IR281 Voluntary disclosure_), or
    2.  by sending:
        1.  a letter, or
        2.  a facsimile, or
        3.  an email to Inland Revenue's Secure Online Correspondence Service.
24.  Inland Revenue will accept written disclosures that are not made on the relevant form provided that they meet the information requirements specified in this SPS and any other statutory requirements under section 141G(2).
25.  A voluntary disclosure can be made at any time but in order to get the benefit of the reduction in any applicable penalty it will need to be made by or on the date that the tax audit starts.
26.  Inland Revenue will acknowledge in writing that it has received the taxpayer's voluntary disclosure.

#### Making a voluntary disclosure during the first tax audit or investigation interview

27.  A taxpayer can make a post-notification voluntary disclosure during or before the first interview that forms part of the audit. At the interview the Inland Revenue officer will consider whether the disclosure is complete and contains all the information necessary to determine the correct tax position and shortfall and will clarify any matters which are unclear. The officer will advise the outcome as soon as practicable and preferably at the interview.

#### Notification of a tax audit

**Note:**

This section should be read in conjunction with _SPS 07/02 Notification of a pending audit or investigation_.

28.  Under section 141G(4), a taxpayer is treated as having been notified that a tax audit is pending or has started, if any of the following persons has received the notification:
    1.  the taxpayer, or
    2.  an officer of the taxpayer, or
    3.  a shareholder of the taxpayer (for close companies), or
    4.  a tax adviser acting for the taxpayer, or
    5.  a partner in a partnership, or
    6.  a person acting for, on behalf of, or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer.
29.  Pursuant to the definition of "officer" under section 3(1), an officer of the taxpayer includes:
    1.  a director, secretary and other statutory officer of a company, and
    2.  a receiver or manager of any company property and a person who has similar powers or responsibilities to a receiver or manager, and
    3.  a company liquidator.
30.  An employee is not generally an "officer" for the purposes of section 141G, unless they are also a person who satisfies any of the criteria in paragraph 29.

#### Time of notification

31.  Notification will be treated as occurring at the earlier of the date that the taxpayer or their agent receives written notice advising them of a pending audit, or a telephone call advising of a pending audit, or when an Inland Revenue officer makes an unannounced visit (see paragraph 33).
32.  If the exact time that the written notice was received becomes critical, it will be determined from the time that the notice is expected to reach its destination as specified by section 14B(8). Any telephone call advising that a tax audit or investigation is pending will be followed up in writing as soon as possible.

#### Unannounced visits

33.  In respect of unannounced visits, notification will be treated as occurring on the date that Inland Revenue first makes contact with the taxpayer. This means that taxpayers will not be able to make a pre-notification disclosure, but may still be able to make a post-notification disclosure (see paragraph 27 on making a voluntary disclosure during the first audit interview).

#### Disclosure by a company's subsidiary

34.  A tax audit of a parent company or one of its subsidiaries may necessitate the audit of other subsidiaries within the same group of companies. In such cases, whether there is a pre-notification or post-notification disclosure depends on which entity in the group has been notified of the audit and whether that notification related to one or more companies in the group or to the entire group.
35.  For example, a group of companies consists of a parent company and two subsidiaries. If only the parent company has been notified that a tax audit of the parent company is pending, any voluntary disclosure that a subsidiary of the group subsequently makes must be treated as a pre-notification disclosure (provided that it meets the requirements for full disclosure).
36.  However, if the subsidiaries have also been notified that a tax audit is pending, any voluntary disclosure that a subsidiary makes before the tax audit starts will be treated as a post-notification disclosure.
37.  When a company has a branch, the branch and company are considered to have been notified that a tax audit or investigation is pending at the same time. This is because the branch is not a separate legal entity from the company.

#### Full disclosure

38.  Inland Revenue will consider all valid voluntary disclosures. Subject to the applicable time bar and other relevant limitations the Commissioner can exercise the discretion under section 113 to amend an assessment to reflect the taxpayer's voluntary disclosure. See _SPS 07/03 Requests to amend assessments_, in _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol.19, No.5 (June 2007) for details.
39.  Section 141G requires that the voluntary disclosure be full. It is not the Commissioner's role where a penalty reduction is sought to elicit the required information from the taxpayer.This does not necessarily mean disclosing discrepancies to the last dollar but does require that the taxpayer provides sufficient information to enable the Commissioner to make a correct assessment. Each case must be considered on its own merits however if any subsequent investigation reveals a further shortfall that should have been included in the disclosure then the taxpayer will not be entitled to the reduction in respect to the voluntary disclosure.
40.  For example, a taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure in respect of previously unreturned interest income from money on fixed term deposit. On investigation it is revealed that the taxpayer also has other interest income that was not included in the voluntary disclosure. The voluntary disclosure was not a full disclosure in that other income was not included. The taxpayer will not be entitled to any reduction in respect of the disclosure.
41.  If the taxpayer provides information relating to a tax shortfall pursuant to a legal requirement, for example a request made under section 17, the taxpayer cannot be said to have made a voluntary disclosure.
42.  Similarly, if Inland Revenue has already identified and verified that there has been a tax shortfall, the taxpayer cannot make a voluntary disclosure.Any subsequent verification of the tax shortfall by the taxpayer would merely confirm the Commissioner's prior knowledge of that tax shortfall.
43.  However, if the taxpayer makes a disclosure of another tax shortfall that is not already known to the Commissioner (even if the disclosure arises as a result of a statutory request for information) the taxpayer's additional disclosure will be treated as a voluntary disclosure provided the other requirements of section 141G(2) are satisfied.
44.  If the disclosure is not fully detailed, and the taxpayer cannot provide full details at their first point of contact with Inland Revenue, the Commissioner will allow the taxpayer reasonable time to obtain more information. The time period for obtaining this information will be negotiated between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officer.
45.  If the taxpayer provides the clarifying information within the agreed period, and provided the information then constitutes a full disclosure, the taxpayer will be treated as having made a full disclosure on that initial date.

#### Minimum details required

46.  To satisfy the requirement for full disclosure a taxpayer should provide the following minimum details:
    1.  the taxpayer's details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, contact telephone number), and
    2.  the nature of the errors or omissions, and
    3.  an explanation as to why the errors or omissions occurred, and
    4.  adequate information to enable a correct assessment of the tax shortfall to be made, and
    5.  any further information that is necessary to make an assessment.
47.  Where all this information is not provided, the Commissioner will consider on a case-by-case basis whether the information provided is sufficient to satisfy the full disclosure requirements.
48.  In doing so, the Commissioner will have regard to the taxpayer's reasons for not providing all of the information listed in paragraph 46. (See the discussion regarding when the taxpayer cannot provide full details of the tax shortfall at the first point of contact in paragraph 44.)
49.  In addition to the minimum details stated in paragraph 46, taxpayers should consider the following situations to ensure that a full voluntary disclosure is made.

#### More than one tax shortfall

50.  Where a taxpayer has more than one tax shortfall each shortfall will be considered separately. For the purpose of section 141G, a distinction is drawn between a tax shortfall that is voluntarily disclosed and one that has been detected by an Inland Revenue tax audit. The latter cannot qualify for a shortfall penalty reduction under section 141G(3).
51.  A taxpayer can sometimes discover two matters that are relevant to the same tax position and shortfall. The taxpayer should disclose both matters when making the voluntary disclosure to Inland Revenue.
52.  If one of the matters is not disclosed until after the tax audit starts (for example, after the first audit interview has ended), the taxpayer cannot qualify for a shortfall penalty reduction under section 141G(3). This is because the taxpayer has not provided "all the details of the tax shortfall" necessary for full disclosure under section 141G(1).

#### Disclosure of another tax type

53.  If a taxpayer:
    1.  is subject to a tax audit on one tax type, and
    2.  makes a voluntary disclosure that satisfies the information requirements under section 141G(1) and (2) in respect of another tax type, and
    3.  has not been notified that a tax audit or investigation is pending in respect of that other tax type,the taxpayer's voluntary disclosure will qualify as a pre-notification disclosure.
54.  For example, a taxpayer is subject to an audit regarding PAYE because they paid wages without deducting tax pursuant to the PAYE rules. The taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure in respect of income tax for the 2007 year because they have omitted some sales in their income tax return. The taxpayer has not been notified that an audit is pending in respect of the income tax shortfall. The taxpayer's voluntary disclosure is a pre-notification disclosure for the purposes of section 141G(1)(a).

#### Disclosure of another period

55.  Inland Revenue's notification that a tax audit is pending will generally inform the taxpayer of the tax periods that are subject to the audit (though this period may be subsequently amended). The taxpayer can still make a pre-notification disclosure for another tax period that is not stipulated in the notification.
56.  However, Inland Revenue can extend the tax audit to other tax periods. Inland Revenue will notify the taxpayer promptly if the audit's scope widens during the audit and other tax types and/or periods are to be reviewed.
57.  If the taxpayer does not disclose all the details of a tax shortfall for a tax period until after they are notified that a tax audit is pending for that tax period, the taxpayer's voluntary disclosure cannot be a pre-notification disclosure under section 141G(3)(a). However, the taxpayer's full voluntary disclosure can be a post-notification disclosure if it is made before the tax audit starts (as defined in section 141G(5)).

#### The taxpayer's disclosure must be voluntary and unconditional

58.  Whether a taxpayer's disclosure is voluntary is a matter to be determined on a case-by-case basis. A taxpayer's disclosure of a tax shortfall is voluntary where the taxpayer has provided the information of their own free will, impulse or choice.
59.  Inland Revenue accepts that a taxpayer's disclosure is still a voluntary one even if it is prompted by the notification that a tax audit is pending. Section 141G(1)(b) provides that a taxpayer can make a post-notification disclosure in these circumstances provided that the requirements for full disclosure are met.
60.  However, sometimes Inland Revenue may advise the taxpayer of a known tax shortfall and request that the taxpayer provides specific information to verify the exact details of the shortfall - perhaps including timing of transactions and exact amounts of money involved - in order to raise the assessment. In this circumstance Inland Revenue has prompted the provision of the specific information and it is clear they already know about the tax shortfall so it cannot be said that a voluntary disclosure has been made.
61.  Inland Revenue occasionally receives information from taxpayers purporting to limit the Commissioner's use of it or containing conditions on how the information may be used. For example, a taxpayer may send a letter regarding an amount of income that had been treated as being non-taxable. The taxpayer's letter also contains a further condition that Inland Revenue should accept the information in full and final settlement of all other taxes and not investigate further (or discontinue an existing investigation). The Commissioner cannot be bound in this way and would be obligated to act on the information provided in the taxpayer's letter. If on further investigation no further shortfalls are found, the taxpayer's letter could still be a full disclosure, and provided it also meets the other criteria in this SPS the taxpayer's letter would still be a voluntary disclosure. However, if on further investigation, additional shortfalls are revealed, then the taxpayer's letter cannot be a voluntary disclosure as the disclosure was not full. In those circumstances the taxpayer would not be entitled to a reduction in respect to the information provided in the letter.

#### Prosecution

62.  If a taxpayer makes a pre-notification disclosure, Inland Revenue will not consider prosecution action against them in respect of the tax shortfall that has been voluntarily disclosed.
63.  However, Inland Revenue may consider prosecution action where a taxpayer makes a post-notification disclosure that involves evasion or similar offending.

### Examples

The following examples are provided to further explain the Commissioner's view on voluntary disclosures. The example are for purposes of clarification only and do not form part of the SPS.

#### Example 1

A taxpayer provides information regarding a tax shortfall pursuant to an information demand made by Inland Revenue under section 17. The information that the taxpayer has provided does not amount to a voluntary disclosure.

#### Example 2

An employer files their Employer Monthly Statement without an accompanying payment. The employer cannot voluntarily disclose the non-payment of the PAYE because Inland Revenue will already know that payment has not been made.

#### Example 3

An Inland Revenue officer has sufficient information to establish that a taxpayer who is a builder has not returned income tax on the proceeds from the sale of three houses (Houses A, B and C) in the 2008 tax year and the officer has sufficient information to verify the amount of the unreturned income tax.

The officer notifies the taxpayer that a tax audit or investigation is pending in respect of the 2008 tax year. In the letter, the officer sets out the facts and tax shortfalls. The officer also asks the taxpayer to provide specific information about these tax shortfalls.

The taxpayer has not made a voluntary disclosure for the purpose of section 141G. This is because Inland Revenue has prompted the taxpayer to provide the specific information and already knows about this tax shortfall.

The taxpayer in the above example can make a voluntary disclosure of other tax shortfalls that are not stipulated in the notification or known to Inland Revenue (see examples 4 and 5).

#### Example 4

Applying the same facts as in example 3, the taxpayer discloses a tax shortfall relating to the sale proceeds of a fourth house (House X) - also in the 2008 tax year. The taxpayer has made a voluntary disclosure in respect of this tax shortfall, notwithstanding that the audit notification may have prompted the taxpayer's disclosure.

This is because Inland Revenue has not specifically requested information regarding the fourth transaction. The taxpayer is entitled to a 40% post-notification disclosure reduction of any shortfall penalty payable in respect of this tax shortfall under section 141G(3)(b) and could be entitled to a further penalty reduction for previous behaviour under section 141FB (see _SPS 06/03 Reduction of shortfall penalties for previous behaviour_).

#### Example 5

Applying the same facts as in example 3, the information that the taxpayer has disclosed shows that they have omitted income on three sales (Houses A, B and Y) for the 2008 tax year. The disclosed information also shows that they did not in fact complete one of the sales (that is, in respect of House C) as asserted by the Inland Revenue officer.

In this example, the taxpayer has made a voluntary disclosure of the tax shortfall in respect of the sale of House Y that is unknown to Inland Revenue. The taxpayer is entitled to a 40% post-notification reduction of any shortfall penalty payable in respect of this tax shortfall under section 141G(3)(b) and could be entitled to a further penalty reduction for previous behaviour under section 141FB (see _SPS 06/03 Reduction of shortfall penalties for previous behaviour_).

The taxpayer is not entitled to any shortfall penalty reduction under section 141G(3) in respect of tax shortfalls that arise from the other two transactions, because they are already known to Inland Revenue.

#### Example 6

As part of a project to investigate specific concerns regarding the GST consequences where owners of serviced apartments change the way in which those apartments are used (for example, where the owner may have purchased an apartment as an investment property but subsequently moved into the property themselves), Inland Revenue writes to a number of apartments owners. The letter advises the taxpayers that they may need to make adjustments for non-taxable use of the apartment. The taxpayers were selected where Inland Revenue had information showing the property was the same as the address used by the taxpayer for other activities although Inland Revenue had not yet formed an intention to actively investigate all or any of the group. The letter reminds the taxpayer of a need to make appropriate adjustments should the taxpayer occupy the property themselves.

In response to the above letter a taxpayer has made a voluntary disclosure of a tax shortfall in respect of their private use of a property. The letter from Inland Revenue did not contain details of a specific tax shortfall, nor did it advise of a pending audit. That being the case, the taxpayer is entitled to a 100% pre-notification reduction of any shortfall penalty payable, notwithstanding the disclosure may have been prompted by the letter sent to the taxpayers advising of Inland Revenue's interest in this matter.

**Note:**

The circumstances in Example 6 can be distinguished from that described in paragraph 42 of the SPS. This is because in Example 6 Inland Revenue had not verified that a shortfall existed, nor the amount of any shortfall.

#### Example 7

Inland Revenue does a preliminary risk review exercise in order to determine which taxpayers ought to be investigated. As part of that risk review an Investigator writes to a taxpayer and requests a copy of their financial statements for the period of the risk review. The taxpayer realises there is an error in the income tax return filed for that period and along with the information requested also makes a voluntary disclosure.

The request for financial statements made as part of the risk review exercise is not notification of an audit. Provided the other criteria for a full disclosure, as set out in paragraphs 38 - 49 of the SPS, are met, the taxpayer would be entitled to a pre-notification deduction. This is despite the fact that the taxpayer may have inferred an audit was likely to eventuate following the "risk review".

#### Example 8

A taxpayer files a GST return showing a large refund. As part of a refund check conducted by Inland Revenue, an officer contacts the taxpayer to ask about the large refund. The taxpayer advises they have purchased a large property. The officer asks to be shown the documentation relating to that purchase. Before sending the documents the taxpayer notes that they do not have a valid tax invoice in respect of the input tax claimed and so makes a voluntary disclosure.

The request for information relating to the large refund was not notice of a pending audit or investigation. Therefore the taxpayer is entitled to a pre-notification reduction for the voluntary disclosure.

**Note:**

In respect of Example 7 and Example 8 a request for information in similar circumstances may include notification of an audit or investigation. However, consistent with _SPS 07/02 Notification of a pending audit or investigation,_ this would be clearly brought to the taxpayer's attention by using the words "audit" or "investigation".

Recording Inland Revenue Interviews (July 2010) (WITHDRAWN)
===========================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS 10/01 Recording Inland Revenue Interviews. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This item also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ _(TIB)_ Vol 22 No 7 (August 2010).

### Introduction

1.  For the purpose of administering the Inland Revenue Acts[1](#1)
     it is often necessary for Inland Revenue officers to conduct interviews with taxpayers and others. The purpose of an interview will range from general information exchanges to resolve queries to formal interviews where there is the potential for litigation.
2.  Interviewees will generally be asked to attend an interview on a voluntary basis. However, section 19 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 gives the Commissioner the authority to require any person to attend an interview. Compulsory interviews under section 19 are held when considered appropriate by the Commissioner to obtain information from taxpayers or other parties.
3.  As statements made by taxpayers and others during an interview may be admissible as evidence in litigation it is important that all interviews are carried out in a fair and open manner and in a way that will not make the statement inadmissible. It is also important that interviews are clearly recorded and that the questions and answers are unambiguous.
4.  Not all interviews conducted by Inland Revenue will be electronically recorded. In many cases traditional hand-written notes will be sufficient. However, Inland Revenue is increasingly conducting interviews using technology.
5.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue's standard practice for using technology to record interviews where it is appropriate.
6.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA").

### Application

7.  This SPS applies from 1 July 2010. It replaces _SPS INV-330 Tape-recording Inland Revenue Interviews_ which was published in _TIB_ Vol 12, No 5 (May 2000).
8.  It does not apply to independent contractors conducting interviews on behalf of Inland Revenue, such as a research company contracted to carry out a customer survey, or an external solicitor contracted to carry out a Child Support Review.

### Legislation

9.  Section 19 of the TAA provides:
10.  **19 Inquiry by Commissioner**
    
    1.  The Commissioner may, for the purpose of obtaining any information with respect to the liability of any person for any tax or duty under any of the Inland Revenue Acts or any other information required for the purposes of the administration or enforcement of any of those Acts or for the purpose of carrying out any other function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner, by notice, require any person to attend and give evidence before the Commissioner or before any officer of the Department authorised by the Commissioner in that behalf, and to produce all books and documents in the custody or under the control of that person which contain or which the Commissioner or the authorised officer considers likely to contain any such information.
    2.  The Commissioner may require any such evidence to be given on oath and either orally or in writing, and for that purpose the Commissioner or the authorised officer may administer an oath.
    3.  No person summoned or examined under this section shall be excused from answering any question on the ground that the answer may incriminate the person or render the person liable to any penalty or forfeiture.
    4.  No statement made by any such person in answer to any question put to the person shall in criminal proceedings be admissible against the person, except upon a charge of perjury against the person in respect of the person's testimony upon that examination.
    5.  The provisions of the Crimes Act 1961 which relate to perjury are applicable to any inquiry under this section.
    6.  A person required to attend before the Commissioner or an authorised officer may receive out of money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose such sum on account of travelling expenses and loss of time as the Commissioner thinks reasonable and orders accordingly.

10.  Principle 6 of the Privacy Act 1993 provides:
11.  **Principle 6 Access to personal information**
    
    1.  Where an agency holds personal information in such a way that it can readily be retrieved, the individual concerned shall be entitled-
        1.  To obtain from the agency confirmation of whether or not the agency holds such personal information; and
        2.  To have access to that information.
    2.  Where, in accordance with subclause (1)(b) of this principle, an individual is given access to personal information, the individual shall be advised that, under principle 7, the individual may request the correction of that information.
    3.  The application of this principle is subject to the provisions of Parts 4 and 5 of this Act.

11.  Section 27 of the Privacy Act 1993 provides for exceptions to Principle 6, one of which may sometimes apply to Inland Revenue responsibilities for administering the Revenue Acts
    1.  An agency may refuse to disclose any information requested pursuant to principle 6 if the disclosure of the information would be likely-  
        ...
        3.  To prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the right to a fair trial;... .

### Standard Practice

12.  The electronic recording of interviews is common practice by regulatory and investigative agencies. There are advantages for both parties in electronically recording interviews:
    *   Using technology to record an interview will take less time than taking hand written notes;
    *   Electronic recording provides an exact record of what was said by all the parties at the interview;
    *   Those parties at the interview are able to concentrate fully on the interview instead of there being delays while taking full written notes;
    *   An electronic copy of the interview will, in most cases, be made available to the interviewee.

13.  It is likely that electronic recording would be necessary where:
    
    *   The tax affairs which the interview relates to are complex;
    *   There are numerous facts to be gathered;
    *   There are inconsistencies in the interviewee's explanations to date;
    *   The relationship between the interviewee and Inland Revenue has deteriorated and objectivity needs to be restored;
    *   There is a possibility that Inland Revenue may commence civil or criminal proceedings.
    
      
    These are examples only and the decision by Inland Revenue staff to record an interview is not limited to these situations.

14.  An interviewee may request that an interview be recorded. Such requests should be made before the interview in sufficient time to arrange recording equipment.

#### _Preliminary matters_

15.  If Inland Revenue intends to electronically record an interview, the interviewee will be advised of that intention when the interview is arranged.
16.  If a decision about electronically recording an interview subsequently changes, the interviewee is to be advised of that decision as soon as practicable before the interview starts.
17.  Where an interviewee is attending an interview voluntarily the interview will only be electronically recorded with the interviewee's consent and co-operation. If the interviewee declines to consent to recording of a voluntary interview, Inland Revenue will respect that decision. There will be no secret recording of interviews.
18.  Compulsory interviews under section19 will always be electronically recorded, using video recording technology in appropriate cases. The interviewee's consent is not required for electronically recording section19 interviews.

#### _The recording process_

19.  There are three ways in which an interview may be recorded:
    1.  in handwriting (which may be typewritten later);
    2.  by audio recording;
    3.  by video recording.
20.  As noted, it is preferable to record interviews using technology rather than taking hand-written notes. Video recording is not regularly used but may be used when it is appropriate, such as when the interview is likely to be used evidentially.
21.  Hand-written notes may be taken even when an interview is being recorded electronically.

#### _The interview_

22.  After the formal introduction to the interview, the interviewer will ask the interviewee to acknowledge that the interview is being electronically recorded (and in the case of a voluntary interview, with the consent of the interviewee).
23.  The interview may be admitted in evidence. To avoid any misunderstanding, it is important that everyone involved in the interview speaks clearly and slowly.
24.  If more than one interviewer is asking questions, they will need to identify themselves for purposes of transcription.

#### _Copies_

25.  The purpose of an interview is to obtain information to assist in fulfilling the Commissioner's duties. For this reason copies of interviews are kept for reference and for use in potential litigation.
26.  Under Principle 6 of Privacy Act 1993[2](#2)
     a person is entitled to ask for a copy of any material that relates to them held by, for example, a government agency or an employer.
27.  **Hand-written interview notes**: If the result of an interview is recorded in writing, the statement will be read back to the interviewee, or the interviewee should be asked to read it. The interviewee will be asked to initial each page except the last, which should be signed with the interviewee's full name. If the handwriting is easily legible, it may not be necessary to have the record typed. If requested, the interviewer, in most cases, will give the interviewee a copy of the statement immediately. If copying facilities are not immediately available, a copy may be posted to the interviewee.
28.  **Digitally recorded interviews:** If a digital recording system is used, the original recording on the hard drive of a laptop computer or hand-held recorder cannot be sealed but will be moved to a permanent and secure storage repository. The technology used by Inland Revenue creates tamper proof recordings and these are transferred to permanent storage under strict controls to ensure future security of related records. The interviewee must be told this. In such cases the interviewer should immediately make copies to CD or DVD (depending on the technology available). One copy is to be sealed in the interviewee's presence. The other copy will become an Inland Revenue file copy.
29.  **Copy of the interview record to the interviewee:** Inland Revenue will, in most cases, give the interviewee a copy of a recorded interview. However, in some cases there may be reason to suspect that giving an interviewee a copy may prejudice the maintenance of the law, which in Inland Revenue's case means the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts.
30.  In cases such as these, the Privacy Act 1993 and the Official Information Act 1992 allow the agency to withhold copies until the investigation has been completed.
31.  Where it is decided not to provide a copy immediately, an interviewee will be told of the decision to withhold that copy, and that one will be supplied at the conclusion of the investigation. The interviewee will be advised of their right under section 67 of the Privacy Act 1993 to seek an investigation and review by the Privacy Commissioner of the Commissioner's decision to withhold the copy.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 30 June 2010.

Imaging of electronic storage media
===================================

SPS 10/02 sets out IR's practice when taking an image of a taxpayer's electronic storage media.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 22, No. 7 (August 2010).

### Introduction

1.  Taxpayers record and store business records and other information on a variety of electronic storage media. This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue's practice when taking an image of a taxpayer's electronic storage media. This SPS has been produced to establish Inland Revenue's standards for imaging electronic storage media and to ensure that Inland Revenue performs that function efficiently, effectively and consistently.
2.  All references to legislation in this SPS are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") unless specified otherwise.

### Application

3.  This SPS discusses a small part of Inland Revenue's wider information-gathering powers under the TAA. The standard practice contained in this SPS will be applied where other means of obtaining information are inappropriate or inadequate.
4.  This SPS applies from 14 July 2010.

### Background

5.  Electronic record-keeping and the storage of information by electronic means has become common practice for taxpayers. Technological developments mean records can be kept and information can be stored electronically on a variety of media.
6.  Information stored electronically falls within the definition of "book and document" under section 3. Examples include, but are not limited to, information stored in computer hard drives, USB flash drives, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, photocopiers, scanners, and external hard drives. The Commissioner is entitled to access such information where it is "necessary or relevant" under section 16.
7.  Consequently, there is a need for Inland Revenue to expand its information collection methods to accommodate technological advances. This SPS provides the framework within which an electronic storage medium can be imaged using the existing statutory information gathering powers provided for in sections 16 and 16B.
8.  The imaging of the electronic storage medium is generally performed on-site where the medium is located. If this is not possible, section 16B allows the Commissioner to remove the device to image off-site. In certain circumstances, section 16C provides that the Commissioner can, by obtaining a warrant or with the consent of the occupier, remove and retain the electronic storage medium to allow full and complete inspection. However, note that the scope of this SPS is limited to the imaging of electronic storage media only. It does not extend to the retention of electronic storage media for inspection.

### Definitions

9.  The following terms are used throughout this SPS:

*   **_Electronic storage medium:_** Any device that has the ability to store data electronically. This may include computer hard drives, memory cards, memory sticks, mobile phones, MP3 players, or any other devices that have the function of storing data electronically.
*   **_Image:_** An exact copy of all data from the original electronic storage medium, saved in a file format that is evidentially sound and allows retrieval and analysis of that data.

### Summary

10.  Section 16 authorises the Commissioner to have full and free access to any place to inspect and copy all books and documents that the Commissioner considers necessary or relevant for a purpose under an Inland Revenue Act.
11.  The definition of "book and document" in section 3 includes an electronic storage medium.
12.  Generally, as a starting point, a relevance search will be carried out on the electronic storage medium in order to satisfy the Commissioner that the electronic storage medium contains "necessary or relevant" information or it is likely to provide any information otherwise required. However, there may be circumstances where the Commissioner has sufficient information to be satisfied that the electronic storage medium contains information that is "necessary or relevant" without conducting a relevance search.
13.  In some cases, such as where the data stored on the electronic storage medium is encrypted or where there has been a claim of legal privilege or non-disclosure right, it may not be practicable for the Commissioner to conduct a relevance search. In which case the medium will be imaged without carrying out a relevance search. This does not necessarily mean that the search is unreasonable in terms of section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 because there may be circumstances where the Commissioner has sufficient information to be satisfied that the electronic storage medium contains information that is "necessary or relevant" without conducting a relevance search.
14.  As the courts have found that an electronic storage medium is analogous to a book or a very long document, the entire electronic storage medium will be imaged if the relevance search identifies information that is "necessary or relevant".
15.  In the event that a claim of legal privilege or non-disclosure right for tax advice documents is made, in order to preserve the information, the electronic storage medium will either be sealed, or imaged and then sealed.
16.  The Commissioner will attempt to resolve the claim of legal privilege or non-disclosure right with the person making the claim by negotiation, although the matter may need to be resolved through the courts.
17.  The imaging of the electronic storage medium is generally performed on-site where the electronic storage medium is located. However, under section 16B, the Commissioner may remove an electronic storage medium for the purpose of imaging it.
18.  In deciding whether to remove an electronic storage medium, the Commissioner may consider the following:
    *   Volume of data stored on the electronic storage medium;
    *   Whether it is appropriate or practicable for the electronic storage medium to be removed;
    *   The time it may take to image the electronic storage medium on-site;
    *   The occupier's preference for the removal of the electronic storage medium or other reasonable alternatives as suggested by the occupier; and
    *   Whether it is appropriate for the Inland Revenue officers to remain at the premises.
19.    
    In any case, if there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a risk to the information stored on the electronic storage medium, the electronic storage medium will be removed.

19.  Consent for the removal of the electronic storage medium for imaging is not required by section 16B.
20.  To minimise any disruption to business that may be caused by the removal of the electronic storage medium, the owner has a right to inspect and obtain a copy of the electronic storage medium that is removed.
21.  The scope of this SPS is limited to the standard practice for imaging electronic storage media. It does not extend to the power to remove and retain books or documents for inspection under section 16C.

### Legislation

22.  The relevant provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 in relation to the information gathering powers are sections 3, 16 and 16B:

### Discussion

#### The Commissioner's powers to obtain information under sections 16 & 16B

24.  Section 16 authorises the Commissioner to have full and free access to any place to inspect and copy all books and documents that the Commissioner considers "necessary or relevant".
25.  "Necessary or relevant" for the purposes of section 16 means that the book or document is necessary or relevant for any of the following purposes:
    *   Collecting any tax or duty under any of the Inland Revenue Acts;
    *   Carrying out any other function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner;
    *   Likely to provide any information required for the purposes of any of the Inland Revenue Acts or the Commissioner's functions.
26.  Occupiers of lands, buildings, or places are required to assist the Commissioner by providing all reasonable facilities and assistance for the effective exercise of section 16 and to answer all proper questions relating to that exercise (section 16(2)).
27.  Section 16(3) provides that a private dwelling can only be accessed by obtaining a warrant or with the consent of an occupier.
28.  Section 16B was inserted into the TAA in 2003, giving the Commissioner the power to remove books or documents accessed under section 16 in order to make copies. This power was provided to address the risk of books or documents being destroyed, removed, or tampered with in certain cases. The power under section 16B will be exercised in situations where it is necessary to prevent the Commissioner's legitimate investigations being hindered or where copying on the premises is not practicable.
29.  As discussed in paragraphs 33 to 36 of this SPS, the removal of books or documents under section 16B includes removing an electronic storage medium for imaging. Consent to remove the book or document for copying is not required by section 16B.
30.  If the Commissioner removes a book or document, the owner is entitled to, at the time of removal or at reasonable times subsequently, inspect and obtain a copy of the book or document that is removed (section 16B(4)). This should assist in minimising any disruption to businesses or other activities that may be caused by the removal of the books or documents. In any case, books and documents that are removed will be copied and returned as soon as practicable.
31.  Decisions to access places and to remove books or documents from those places will be made or approved by an Inland Revenue officer delegated to do so on behalf of the Commissioner.
32.  Certified copies of books or documents are admissible in evidence in court as if they were the original (section 16B(3)).

#### Books and documents

33.  The definition of "book and document" under section 3 refers to a broad range of items that store or record information, including those that do so electronically.
34.  In _Avowal Administration Attorneys Limited & Ors v District Court at NorthShore & Anor_ \[2010\] NZCA 183, the Court of Appeal held that a computer hard drive comes within the definition of "book and document". A "record" includes information that is recorded, as well as the medium in which the recording is made. It follows then, that "any other type of record whatever" referred to in the definition should include a computer hard drive.
35.  This finding in _Avowal_ is also consistent with the observations made in the Court of Appeal in _A Firm of Solicitors v District Court at Auckland_ \[2006\] 1 NZLR 586 where it was observed that a computer hard drive is a "document" that may be \[imaged\].
36.  The courts have confirmed the Commissioner's view that devices that have the ability to store or record information electronically fall within the meaning of "book and document" under section 3 and therefore are subject to removal and imaging under sections 16 and 16B. Also see definition of "electronic storage medium" at paragraph 9.

#### Relevance search and imaging of the electronic storage medium

37.  The Commissioner's powers under sections 16 and 16B are subject to section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, which provides that everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. Therefore, as a starting point, a relevance search is carried out to enable the Commissioner to be satisfied that the electronic storage medium is necessary or relevant for the purposes of section 16(1) or it is likely to provide information otherwise required for these purposes.
38.  In some cases, it may not be practicable for the Commissioner to conduct a relevance search, such as where the data stored on the electronic storage medium is encrypted (making it impossible to carry out a relevance search), or where the information is subject to a claim of legal privilege or non-disclosure right.
39.  While the Court of Appeal in _Avowal_ noted a preliminary screening of the electronic storage medium to be good practice, it did not see it as necessarily a prerequisite to a reasonable search or access under section 16. The Commissioner may already hold information that provides sufficient ground to be satisfied that the electronic storage medium is "necessary or relevant". The "reasonableness" of a search must be assessed having regard to the circumstances of the case.
40.  If the relevance search identifies information of interest, the Commissioner is entitled to image the entire electronic storage medium. The fact that the electronic storage medium also contains irrelevant or privileged information does not mean it cannot be copied or removed. The court in _A Firm of Solicitors_ described the removal of a hard drive or the copying of a hard drive as analogous with the removal of a book or a very long document and reasoned that it cannot be contemplated that only pages containing relevant or non-privileged information are torn out and removed from that book or document. Therefore, the Commissioner will image the entire electronic storage medium.

#### Removal of electronic storage medium

41.  _Avowal_ also confirmed that where the Commissioner has determined that the information contained in an electronic storage medium is necessary or relevant for a purpose under an Inland Revenue Act or is likely to provide any information otherwise required for these purposes, the Commissioner is entitled to remove that electronic storage medium for copying under section 16B. The reasoning in _A Firm of Solicitors_ discussed in paragraph 40 also applies to the removal of the electronic storage medium. The fact that the electronic storage medium contains privileged or irrelevant material should not prevent it from being removed. What is required is a warrant, for the purpose of removal for inspection, with conditions to deal with irrelevant or privileged material appropriately.
42.  Section 16B does not require the consent of the occupier before removing the electronic storage medium for imaging.

#### Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents and legal privilege

43.  Confidential communications between legal practitioners and their clients that meet the criteria under section 20 are privileged from disclosure under section 16.
44.  Sections 20B to 20G deal with the right of an information holder to not disclose a book or document that is eligible to be a tax advice document. See _SPS 05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents_ (or any subsequent replacements of the SPS) for more information.
45.  The Commissioner will adhere to the provisions of sections 20 to 20G regarding legal privilege and the non-disclosure right for tax advice documents when exercising the information-gathering powers, including when imaging electronic storage media.
46.  As decided in _A Firm of Solicitors_, the mere removal and imaging of documents that may be legally privileged or subject to non-disclosure right does not breach that right or privilege, as there is no disclosure of those documents. The Commissioner will engage in a process to ensure that these documents are not accessed unless it is necessary to extract those documents to resolve the claim of legal privilege or non-disclosure right.

### Standard Practice

#### Accessing the electronic storage medium

47.  Section 16 authorises the Commissioner to access all lands, buildings and places to inspect and image electronic storage media if it is considered that the electronic storage media is "necessary or relevant". This includes access using section 16 and obtaining a warrant or with the consent of an occupier to enter a private dwelling.
48.  The Inland Revenue officer exercising section 16 may be accompanied by any other person considered necessary for the effective exercise of the power.
49.  The Commissioner's entitlement to full and free access to information stored in electronic storage media, together with the requirement in section 16(2) that the occupier of the premises must provide the Commissioner with all reasonable facilities and assistance for the effective exercise of the Commissioner's powers under section 16, means that the occupier must provide, for example, decryption codes and passwords in order to access the data stored in the electronic storage media.
50.  It is the Commissioner's view that reasonable force can be used to obtain full and free access to an electronic storage medium. Reasonable force would be, for example, removing the need to use a password on a computer or disassembling a computer in order to access the computer hard drive.

#### Carry out a relevance search

51.  A relevance search is carried out to determine whether the electronic storage medium contains information that is necessary or relevant or is likely to provide any information otherwise required.
52.  If the relevance search reveals that the electronic storage medium contains information of interest, that entire electronic storage medium will be imaged. Generally, the imaging is performed on-site where the electronic storage medium is located.
53.  The occupier will be given information about the right to claim legal privilege and non-disclosure right for tax advice documents. If a claim to legal privilege or the non-disclosure right for tax advice documents is made over the contents of an electronic storage medium, a relevance search will not be carried out and the electronic storage medium will be sealed or imaged then sealed. (See paragraphs 64 to 70 on the process for dealing with legal privilege and non-disclosure right.)
54.  Further, a relevance search will not be carried out where it is not practicable for the Commissioner to do so, such as where the data is encrypted.  In these cases, the encrypted electronic storage medium will be imaged without carrying out a relevance search.
55.  As mentioned in paragraph 39, the Commissioner may already hold information that provides sufficient ground to be satisfied that the electronic storage medium is "necessary or relevant" without carrying out a relevance search. Not carrying out a relevance search in some cases does not necessarily lead to an unreasonable search and seizure of the electronic storage medium.

#### Removal of electronic storage media

56.  The Commissioner's preference is to image electronic storage media on the premises accessed under section 16. However the removal of electronic storage media for the purposes of imaging is provided for in section 16B. The decision to remove the electronic storage media will be made by an appropriately delegated Inland Revenue officer.
57.  Section 16B provides for the removal of electronic storage media for the purpose of imaging. The Commissioner may take into consideration any relevant factors when deciding to remove an electronic storage medium for imaging, including but not limited to the following:
    *   Volume of data stored on the electronic storage medium;
    *   Whether it is appropriate or practicable for the electronic storage medium to be removed;
    *   The time it may take to image the electronic storage medium on-site (to avoid prolonged occupation at the premises or disruption to business);
    *   The occupier's preference for the removal of the electronic storage medium or any reasonable alternatives as suggested by the occupier; and
    *   Whether it is appropriate for the Inland Revenue officers to remain at the premises. For example, access to a private dwelling where children are present or may be expected.
58.  In any case, if the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that there is a risk to the information stored on the electronic storage medium, the electronic storage medium will be removed.

58.  While the information stored on a computer hard drive can be regarded as falling within the meaning of "book and document" and is removable under section 16B, the computer itself does not. However, if the hard drive of a computer is not readily removable, the entire computer may need to be removed in order to image the hard drive. Consent is not necessary but the criteria for removal in paragraph 57 will be applied.
59.  Where it is not appropriate for Inland Revenue officers to remain at the premises, or where the occupier has expressed their preference for removal, the electronic storage medium will be removed. The Commissioner will follow the same process of carrying out a relevance search on the electronic storage medium off-site, and the device will be imaged if the relevance search identifies information that is necessary or relevant or is likely to provide any information otherwise required.
60.  A receipt detailing the items removed and the date of removal will be provided to the occupier at the time of removal.
61.  If legal privilege or the non-disclosure right is claimed, an undertaking will be provided that the contents of the electronic storage medium will not be viewed until such claims have been dealt with, unless it is necessary to view the contents to resolve the claim of legal privilege or non-disclosure right.
62.  The electronic storage media that are removed will be taken to a site where they will be imaged by a qualified technician and returned to the occupier as soon as practicable. An indication will be given to the occupier at the time of removal as to when the electronic storage media will be returned, having regard to the amount of data to be imaged.
63.  To minimise any disruption to business or other activities, the owner of the electronic storage medium is entitled to inspect and obtain a copy of the electronic storage medium that is removed, at the time of removal or at reasonable times subsequently.

#### Protection of non-disclosure right for tax advice documents and legal privilege

64.  An electronic storage medium may contain information that may be subject to legal privilege or tax advice documents that are protected by the non-disclosure right under the TAA.
65.  The occupier will be given an opportunity to claim legal privilege or non-disclosure right for tax advice documents before a relevance search is carried out. Alternatively, a claim of non-disclosure right may be made by a later date as agreed by the Commissioner. Legal privilege and non-disclosure right may be claimed by providing the name of the legal practitioner or the tax advisor to the Inland Revenue officers. (Note that this differs from the process for claiming the right of non-disclosure as set out in _SPS 05/07_.)
66.  If a claim to legal privilege or the non-disclosure right for tax advice documents is made over the contents of an electronic storage medium, it is the Commissioner's view that the information in the electronic storage medium should be preserved in order to deal with the claim at a later stage (see paragraph 68). In these circumstances, a relevance search will not be carried out. However, to protect the claim, the Commissioner will either:
    *   Seal the original electronic storage medium; or
    *   Image the electronic storage medium then seal the imaged copy and return the original. This would allow a business to continue to operate.
67.  The sealed item will be held in a secure place that has restricted access and is independent from the investigation. The Inland Revenue officers will provide an undertaking that the sealed item would not be viewed, unless viewing it is unavoidable while carrying out the step in paragraph 68.
68.  The Commissioner will attempt to deal with the claim of legal privilege or the tax advice status of information by negotiation with the person making the claim. To identify documents that may be legally privileged or that may be tax advice documents, the Commissioner will request names and keywords that may identify these documents. These documents will then be filtered and provided to the person to decide which documents they want to claim legal privilege or tax advice status on. The person will be given sufficient time in order to make the claim. The filtering of the documents will be carried out by a trained technician who is independent from the investigation.
69.  If the claim of legal privilege or the non-disclosure of tax advice documents cannot be resolved between the Commissioner and the person making the claim, the Commissioner may apply to a District Court Judge for orders under section 20(5) as to whether the claim for legal privilege is valid, or under section 20G as to whether the document is a tax advice document (or for related orders regarding tax contextual information).
70.  Only documents that are relevant and not treated as legally privileged or tax advice documents will be relied on by the Commissioner.

#### Protection of secrecy

71.  Section 81 requires Inland Revenue officers to maintain the secrecy of all matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts that come to the officer's knowledge, including all information stored on electronic storage media. The prohibition on disclosure also applies to information on the electronic storage media that is not relevant to an Inland Revenue Act, for example marketing information on a company's new product.
72.  Accordingly, Inland Revenue will not disclose any information obtained except where it is in the course of carrying into effect an Inland Revenue Act.
73.  The maintenance of secrecy provisions in the TAA extend to any third parties that may accompany the Commissioner in the exercise of the section 16 power.

Acceptance of late objections under Section 92(2) of the Child Support Act 1991
===============================================================================

SPS 10/03 sets out IR's policy on the acceptance of late objections to assessments or decisions under the Child Support Act 1991.

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement sets out Inland Revenue's policy on the acceptance of late objections to assessments or decisions under section 92(2) of the Child Support Act 1991 ("the CSA").
2.  This matter was previously included in SPS INV-300: _Acceptance of late objections under section 126 of the Tax Administration Ac_t 1994, published in March 1997. SPS INV-300 has been withdrawn (refer to notice of withdrawal in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 21, No 3 (May 2009)).
3.  For the purposes of this statement "objector" means "liable person" and or "custodian" under the CSA.

### Background

4.  Section 92(1) of the CSA provides that objections are to be delivered or posted to the Commissioner within 28 days after the date on which notice of the decision or assessment objected to was given by the Commissioner. However, section 92(2) of the CSA provides a discretion to allow the Commissioner to accept a late objection.
5.  The Court of Appeal in _CIR v Wilson_ (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 considered it impossible to lay down absolute rules as to what factors will always be relevant to the determination of a late objection request. The Court however in effect, did suggest a two step approach in considering requests. In summary, the first step is to consider the objector's explanation for the lateness of the objection. A reasonable explanation is all that is required at this stage. The second step is to consider all the surrounding circumstances and decide whether, as a matter of fairness, the application should be allowed.
6.  The steps are:  
      
    _Step 1_  
      
    Consider the explanation given by the objector for their failure to make a timely objection.Where there has been a delay, the reasons for the failure to make the objection within the required time will be considered.  
      
    Depending on the circumstances, it may be relevant to consider whether the failure to object in time was due to inadvertence, negligence, an agent's action or a deliberate decision of the objector. These factors may weigh against the objector.  
      
    A reasonable explanation to explain the delay is all that is required at this point. For example, where the delay was caused by:
    
    *   the ill health of the objector, or
    *   other circumstances beyond their control, such as the objector being overseas during the whole of the 28 day objection period and there were no arrangements in place to receive and deal with notices.
    
      
    This will generally be sufficient to satisfy step 1.  
      
    If there is some merit in the explanation given (that is, it provides reasonable justification for the failure to object in time), the objection will be considered further in accordance with step 2.  
      
    If, however, the explanation is inadequate, the objection can be rejected making it unnecessary to proceed to step 2.  
      
    Under section 92(3) of the CSA, the details and grounds of the late objection must be given at the same time as the explanation for the delay.  
      
    _Step 2  
    _  
    The Commissioner will consider all the circumstances surrounding the objection to decide whether, as a matter of fairness, the objection should be allowed.  
      
    This may mean some duplication of those matters considered in step 1 (reasons for the delay in making the late objection). However, the purpose at step 2 is to determine whether in the light of all the circumstances, and as a matter of fairness the objection should be allowed.  
      
    The Court of Appeal in _Wilson_ noted that although obtaining a correct assessment may be an important factor, it would be going too far to say it is the paramount consideration in deciding whether to accept a late objection. A number of factors have been identified as potentially relevant in this regard. These are set out in Appendix A.

#### _Claims where there has been a clear error_

Where there is a clear error in the assessment or decision, an amendment may be made under section 87 of the CSA.

#### _Other claims_

If the error can be established only after further investigation or consideration, (and the error does not arise from a subsequent change in interpretation of the law), the procedures set out in steps 1 and 2 will need to be followed. A liberal approach should be taken when considering such claims.

### Weighting of factors

7.  The weighting to be given to the factors which are taken into account in deciding whether or not to accept a late objection, is to be decided by the Commissioner on the circumstances of each case.

### Recording the decision

8.  It is important that the factors taken into account in deciding whether or not to accept a late objection be adequately documented.
9.  A detailed report will be prepared, addressed to the person who will be making the decision whether to accept the late objection, or not. This report will set out the factors which have been taken into account, the weight that has been applied to each factor and the reasons for the recommendation.
10.  The person making the decision is to include their comments including their reasoning and the resulting decision.

### No appeal or objection rights

11.  There are no appeal or objection rights under the CSA where the Commissioner does not exercise his discretion to accept a late objection. However, the decision can be challenged by way of judicial review to the High Court.
12.  Should judicial review proceedings arise, evidence of the decision making process will need to be produced to the Court. It will enhance the evidence which can be produced to the Court, if the factors taken into account and the reasons for making the decision are recorded at the time. This evidence may include an affidavit from the officer who made the decision to decline the late objection, all relevant correspondence, file notes, phone call notes, signed reports and system notes.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on the 15th day of July 2010.

### APPENDIX A

#### Factors which may be relevant in considering a late objection request (to be considered under "step 2" of the process)

Some factors which support the acceptance of a late objection are:

*   If the proposed objection has apparent merit. This may and often will be a relevant factor. This can only be assessed on the material before the Commissioner when asked to accept a late objection and need not be investigated to the point of allowance or disallowance. It will not usually be necessary for Inland Revenue to make further enquiry to determine the merits in order to make a decision. In some cases however, a moment's check may show that the quantification of liability in the assessment was erroneous.
*   If the objector had consistently asserted their entitlement and only failed to lodge an objection due to the Commissioner's insistence that the entitlement was not available to them.
*   If there are no practical or administrative difficulties in considering the situation at that time (e.g. they are part of a readily identifiable group, the evidence is immediately available and no practical obstacles exist to its application).
*   The objectors have been told that a "test case" would apply to them.
*   When an assessment notice or decision has been sent to the objector's home and the objector is temporarily away during the 28 day objection period.
*   The serious ill health or death of an agent, or the agent's office is shut for annual holidays.
*   When granting the relief requested would not violate the Commissioner's responsibility to be even handed.
*   When the objector is seeking legal or other professional advice.
*   When the objector is ignorant of procedures to follow.
*   When the objector has fallen ill.

Some factors which support declining a late objection are:

*   If an objector has a professional adviser, Inland Revenue may be reluctant to accept a late objection as a professional advisor should generally be aware of the legislative requirements of the CSA. Omitting to lodge an objection because of an oversight by the objector or their advisor will usually not on its own constitute satisfactory grounds for accepting a late objection.
*   The extent to which an objection is late and any history of making late objections by either the objector or the agent.
*   The Commissioner would not be required to exercise discretion where the objector had never contemplated seeking a benefit but had endeavoured to take advantage of a subsequent change in the interpretation of the law, such as by way of a subsequent court decision or issue of a Standard Practice Statement.

All circumstances are to be considered. The above factors are guidelines only and are not exhaustive. They are not intended to restrict the discretion given to the Commissioner. Decision makers should always remain open to the possibility of new factors arising in any case that may make it unfair not to accept the objection.

Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer (November 2010) (WITHDRAWN)
===============================================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS 10/05 - Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This item also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 22, No. 11 (December 2010).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") discusses a taxpayer's rights and responsibilities in respect of an assessment or other disputable decision when the taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process.  
      
    
2.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").  
      
    
3.  Where the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner's practice is stated in _SPS 10/04 Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_.  
      
    
4.  The Commissioner regards this SPS as a reference guide for taxpayers and Inland Revenue officers. Where possible, Inland Revenue officers must follow the practices outlined in this SPS.  
      
    
5.  The disputes resolution process is designed to ensure that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process.  
      
    
6.  The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an "all cards on the table" approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to a court.  
      
    
7.  In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N(1)(c)) must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment.

### Application

8.  This SPS applies from 8 November 2010 and incorporates administrative changes to the disputes process which were implemented by Inland Revenue on 1 April 2010.  
      
    
9.  It replaces _SPS 08/02 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer_.  
      
    
10.  We acknowledge that Inland Revenue issued an officials' issues paper entitled "Disputes: a review" in July 2010. However, the outcome of that review has yet to be finally determined. This SPS represents the law and the Commissioner's administrative practice as it currently stands. If changes to the law and/or the Commissioner's administrative practice arise out of "Disputes: a review" this SPS will be reviewed and amended to reflect those changes.

### Background

11.  The tax dispute resolution procedures were introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the Richardson Committee in the _Report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department_ (April 1994) and were designed to reduce the number of disputes by:
    
    1.  promoting full disclosure, and
    2.  encouraging the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes, and
    3.  promoting the early identification of issues, and
    4.  improving the accuracy of decisions.
    
      
    
12.  The disputes resolution process ensures that there is full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process.  
      
    
13.  The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an "all cards on the table" approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts, and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to court.  
      
    
14.  The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps specified in the TAA. The main elements of those steps are the issue of:
    
    1.  A notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA"): this is a notice that either the Commissioner or taxpayer issues to the other advising that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer's assessment, the Commissioner's assessment or other disputable decision (the prescribed form is the _IR770 Notice of proposed adjustment_). A NOPA is the formal document which begins the disputes process.
    2.  A notice of response ("NOR"): this must be issued by the recipient of a NOPA if they disagree with it (the preferred form is the _IR771 Notice of response_).
    3.  A notice rejecting the Commissioner's NOR: this must be issued by the taxpayer if they disagree with the Commissioner's NOR (there is no prescribed form for a notice rejecting the Commissioner's NOR).
    4.  A disclosure notice and statement of position ("SOP"): the issue of a disclosure notice by the Commissioner triggers the requirement for the taxpayer to provide a SOP to continue the dispute. Each SOP must provide an outline of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the positions taken. Each party must issue a SOP (the preferred form is the _IR773 Statement of position_). The SOPs are important documents because they limit the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that either party can rely on if the case proceeds to court to what is included in the SOPs (unless a hearing authority makes an order that allows a party to raise new facts or evidence under section 138G(2)).
    
      
    
15.  There are also two administrative phases in the disputes process - the conference and adjudication phases. If the dispute has not been already resolved after the NOR phase, the Commissioner's practice will be to hold a conference. A conference can be a formal or informal discussion between the parties to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues.  
      
    
16.  If the dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase and the exchange of SOPs, the Commissioner will usually refer the dispute to adjudication, except in limited circumstances. Adjudication involves Inland Revenue independently considering a dispute and is the final phase in the disputes process before the taxpayer's assessment is amended (if it is to be amended) following the exchange of the SOPs.  
      
    
17.  Timely progression of disputes through the disputes process may require the use of the Commissioner's information gathering powers (particularly section 17) before and/or during the disputes process.  
      
    
18.  Inland Revenue has a quality assurance review process known as Core Task Assurance ("CTA") which is designed to ensure that key pieces of work (including NORs and SOPs) are subject to an independent review by Legal & Technical Services before being issued. Given the importance of the disputes process to the Commissioner and to taxpayers, Inland Revenue officers are required to get CTA approval of disputes documents prior to issue.

### Summary of key actions and indicative administrative timeframes

20.  Set out below is a summary of the key actions and administrative timeframes where a disputes process is commenced by a taxpayer.  
      
    
21.  These key actions and timeframes are intended to be administrative guide lines for Inland Revenue officers. Any failure to meet these administrative timeframes will not invalidate subsequent actions of the Commissioner or prevent the case from going through the disputes process.  
      
    
    | Paragraph in the SPS | Key actions | Indicative timeframes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |     | **The taxpayer's NOPA** |     |
    | 39, 48, 60, 71 and 77 | A taxpayer's response period for issuing a NOPA in respect of an assessment or other disputable decision | Within four months from the date that the assessment or other disputable decision is issued. |
    | 108 | The Commissioner forwards and assigns the taxpayer's NOPA to the responsible officer. | Usually within five working days after the taxpayer's NOPA is received. |
    | 110 | The Commissioner acknowledges the receipt of the taxpayer's NOPA (either by telephone or in writing). | Usually within 10 working days after the taxpayer's NOPA is received. |
    | 111 | The Commissioner advises that the taxpayer's NOPA is deficient, but the applicable response period has not expired. | Immediately after the Inland Revenue officer becomes aware of the deficiency. |
    | 129 | The Commissioner considers the application of "exceptional circumstances" under section 89K, where a taxpayer's NOPA has been issued outside the applicable response period. | Usually within 15 working days after receiving the taxpayer's application. |
    |     | **The Commissioner's NOR** |     |
    | 136 | The Commissioner advises the taxpayer (either by telephone or in writing) whether the Commissioner intends to issue a NOR. | Usually within 10 working days before the response period for the taxpayer to issue a NOPA expires. |
    | 135 | The Commissioner has issued and the taxpayer has received a NOR. | Within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer's NOPA is issued. |
    |     | **The taxpayer's written rejection of the Commissioner's NOR** |     |
    | 154 | The Commissioner confirms whether the taxpayer will reject the Commissioner's NOR. | Usually two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner's NOR expires. |
    | 155 | The taxpayer rejects the Commissioner's NOR in writing. | Within two months after the date that the Commissioner's NOR is issued. |
    | 157 | Inland Revenue forwards the taxpayer's rejection of the Commissioner's NOR to the responsible officer. | Usually within five working days after receiving the taxpayer's rejection. |
    | 157 | The Commissioner acknowledges receipt of the taxpayer's rejection of the Commissioner's NOR. | Usually within 10 working days after receiving the taxpayer's rejection. |
    | 153 | The taxpayer is deemed to accept the Commissioner's NOR, because they have failed to reject it within the applicable response period and none of the "exceptional circumstances" apply. | At the end of the two month period starting on the date of issue of the Commissioner's NOR. |
    | 158 | The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that they are deemed to accept the Commissioner's NOR. | Within two weeks after the response period for the Commissioner's NOR has ended. |
    |     | **Conference phase** |     |
    | 167 | The Commissioner will write to the taxpayer to initiate the conference phase and to offer a facilitated conference. | The Commissioner's offer of a facilitated conference will be made in writing within one month after the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's rejection of the Commissioner's NOR.  <br>The conference letter marks the start of the conference phase timeframe. |
    | 169 | The taxpayer will advise Inland Revenue whether they will attend the conference meeting, and whether they will accept the conference facilitation offer. | Usually within two weeks of receipt of the conference facilitation letter. If the taxpayer does not respond within this timeframe, the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute will contact the taxpayer about the letter. |

    |     | **Taxpayer's SOP** |     |
    | 214 | The taxpayer must issue a SOP within the response period for the disclosure notice. | Within two months after the date that the disclosure notice is issued, unless any of the "exceptional circumstances" under section 89K applies. |
    | 229 | The Commissioner confirms whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP. | Usually 10 working days before the response period for the disclosure notice expires. |
    | 229 | The Commissioner forwards the taxpayer's SOP to the responsible officer. | Usually within five working days after the taxpayer's SOP is received. |

    | 260 | The Commissioner forwards materials relevant to the dispute to the Adjudication Unit. | Usually when the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's response or within 10 working days after the date that the Commissioner's letter is issued. |
    | 249 | Adjudication of the disputes case | Usually within 3 months after the date that the Adjudication Unit receives the disputes files, depending on the number of disputes that are before the Adjudication Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. |
    | 267 | The taxpayer can file challenge proceedings | Within two months of the adjudication decision. |
    

### Standard Practice and Analysis

#### Taxpayer's assessment

22.  Section 92(1) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer who is required to furnish a return of income for a tax year must make an assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable for the tax year, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due.
    
23.  Section 92(1) applies to tax on income derived in:
    
    1.  the 2005-06 and later tax years for a taxpayer whose income year matches the tax year, and
    2.  the corresponding income year for a taxpayer whose income year is different from the 2005-06 and later tax years.
    
      
    
24.  If a taxpayer has to file an income tax return they must make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due. The definition of disputable decision in section 3(1) includes an assessment made by a taxpayer.  
      
    
25.  Similar requirements apply to a taxpayer who must file a GST return under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GST Act"). For a GST return period that begins on or after 1 April 2005, the taxpayer must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable. Section 92B(1) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer who is required under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide a GST tax return for a GST return period must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable by the taxpayer for the return period.
    
26.  Pursuant to sections 92(2) and 92B(2) the assessment date for an income tax or GST assessment made by a taxpayer is the date that Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer's tax return.  
      
    
27.  When the taxpayer's assessment is received, the Commissioner's practice is to stamp, either electronically or manually, the tax return with the date of receipt. This date is then entered into Inland Revenue's computerised database and a return acknowledgment form is sent to the taxpayer or agent. This practice ensures that the taxpayer will have a clear record of when their assessment was made.  
      
    
28.  Under section 92B(3) for a GST assessment and section 92(6) for an income tax assessment, a taxpayer cannot make an assessment of the amount of tax payable for a return period in their tax return if the Commissioner has previously made an assessment of the tax that is payable for that return period. This is commonly known as a "default assessment" and involves the Commissioner making a default determination that estimates the taxpayer's tax liability (for example, if they have missed a return filing deadline).  
      
    
29.  For further discussion regarding how a taxpayer can dispute a default assessment see paragraphs 42 to 54.

#### The Commissioner's assessment

30.  Notwithstanding section 92(1) and subject to the statutory time bar in sections 108 and 108A, the Commissioner can sometimes issue a notice of assessment to a taxpayer.  
      
    
31.  The Commissioner cannot make an assessment without first issuing a NOPA to a taxpayer, unless an exception under section 89C to the requirement for issuing a NOPA applies.  
      
    
32.  The exceptions under section 89C are explained in _SPS 10/04: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ or any replacement SPS. The Commissioner must ensure that any assessment is made in accordance with section 89C. However, if, on a rare occasion, an assessment was made in breach of section 89C, it will still be regarded as being valid under section 114(a).  
      
    
33.  If the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D(1).

#### A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner

34.  A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in the following situations:

##### Situation 1: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner's assessment

35.  Section 89D(1) reads:
    
    > If the Commissioner-  
    >      (a) Issues a notice of assessment to a taxpayer; and  
    >      (b) Has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment, whether or not in breach of section 89C,-  
    > the taxpayer may, subject to subsection (2), issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the assessment.
    
36.  When the Commissioner issues to a taxpayer a notice of assessment that does not relate to a "default assessment" (as discussed in paragraph 28) without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of the assessment. A taxpayer's response to a default assessment is discussed in Situation 2.  
      
    
37.  A taxpayer's NOPA is not an assessment. It is an initiating action that allows open and full communication between the parties. A NOPA forms a basis for ensuring that the Commissioner does not issue an assessment without some formal and structured dialogue with the taxpayer in respect of the grounds upon which the Commissioner is issuing any assessment or amended assessment (_McIlraith v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,456).  
      
    
38.  If the Commissioner has issued an assessment the taxpayer can issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) in respect of any of the considerations that were relevant to making the assessment. This could include preliminary decisions which are necessary to make the assessment, for example, a decision made by the Commissioner under section 89C (_MR Forestry (No 1) Trust Ltd v CIR_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,954).  
      
    
39.  The taxpayer must issue the NOPA within the applicable "response period" as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the assessment unless the Commissioner accepts a late NOPA under section 89K(1). However, this response period is subject to the exception discussed in Situation 6.  
      
    
40.  For example, if the Commissioner's notice of assessment is issued on 7 April 2008, under section 89D(1) the taxpayer must issue a NOPA in the prescribed form in respect of the assessment on or before 6 August 2008.  
      
    
41.  The taxpayer's right to issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) is unaffected, even if, in a very rare circumstance, the Commissioner made the assessment in breach of section 89C. The assessment will be deemed to be valid under section 114(a).

##### Situation 2: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner's default assessment

42.  If a taxpayer has not filed a tax return, the Commissioner can make a default assessment under section 106(1) without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer.  
      
    
43.  Section 89D(2) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer who has not furnished a return of income for an assessment period may dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner only by furnishing a return of income for the assessment period.
    
44.  A taxpayer that intends to dispute a default assessment through the disputes process must:
    
    1.  pursuant to section 89D(2) provide a tax return for the period to which the default assessment relates notwithstanding that the tax return cannot include the taxpayer's assessment (section 89D(2A)), and
    2.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the default assessment.
    
      
    
45.  Similar rules apply to a NOPA that a taxpayer issues in respect of a GST default assessment.  
      
    
46.  Section 89D(2C) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer who has not provided a GST tax return for a GST return period may not dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner other than by providing a GST return for the GST return period.
    
47.  Where a taxpayer has not filed a GST return, the Commissioner can make a GST default assessment without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer.  
      
    
48.  If a taxpayer wants to dispute a GST default assessment through the disputes process, they must:
    
    1.  provide a GST return for the periods to which the GST default assessment relates pursuant to section 89D(2C), notwithstanding that the tax return cannot include the taxpayer's assessment (section 89D(2D)), and
    2.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the GST default assessment,
    
    within the applicable response period. That is, within four months from the date that the default assessment is issued.  
      
    
49.  The legislative requirement to provide a tax return in respect of a default assessment made by the Commissioner when issuing a NOPA is an additional requirement of the disputes process. This ensures that the taxpayer has provided the requisite statutory information before they dispute the assessment.  
      
    
50.  If the Commissioner agrees with taxpayer's tax return and NOPA, the Commissioner will amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 or 108A and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion.  
      
    
51.  However, if the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer's tax return and NOPA the Commissioner cannot amend the default assessment. Instead, the Commissioner must issue a NOR to the taxpayer within the relevant response period to continue the disputes process.  
      
    
52.  The taxpayer cannot commence a dispute or challenge proceedings in a hearing authority by simply filing the tax return to which the default assessment relates. The taxpayer must issue a NOPA with their tax return.  
      
    
53.  If a NOPA is not issued, the Commissioner cannot be compelled to amend the default assessment on receipt of the taxpayer's tax return. However, the Commissioner will amend the assessment under section 113 on the basis of the information provided in the tax return subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion if this would ensure that the assessment was correct. (See _SPS 07/03: Requests to amend assessments_ for further details.) Any amended assessment will be the Commissioner's assessment in this circumstance.  
      
    
54.  The Commissioner can decide not to amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 on the basis of the tax return provided.

##### Situation 3: NOPA in respect of a deemed assessment made under section 80H

55.  Section 89D(2B) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer to whom section 80F applies who has not furnished an amended income statement for an assessment period may dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H only by furnishing an amended income statement for the assessment period.
    
56.  Section 89D(2B) applies to a taxpayer who derives income solely from salary, wages, interest and dividends and who will receive an income statement from the Commissioner under section 80D(1).  
      
    
57.  Generally, where the taxpayer considers that the income statement is incorrect, they must advise the Commissioner of the reasons and provide the relevant information to correct the income statement under section 80F(1). This must be done within the statutory time limit. That is, the later of:
    
    1.  the taxpayer's terminal tax date for the tax year to which the income statement relates, and
    2.  two months after the date that the income statement is issued.
    
      
    
58.  If the taxpayer does not provide the relevant information within the statutory time limit, they will be treated as having filed a tax return under section 80G(2) and made an assessment under section 80H in respect of that income statement. In this case, the date of the deemed assessment under section 80H will be the date that the statutory time limit under section 80F expires.  
      
    
59.  Pursuant to section 89D(2B), the taxpayer cannot issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of the deemed assessment made under section 80H without first satisfying their statutory obligation to file an amended income statement for the assessment period.  
      
    
60.  If a taxpayer wants to dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H, they must:
    1.  provide an amended income statement for the assessment period, and
    2.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the assessment within the applicable response period (that is, four months after the date that the deemed assessment is issued.)

##### Situation 4: NOPA in respect of a disputable decision that is not an assessment

61.  Under section 89D(3) a taxpayer can issue a NOPA in respect of a disputable decision that is not an assessment. Section 89D(3) reads:
    
    > If the Commissioner-
    > 
    > (a) Issues a notice of disputable decision that is not a notice of assessment; and  
    > (b) The notice of disputable decision affects the taxpayer, -
    > 
    > the taxpayer, or any other person who has the standing under a tax law to do so on behalf of the taxpayer, may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the disputable decision.
    
62.  For the purpose of section 89D(3) a person with standing under a tax law to issue a NOPA on behalf of the taxpayer includes a tax advisor and an approved advisor group.  
      
    
63.  Section 3(1) defines a "disputable decision" to include:
    
    > (b) A decision of the Commissioner under a tax law, except for a decision -  
    > 
    > (i) To decline to issue a binding ruling under Part VA; or  
    > (ii) That cannot be the subject of an objection under Part VIII; or  
    > (iii) That cannot be challenged under Part VIIIA; or  
    > (iv) That is left to the Commissioner's discretion under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8) and (10) and 89N(3):
    
64.  A "decision of the Commissioner under a tax law" generally refers to a tax law that specifically confers a discretion or power on the Commissioner. Paragraph (b)(iii) excludes from the definition of "disputable decision" any decision that cannot be challenged under Part VIIIA.  
      
    
65.  For example, if the Commissioner:
    
    1.  decides not exercise the discretion under section 113 to amend a taxpayer's income tax assessment, or
    2.  makes a decision under section 108A(3) regarding the application of the time bar, or
    3.  does not agree to a time bar waiver under section 108B,
    
    section 138E(1)(e)(iv) (within Part VIIIA) provides that these decisions cannot be challenged. Therefore, these decisions are not disputable decisions for the purposes of section 89D(3). However, under section 89D(1), the taxpayer can issue a NOPA in respect of the initial assessment if the Commissioner has not previously issued a NOPA in respect of that assessment.  
      
    
66.  A decision made by the Commissioner under section 108(2) (to increase an assessment) is not of itself, and in the absence of an assessment, a disputable decision. Any challenge to the correctness of the decision must be brought in the context of a challenge to the assessment itself (_Vinelight Nominees Ltd & Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2)_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,519).  
      
    
67.  Paragraph (b)(iv) of the definition of "disputable decision" in section 3(1) also excludes any decision that is left to the Commissioner's discretion arising under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8) and(10), and 89N(3).  
      
    
68.  For example, the Commissioner does not exercise the discretion under section 89K(1) to accept a late NOPA that a taxpayer has issued outside the applicable response period. This decision not to exercise the discretion in the taxpayer's favour is not a disputable decision.  
      
    
69.  The exceptions specified in paragraph (b) of the definition of "disputable decision" ensure that only substantive issues are disputed as disputable decisions and the procedural components of the disputes process do not, in themselves, give rise to disputes although they may be amenable to judicial review.  
      
    
70.  The following examples illustrate what is a disputable decision:
    
    1.  A taxpayer who is a natural person can dispute the Commissioner's decision made under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA 2007") that they are a New Zealand resident for taxation purposes.
    2.  Under section RD 3(5) of the ITA 2007, the Commissioner can determine whether, and to what extent, a payment is subject to PAYE. This determination cannot be challenged by the taxpayer and, therefore, is excluded from the definition of "disputable decision" under section 3(1)(b)(iii). However, an employer or employee can dispute an assessment of tax deductions on the basis that a section RD 3(5) determination on which it is founded is wrong in fact or law.
    
      
    
71.  The taxpayer must issue the NOPA to the Commissioner within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the notice of disputable decision or notice revoking or varying a disputable decision that is not an assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1).

##### Situation 5: NOPA in respect of a taxpayer's assessment

72.  Section 89DA(1) reads:
    
    > A taxpayer may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of an assessment made by the taxpayer for a tax year or a GST return period if the Commissioner has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment.
    
73.  If a taxpayer needs to file an income tax return they must also make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability under section 92(1) unless the Commissioner has previously made an assessment for that tax year (section 92(6)).  
      
    
74.  Section 89DA(1) also applies to a taxpayer's GST assessment for a return period. A taxpayer who has to file a GST return must also make an assessment of the amount of GST payable for the return period under section 92B(1).  
      
    
75.  The date on which a taxpayer's assessment of income tax is made is the date on which the taxpayer's return of income is received at an office of the Department (section 92(2)). A taxpayer's assessment of the amount of GST payable is made on the date on which the taxpayers of GST tax return is received at an office of the Department (section 92B(2)).  
      
    
76.  Pursuant to section 89DA(1), a taxpayer can issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of their own tax assessment.  
      
    
77.  The taxpayer's NOPA must be issued within the applicable response period as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1).  
      
    
78.  The date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment will be determined under section 14B. For example, under section 14B(8), the Commissioner will receive a NOPA that the taxpayer sends by post on the date that it would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.

##### Situation 6: NOPA that relates solely to a research and development tax credit

79.  Under section 89DA(3), a taxpayer can also issue a NOPA that relates solely to a research and development expenditure tax credit arising from a notice of assessment that they have previously issued for the 2008-09 tax year.  
      
    
80.  The NOPA must be issued within the period that starts on the date on which the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment and ends two years after the latest date on which a taxpayer can provide a return of income for the 2008-09 tax year. This response period is an exception to the general response period that applies for disputing taxpayer assessments.  
      
    
81.  As the research and development expenditure tax credit has been repealed from the 2009-10 tax year onwards this response period has limited application it is not intended to discuss it further in this SPS.

#### Contents of a taxpayer's NOPA

82.  A NOPA is the document that commences the disputes process. It is intended to identify the true points of contention and explain the legal or technical aspects of the issuer's position in relation to the proposed adjustment in a formal and understandable manner. This will ensure that information relevant to the dispute is quickly made available to the parties. Section 89F(1) and (3) specifies the content requirements for any NOPA that a taxpayer may issue.  
      
    
83.  Section 89F reads:
    
    > (1) A notice of proposed adjustment must -
    > 
    > (a) contain sufficient detail of the matters described in subsections (2) and (3) to identify the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant; and  
    > (b) be in the prescribed form.
    > 
    > ...  
    > (3) A notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant must -
    > 
    > (a) Identify the adjustment or adjustments proposed to be made to the assessment; and  
    > (b) Provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the disputant's proposed adjustment or adjustments; and  
    > (c) State how the law applies to the facts; and  
    > (d) Include copies of the documents of which the disputant is aware at the time that the notice is issued that are significantly relevant to the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant.
    
84.  The prescribed form for a NOPA as required under section 89F(1)(b) is the _IR770 Notice of proposed adjustment_ form that can be found on Inland Revenue's website: www.ird.govt.nz. A handwritten NOPA in this form is acceptable. Additional information can also be attached to the prescribed form.  
      
    
85.  If the Commissioner receives a NOPA that is not in the prescribed form or has insufficient detail under section 89F(1)(a) the Commissioner's practice will be to advise the taxpayer that the NOPA must be in the prescribed form or include sufficient information. If this occurs on the last day of the response period the Commissioner will consider any resubmitted NOPA under section 89K(1)(a)(iii) provided that the lateness is minimal (see paragraph 124).  
      
    
86.  If the taxpayer's NOPA does not satisfy the content requirements under section 89F(1)(a) and (3) the Commissioner can reject the NOPA and not issue a NOR (see paragraphs 111 to 118).  
      
    
87.  When issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer must state the facts and law in sufficient detail, state how the law applies to the facts, and include copies of the documents that are significantly relevant to the dispute and known to the taxpayer when they issue the NOPA.  
      
    
88.  The Commissioner cannot treat a tax return provided by the taxpayer as a NOPA because it will not satisfy the requirements in section 89F(1) and (3).  
      
    
89.  Section 89F(3)(b) requires that the taxpayer's NOPA states the key facts and law concisely and in sufficient detail. The term "sufficient detail" means that the document must contain adequate analysis of the law and facts that are relevant to the dispute. This means sufficient discussion of the law to enable the Commissioner to clearly understand the proposed adjustment.  
      
    
90.  The Commissioner considers that it is necessary that the taxpayer provides "a statement of the facts and law in sufficient detail" to ensure that they have fully considered issues before they raise them in their NOPA and to reduce further administrative and compliance costs.

##### _Identify the proposed adjustment - section 89F(3)(a)_

91.  The taxpayer must identify the proposed adjustment in their NOPA. This includes for each proposed adjustment:
    
    1.  the amount or impact of the adjustment, and
    2.  the tax year or period to which the proposed adjustment relates.
    
      
    
92.  The proposed adjustment should be set out as specifically as possible. For example:
    *   "increase the 2007 repairs and maintenance expenditure by $3,000";
    *   "increase the GST input tax deduction by $4,000 in the August 2007 return period".

##### _Provide a statement of the facts and law in sufficient detail - section 89F(3)(b)_

**Facts**

93.  To provide a brief and accurate statement of facts, the taxpayer must focus on the material factual matters relevant to the legal issues. The taxpayer must include the facts necessary for proving all the arguments raised in support of each adjustment, including any facts that are inconsistent with any argument that the Commissioner has previously raised.  
      
    
94.  The taxpayer should endeavour to disclose all the relevant material facts clearly and with adequate amounts of detail relative to the complexity of the issues. The taxpayer is best suited to do this because they are usually very familiar with the background and facts that relate to the dispute. Disclosing the background and facts at the NOPA phase helps to resolve the dispute at an earlier stage. However, the taxpayer should not overstate the facts with irrelevant detail or repetition.  
      
    
95.  In complex cases, the Commissioner expects the taxpayer to explain the relevant facts clearly and methodically. The taxpayer should also assist the Commissioner to understand the background and facts of the dispute, so as to facilitate a speedy resolution of the case. The taxpayer should explain the facts and law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the adjustment. It is unhelpful and can cause delays if the Commissioner has to second guess the factual bases of the taxpayer's case.  
      
    
96.  For example, in a dispute that involves a complex financial arrangement, the taxpayer should explain each element of it. This includes explaining the background to the financial arrangement, identifying the parties involved, highlighting the relevant clauses in an agreement, etc.

**Law**

97.  Each proposed adjustment should stipulate the relevant section or sections that the taxpayer relies on and including, if a section has multiple independent parts, the applicable subsection(s).  
      
    
98.  It is important that the taxpayer includes an adequate amount of analysis of the applicable legal principles or tests in their NOPA. If possible these should be supported by case authorities with full citations. For example, in a dispute that involves the tax treatment of a trade-tie payment, the taxpayer must apply the legal principles from a leading case such as _Birkdale Service Station v CIR_ (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. However, it is not necessary to laboriously describe large numbers of precedent cases on the same issue or include extracts from each.

##### _How the law applies to the facts - section 89F(3)(c)_

99.  The taxpayer must apply the legal arguments to the facts. This ensures that the proposed adjustment is not a statement that appears out of context in relation to the rest of the document. The Commissioner considers that the application of the law to the facts should logically support the proposed adjustment and be stated clearly and in detail.  
      
    
100.  The taxpayer should present the materials and arguments on which they intend to rely or on which reliance will be placed. That is, if more than one argument supports the same or a similar outcome, all arguments should be made and supported by evidence. For each proposition of law, it is recommended that the NOPA makes a clear link to an outline of supporting facts.

##### _Include copies of the relevant documents that support the adjustment - section 89F(3)(d)_

101.  The taxpayer must provide full copies of the documents that they know are significantly relevant to the dispute and in existence when they issue the NOPA. This ensures that the Commissioner has all the relevant information necessary to respond to the NOPA.  
      
    
102.  For example:
    
    1.  A taxpayer proposes an adjustment to GST input tax credits in their NOPA. The taxpayer must provide copies of the relevant tax invoices as documentary evidence in their NOPA.
    2.  A taxpayer's dispute involves a sale of land transaction. The taxpayer must provide a copy of the sale and purchase agreement and other relevant correspondence between the vendor and the purchaser as documentary evidence in their NOPA.
    
      
    
103.  In some cases, new documentary evidence can emerge, as the dispute progresses. For example, the documentation is quite old and may have been misplaced. The taxpayer may be unaware of these documents when the NOPA was issued. The parties should then exchange this new evidence when it becomes known or available.  
      
    
104.  Where a taxpayer is aware of a particular document that is significantly relevant to their dispute, but cannot obtain a copy of it, the taxpayer should include the following matters in their NOPA:
    
    1.  the nature of the document and its relevance to the dispute, and
    2.  the reasonable steps that the taxpayer has taken to obtain a copy of the document, and
    3.  the expected date that the document will be made available to the Commissioner.
    
      
    
105.  However, this practice should not be treated as dispensing with the requirements under section 89F(3)(d). The Commissioner still expects the taxpayer will send copies of the relevant documents mentioned in their NOPA as soon as they become available.

#### Election of the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority

106.  Under section 89E(1), a taxpayer issues can elect in their NOPA that the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction hears any unresolved dispute that arises from the NOPA, if the following requirements are met:
    
    1.  the taxpayer's NOPA is issued under section 89D or 89DA (see discussion at paragraphs 34 to 81), and
    2.  the amount in dispute is $30,000 or less.
    
      
    
107.  A taxpayer's election under section 89E(1), is irrevocable and is binding on them. In this circumstance, the full disputes process does not have to be followed.

#### Receipt of a taxpayer's NOPA

108.  Inland Revenue will usually assign a taxpayer's NOPA to the responsible officer within five working days after it is received.  
      
    
109.  After receiving the NOPA, the responsible officer will determine and record the following:
    
    1.  the date on which the NOPA was issued, whether the NOPA has been issued within the applicable response period and the date by which the Commissioner's response must be issued, and
    2.  the NOPA's salient features including any deficiencies in its content.
    
      
    
110.  Where practicable, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent that it has received the NOPA by telephone or in writing within 10 working days.

##### Deficiencies in the contents of a NOPA

111.  Where Inland Revenue has received a NOPA that it considers deficient (that is, the requirements under section 89F(1)(a) and (3) may not be met), the responsible Inland Revenue officer will take reasonable steps to have the taxpayer correct the information in the NOPA before the response period expires.  
      
    
112.  The taxpayer will be advised as soon as practicable that the Commissioner considers that the NOPA may not meet the requirements of section 89F(1)(a) and (3) and why. They will also be advised that any additional or corrected information should be provided within the response period.  
      
    
113.  Taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOPA immediately after they have completed it because they could have insufficient time to rectify any deficiencies if the response period is due to expire.  
      
    
114.  Generally where the deficiencies are not able to be remedied but the NOPA advances sufficient argument to allow the dispute to progress, then the Commissioner will continue with the dispute. The argument that the NOPA is deficient will be incorporated into the Commissioner's SOP and the Commissioner will also fully argue the substantive issue.  
      
    
115.  However, if the NOPA received is highly unsatisfactory the Commissioner is unlikely to continue with the dispute. This will be on the grounds that the NOPA does not satisfy the requirements set out in section 89F(1)(a) and (3).  
      
    
116.  A NOPA is likely to be considered highly unsatisfactory only where the taxpayer's position is materially inconsistent and not capable of coherent explanation, or there is no observable explanation at all of the taxpayer's grounds for dispute. In these situations the dispute will be treated as if it has never commenced (unless the taxpayer resubmits a late NOPA and the Commissioner accepts it under one of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K).  
      
    
117.  In considering the adequacy of the taxpayer's NOPA, the Commissioner's view will not be based on the strength or weakness of the taxpayer's argument. The Commissioner will only be concerned with whether the NOPA meets its statutory requirements.  
      
    
118.  The approach outlined above is consistent with that taken by the Court of Appeal in _CIR v Alam and Begum_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,564.

#### NOPA that a taxpayer has issued outside the applicable response period

119.  Unless an "exceptional circumstance" arises under any of the circumstances specified in section 89K(1), the Commissioner cannot accept a NOPA that a taxpayer issues under section 89D or 89DA outside the applicable response period.

_Exceptional circumstances under section 89K_

120.  The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. The cases on "exceptional circumstances," such as _Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752, _Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005, _Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR_ (2001) 17,470 (CA), _Hollis v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,570, and _Balich v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,230 are also relevant. The case law confirms that the Commissioner should apply the definition of "exceptional circumstances" in sections 89K(3) and 138D consistently.  
      
    
121.  The following guidelines have emerged from the case law:
    
    1.  a taxpayer's misunderstanding or erroneous calculation of the applicable response period will usually not be regarded as an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control under section 89K(3)(a);
    2.  an agent's failure to advise their client that they have received a notice of assessment or other relevant documents that causes the taxpayer to respond outside the applicable response period will not generally be considered to be an exceptional circumstance under section 89K(3)(b) (_Hollis v CIR_); and
    3.  an exceptional circumstance can arise if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information that the Commissioner has given them that causes them to respond outside the applicable response period (_Hollis v CIR_).
    
      
    
122.  The Commissioner will only accept a late NOPA on rare occasions. See _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996) for some examples of situations that can be considered "exceptional circumstances" beyond a taxpayer's control.  
      
    
123.  Section 89K(3) reads:
    
    > For the purpose of subsection (1),-
    > 
    > (a) An **exceptional circumstance** arises if-
    > 
    > (i) An event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not rejecting a proposed adjustment, or for not issuing a notice of proposed adjustment or statement of position, within the response period for the notice:  
    > (ii) A disputant is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period:
    > 
    > (b) An act or omission of an agent of a disputant is not an exceptional circumstance unless-
    > 
    > (i) It was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that could not have been anticipated, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or  
    > (ii) The agent is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period.
    
124.  The statutory holiday exception is self-explanatory. The Commissioner can also accept a late NOPA where the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, that is, the document was only one to two days late.  
      
    
125.  For example, the response period ends on a Saturday and the taxpayer provides a NOPA on the following Tuesday. The Commissioner treats the response period as ending on Monday on the basis of section 35(6) of the Interpretation Act 1999 and accepts that the lateness of the NOPA was minimal. That is, the Commissioner received the NOPA within one to two days of Monday, the last day of the response period. If the response period ended on Friday and the taxpayer provided the NOR on the following Monday, the Commissioner would also accept that the lateness is minimal.  
      
    
126.  Besides the degree of lateness, the Commissioner will consider the following factors when exercising the discretion under section 89K(1):
    
    1.  the date on which the NOPA was issued, and
    2.  the response period within which the NOPA should be issued, and
    3.  the real event, circumstance or reason why the taxpayer did not issue the NOPA within the applicable response period, and
    4.  the taxpayer's compliance history in relation to the tax types under consideration (for example, the taxpayer may have a history of paying tax late or filing late tax returns or NOPAs in the past).
    
      
    
127.  For example, a taxpayer issues a NOPA to the Commissioner two days after the applicable response period has expired. The taxpayer does not provide a legitimate reason for the lateness. The taxpayer also has a history of filing late NOPAs within the minimal allowable lateness period (that is, up to two days outside the applicable response period) and has been advised on the calculation of the response period each time.  
      
    
128.  Although the degree of lateness was minimal each time, the Commissioner would not accept the taxpayer's NOPA in this circumstance. This ensures that the section 89K(3)(b)(ii) exception is not treated as an extension of the response period in all circumstances.  
      
    
129.  The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer's application made under section 89K(1) after receiving the relevant NOPA. The responsible officer will document the reasons for accepting or rejecting the taxpayer's application and advise them of their decision in writing within 15 working days after Inland Revenue receives their application.  
      
    
130.  If the Commissioner rejects a taxpayer's application made under section 89K(1), the Commissioner can still consider the validity of the taxpayer's tax position in terms of the practice for applying the discretion under section 113. See _SPS 07/03: Requests to amend assessments_ for details of this practice. However, the Commissioner's decision to reject an application made under section 89K(1) is not a disputable decision for the purposes of section 89D(3).

#### Timeframes to complete the disputes resolution process

131.  If a taxpayer has issued a NOPA to the Commissioner and the dispute remains unresolved, when practicable, the parties should negotiate a timeframe to ensure that the dispute is progressed in a timely and efficient way.  
      
    
132.  Agreeing to a timeframe is not statutorily required but, rather, is a critical administrative requirement that requires both parties to be ready to progress matters. The parties should endeavour to meet the agreed timeframe. If there are delays in the progress of the dispute the responsible officer must manage the delay including any relationship with internal advisers and liaise with the taxpayer.  
      
    
133.  If the negotiated timeframe cannot be achieved, the Commissioner must enter into continuing discussions with the taxpayer, either to arrange a new timeframe, or otherwise keep them advised of when the disclosure notice will be issued. Therefore, the failure to negotiate or adhere to an agreed timeframe will not prevent the case from progressing through the disputes process in a timely manner.  
      
    
134.  In addition to the above administrative practice, the Commissioner is bound by section 89N. Under section 89N(2), if the parties cannot agree on the proposed adjustment, the Commissioner cannot amend the assessment without completing the disputes process (that is, consider the taxpayer's SOP), unless any of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c) apply. These exceptions are explained in _SPS 10/04: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ or any replacement SPS.

#### The Commissioner's response to a taxpayer's NOPA: notice of response

135.  If the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer's proposed adjustment, then, under section 89G(1) the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer that any or all of their proposed adjustments are rejected by issuing a NOR within the applicable response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer's NOPA is issued. The Commissioner interprets this to mean that the taxpayer must receive the NOR within this period. For example, if a taxpayer issues a NOPA on 9 April 2010, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of its rejection by issuing to them a NOR and they must receive that NOR on or before 8 June 2010.  
      
    
136.  Where practicable, the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent within 10 working days before the response period expires to advise whether the Commissioner intends to issue a NOR to them in response to their NOPA. Such contact may be made by telephone or letter  
      
    
137.  The Commissioner must issue the NOR to the taxpayer (section 14(3)(a)) or a representative authorised to act on their behalf (section 14(3)(b)). In respect of the latter, it is a question of fact whether the recipient is authorised to receive the NOR on the taxpayer's behalf. The taxpayer must ensure that their NOPA stipulates the name of the person or agent that they have nominated to receive any NOR issued by the Commissioner (_CIR v Thompson_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,375).  
      
    
138.  If a tax agent sends a NOPA to the Commissioner although the tax agent would appear to have authority to receive the Commissioner's NOR, the Commissioner's practice will be to contact the tax agent to confirm whether the agent can accept service of the NOR.  
      
    
139.  Section 89G(2) specifies the content requirements for a NOR. The Commissioner must state concisely in the NOR:
    
    1.  the facts or legal arguments in the taxpayer's NOPA that the Commissioner considers are wrong, and
    2.  why the Commissioner considers that those facts and arguments are wrong, and
    3.  any facts and legal arguments that the Commissioner relies upon, and
    4.  how the legal arguments apply to the facts, and
    5.  the quantitative adjustment to any figures proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments that the Commissioner relies upon.
    
      
    
140.  Under section 89G(2)(e), the requirement for a quantitative adjustment establishes the extent to which the Commissioner considers that the adjustment in the taxpayer's NOPA is incorrect. This amount need not be exact, although, every attempt should be made to ensure that it is as accurate as possible. The amount in dispute can be varied, as the dispute progresses. For example, if the parties agree on new figures at the conference phase.  
      
    
141.  The Commissioner considers that Inland Revenue has a statutory obligation to inform the taxpayer adequately. Therefore, any NOR that the Commissioner issues to reject the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA must be relatively brief but sufficiently detailed to explain all the relevant facts, quantitative adjustments, issues and law.

#### Deemed acceptance

142.  Section 89H(2) reads:
    
    > If the Commissioner does not, within the response period for a notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant, reject an adjustment contained in the notice, the Commissioner is deemed to accept the proposed adjustment and section 89J applies.
    
143.  If the Commissioner issues a NOR outside the two-month response period, the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA under section 89H(2). This will finish the dispute and the Commissioner must issue an assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer pursuant to section 89J(1) (see the discussion in paragraphs 148 to 152).  
      
    
144.  However, the Commissioner is not precluded from later exercising the discretion under section 113 and issuing to the taxpayer an amended assessment that reflects another adjustment for a different issue to that previously accepted under section 89H(2) for the same tax period.

##### Exception to deemed acceptance

145.  Notwithstanding section 89H(2), the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for an order that a NOR can be issued outside the two-month response period under section 89L(1). Section 89L only applies if an exceptional circumstance has occurred or prevented the Commissioner from issuing a NOR to the taxpayer within the response period. The Commissioner will endeavour to apply the requirement for exceptional circumstances in section 89L(1)(a) consistently with the similar requirement in section 89K(1)(a) (see discussion in paragraphs 120 to 130).  
      
    
146.  Under section 89L(3), an "exceptional circumstance":
    
    > (a) Is an event or circumstance beyond the control of the Commissioner or an officer of the Department that provides the Commissioner with a reasonable justification for not rejecting an adjustment proposed by a disputant within the response period; and  
    > (b) Without limiting paragraph (a), includes a change to a tax law, or a new tax law, or a decision of a court in respect of a tax law, that is enacted or made within the response period.
    
147.  For example:
    1.  A flood damaged an Inland Revenue office during the applicable response period for a taxpayer's NOPA. The taxpayer's NOPA was lost in the flood. The Inland Revenue officer could not obtain another copy of the NOPA within the applicable response period. The absence of information has prevented the Commissioner from forming a view on the subject matter in dispute. The Commissioner can apply for a High Court order under section 89L for further time to issue a NOR.
    2.  A taxpayer issues to the Commissioner a NOPA that claims additional tax depreciation on computer software. During the two-month response period, a High Court decision was made in respect of another taxpayer. The High Court held that a depreciation claim amounted to tax avoidance and should be disallowed. The Commissioner can apply to the High Court for further time to issue a NOR to the taxpayer, so as to consider the full effect of the High Court decision.
    3.  The Inland Revenue officer to whom a taxpayer's NOPA was assigned is absent on annual leave for the remainder of the response period. The Inland Revenue officer does not arrange for another officer to prepare and issue a NOR to the taxpayer within the response period. The Commissioner is deemed to accept the NOPA under section 89H(2). In this circumstance, the Commissioner does not consider that an exceptional circumstance prevented the Inland Revenue officer from rejecting the adjustment within the response period for the purpose of section 89L(1)(a).

##### Implication of section 89J

148.  Under section 89J(1), if the Commissioner accepts or is deemed to accept any adjustment that is proposed in a taxpayer's NOPA, the Commissioner must include or take account of the adjustment in:
    
    1.  a notice of assessment, and
    2.  any further notice of assessment or amended assessment,
    
    that is issued to the taxpayer unless the Commissioner has applied to the High Court for an order that a notice can be issued rejecting the proposed adjustment under section 89L(1).  
      
    
149.  In this circumstance, the Commissioner's practice will be not to later issue a NOPA that purports to reverse any proposed adjustment previously accepted under section 89H(2) because section 89J(1) prevents the Commissioner from issuing to the taxpayer a further amended assessment that does not include or take into account the previously accepted adjustment.  
      
    
150.  However, pursuant to section 89J(2) the Commissioner can issue a notice of assessment or amended assessment that does not include or take into account an adjustment that the Commissioner has, or is deemed to have accepted, if the Commissioner considers that, in relation to the adjustment, the taxpayer:
    
    1.  was fraudulent, or
    2.  wilfully misled the Commissioner.
    
      
    
151.  If the Commissioner considers that section 89J(2) applies following deemed acceptance under section 89H(2) the Commissioner cannot resume the earlier disputes process but can later issue a NOPA in respect of any of the adjustments proposed in the earlier disputes process.  
      
    
152.  Any opinion that the Commissioner forms under section 89J(2) must be honestly held, based on a correct understanding of the relevant grounds and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the facts and law available. An opinion formed by the Commissioner under section 89J(2) is a disputable decision for the purposes of section 89D(3).

### Rejection of the Commissioner's notice of response

153.  If the Commissioner has issued a NOR under section 89G(1) that rejects the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA, the taxpayer must reject the Commissioner's NOR within the applicable response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner issues the NOR. Otherwise, the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner's NOR under section 89H(3) and the dispute will finish.  
      
    
154.  The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner's NOR expires to determine whether the taxpayer will reject the Commissioner's NOR in writing. Such contact can be made by telephone or in writing.  
      
    
155.  The taxpayer must reject the Commissioner's NOR in writing. The written rejection must be issued within the response period and can be in any form. The taxpayer does not have to expressly reject each of the rejections of proposed adjustments that are included in the Commissioner's NOR. The taxpayer's written rejection must simply make it clear that the taxpayer rejects the Commissioner's NOR.  
      
    
156.  For example, in certain circumstances, the Commissioner can treat a notice of proceedings and statement of claim that the taxpayer serves on the Commissioner within the response period to commence challenge proceedings as a valid rejection in writing of the Commissioner's NOR.  
      
    
157.  Where practicable, the taxpayer's written rejection will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue has received it and acknowledged as received within 10 working days.  
      
    
158.  If deemed acceptance occurs (that is, the taxpayer has not rejected the Commissioner's NOR in writing), the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer of this within two weeks after the response period to the Commissioner's NOR has expired.  
      
    
159.  Under section 138B(3) a taxpayer can file challenge proceedings upon receipt of the Commissioner's NOR. This does not automatically end the disputes process. However, the Commissioner's practice is to treat a notice of proceedings and statement of claim that the taxpayer serves on the Commissioner within the response period commencing challenge proceedings as also being a request for the Commissioner's agreement to opt out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii). The Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer opting out in these circumstances as it is considered that once a challenge is filed the dispute will be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority.

### Conference phase

##### What is the conference phase of the disputes process?

160.  The conference phase of the disputes process allows the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute to exchange material information relating to the dispute (if this has not already been done prior to the conference phase). More importantly it is an opportunity for the parties to the dispute to try to resolve the differences in their understanding of facts, laws and legal arguments.  
      
    
161.  The word "resolve" in this context is not limited to final resolution of the dispute. Settlement is a possibility but this is not the only objective of the conference phase. The parties may "resolve" part of the dispute by agreeing on some of the facts and clarifying some of the legal arguments, while agreeing to disagree on other matters, which will become the focus in the later phases of the disputes process.  
      
    
162.  Generally, if a dispute remains unresolved after the NOR phase, the conference phase will follow.  
      
    
163.  The conference phase is an administrative process that aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the dispute. However, the conference phase should not be used by either party for the purpose of delaying the completion of the disputes process. The conference phase can involve more than one meeting between the parties and it is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting.

##### Legal and other advisers attending a conference

164.  If a dispute is not settled earlier, the parties can obtain expert legal or other advice during the conference phase in addition to advice previously obtained. These advisers can attend any meetings in relation to the dispute.

##### Conference facilitation

165.  Conference facilitation is a new feature in the conference phase. A facilitated conference will involve an independent internal facilitator who will promote and encourage structured discussion between Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer on an informed basis and with the _bona fide_ intention of resolving the dispute. The conference facilitator will be a senior Inland Revenue officer who will not have been involved in the dispute or given advice on the dispute prior to the conference phase. The facilitator will have sufficient technical knowledge to understand and lead the conference meeting.  
      
    
166.  The conference facilitator will not be responsible for making any decision in relation to the dispute, except for determining when the conference phase has come to an end. In particular, it is not the role of the facilitator to undertake settlement of the dispute. If this possibility arises it is the responsibility of the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute.  
      
    
167.  Having a conference facilitated is optional and a conference can be held without a facilitator but, conference facilitation will be offered to all taxpayers as part of the disputes process. The Commissioner's offer of a facilitated conference will be made in writing ("the conference facilitation letter") within one month from the date of issue of the taxpayer's rejection of the Commissioner's NOR. The conference facilitation letter marks the commencement of the conference phase.  
      
    
168.  The format of the conference meeting need not be limited to a face-to-face meeting. The parties to the dispute may agree to hold a telephone or video conference. (For reasons of simplicity, the SPS refers to "meetings" to include these different conference formats.)  
      
    
169.  The taxpayer is expected to respond within two weeks from the date of the conference facilitation letter. The taxpayer should indicate whether they will attend the conference meeting, whether they will accept the conference facilitation offer, whether there are any special needs or requirements at the meeting and who else will be attending the meeting. If the taxpayer does not respond within this timeframe, the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute will contact the taxpayer about the conference facilitation letter.

##### Preparation for the conference meeting

170.  When a taxpayer agrees to attend a conference meeting, Inland Revenue will contact the taxpayer within two weeks from the taxpayer's agreement to establish a timeframe and agree on how the meeting will be conducted.  
      
    
171.  Prior to the conference meeting, the taxpayer should inform Inland Revenue whether their advisors will attend the conference meeting.  
      
    
172.  The parties to the dispute may agree to exchange information relevant to the dispute before the conference meeting. A copy of that information will be provided to the facilitator. The Inland Revenue officers will provide the taxpayer a list of information that has been given to the facilitator. The taxpayer may request a copy of any information on that list if it is not already in their possession. It is also crucial for the parties to exchange the information prior to the meeting if the agreed format of the conference is a telephone or video conference.  
      
    
173.  Inland Revenue may decide to concede the dispute after considering the taxpayer's information. The whole disputes process (including the conference phase) would come to an end in these cases.  
      
    
174.  The conference phase will generally be expected to be completed within three months, but this may vary depending on the facts and complexities of the specific case. A longer conference phase may be justified in some disputes if the parties are engaged in meaningful discussions.  
      
    
175.  An agenda will be useful for both parties at the conference meeting. An agreed agenda should divide the conference meeting into two parts. The first part of the meeting should involve an exchange of material information and discussion of contentious facts and issues relating to the dispute. Any procedural matters such as the timeframe for completing the disputes process, the adjudication process, time bar waivers and the possibility of opting out of the disputes process will also be discussed. The second part of the meeting, if applicable, would involve negotiation of possible areas of resolution of the dispute. Any communication made and any materials prepared for the purpose of negotiating a settlement or resolution during this part of the meeting will be treated as being on a "without prejudice" basis.  
      
    
176.  Where there is no agenda the conference facilitator will guide the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to discuss the contentious facts and issues at the conference meeting.  
      
    
177.  Where the option of conference facilitation has been declined, the parties to the dispute should work out the appropriate structure at the conference meeting, bearing in mind that one of the aims of any conference is to reach agreement on some or all the facts and issues and thus, resolve the dispute.

##### At the conference meeting

_Facilitated conference_

178.  The facilitator will:
    1.  Explain the objectives of the conference phase on the basis of the agreed agenda.
    2.  Remind the parties of any rules relating to the conference (these will generally have been set out in the conference facilitation letter).
    3.  Clarify who the parties are at the conference meeting and the capacities they hold (e.g. whether they are the authorised tax advisors; whether they have authority to settle the dispute at the meeting, etc.)
    4.  Ask whether the parties agree to record the meeting discussions using audio or video technology. (Refer to _SPS 10/01 Recording Inland Revenue Interviews_ or any replacement SPS).
    5.  Run through the agenda.
    6.  Encourage the parties to present evidence in support of their perceived facts (either at the conference meeting or on a later date if the evidence cannot be provided at the time of the meeting). Where possible, encourage the parties to reach agreement on all the facts of the dispute. If no agreement can be made, encourage the parties to establish the common grounds and address the matters that they agree to disagree. These agreements will be recorded in writing. The agreements will be sent to the taxpayer to verify the correctness and sign by a specified date.
    7.  Promote constructive discussion of only the contentious tax issues and where possible, encourage both parties to explore the issues, resolve or settle the dispute (subject to our internal revenue delegations and guidelines on settlement). If the contentious tax issues cannot be resolved, ask both parties to do one or more of the following:
        *   At the end of the conference meeting, ask the parties to consider whether the conference phase comes to an end. Consider whether there is need for another meeting, noting that another meeting can be justified if both parties need to exchange further information in support of their tax technical arguments but continuous meetings are discouraged if this is seen as a delaying tactic.
        *   Where the parties agree to end the conference phase and the facilitator considers that the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved, the facilitator can clearly signal the end of the conference phase to the parties.
        *   Agree on the timeframe for completing the disputes process and submitting the dispute to the adjudication process. This includes the timeframe for taxpayers to meet outstanding information requests and Inland Revenue officers' undertaking to provide copies of information relevant to the disputes. The agreed timeframe will also factor in time bar waivers if given by the taxpayer and the time required for any court challenge that relates to documents, which are claimed to be protected by professional legal privilege and tax advice documents, which are claimed to be protected by the non-disclosure rights. Ask the taxpayer whether a time bar waiver will be given if the time bar applicable to the assessment in dispute is imminent.
        *   Clearly indicate whether the communication made and/or documents prepared for the purpose of negotiating potential settlement or resolution of the dispute will be treated as being on a "without prejudice" basis.
        *   Ask the taxpayer to consider whether the opt out process applies and advise the taxpayer of the right to opt out within the required timeframe, so that it is not necessary to complete the disputes process as required under section 89N and that the dispute will be more efficiently resolved by a hearing authority.
    8.  Note that any agreement between the parties will be recorded in writing and signed either at the conference meeting by both parties or on a later date after the taxpayer has verified the correctness of the agreement.
    9.  Note that the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute will remain as the first point of contact.

_Unfacilitated conference_

179.  In an unfacilitated conference, the parties at the conference should agree on and perform tasks similar to those listed in paragraphs 178(a) to (h) above.  
      
    
180.  At the end of the conference meeting, it is important for the Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer to discuss whether they consider that the conference phase has come to an end and record any agreement in writing.

##### After the conference meeting

181.  The following is relevant only if the conference phase does not end at the meeting.

_Facilitated conference_

182.  The facilitator will:
    1.  follow up on the agreed matters including the agreed timeframe and exchange of information (but does not include enforcing the agreement between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute);
    2.  assess any need to attend a further meeting;
    3.  suggest to the parties that the conference phase has ended and ask them to reach an agreement on this matter, then clearly notify the parties of the date on which the conference phase has ended.

_Unfacilitated conference_

183.  In a conference that did not have a facilitator, the Inland Revenue officers will perform these tasks. They may suggest to the taxpayer that the conference phase has ended after all the material information relating to the dispute has been exchanged and all the contentious facts and issues have been discussed. The parties will then agree in writing on the date on which the conference phase has ended. If the parties cannot agree on when to end the conference phase, the Investigations Manager will be responsible for making the decision on ending the conference phase after considering all the parties' relevant reasons and concerns.

##### End of the conference phase

184.  It is important for the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to be fully aware of when the conference phase comes to an end. The conference phase is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting. In most cases, it is expected that the parties involved in the dispute will agree on when the conference phase has ended. Such agreement will be put in writing.

_Facilitated conference_

185.  After a facilitated conference the facilitator will be responsible for clarifying the agreed end date of the conference phase with the parties.  
      
    
186.  If the facilitator considers that both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers have exchanged all the material information relevant to the dispute, have fully discussed the tax technical issues and have not resolved the dispute, the facilitator may suggest to the parties that the conference phase can come to its end.  
      
    
187.  If there is no agreement and the parties' reasons for continuing the conference phase are considered to be insufficient, the conference facilitator can make a decision to end the conference phase and notify the parties of that decision. The following are examples of strong indicators that the conference phase has come to its end:
    
    1.  The taxpayer and/or the tax advisors stop contacting the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute for a few weeks;
    2.  The parties did not exchange information notwithstanding that this has been agreed on at the conference meeting, thus leading to the exercise of the Commissioner's powers (eg section 17 notices);
    3.  The parties agree to disagree with each other and express interest in progressing to the SOP phase;
    4.  The taxpayer appears to be using delaying tactics at the conference phase when the issue in dispute is subject to an imminent time bar.
    
      
    
188.  In rare situations, where conference facilitation is involved and the facilitator is concerned with the parties' decision to end the conference phase before achieving the objectives of the conference meeting, the facilitator may adjourn the meeting and discuss the concerns with the responsible Inland Revenue officers. The facilitator may also contact the taxpayer or the taxpayer's tax advisors to discuss whether the conference phase should come to its end. The facilitator will seek the parties' agreement as to whether or not the conference phase is complete.

_Unfacilitated conference_

189.  Where no conference facilitation is involved, the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers will work out when to end the conference phase. They should consider whether the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved before reaching the agreement. If no agreement can be reached, the Investigations Manager will review the conduct of the parties during the conference phase and make a decision on whether the conference phase has come to an end.  
      
    
190.  When a dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase has been completed, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1).

### Progressing disputes through the disputes process where the dispute affects multiple taxpayers

191.  Sometimes it is necessary for Inland Revenue to deal with a large number of taxpayers that are all affected by the same disputed matter. This can arise in situations where:
    
    *   the taxpayers are all investors in a particular scheme;
    *   the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same promoter;
    *   the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same tax agent;
    *   there exists a widespread but well-defined common problem involving many unrelated taxpayers (eg taxpayers moving their private residence into an LAQC, or a number of taxpayers claiming non-deductible expenses such as fines for overloading).
    
      
    
192.  Given Inland Revenue's limited resources, and bearing in mind taxpayer compliance costs it may not be appropriate for all the cases to proceed through the full dispute process.  
      
    
193.  The Commissioner's approach, in the context of taxpayer initiated disputes, to the different situations which arise where a large number of taxpayers are all affected by the same disputed matter is outlined in the following paragraphs.

##### Situation one: There are a number of cases on the same issue under dispute. One case has been referred to the Adjudication Unit, who has still to reach a conclusion on the matter

194.  In this situation it may be possible for other affected taxpayers and the Commissioner to merely agree, subject to statutory time bar issues, to place their case "on hold" while the Adjudication Unit undertakes its analysis.  
      
    
195.  However, care will need to be taken to ensure that the time bar will not be breached, and consideration should be given to obtaining a time bar waiver.  
      
    
196.  Again, as this approach requires the taxpayer to agree, the Commissioner can offer it to individual taxpayers but they still have the choice to progress the dispute through the full disputes process.  
      
    
197.  Taxpayers who agree to place their case "on hold" while adjudication considers the issues in question in relation to another taxpayer will not be bound by any decision reached by the Adjudication Unit and will be free to continue with their dispute should they wish.

##### Situation two: The Adjudication Unit has looked at an issue before and taken a view supporting the taxpayer

198.  It is the Commissioner's policy that a finding for the taxpayer in previous dispute(s) will usually lead to the other disputes being withdrawn, particularly if the disputes are in respect of the same transaction.  
      
    
199.  However, in some situations further consideration of the issue is required at a national level before the Commissioner will apply the conclusions reached in a particular adjudication report more broadly to other taxpayers. In those cases, Inland Revenue officers may be advised that a specified or contrary approach (to that adopted by the Adjudication Unit) is to be followed pending further consideration of the issue at a national level.

### Disclosure notice

200.  The Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1), unless the Commissioner:
    1.  does not have to complete the disputes process because any of the exceptions under section 89N(1)(c) apply (see the discussion in _SPS 10/04: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ or any replacement SPS), or
    2.  does not have to complete the disputes process because the High Court has made an order that the dispute resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3), or
    3.  has already issued to the taxpayer a notice of disputable decision that includes or takes into account the adjustment proposed in the NOPA pursuant to section 89M(2). Section 89M(1) and (2) reads:
        
        > (1) Unless subsection (2) applies, and subject to section 89N, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment to a disputant at the time or after the Commissioner or the taxpayer, as the case may be, issues the notice of proposed adjustment.  
        > (2) The Commissioner may not issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment if the Commissioner has already issued a notice of disputable decision that includes, or takes account of, the adjustment proposed in the notice of proposed adjustment.
        
201.  The meaning of disputable decision is discussed in paragraphs 61 to 71.  
      
    
202.  The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer two weeks before a disclosure notice is issued that it will be issued to them.  
      
    
203.  Where practicable, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer shortly after the disclosure notice and SOP are issued to ascertain whether they have received these documents.  
      
    
204.  If the taxpayer has not received the Commissioner's disclosure notice, for example, due to a postal error or an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control, the Commissioner will issue another disclosure notice to the taxpayer. In this circumstance, the response period within which the taxpayer must respond with their SOP will commence from the date that the Commissioner issued the initial disclosure notice.  
      
    
205.  Where the taxpayer cannot issue a SOP within the applicable response period, they should issue a late SOP with an explanation of why it is late. The Commissioner will consider the late SOP in terms of the discretion under section 89K(1) (see paragraphs 120 to 130 for details).

_Evidence exclusion rule_

206.  A disclosure notice is the document that can trigger the application of the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1). This rule restricts the evidence that the parties can raise in court challenges to matters disclosed in their SOP. (Both parties can refer to evidence raised by either party.)  
      
    
207.  Any disclosure notice that the Commissioner issues will explain the effect of the evidence exclusion rule and refer to section 138G.  
      
    
208.  Section 89M(6B) defines "evidence" for the purposes of the evidence exclusion rule to mean the available documentary evidence and not lists of potential witnesses. Therefore, the identities of both parties' witnesses in sensitive cases will continue to be protected, without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule.

_Issue of a disclosure notice_

209.  The Commissioner can issue a disclosure notice at any time on or after the date that the taxpayer issues a NOPA because there is no statutory timeframe specifying when the notice must be issued.  
      
    
210.  The Commissioner does not have to issue a disclosure notice to a taxpayer when they ask for one to be issued. However, the Commissioner will usually discuss such a request with the taxpayer and advise whether a disclosure notice will be issued and, if not, the reasons why and the implications for the dispute.  
      
    
211.  Generally, the Commissioner's practice is to issue a disclosure notice after the exchange of a NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, the conclusion of the conference phase and in accordance with any timeframe agreed with the taxpayer. The Commissioner will usually issue a disclosure notice within one month after the conference phase has been completed.  
      
    
212.  When possible, the responsible officer should use the relevant statutory power under the TAA to obtain any information needed to complete the conference or disclosure phases. This will ensure that the disputes process is conducted in a timely and efficient manner. If the Commissioner is waiting for information to be provided pursuant to a statutory power Commissioner will defer issuing a disclosure notice to ensure that any information provided by the taxpayer can be included in the Commissioner's SOP.  
      
    
213.  If a disclosure notice is issued earlier (for example, the facts are clear, the taxpayer agrees, or a conference is not required) the reasons must be documented and explained to the taxpayer.

### Taxpayer's statement of position (SOP)

214.  Pursuant to section 89M(5), once the Commissioner has issued a disclosure notice, the taxpayer must issue to the Commissioner a SOP within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the disclosure notice is issued.  
      
    
215.  The Commissioner cannot consider a document that the taxpayer purports to issue as a SOP before the Commissioner has issued the disclosure notice because it would have been issued outside the applicable response period. The taxpayer must submit another SOP after the disclosure notice is issued to satisfy their obligation under section 89M(5).  
      
    
216.  Unless an "exceptional circumstance" in section 89K applies, if the taxpayer issues a SOP to the Commissioner outside the response period, the Commissioner will treat the dispute as if it was never commenced. The Commissioner does not have to issue an assessment to include or take account of the taxpayer's proposed adjustment. Section 89M(7)(b) reads:
    
    > (7) A disputant who does not issue a statement of position in the prescribed form within the response period for the statement of position, is treated as follows:  
    > ...
    > 
    > (b) if the disputant has proposed the adjustment to the assessment, the disputant is treated as not having issued a notice of proposed adjustment.
    

##### Contents of a taxpayer's statement of position

217.  The content of a SOP is binding. If the matter proceeds to court, then pursuant to section 138G(1) the parties can only rely on the facts, evidence (excluding oral evidence), issues and propositions of law that either party discloses in their SOP barring an application by the parties to the court to include new information under section 138G(2).  
      
    
218.  The taxpayer's SOP must be in the prescribed form (the _IR773 Statement of position_ form that can be found on Inland Revenue's website: www.ird.govt.nz) and include sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law on which the taxpayer wishes to rely. In particular, the taxpayer must clarify what tax laws are being relied on and advise if any of these are different to those relied on in the taxpayer's NOPA.  
      
    
219.  However, if the Commissioner receives a SOP that is not in the prescribed form (as described in paragraph 218) the Commissioner's practice will be to advise the taxpayer that the SOP must be in the prescribed form. If this occurs on the last day of the response period the Commissioner will consider the resubmitted SOP under section 89K(1)(a)(iii) provided that the lateness is minimal.  
      
    
220.  Section 89M(6) reads:
    
    > A disputant's statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner,-
    > 
    > (a) Give an outline of the facts on which the disputant intends to rely; and  
    > (b) Give an outline of the evidence on which the disputant intends to rely; and  
    > (c) Give an outline of the issues that the disputant considers will arise; and  
    > (d) Specify the propositions of law on which the disputant intends to rely.
    
221.  The minimum content requirement for a SOP is an outline of the relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law. To allow the Adjudication Unit to successfully reach a decision, the outline in the SOP must contain full, complete and detailed submissions.  
      
    
222.  An outline that consists of a frank and complete discussion of the issues, law, arguments and evidence supporting the arguments is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes process. (In very complex cases the taxpayer should provide a full explanation of the relevant evidence).  
      
    
223.  The disputes process does not require that relevant documents are discovered or full briefs of evidence or exhaustive lists of documents exchanged. Rather, providing an outline of relevant evidence in the SOP will ensure that both parties appreciate the availability of evidence in respect of the factual issues in dispute. The taxpayer should include an outline of any expert evidence on which they intend to rely in the SOP.  
      
    
224.  If the Commissioner considers that the SOP has insufficient detail to allow a correct assessment to be made the SOP can be treated as not complying with the requirements of section 89M(6).  
      
    
225.  Subject to any order made by the court under section 138G(2), the evidence exclusion rule found in section 138G(1) prevents a hearing authority from considering arguments and evidence that are not included in:
    
    1.  the SOP, or
    2.  any additional information that:
        1.  the Commissioner provides under section 89M(8), that is deemed to be part of the Commissioner's SOP under subsection (9), or
        2.  the parties provide pursuant to an agreement under section 89M(13), that is deemed to be part of the provider's SOP under subsection (14).
    
      
    
226.  Section 89M(6B) reads:
    
    > In subsection 4(b) and 6(b), evidence refers to the available documentary evidence on which the person intends to rely, but does not include a list of potential witnesses, whether or not identified by name.
    
227.  Pursuant to section 89M(6B), the SOP must list any documentary evidence butnot potential witnesses. Any witnesses' identities will continue to be protected without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule.

##### Receipt of a taxpayer's statement of position

228.  If a taxpayer has issued a SOP the Commissioner can accept the SOP or issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer's SOP. Furthermore, section 89N(2) allows the Commissioner to amend an assessment under section 113 after the Commissioner has considered the SOP. (However, the Commissioner's practice is to send the dispute through the adjudication process. See paragraphs 248 to 263 for details.)  
      
    
229.  The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent 10 working days before the response period expires to determine whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP in response to the disclosure notice. Such contact will be made by telephone or in writing. The taxpayer's SOP will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue receives it. Upon receipt of the SOP, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following:
    
    1.  the date on which the SOP was issued, and
    2.  whether the SOP has been issued within the relevant response period, and
    3.  the salient features of the SOP including any deficiencies in its content.
    
      
    
230.  Where practicable, the Commissioner will acknowledge that the taxpayer's SOP is received within 10 working days after it is received. However, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of any deficiencies in the SOP's content as soon as they become aware of the deficiency. They will be further advised when the response period expires that those deficiencies must be rectified and whether the Commissioner intends to provide any additional information to the taxpayer.  
      
    
231.  Where a SOP is issued outside the applicable response period, the taxpayer can apply for consideration of exceptional circumstances under section 89K. The reasons for accepting or rejecting the application must be documented and the responsible officer will make a reasonable effort to advise the taxpayer of the decision in writing within 15 working days after Inland Revenue has received the taxpayer's application.  
      
    
232.  If the taxpayer issues a SOP outside the applicable response period and none of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K apply, the dispute will be treated as if it was never commenced (see paragraph 216). Where practicable, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of this within 10 working days after the response period for the disclosure notice has expired.

### Commissioner's statement of position in response

233.  When the taxpayer has issued a NOPA, section 89M(3) allows the Commissioner to issue a disclosure notice without a SOP. If the dispute remains unresolved the Commissioner's practice is to issue a SOP that addresses and responds to the substantive items in the taxpayer's SOP within the applicable response period (that is, within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer issued their SOP).  
      
    
234.  However, in very rare circumstances the Commissioner may not issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer's SOP. For example, where an assessment must be issued because a statutory time bar is imminent, an exception arises under section 89N(1)(c) or the High Court has made an order that the disputes process can be truncated pursuant to an application made under section 89N(3).  
      
    
235.  If there is insufficient time to provide a SOP in response the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for further time to reply to the taxpayer's SOP under section 89M(10) if the application is made before the response period expires and the Commissioner considers that it is unreasonable to reply within the response period because of the number, complexity or novelty of matters raised in the taxpayer's SOP.  
      
    
236.  Such applications are expected to be rare but can arise if the taxpayer is less than co-operative with supplying information and/or has failed to maintain proper and adequate records.  
      
    
237.  The Commissioner's SOP must be in the form that the Commissioner has prescribed under section 35(1) and include sufficient details to fairly inform the taxpayer of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law on which the Commissioner wishes to rely.  
      
    
238.  Section 89M(4) reads:
    
    > The Commissioner's statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the disputant,-
    > 
    > (a) Give an outline of the facts on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and  
    > (b) Give an outline of the evidence on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and  
    > (c) Give an outline of the issues that the Commissioner considers will arise; and  
    > (d) Specify the propositions of law on which the Commissioner intends to rely.
    
239.  If the Commissioner has issued a SOP, the Commissioner can also provide to a taxpayer additional information in response to matters raised in their SOP under section 89M(8) within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer's SOP is issued.  
      
    
240.  However, the Commissioner's practice is to issue a SOP to the taxpayer towards the end of the response period to allow sufficient time for gathering any further information in response and considering the SOP's content. This minimises the occasions when additional information needs to be provided under section 89M(8) as the information in question will be in the SOP. In any event, as any additional information must be provided within the same response period as the Commissioner's SOP in most case it will be unlikely that the Commissioner will be able to issue additional information within the response period.  
      
    
241.  The taxpayer cannot reply to the Commissioner's SOP (or any additional information provided) unless the Commissioner agrees to accept additional information under section 89M(13).

### Agreement to include additional information

242.  The parties can agree to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13) at any time during the disputes process including after the dispute has been referred to the Adjudication Unit. Although there is no statutory time limit, the Commissioner's practice is to allow one month (from the later of the date that the Commissioner issues a SOP or provides any additional information under section 89M(8)) for such an agreement to be reached and information provided.  
      
    
243.  However, before agreeing to a request made by the taxpayer under section 89M(13) the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer's prior conduct and whether they could have provided the information earlier through the application of due diligence.  
      
    
244.  The Commissioner will usually also consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information and its capacity to help resolve the dispute and may decide to take it into account in coming to an assessment. In this circumstance, both parties will be expected to cooperate in resolving the relevance and accuracy of any such material. The Commissioner may wish to apply resources to verification and comment and this will be considered by the adjudicator.  
      
    
245.  If a taxpayer's request to add additional information to their SOP is declined, the reasons must be documented with detailed reference to the taxpayer's conduct, level of cooperation before the request was made and why the information was not provided earlier. The responsible officer will also advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the reasons why their request was declined.  
      
    
246.  Any agreements to add further information to the SOP will be made subject to the taxpayer agreeing that the Commissioner can also include responses to the additional information to the SOP under section 89M(13), if required.  
      
    
247.  Any additional information that the parties provide under section 89M(13) will be deemed to form part of the provider's SOP under section 89M(14). Thus, the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1) applies to the additional information.

### Preparation for adjudication

248.  The Adjudication Unit is part of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and represents the final step in the disputes process. The adjudicator's role is to review unresolved disputes by taking a fresh look at the tax dispute and the application of law to the facts in an impartial and independent manner and provide a comprehensive and technically accurate decision that will ensure the correctness of the assessment.  
      
    
249.  Generally, the adjudicator will make such a decision within three months after the case is referred to the Adjudication Unit. However, this will depend on the number of disputes that are before the Adjudication Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. (For further information on the timeframe for adjudication of disputes see the article titled "Adjudication Unit - Its role in the dispute resolution process" that was published in the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 19, No. 10 (November 2007).)  
      
    
250.  Judicial comments have been made in _C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited and Another_, _Ch'elle Properties (NZ) Limited v CIR_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 and _ANZ National Bank Ltd and others v C of IR (No. 2)_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,835 indicating that, as a matter of law, it is not strictly necessary for Inland Revenue officers to send all disputes to the Adjudication Unit for review, and Inland Revenue officers are not necessarily bound by the Adjudication Unit's decisions.  
      
    
251.  Notwithstanding the above judicial comments, if the parties have not agreed on all the issues at the end of the conference and disclosure phases or to truncate the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), it is the Commissioner's policy and practice that all disputes are to be sent to the Adjudication Unit for review, irrespective of the complexity or type of issues or amount of tax involved unless any of the following exceptions arise:
    
    1.  the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP for the purposes of section 89N(2)(b) and referred the dispute to the Adjudication Unit for their preliminary consideration and the Adjudication Unit has determined that it has insufficient time to reach a decision in respect of the dispute before a statutory time bar would prevent the Commissioner from subsequently increasing the assessment (see paragraph 255 for further discussion), or
    2.  any of the legislative exceptions specified in section 89N(1)(c) apply (see _SPS 10/04: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ for further discussion) so that the Commissioner can amend an assessment without first completing the disputes process, or
    3.  the High Court has made an order that the disputes process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3).
    
      
    
252.  Inland Revenue officers will adequately consider the facts and legal arguments in the taxpayer's SOP before deciding whether to amend the assessment. It is expected that this will occur only in very rare circumstances.  
      
    
253.  Whether the Commissioner has adequately considered a SOP will depend on what is a reasonable length of time and level of analysis for that SOP given the circumstances of the case (for example, the length of the SOP and the complexity of the legal issues).  
      
    
254.  Thus a simple dispute could take only a couple of days to consider adequately while a complex dispute could take a few weeks.  
      
    
255.  The decision not to refer the case to adjudication must be made by a senior person in Service Delivery (for example, at the time of writing the delegation was with Assurance Manager level or above). In respect of the first exception mentioned in paragraph 251(a) it is necessary that the parties have exchanged a SOP and it is a matter solely for the Adjudication Unit to determine whether it has insufficient time to fully consider the dispute.  
      
    
256.  If the dispute is to be referred to the Adjudication Unit, the Commissioner should not issue an assessment or amended assessment before the adjudication process is completed unless a time bar is imminent. The responsible officer will prepare a cover sheet that records all the documents that must be sent to the Adjudication Unit.  
      
    
257.  The cover sheet together with copies of the documents (NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, conference notes, both parties' SOP, additional information, material evidence including expert opinions and a schedule of all evidence held) and any recordings of discussions held during the conference must be sent to the Adjudication Unit.  
      
    
258.  When the dispute is to be referred to adjudication, the responsible officer will issue a letter and copy of the cover sheet to the taxpayer before sending the submissions, notes and evidence to the Adjudication Unit. The cover sheet and letter is usually completed within one month after the date that the Commissioner issues the SOP or provides additional information under section 89M(8).  
      
    
259.  The purpose of this letter is to seek the taxpayer's concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator - primarily in regard to the documentary evidence that has been disclosed at the SOP phase. This letter will allow the taxpayer no more than 10 working days from when it is received to provide a response.  
      
    
260.  Once the taxpayer has concurred on the materials to be sent to the Adjudication Unit, those materials will usually be so forwarded. However, if the taxpayer does not provide a response the materials will be forwarded within 10 working days after the date that the letter is issued to the taxpayer advising that the materials will be sent to the Adjudication Unit. The adjudicator can also contact the parties after the initial materials have been received to obtain further information.  
      
    
261.  Where an investigation has covered multiple issues, the cover sheet will outline any issues that the parties have agreed upon and any issues that are still disputed. The adjudicator can then consider the disputed issues and not reconsider those issues that have been agreed upon.  
      
    
262.  Generally, the adjudicator only considers the materials that the parties have submitted. They do not usually seek out or consider further information, unless it is relevant. The adjudicator may consider such additional information notwithstanding that the parties have not agreed that the provider can include this information in their SOP under section 89M(13).  
      
    
263.  However, any additional material that the parties have not included in their SOP (or is not deemed to be included in their SOP under section 89M(14)) cannot later be raised by the parties as evidence in the TRA or a hearing authority because of the evidence exclusion rule in section 138G(1).

### Adjudication decision

264.  Once a conclusion is reached, the Adjudication Unit will advise the taxpayer and responsible officer of the decision. The responsible officer will implement the Adjudication Unit's recommendations and follow up procedures where required, including issuing a notice of assessment to the taxpayer where applicable.  
      
    
265.  If the Adjudication Unit makes a decision that is not in the Commissioner's favour, the Commissioner is bound by and cannot challenge that decision. The dispute will come to end. The Commissioner will issue an assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer to reflect the decision.  
      
    
266.  If a taxpayer commences the disputes process, they can file challenge proceedings in the general jurisdiction of the TRA, its small claims jurisdiction (if the taxpayer so elects in their NOPA under section 89E(1)) or the High Court within the applicable response period if any of the following conditions are met:
    
    1.  the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period and the Commissioner has later issued an amended assessment to the taxpayer (section 138B(2)), or
    2.  the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period by a NOR or other written disputable decision and the Commissioner has not issued an amended assessment (section 138B(3)), or
    3.  the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued a disputable decision that is not an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period (section 138C).
    
      
    
267.  A taxpayer must file proceedings with the TRA or High Court within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues:
    
    1.  the amended assessment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138B(2), or
    2.  the written disputable decision rejecting the taxpayer's proposed adjustment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138B(3), or
    3.  the written disputable decision rejecting the taxpayer's proposed adjustment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138C.
    
      
    
268.  If applicable, the responsible officer will implement any decision made by the hearing authority and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer.

Child Support Debt - Requesting an instalment arrangement (WITHDRAWN)
=====================================================================

SPS 11/02 sets out IR's practice when considering requests for relief to pay overdue child support obligations by instalment arrangements.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No 2 (March 2011).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue's practice for providing relief when the immediate payment of an overdue child support obligation is not possible. The relief is provided in the form of an instalment arrangement to pay the debt. However, taxpayers who have a tax debt or Student Loan repayment arrears should refer to SPS 11/01 (_Instalment arrangements for payment of tax_) or SPS 11/03 (_Student Loans - Relief from repayment obligations_).  
     
2.  For the purpose of this SPS, the term "instalment arrangement" has been used instead of "payment agreement" which is used in the Child Support Act 1991 ("CSA").  
     
3.  A debt owing by a custodian will be collected by the Commissioner in the same manner as if it was financial support owing by a liable person. Reference to "liable person" may include a custodian for the purpose of this SPS.  
     
4.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the CSA.

### Application

5.  This SPS applies to the Commissioner's discretion to provide relief when giving consideration to:
    *   requests for instalment arrangements to settle child support debt; and
    *   write-off of incremental penalty debt when the instalment arrangements are adhered to.

### Summary

6.  The CSA provides limited discretion where a liable person is unable to pay their child support debt in full and on time. The Commissioner may:
    *   agree to an instalment arrangement to pay child support debt; and
    *   write-off incremental penalties when instalment arrangements are adhered to.  
         
7.  As a result, the Commissioner will look at the circumstances of a case and may agree to an instalment arrangement to pay child support debt.

### Legislation

8.  The relevant legislative provisions of the CSA:

##### 135G Discretionary relief for residual incremental penalty debt

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (1) | The Commissioner may grant relief to a liable person from the payment of incremental penalties in the manner prescribed by section 135A if- |     |     |
| (a) | the liable person has paid all of the financial support debt and initial late payment penalties to which the incremental penalties relate; and |     |
| (b) | the Commissioner is satisfied that recovery of the incremental penalties- |     |
| (i) | would involve an inefficient use of the Commissioner's resources; or |
| (ii) | would place the liable person in serious hardship. |
| (2) | Before making a decision under subsection (1)(b), the Commissioner must have regard to the matters referred to in sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. |     |     |
| (3) | In this section,-  <br>**serious hardship**, in relation to a liable person,- |     |     |

| (ii) | the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the liable person or the liable person's dependant; or |
| (iii) | a serious illness suffered by the liable person or the liable person's dependant; or |
| (iv) | the cost of education for the liable person's dependant: |
| (b) | does not include significant financial difficulties that arise because- |     |
| (i) | the liable person is obligated to pay tax or financial support; or |
| (ii) | the liable person may become bankrupt; or |
| (iii) | the liable person's, or the liable person's dependant's, social activities and entertainment may be limited; or |
| (iv) | the liable person is unable to afford goods or services that are expensive or of a high quality or standard according to normal community standards. |

##### 135H Relief from initial late payment penalty if payment arrangement

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (1) | The Commissioner must write off an initial late payment penalty in relation to a financial support debt if the Commissioner is satisfied that- |     |     |     |
| (a) | the initial late payment penalty relates to the first payment of financial support payable by the liable person; and |     |     |
| (b) | within the 3-month period beginning on the date that the Commissioner issues the assessment under which the first payment is payable, either- |     |     |
| (i) | the liable person enters into a payment agreement with the Commissioner to pay, in 2 or more instalments,- |     |
| (A) | the first payment; and |
| (B) | other payments of financial support that are or will become payable by the liable person; or |
| (ii) | the Commissioner gives a person a deduction notice under section 154 in relation to the liable person for the purpose of collecting, in 2 or more deductions and payments,- |     |
| (A) | the first payment; and |
| (B) | other payments of financial support that are or will become payable by the liable person; and |
| (c) | either,- |     |     |
| (i) | in the case of paragraph (b)(i), every one of those instalments is paid in full in accordance with that payment agreement; or |     |
| (ii) | in the case of paragraph (b)(ii), every one of those deductions and payments is made in accordance with that notice. |     |
| (2) | If an initial late payment penalty is written off under this section, and that penalty has been paid in whole or in part, the Commissioner must refund to the liable person the whole or part of the initial late payment penalty that has been paid. |     |     |     |
| (3) | For the purposes of this section, **first payment** means the first amount of financial support that is required to be paid by a liable person under an assessment made by the Commissioner under section 24(1)(a). |     |     |     |

##### 135J Relief from incremental penalties unpaid before agreement entered into

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| r   | \=  | ( a × c ) | −   | d   |

| (b) | the Commissioner is satisfied, in respect of each failure to make a payment in accordance with the payment agreement, that the circumstances in relation to the failure would, if they were related to the payment of a debt to which a penalty relates, entitle the Commissioner to grant relief under any of the provisions of sections 135B to 135E. |

| (4) | The Commissioner may disregard a failure to make a deduction and payment for the purpose of applying section 135K. |     |

| (c) | that sum or, as the case may be, every one of those instalments is paid in full in accordance with that payment agreement. |
| (2) | The Commissioner must grant relief to the liable person- |     |
| (a) | by writing off the incremental penalty referred to in subsection (1)(a); or |
| (b) | if that incremental penalty has been paid, in whole or in part, by refunding to that person the whole or the part of that incremental penalty that has been paid, with or without writing off any part of that incremental penalty that has not been paid. |

##### 151 Overpayments to payees

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (1) | Where a payee is paid an amount under any provision of this Part of this Act and- |     |
| (a) | The payee was not entitled to be paid the amount; or |
| (b) | The amount is, because of a subsequent variation in the liability of the liable person, repayable by the Commissioner to the liable person; or |
| (c) | The amount is, because of a subsequent variation in the entitlement of the payee, in excess of the amount properly payable to the payee under this Act,- |
| the amount is repayable by the payee to the Commissioner and is a debt due by the payee to the Crown. |     |
| (2) | The Commissioner shall, as soon as practicable, assess the amount that is so repayable, and the provisions of this Act shall apply to the amount assessed and to the payee as if that amount was financial support and the payee was a liable person. |     |
| (3) | Where, in any case to which subsection (1) of this section applies, the payee is entitled to receive further payments under any provision of this Part of this Act, the amount of the debt due to the Crown by the payee may be recovered by reducing such of those payments by such amount as is determined in writing by the Commissioner. |     |

##### 152 Relief in cases of serious hardship

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| In any case where- |     |     |
| (a) | A person is required under section 151 of this Act to repay any amount of financial support (including any penalty imposed thereon under this Act) to the Commissioner and the amount is unable to be recovered, either in whole or in part, in the manner prescribed in section 151(3) of this Act; and |     |
| (b) | It is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner- |     |
| (i) | That the person has suffered such loss or is in such circumstances that the repayment of the amount or part thereof that is unable to be so recovered has entailed or would entail serious hardship; or |
| (ii) | That, owing to the death of the person, the dependents of that person are in such circumstances that the repayment of the full amount has entailed or would entail serious hardship,- |
| the Commissioner may write-off the debt, wholly or in part, and may make such alterations in the assessment as are necessary for that purpose; and may, if the amount unable to be recovered in the manner prescribed in section 151(3) of this Act or any part thereof has been already paid, refund any amount paid in excess of the amount of the assessment as so altered under this section. |     |     |

### Discussion

9.  A liable person should contact Inland Revenue at the earliest opportunity if they think they are likely to be unable to pay their child support obligations on time and in full so that options for payment, which may include an instalment arrangement, can be discussed. The Commissioner will consider a request for an instalment arrangement on a case-by-case basis.  
     
10.  Early contact may also minimise penalties where an instalment arrangement can be entered into.  
     
11.  Applications may be made by telephone, in writing or by electronic means.

#### Available options for relief

12.  The Commissioner may, when satisfied that immediate payment of child support debt is not possible, grant relief to a liable person through the following options:
    *   agree to an instalment arrangement;
    *   write-off incremental penalties - provided that the instalment arrangement is adhered to.

#### When will relief be provided?

13.  Requests for instalment arrangements will largely rely on the liable person being able to show that they are not able to make immediate payment of their child support debt.  
     
14.  The Commissioner will consider all options available for payment and will look to maximise recovery of child support debt (that is, payment of the debt in the shortest possible time) while ensuring the liable person maintains their current child support obligations.

#### Instalment arrangements

15.  An instalment arrangement may consist of one or more payments to settle a child support debt. It may also include any current year child support obligation payable during the term of the instalment arrangement. This is to ensure that the liable person meets their current child support obligations.  
     
16.  When an instalment arrangement includes current year child support obligations, it must provide for the minimum annual rate of child support payable for a current year, plus a reasonable amount toward reducing the outstanding debt.  
     
17.  Consequently, an instalment arrangement must be for more than the minimum annual amount of child support payable.

#### Information to support application

18.  A decision will be made based on the circumstances of each individual case, with the aim of recovering the child support debt in the shortest possible period. The Commissioner will also consider whether the liable person can reasonably afford to repay their child support debt at the rate detailed in their instalment arrangement application.  
     
19.  Information to support a request for an instalment arrangement may be provided by the liable person with their application. Alternatively they may be asked to complete a _Child Support - repayment of arrears (IR130)_ form. The information provided will assist the Commissioner when considering the application, including whether other options are available to the liable person to settle their child support debt. The IR130 form is available on our website at www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides.

#### Default with instalments may not undo an instalment arrangement

20.  It is acknowledged that a liable person's circumstances can change for reasons outside their control. For example, an unforeseen household expense or default by debtors can erode their cash flow and their ability to maintain an instalment arrangement.  
     
21.  In these circumstances the liable person should contact Inland Revenue promptly to discuss an adjustment to their instalment arrangement. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the liable person is unable to continue to meet their instalment obligation other options to recover the debt will be considered.  
     
22.  If a liable person does not comply with the terms of an instalment arrangement, the Commissioner may cancel the instalment arrangement and pursue other remedies to collect the debt. However, before doing so, the reasons for the default will be considered and the Commissioner will take into account the liable person's overall compliance behaviour including:
    *   regularity of payments.
    *   current financial circumstances.
    *   the circumstances under which the payments were missed.

#### Write-off of penalty

23.  If child support obligations are not paid in full and on time, an initial 10% late payment penalty will be charged on the unpaid amount and a further 2% incremental penalty will be added each month the debt remains unpaid.  
     
24.  When a liable person enters into an instalment arrangement to clear their child support debt (which may include current child support payment obligations), the Commissioner will write-off appropriate incremental penalties when the liable person has completed the agreed payments.  
     
25.  Instalment arrangements are reviewed every 26 weeks (from the date of commencement) to confirm that the liable person has made the agreed payments. Where that instalment arrangement has been complied with, a proportion of the incremental penalties relative to the overall debt (under the instalment arrangement) paid during that period will be written-off.  
     
26.  Where an instalment arrangement has not been complied with and the Commissioner is satisfied that the default was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the liable person the failure to meet their obligations may be disregarded and the incremental penalties may still be remitted.  
     
27.  If the liable person does not comply with their repayment obligations and does not contact Inland Revenue to discuss options it is likely that the instalment arrangement will be cancelled. Should an instalment arrangement be cancelled, incremental penalties will accrue on any unpaid child support debt.  
     
28.  After the instalment arrangement has been completed, so that all of the financial support debt and initial late payment penalties have been paid, some incremental penalties may still remain. Further relief may be granted in respect of those further penalties. For that further relief to be granted, the Commissioner must be satisfied that:
    *   payment of the remaining incremental penalties would cause serious hardship to the liable person; or
    *   recovery of the penalties would involve an inefficient use of the Commissioner's resource when considering the circumstances of each individual case.

### Standard Practice

29.  A liable person should contact the Inland Revenue at the earliest opportunity if they are not going to be able to pay their child support obligations on time and in full. This is to discuss options for payment which may include an instalment arrangement.  
     
30.  Although it is best to contact Inland Revenue before a person gets behind with child support payments, it is never too late to make contact to discuss the options available to resolve child support debt and minimise exposure to related penalties.  
     
31.  Requests for an instalment arrangement may be made in writing, by telephone, or any other manner acceptable to the Commissioner. For example, the IR website on-line service.  
     
32.  Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. A liable person will need to be able to show why they will not able to make immediate payments towards their child support obligation. They may be asked to supply further information about their financial circumstances in support of their application.  
     
33.  When the Commissioner is satisfied that a liable person is not able to make immediate payment an instalment arrangement may be agreed to.  
     
34.  Instalment arrangements that include current year child support obligations must include the minimum annual rate of child support payable for a current year, plus a reasonable amount toward reducing the child support debt. Consequently, any instalment arrangement must be for more than the minimum annual amount of child support payable.  
     
35.  An instalment arrangement will be structured so that the child support debt will be paid in the shortest possible time.  
     
36.  When the Commissioner agrees to an instalment arrangement, the terms will be confirmed in writing. That confirmation will set out both the liable person's and the Commissioner's obligations under the instalment arrangement. Confirmation may be made by electronic means if that was the method used by the liable person when making their request.  
     
37.  Liable persons who enter into an instalment arrangement must inform the Commissioner as soon as practicable if there is a change in their circumstances that may impact on an earlier decision to provide financial relief, or their ability to repay their child support debt.  
     
38.  The Commissioner will review instalment arrangements every 26 weeks (from the date of commencement) to confirm that the liable person has made the agreed payments. So long as the agreement has been complied with, incremental penalties relative to the debt paid during that period will be written-off.  
     
39.  Default on payment of an instalment may not undo the overall instalment arrangement. When the Commissioner is satisfied that a liable person is unable to pay their child support debt under an instalment arrangement, the terms of the instalment arrangement may be varied following discussion with the liable person.  
     
40.  However, when an instalment arrangement is cancelled because a liable person does not comply with their repayment obligations, the Commissioner will consider whether other options may be available to collect the child support debt. Penalties will accrue on any unpaid amount.

Student Loans - Relief from repayment obligations (WITHDRAWN)
=============================================================

SPS 11/03 sets out IR's practice for providing relief from payment of student loan repayment obligations.

This item has been withdrawn and replaced by [SPS 20/05: Student loan repayment – options for relief](/standard-practice-statements/returns-and-debt-collection/sps-20-05)
.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No 2 (March 2011).

This item has been withdrawn and replaced by [SPS 20/05: Student loan repayment – options for relief](/standard-practice-statements/returns-and-debt-collection/sps-20-05)
.

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue's practice for providing relief from payment of student loan repayment obligations. However, where a student loan borrower has a tax debt or a child support debt, they should refer to SPS 11/01 (_Instalment arrangements for payment of tax_) or SPS 11/02 (_Child Support Debt – Requesting an instalment arrangement_).  
      
    
2.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 ("SLSA").

### Application

3.  This SPS applies to applications for relief from payment of:
    *   overdue student loan repayment obligations;
    *   student loan repayment obligations not yet due;
    *   student loan repayment deductions for the current tax year;
    *   penalties imposed on overdue student loan repayment obligations.

### Summary

4.  The SLSA provides very limited discretion for hardship relief where serious or significant financial hardship is experienced by a student loan borrower although the SLSA provides for hardship relief if there are special reasons which would make it fair and reasonable to grant that relief.  
      
    
5.  Those forms of relief are generally referred to in this SPS as hardship relief. They are:

*   The Commissioner may:
    *   refrain from issuing a notice of assessment or collecting and write off any student loan repayment obligation payable by the borrower if the amount in any tax year is $20 or less;
    *   refrain from the collection of any student loan repayment obligation payable by the borrower if the due date for payment has passed and the amount is more than $20 but less than $334 (excluding penalties). The amount not collected will be added back to the loan balance.
    *   reduce any amount that must be deducted or paid by a borrower, for example, issue a special repayment deduction rate certificate (formerly "Special Tax Code") to vary a deduction for the current or next year in order to change a borrower's student loan repayment obligation. The amount not collected as a consequence of a reduction will be added back to the loan balance.
    *   reduce a repayment obligation for the previous tax year. The amount not collected as a consequence of a reduction will be added back to the loan balance.
    *   refund any amount that was deducted or paid to meet a student loan repayment obligation in the previous tax year where he is satisfied the repayment has, or would, cause serious hardship to a borrower.

6.  A borrower can apply for the remission of late payment penalties imposed on any student loan repayment obligation. The Commissioner will look at the circumstances of each case and if the Commissioner thinks it equitable, may grant relief.

### Legislation

7.  The relevant legislative provisions of the SLSA are:

##### 51 Power of Commissioner in respect of small amounts

|     |     |
| --- | --- |

##### 55B Hardship relief for current tax year or next tax year

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (1) | If an application is made under section 54(1)(b) or (c), the Commissioner may, for any period the Commissioner considers equitable, reduce any amount that must be deducted or paid in order to meet the repayment obligation assessed or to be assessed for the current tax year or the next tax year if the Commissioner- |     |
| (a) | is satisfied that the amount being deducted or paid, or to be deducted or paid, has caused or will cause serious hardship to the borrower; or |
| (b) | considers that there are other special reasons that make it fair and reasonable to do so. |
| (2) | If the Commissioner reduces the amount to be deducted or paid by a borrower under subsection (1), the Commissioner must, as appropriate, do 1 of the following: |     |

| (3) | If the Commissioner reduces the amount to be deducted from, or paid by, a borrower to zero, section 18 does not apply to that borrower for the period for which that reduction applies. |     |

| --- | --- |
| (1) | Any amount that, as a result of a decision under section 55, 55A, or 55B, the Commissioner has refunded to, or not collected from, a borrower is subject to interest at the total interest rate on the daily amount outstanding (except to the extent that this Act otherwise requires). |
| (2) | Section 56 or 57, as appropriate, applies to a borrower who, as a result of the Commissioner refraining from deducting or collecting any amount from that borrower, or reducing that borrower's repayment obligation, has had deductions made, or has made payments, in excess of that borrower's repayment obligations as set out in section 56(1)(a) to (e) or section 57(1). |

##### 55D Borrowers must inform Commissioner of change of circumstances and Commissioner may review

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (1) | A borrower who applies for hardship relief under section 54 must inform the Commissioner as soon as practicable if there is a change in the borrower's circumstances that- |     |
| (a) | means that any information supplied to the Commissioner under section 54 is incorrect or inaccurate; or |
| (b) | may affect whether or not a borrower would have been, or will continue to be, granted hardship relief under section 55, 55A, or 55B. |
| (2) | The Commissioner may, at the end of a tax year, review any decision he or she made during that year to grant hardship relief to a borrower. |     |

| (a) | require the borrower to take any action that is required in order to reverse the effects of the hardship relief that was granted to the borrower: |
| (b) | reinstate all or part of the repayment deduction or repayment obligation that would have applied to the borrower if hardship relief had not been granted to the borrower, and require payment of any amount that would have been due during the relevant tax year. |

| (a) | Credit the amount so paid in excess, so far as it extends, to any repayment obligation for any other tax year or any other amount that has become due and payable that the borrower has failed to pay in the order in which that repayment obligation or other amount became due; and |

| (1) | On the application of a borrower, the Commissioner may exempt part or all of a relevant refund made to that borrower from section 57C. |     |
| (2) | The Commissioner may only exempt a relevant refund if the Commissioner is satisfied that that refund was necessary to alleviate the borrower's significant financial hardship. |     |

| (d) | the cost of modifying a residence to meet special needs arising from a disability of a borrower or a borrower's dependant; or |
| (e) | the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of a borrower or a borrower's dependant; or |
| (f) | the cost of palliative care for a borrower or a borrower's dependant; or |
| (g) | the cost of a funeral for a borrower's deceased dependant. |

### Discussion

#### Application for relief

8.  A borrower can make an application to Inland Revenue for hardship relief where they believe that payment of their student loan obligation would cause or has caused "serious hardship". A borrower can also apply for hardship relief if they consider that there are "other special reasons" that would justify relief from their repayment obligations. Each application will be considered on its own merits.  
      
    
9.  If a borrower anticipates that they will experience serious hardship or serious financial hardship as a consequence of having to meet their student loan repayment obligations for the next year, their application for hardship relief should be sent to Inland Revenue by 31 March of the current tax year. However, the Commissioner will also consider applications on a retrospective basis.  
      
    
10.  Applications can be made by telephone, in writing or by electronic means using the IR website on-line service.

#### Available options for relief

11.  Where the Commissioner is satisfied that the repayment of a student loan obligation (and related penalties) will cause the borrower serious hardship or there are other special reasons, the following options are available:
    *   refrain to collect a repayment obligation of less than $334;
    *   remit a penalty;
    *   reduce a student loan repayment obligation;
    *   refund repayments for the tax year immediately prior to the current tax year.

#### When relief will be provided

12.  Although the SLSA does not define the meaning of "serious hardship" or "other special reasons", section 57D (see above) sets out circumstances that would indicate a borrower is experiencing "significant financial hardship". This provides a guide to circumstances where the Commissioner will provide relief, although it is not an exhaustive list.  
      
    
13.  Applications for hardship relief are considered on a case-by-case basis. The onus is on the borrower to show that payment of their student loan obligations has or will cause hardship, or that there are special reasons why the Commissioner should not pursue full payment for a period.

#### Timing of applications for future relief

14.  When a borrower anticipates that they will experience financial hardship as a consequence of having to meet their student loan repayment obligations for a future tax year, their application for hardship relief should be sent to Inland Revenue on or before 31 March in the current tax year.

#### Information to support applications

15.  The application for hardship relief should set out the borrower's circumstances and clearly explain the reason for requesting hardship relief. The Commissioner may require the borrower to provide further information in support of their application.  
      
    
16.  Resident borrowers may use the IR40 "Statement of financial position" form as a guide for the information required on support of their application for hardship relief.  
      
    
17.  Overseas-based borrowers are required to apply for hardship relief in writing, providing full details of their financial situation, or by completing an IR219 "Student loan overseas-based repayment application" form.  
      
    
18.  The IR40 and IR219 forms are available on our website at www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides.

#### When relief is provided

##### _Refrain from collection_

19.  The Commissioner may refrain from issuing a notice of assessment or may write off any student loan repayment obligation payable by the borrower if the amount payable in any tax year is $20 or less.  
      
    
20.  The Commissioner may refrain from collecting a student loan repayment obligation of more than $20 and less than $334 if the due date for payment has passed. When the Commissioner refrains from collecting payment of a loan obligation, the unpaid amount is added back to the loan balance and attracts interest (if applicable).

##### _Remit a penalty_

21.  Late payment penalties are imposed if a borrower does not meet their student loan repayment obligations in full and on time. Those penalties compound monthly until the arrears are paid.  
      
    
22.  The Commissioner will consider an application for remission of late payment penalties once the initial arrears have been paid or at any time the borrower requests.  
      
    
23.  Late payment penalties may be remitted when a payment default was:
    *   beyond the control of the borrower or the borrower's agent; or
    *   the result of a genuine error; or
    *   in any other situation in which the Commissioner deems it equitable to do so.  
          
        
24.  When considering an application to remit a late payment penalty the Commissioner will take into account the borrower's previous compliance record, including whether they have paid their student loan repayment obligations as soon as practicable. The borrower's overall compliance history; including their other general tax and Child Support obligations (if applicable), will also be a factor in deciding whether or not to remit a late payment penalty.

##### _Reduce a repayment obligation_

25.  A borrower's student loan repayment obligation is the amount of their student loan repayable for a particular tax year. That student loan repayment obligation is generally calculated by taking the borrower's income (that exceeds the repayment threshold) and multiplying by the repayment percentage, to establish the amount of the student loan to be repaid for that tax year.  
      
    
26.  If the Commissioner grants serious hardship relief, or there are other special reasons that would make it fair and reasonable to reduce a borrower's student loan repayment obligation for a tax year, the following will occur:
    *   the borrower will be issued with a special repayment deduction rate certificate that varies the deduction rate for a current or future year to reflect a reduced repayment obligation. (The borrower will need to give the certificate to their employer so that the employer can deduct student loan repayment deductions at a reduced rate); or
    *   the percentage payable by the borrower (receiving income not subject to PAYE) will be reduced.
    *   the amount not collected, as a consequence of a reduction, will be added back to the loan balance.
    *   consideration will be given to a borrower who is overseas to see if they are entitled to a repayment holiday or an opt-out period, from their repayment obligations.

##### _Refund repayments for previous tax year_

27.  When payments by a borrower exceed their student loan repayment obligations, the overpayment will be offset against any other student loan amounts that are due but remain unpaid. Any remaining overpayment will then be offset against the borrower's loan balance.  
      
    
28.  Resident borrowers can request that an overpayment be refunded directly to them within six months from the date of issue of the Commissioner's notice of assessment advising of the overpayment. Overseas-based borrowers have two months to make a request.

#### Change of circumstances

29.  A borrower is are required to advise Inland Revenue of any change to their circumstances that is likely to mean that an earlier decision to provide hardship relief, or their ability to repay their loan obligations, will need to be reviewed.  
      
    
30.  Should a borrower's financial situation improve, they may make voluntary payments in addition to their amended student loan repayment obligation.

#### Year-end review

31.  The Commissioner may review any decision to provide hardship relief at the end of the tax year (31 March). Where the borrower's circumstances have materially changed, the Commissioner may review the hardship relief previously agreed too.

### Standard Practice

32.  A borrower should contact Inland Revenue at the earliest opportunity if they think repayment of their student loan will cause them serious hardship, or if there are other special reasons for making an application for financial relief.  
      
    
33.  Applications are generally not required by any specific time, although an application for anticipated hardship for future year's obligations must be received by Inland Revenue on or before 31 March in the current tax year.  
      
    
34.  An application will be considered on the basis of the borrower's current or future ability to meet their student loan repayment obligation. In considering an application the Commissioner will look at all options available to a borrower to enable them to meet their loan repayment obligations.  
      
    
35.  A resident borrower may make application in writing, by telephone, or other manner acceptable to the Commissioner. An overseas-based borrower is required to apply in writing or complete an IR219 "Student loan overseas-based repayment application" form.  
      
    
36.  A borrower will need to show why payment of their loan repayment obligation will cause them serious hardship, or show why they think relief should be given for some other special reason.  
      
    
37.  If the Commissioner is satisfied that payment of a repayment obligation will cause serious or significant financial hardship to a borrower, or is satisfied that there are special reasons that make it fair and reasonable to provide relief, the Commissioner may:
    *   refund[1](#ftn01)
         any amount that was deducted or paid that is more than the Commissioner considers a borrower is able to afford to pay without causing hardship; and/or
    *   reduce any amount that must be deducted or paid in order for the borrower to meet their adjusted repayment obligation.  
          
        
38.  The unpaid balance of the original student loan repayment obligation not recovered as a result of providing hardship relief, will be added back to the loan balance owing and will incur interest (if applicable).  
      
    
39.  When the Commissioner agrees to provide hardship relief the terms and details of the adjusted student loan repayment obligation and consequential matters (e.g. refunds, changed tax code for PAYE purposes) will be confirmed so that the borrower is advised of the impact on their student loan account for the relevant year.  
      
    
40.  A borrower who applies for hardship relief must advise the Commissioner, as soon as practicable, of any change in their circumstances that is likely to impact on information previously relied upon in deciding to grant hardship relief, or may impact on the borrower's ability to pay their student loan obligation.  
      
    
41.  The Commissioner may, at the end of a tax year, review any decision to grant hardship relief. If the Commissioner considers that the circumstances upon which the relief had been agreed to have materially changed, he may reinstate all or part of the repayment deduction or repayment obligation.

Compulsory deductions from bank accounts (WITHDRAWN)
====================================================

Statement SPS 11/04 sets out IR's practice on the use of deduction notices issued to banks requiring them to make deductions from their customers' accounts.

This item has been withdrawn and replaced by [SPS 21/01: Deduction notices](/standard-practice-statements/processing/sps-21-01)
.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No 5 (June 2011).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") sets out Inland Revenue’s practice on the use of statutory notices (referred to in this statement as "deduction notices") which are issued to banks requiring them to make deductions from their customers’ accounts.

### Application

2.  This SPS outlines the Commissioner's powers to require a bank to make deductions from amounts that are payable, or will be payable, to a taxpayer who has arrears. This statement applies to deduction notices issued to banks under the following enactments:
    *   Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA")
    *   Child Support Act 1991 ("the CSA")
    *   Gaming Duties Act 1971 ("the GDA")
    *   Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GSTA")
    *   Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 ("the SLSA").
3.  This SPS applies to deduction notices issued from 29th April 2011. It replaces SPS 09/01 published in TIB Vol. 21, No. 2 (April 2009), which is withdrawn with effect from the date of this SPS.

### Legislation

4.  The relevant sections which grant the Commissioner the power to issue a deduction notice are as follows:
    *   Section 157 of the TAA
    *   Section 151(2) of the CSA
    *   Section 154 of the CSA
    *   Section 12L of the GDA
    *   Section 43 of the GSTA
    *   Section 46 of the SLSA.

### Discussion

5.  A deduction notice is an important debt collection tool for Inland Revenue. The relevant legislative provisions grant the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("Commissioner") the power to require a third party to make deductions from amounts that are payable, or will   become payable by that third party, to a taxpayer who has tax arrears.
6.  Amounts payable includes all monies deposited with a bank to the credit of the taxpayer, including funds on term deposit even though that term may not be due to mature.
7.  Inland Revenue will not require deductions from a bank account that would put the taxpayer into, or further into, overdraft. Although if Inland Revenue issues a deduction notice for an account which is in credit and the taxpayer attempts to avoid complying with that notice by transferring funds from that account so that it will go into overdraft, then the deduction notice will take priority.
8.  The deduction notice may require deductions to be made by the way of lump sum or by instalments, and will require the bank to check their customer's account(s) and deduct any funds according to the notice. If no funds are available the bank is required to advise Inland Revenue.
9.  A deduction notice may require deductions to be made to cover daily interest. The interest starts on the date of the deduction notice and ends on the day on which the amount required to be deducted, has been deducted. If interest is to be calculated, the rate of interest will be advised in the deduction notice.
10.  The notice will continue to apply until a deduction is made by the bank in respect of a notice requiring deduction by lump sum, or in respect to an on-going notice, until the amount required pursuant to the notice has been deducted or the notice is either revoked or withdrawn by Inland Revenue.
11.  With recovery of funds under the TAA, GDA,GSTA and SLSA, deductions made by the bank are held in trust for the Crown until they are forwarded to Inland Revenue. If the deduction is not made by the bank, the amount required to be deducted is recoverable by Inland Revenue from the bank as if it were tax payable by that bank.
12.  Furthermore, Inland Revenue has the power to prosecute the bank for not complying with the terms of the deduction notice under section 157A of the TAA. 
13.  The bank does not however, incur liability in this manner if they fail to comply with a deduction notice for child support arrears under section 168(2) of the CSA.

### Standard Practice

#### Decision to issue a deduction notice

14.  The decision to take any debt collection action, including the use of a deduction notice, is made only after consideration of all relevant information, including any previous communication between the department and the taxpayer, the amount and the age of the arrears and any known hardship or hardship likely to be experienced by the taxpayer.
15.  Inland Revenue will not issue a deduction notice for tax arrears that are subject to an instalment arrangement between the taxpayer and the Commissioner, so long as the arrangement is being adhered to by the taxpayer.

#### One-off and on-going notices

16.  The deduction notice may require deductions to be made either in a lump sum (one-off notice) or by instalments (on-going notice).  The manner of the deduction will be specified in the notice. The bank is required to forward the deducted funds to Inland Revenue according to the date specified on the notice.

#### Account monitoring

17.  A deduction notice issued under the appropriate act may require deduction from amounts held on the date of the notice, or from amounts deposited after the date of the notice. Inland Revenue is able to require daily monitoring of accounts where it is considered necessary. If Inland Revenue does require daily monitoring this will be communicated to the bank at the time of issuing the deduction notice.
18.  Inland Revenue acknowledges that compliance with a deduction notice can result in a cost to the bank, especially if constant monitoring of their customers' account(s) is required.  In light of this, daily monitoring will only be requested where such monitoring is considered necessary.
19.  If daily monitoring is required, it will usually be for a maximum of 10 working days.  However, Inland Revenue reserves the right to require an account to be monitored over a longer period where that may be necessary. If a longer period of monitoring is required, this will be communicated at the time of issuing the deduction notice.

#### Deductions from joint bank accounts

20.  A deduction notice issued under the TAA, GDA, GSTA and SLSA can be placed on joint bank accounts when the money is able to be withdrawn from that account by the defaulting person without the signature or other authorisation of the other joint bank account holder(s).
21.  A deduction notice can only be placed on a partnership account in respect of the partnership's liability as a taxpayer under the relevant act. A partnership account is defined in section 157(12) of the TAA as a joint account that files a return of income under section 33(1) of the TAA. A deduction notice cannot be placed on a partnership bank account to satisfy a partner's personal tax liability.

#### _What is "other authorisation" for the purpose of account access?_

22.  The term "other authorisation" as used in the TAA, GDA, GSTA and SLSA[1](#01)
    , ensures that deduction notices can, and will be, applied to accounts which are accessed electronically. This ensures that any alternative methods of account authorisation are not excluded from the scope of deduction notices.

### Deductions for Child Support arrears

23.  Under section 154 of the CSA, the Commissioner is able to require banks to make deductions from money payable to a liable parent. Under section 155 of the CSA this deduction power extends to money held in joint bank accounts in the name of the liable parent and one or more other persons, when the liable parent can draw from that account without the signature of the other person(s). Overpayments made to payees may also be recovered in the same manner as liable parent debt under section 151(2) of the CSA.
24.  The absence of the term "other authorisation" in the CSA does not change the construction of the law. The Electronic Transactions Act 2002 achieves functional equivalence with regard to electronic and paper transactions and in setting up their banking arrangements, the taxpayer consents to the use of an electronic signature to authorise transactions. Therefore, the omission of the term "other authorisation" in the CSA does not exclude the ability to place a deduction notice on accounts based electronically.

### Deductions for Working for Families tax credits

25.  Section MF 5(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that both the primary caregiver and their partner or spouse throughout the income year to which the overpayment relates, are jointly and severally liable for any overpayment of Working for Families tax credits. The Commissioner may place a deduction notice on the bank accounts of the primary caregiver and/or their spouse for the income year, and any joint account held in the names of either the primary caregiver or the spouse for the income year.

### Term investments

26.  A deduction notice will apply to money that is held in a term investment whether or not that investment is due to mature.

### Prosecution

27.  If a bank fails to make the deductions required by the deduction notice, and there was an amount payable, or an amount became payable, Inland Revenue has the power to prosecute the bank for not complying with the terms of the deduction notice under section 157A of the TAA.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 29th April 2011.

Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (WITHDRAWN)
=======================================================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS 11/05 Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This item also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 23 Issue 09 (November 2011).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") sets out the Commissioner's rights and responsibilities with a taxpayer in respect of an adjustment to an assessment when the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process.
2.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").
3.  Where a taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner's practice is set out in SPS 11/06: _Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer._
4.  The Commissioner regards this SPS as a reference guide for taxpayers and Inland Revenue officers. Where possible, Inland Revenue officers must follow the practices outlined in this SPS.
5.  The disputes resolution process is designed to ensure that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process.
6.  The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an "all cards on the table" approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case proceeds to a court.
7.  One of the most significant changes introduced by the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011 is the amendment made to the exclusion rule in section 138G of the TAA. The effect of this change is that the Commissioner and the disputant are now only restricted to issues and propositions of law disclosed in their respective Statements of Position, in subsequent challenge proceedings. The Commissioner does not view this change as detracting from the desirability, as far as practicable, for both parties to a dispute to disclose all relevant facts and evidence as early as possible in order to resolve a dispute. For the purposes of this SPS, the Commissioner for convenience will refer to the new rule in section 138G as the "issues and propositions of law exclusion rule".
8.  In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N(1)(c)) must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment.

### Application

9.  This SPS applies from 13 October 2011 and incorporates legislative changes to the disputes process enacted in the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011.
10.  It replaces SPS 10/04: _Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ dated 8 November 2010.

### Background

11.  The tax disputes resolution procedures were introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the Richardson Committee in the _Report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department_ (April 1994) and were designed to reduce the number of disputes by:
    NaN.  promoting full disclosure, and
    NaN.  encouraging the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes, and
    NaN.  promoting the early identification of issues, and
    NaN.  improving the accuracy of decisions.
12.  The disputes resolution process ensures that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process.
13.  The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an "all cards on the table" approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure and encourage as far as practicable, the disclosure of all relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law before a case proceeds to a court or hearing authority.
14.  In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N(1)(c)) must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment.
15.  The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps specified in the TAA. The main elements of those steps are the issue of:
    NaN.  a notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA"): this is a notice that either the Commissioner or taxpayer issues to the other advising that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer's assessment, the Commissioner's assessment or other disputable decision (the prescribed form is the _Notice of proposed adjustment (IR770)_). A NOPA is the formal document which begins the disputes process
    NaN.  a notice of response ("NOR"): this must be issued by the recipient of a NOPA if they disagree with it (the preferred form is the _Notice of response (IR771)_);
    NaN.  a disclosure notice and statement of position ("SOP"): the issue of a disclosure notice and SOP by the Commissioner triggers the requirement for the taxpayer to provide a SOP to continue the dispute. Each SOP must provide an outline of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the positions taken. Each party must issue a SOP (the preferred form is the _Statement_ _of position (IR773)_). The SOPs are important documents because they limit the issues and propositions of law that either party can rely on if the case proceeds to court to what is included in the SOP (unless a hearing authority makes an order that allows a party to raise new issues and propositions of law under section 138G(2)).
16.  There are also two administrative phases in the disputes process: the conference and adjudication phases. If the dispute has not been already resolved after the NOR phase, the Commissioner's practice will be to hold a conference. A conference can be a formal or informal discussion between the parties to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues.
17.  If the dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase, the Commissioner will prepare a SOP and refer the dispute to adjudication, except in certain circumstances. One of the circumstances where the Commissioner will not refer a dispute to adjudication is where the Commissioner and the taxpayer have agreed in writing not to complete the disputes process (referred to as "opt out", see paragraphs 172 to 195).
18.  Adjudication involves an independent review of the dispute by Inland Revenue's Disputes Review Unit, which was formed to provide an internal but impartial review of unresolved disputes. Adjudication is the final phase in the disputes process before the taxpayer's assessment is amended (if it is to be amended) following the exchange of the SOPs.
19.  Timely progression of disputes through the disputes process may require the use of the Commissioner's information-gathering powers (particularly section 17) before and/or during the disputes process.
20.  Inland Revenue has a quality assurance review process known as Core Task Assurance ("CTA") which is designed to ensure that key pieces of work (including NOPAs and SOPs) are subject to an independent review by Legal and Technical Services ("LTS") before being issued. Given the importance of the disputes process to the Commissioner and to taxpayers, Inland Revenue officers are required to get CTA approval of disputes documents prior to issue.

### Summary of key actions and indicative administrative timeframes

22.  Set out below is a summary of the key actions and administrative timeframes where the disputes process is commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue
23.  These key actions and timeframes are intended to be administrative guidelines for Inland Revenue officers. Any failure to meet these administrative timeframes will not invalidate subsequent actions of the Commissioner or prevent the case from going through the disputes process.

### Standard Practice and Analysis

#### Notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA)

#### The commissioner must issue a NOPA before making an assessment

24.  The Commissioner must issue a NOPA before making an assessment (including an assessment of shortfall penalties but excluding other civil penalties and interest), unless an exception to the requirement that a NOPA be issued applies under section 89C. For a detailed discussion of these exceptions see Appendix 1.
25.  Nevertheless, even if the Commissioner, in a very unlikely event, made an assessment in breach of section 89C, the assessment would be regarded as being valid under section 114(a).
26.  Each exception under section 89C can apply independently or together depending on the circumstances. However, the Commissioner can also choose to issue a NOPA before making an assessment notwithstanding that an exception under section 89C applies.

##### A disputable decision

27.  Pursuant to the definition in section 3(1), a disputable decision is:
    NaN.  an assessment, or
    NaN.  a decision that the Commissioner makes under a tax law, except for a decision:
        NaN.  to decline to issue a binding ruling, or
        NaN.  that cannot be the subject of an objection or challenge, or
        NaN.  that is left to the Commissioner's discretion under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8), (10) and 89N(3).
28.  The Commissioner will generally issue a NOPA before issuing an assessment that takes into account a disputable decision.
29.  For example, the Commissioner issues a notice of disputable decision to a taxpayer who is a director and shareholder of a company advising that the company's loss attributing qualifying company election for the 2007 tax year is invalid because it is received late. However, the company's loss calculation and assessment for the 2007 tax year are not affected.The Commissioner intends to issue an assessment to the taxpayer that takes into account the notice of disputable decision by disallowing the company's losses that the taxpayer has claimed.The Commissioner will issue a NOPA to the taxpayer before making the assessment.

#### A Taxpayer can dispute an assessment that is issued without A NOPA

30.  The Commissioner can issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA under section 89C in the circumstances outlined above. Although the Commissioner must always endeavour to apply the exceptions under section 89C correctly, any assessment made in breach of section 89C will still be treated as valid under section 114(a).
31.  Where the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can dispute the assessment through the disputes process under section 89D(1). (See SPS 11/06: _Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer_ or any replacement SPS)
32.  However, where the Commissioner issues a NOPA to a taxpayer and they accept the proposed adjustment by written agreement or are deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment, then section 89I(1) precludes the taxpayer from challenging the assessment.
33.  However, section 89I cannot apply if the Commissioner and taxpayer have agreed on an adjustment before entering into the disputes process. The parties can dispute the amended assessment, notwithstanding the previous agreement.

### When the Commissioner can issue a NOPA

34.  Section 89B specifies when the Commissioner can issue a NOPA.
35.  Under section 89B(1) the Commissioner can issue one NOPA for multiple issues, tax types and periods. Alternatively, the Commissioner can issue multiple NOPAs for the same issue and period, consistent with the obligation to correctly make an assessment within the four-year statutory time period.
36.  An investigation will have been substantially completed, the facts ascertained, and the proposed adjustment identified and discussed with the taxpayer before a formal NOPA is issued. The Commissioner may actively use his powers to require production of documents in order to ensure that a sustainable position can be taken in the NOPA. The NOPA will also have been quality checked by Legal and Technical Services.
37.  A NOPA is not an assessment. It is an initiating action that allows open and full communication between the parties. If possible, the taxpayer will be given the opportunity to settle a dispute by entering into an agreed adjustment with Inland Revenue before the Commissioner issues a NOPA.
38.  However, the Commissioner or taxpayer is not precluded from issuing a NOPA in respect of any amended assessment that the Commissioner has previously issued to reflect the agreed adjustment.
39.  A NOPA forms a basis for ensuring that the Commissioner does not issue an assessment without some formal and structured dialogue with the taxpayer in respect of the grounds upon which the Commissioner will issue any assessment or amended assessment (_McIlraith v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,456).
40.  Once an investigation has commenced, the intended approach must be discussed with the taxpayer. If the Commissioner decides to issue a NOPA, the responsible officer will endeavour to advise the taxpayer at least five working days before the date that the NOPA is issued. This is to allow the taxpayer time to consider their position and/or seek advice. However, the taxpayer can also be advised earlier.
41.  The Commissioner will endeavour to ensure that any issues relating to the same period and tax type are kept together in the dispute.
42.  The Commissioner can also exercise certain statutory powers (for example, issuing a section 17 notice) after a dispute has commenced and will continue to investigate the facts that relate to the dispute.
43.  If the parties agree upon some and dispute other proposed adjustments for the same tax period and type, the Commissioner cannot issue an assessment that reflects any agreed adjustment already accepted under section 89J(1) until all the remaining disputed issues are resolved (even if the Commissioner does not pursue the disputed issue further) or determined by the Disputes Review Unit.That is, the Commissioner will not issue a partial" or interim" assessment under section 89J(1) if the Commissioner is not satisfied that the assessment is correct.
44.  However, where the statutory time bar is about to fall due, the Commissioner can issue an assessment to reflect both the agreed and disputed adjustment, provided that the requirements of section 89N are met.(See paragraphs 98 to 99 for further discussion.)
45.  Where it is practicable, Inland Revenue officers will contact the taxpayer or their tax agent within 10 working days after the NOPA is issued to ensure that it has been received. Inland Revenue officers making written contact should comply with section 14.

##### Exceptions to the statutory time bar

_Time bar waivers_

46.  If it is contemplated that the disputes process cannot be completed before the statutory time bar period for amending an assessment commences, the parties can agree in writing pursuant to section 108B(1)(a) to waive the time bar by up to 12 months to enable the full disputes process to be applied.
47.  The taxpayer can also give written notice to the Commissioner and waive the time bar for a further six months after the end of the 12-month period under section 108B(1)(b) to allow sufficient time for the dispute to progress through the adjudication process. This notice must be given to the Commissioner within the initial 12-month period.
48.  A statutory time bar waiver must be agreed in writing on the prescribed form (_Notice of waiver of time bar (IR 775)_) and delivered to the Commissioner before the relevant four-year period expires.
49.  The statutory time bar waiver only applies to those issues that the parties have identified and understood before the initial statutory time bar. Other issues not so identified will still be subject to the original statutory time bar, unless section 108(2) or 108A(3) applies.(See paragraph 55.)

_The Commissioner's application to the High Court under section 89N(3)_

50.  If a NOPA has been issued and the disputes process cannot be completed before the statutory time bar period expires, the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for more time to complete the process. (See the discussion regarding section 89N(3) in paragraphs 28 to 39 of Appendix 1 of this SPS.)
51.  However, where the Disputes Review Unit has insufficient time (that is, before the statutory time bar arises or further time allowed under section 108B(1) to fully consider a matter submitted to it expires) the matter will be returned to the responsible officer to decide whether to issue an assessment or amended assessment or to accept the taxpayer's position. Section 89N(2)(b) allows the Commissioner to amend an assessment at any time after the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP in relation to the particular period. (See paragraphs 228 to 230 for further discussion.)

_Exceptions under section 89N_

52.  When a NOPA has been issued, the Commissioner will follow the disputes process unless an exception under section 89N applies. The application of section 89N is discussed in detail in Appendix 1. The Commissioner must obtain and document administrative approval for any departure from the full disputes process.

##### Limitations on the Commissioner issuing a NOPA

53.  Under section 89B(4), the Commissioner cannot issue a NOPA:
    NaN.  if the proposed adjustment is the subject of challenge proceedings, or
    NaN.  after the statutory time bar has expired.
54.  The time bar that arises under sections 108 and 108A prevents the Commissioner from issuing an assessment that increases the amount assessed. The Commissioner can still issue an assessment that decreases the amount of the initial assessment subject to the limitation on refunding overpaid tax under sections RM 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007") and 45(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.
55.  However, the Commissioner is not subject to the statutory time bar that arises under sections 108 and 108A, if the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has:
    NaN.  provided a fraudulent or wilfully misleading tax return (section 108(2)(a)), or
    NaN.  omitted income for which a tax return must be provided that is of a particular nature or source (section 108(2)(b)), or
    NaN.  knowingly or fraudulently failed to make a full and true disclosure of the material facts necessary to determine their GST payable (section 108A(3)).
56.  Furthermore, the Commissioner is not subject to the statutory time bar that arises under section 108 if a taxpayer has a remaining tax credit to which section LA 6(1) of the ITA 2007 applies and the Commissioner seeks to amend an assessment or determination to give effect to section LA 6(3) of the ITA 2007 (section 108(3B)).
57.  When considering whether the exception under section 108(2)(b) applies, the Commissioner will disregard omissions of relatively small amounts of income by applying the principle of _de minimis non curat lex_ (_Babington v C of IR_ \[1957\] NZLR 861).
58.  The Commissioner accepts that the time bar ensures finality in relation to assessments, is a key protection for most taxpayers and the exclusions from its protection must be only invoked where there is an adequate basis in fact and law to support their operation. Section 89B(4)(b) requires that the Commissioner initially decides whether an exception to the time bar applies, for example, whether a tax return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading, before determining whether a NOPA can be issued under section 89B(1).
59.  Any opinion that the Commissioner forms regarding the application of the exceptions to the time bar must be honestly held and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the evidence available and the relevant law. The decision must be clearly documented and include reference to the grounds and reasoning on which it is based.
60.  Any decision to examine a particular period (which would otherwise be time barred) on the basis that section 108(2)(a)-(b) or section 108A(3) may apply, is not, in itself, a disputable decision. Nor is any decision that is made under section 108A, in itself, a disputable decision.
61.  Any NOPA where the CIR is proposing an adjustment on the basis that the exception to the time bar in either section 108(2)(a) - (b) or section 108A(3) applies will set out the reasons why the CIR does not consider that the time bar applies.
62.  The Commissioner is generally limited to a four-year period within which a taxpayer's assessment can be increased following an investigation or in certain other circumstances. In respect of a dispute, the assessment is amended (if necessary) after the disputes process is completed. The Commissioner will endeavour to undertake the various steps involved in the process within the four-year period.
63.  Section 89B(4)(a) applies to individual proposed adjustments. Where the proposed adjustment is the subject of court proceedings, the Commissioner cannot issue a NOPA in respect of those proposed adjustments. However, the Commissioner can issue a separate NOPA to the taxpayer in relation to the same tax period provided it relates to a different adjustment.
64.  For example, a taxpayer challenges the deductibility of feasibility expenditure in the 2009 tax year pursuant to section 138B. The Commissioner can also issue a NOPA to the same taxpayer in relation to the tax treatment of a bad debt in the same tax year.

#### Contents of the Commissioner's NOPA

65.  A NOPA is the document that commences the disputes process. It is intended to identify the points of contention and explain the legal or technical aspects of the issuer's position in relation to the proposed adjustment in a formal and understandable manner. This will ensure that information relevant to the dispute is quickly made available to the parties. Section 89F(1) and (2) specifies the content requirements for any NOPA that the Commissioner may issue.
66.  Under section 89F(1)(b), the NOPA must be in the prescribed form (_Notice of proposed adjustment (IR770)_). Any NOPA that the Commissioner issues must identify in sufficient detail the adjustment proposed and explain concisely the facts and law that relate to the adjustment and how the law applies to the facts. When preparing a NOPA the Commissioner will endeavour to avoid repeating facts, arguments or using unnecessary detail.
67.  Section 89F(2)(b) requires that the NOPA states the key facts and law concisely and in sufficient detail. The Commissioner must ensure that the document is relatively brief and simple to enable the parties to quickly progress the dispute without incurring substantial expenses or excessive preparation time but also detailed enough to explain all the issues relevant to the dispute. The Commissioner's NOPAs should be concise, accurate, coherent and logically presented. In preparing a NOPA Inland Revenue officers should avoid unnecessarily using legalistic language.
68.  The Commissioner should identify (but not reproduce in full) the relevant legislation and legal principles derived from leading cases. These references should be in sufficient detail to clarify the grounds for the proposed adjustment. However, lengthy quotations from cases should be avoided.
69.  The Commissioner has a statutory obligation to inform a taxpayer adequately, but it is recognised that the matters relevant to the dispute will be set out in greater detail at the SOP phase if the dispute is not resolved.
70.  Therefore, what is included in a NOPA or NOR is not conclusive as between the parties because they can introduce further grounds or information or adjust the quantum of the proposed adjustments later in the disputes process (_CIR v Zentrum Holdings Limited_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,912). However, the parties cannot propose another adjustment involving new grounds and a fresh liability at the SOP phase.
71.  The Commissioner must always endeavour to issue a NOPA that has sufficient details, is of a high standard and has been considered by Legal and Technical Services. The Commissioner must endeavour to advise the taxpayer during the conference phase of any new grounds, information or reduction in quantum that will be introduced in the SOP.
72.  If the Commissioner decides to increase the quantum of any proposed adjustment after the NOPA is issued the Commissioner must issue a new NOPA to the taxpayer.
73.  Although candid and complete exchanges of information are implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes process, the Commissioner's practice will be to ensure that the NOPA is, within those limits, as brief as practicable.
74.  The content of any NOPA that the Commissioner issues must satisfy all the requirements specified in section 89F(2)(a) to (c).

#### Identify adjustments or proposed adjustments - section 89F(2)(a)

75.  The Commissioner must consider in respect of each proposed adjustment:
    NaN.  the income amount or impact of the adjustment, and
    NaN.  the tax year or period to which the proposed adjustment relates, and
    NaN.  whether use-of-money interest will apply.
76.  The Commissioner will also consider whether shortfall penalties and/or other appropriate penalties of lesser percentages apply. That is, where sufficient evidence is held to support the imposition of the penalties and this can be justified (by reference to any relevant guidelines.)

_Shortfall penalties_

77.  Shortfall penalties are separate items of adjustment that must be explained and supported in the same manner as the underlying tax shortfall. Section 94A(2) also requires that shortfall penalties must be assessed the same way as the underlying tax. Even though assessments of shortfall penalties relate to the underlying tax they are not subject to the time bars that arise under section 108 or 108A.

78.  Where there is sufficient evidence to suggest that shortfall penalties should be imposed, the relevant Inland Revenue officer must ensure that the shortfall penalties are proposed in the same NOPA as the substantive issues. However, the officer can dispense with this practice if any of the following exceptions apply:
    NaN.  The evidence supporting the imposition of shortfall penalties does not become available until after the Commissioner has issued the NOPA on the substantive issues. In such circumstances, a separate NOPA may be issued in respect of the shortfall penalties at a later stage.
    NaN.  Before entering into the disputes process, a taxpayer has accepted the proposed adjustment in relation to the substantive issues, but not accepted the imposition of the shortfall penalties. In this circumstance, the Commissioner may still issue a NOPA to the taxpayer for the proposed penalties.
    NaN.  The taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure of the substantive issues to the Commissioner and the only disputed issue relates to the imposition of the shortfall penalties.
    NaN.  Prosecution action is being considered and shortfall penalties also apply because the taxpayer has committed one of the culpable acts (for example, evasion), in most instances the Commissioner must first complete any prosecution action against the taxpayer before the shortfall penalties can be imposed.
79.  Pursuant to section 149(5), if shortfall penalties have been imposed the Commissioner cannot subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position unless the shortfall penalties are imposed under section 141ED. Therefore, the Commissioner may omit proposing shortfall penalties in a NOPA if prosecution is being considered as an option. The Commissioner must issue a new NOPA in respect of any shortfall penalties that are to be imposed after the prosecution.
80.  Furthermore, the Commissioner cannot propose shortfall penalties at the SOP phase if they were not previously proposed in a Commissioner's NOPA.

##### State the facts and law - section 89F(2)(b)

_Facts_

81.  To provide a concise statement of facts, the Commissioner must focus on the material factual matters relevant to the legal issues. This includes, for each proposed adjustment, the facts relevant to proving all arguments made in support of the adjustment including any facts that are inconsistent with any arguments that the taxpayer has previously raised.
82.  The Commissioner should endeavour to state all the material facts in brief, so as to avoid irrelevant detail or repetition. For example, where the parties both know the background to the disputed issues, a summary of the facts in the NOPA will suffice. Where possible, the Commissioner will refer to and/or append any documents that have previously set out the facts on which the Commissioner relies.
83.  Although the Commissioner will make every attempt to be concise in the NOPA, the Commissioner considers that the explanation of the material facts should be relative to the complexity of the issues.

_Law_

84.  Under section 89F(2)(b) the Commissioner must state the law concisely by including an outline of the relevant legislative provisions and principles derived from leading cases that affect the proposed adjustment.
85.  It is sufficient that the Commissioner explains the nature of the legal arguments without providing lengthy quotations from the relevant case law.

##### How the law applies to the facts - section 89F(2)(c)

86.  The Commissioner must apply the legal arguments to the facts to ensure that the proposed adjustment is not a statement that appears out of context. The application of the law to the facts must be stated concisely and logically support the proposed adjustment.
87.  The Commissioner must outline all relevant materials and arguments (including alternative arguments) on which the Commissioner
88.  The issues and propositions of law exclusion rule under section 138G(1) does not apply to the issues and propositions of law that are raised in the Commissioner's NOPA. That is, the Commissioner is not restricted to raising the same issues and propositions of law that are specified in the NOPA at the SOP phase or in challenge proceedings that the taxpayer has commenced where a disclosure notice has not been issued.

##### Size and length of Commissioner's NOPAs

_General guidelines_

89.  The length of a Commissioner's NOPA will necessarily vary from case to case. The **maximum length** of a Commissioner's NOPA is administratively capped at 30 pages. The 30-page limit excludes any discussion on shortfall penalties (if included in the same Commissioner's NOPA as the substantive issues), the last page of instructions on What to do next", and schedules that show complicated calculations and diagrams. The application of the 30-page limit is subject to the following further restrictions:
    NaN.  For disputes involving less than $5,000 of tax (excluding evasion and tax avoidance issues), the Commissioner's NOPA should not exceed five pages.
    NaN.  Where the dispute concerns one issue only (for example, the imposition of shortfall penalties), the Commissioner's NOPA should not exceed 10 pages.
90.  A longer Commissioner's NOPA may be appropriate, where the dispute concerns multiple issues or the issue is very complex and involves a substantial amount of tax
91.  The Commissioner will strive to keep NOPAs as short as possible, but this will be balanced with the need to achieve the objective of issuing the NOPA (ie, sufficiently communicating to the recipient the proposed adjustments and the reasons for them). Inland Revenue officers are required to get approval before a Commissioner's NOPA can exceed the 30-page limit.
92.  Wherever practicable, all adjustments proposed for a particular taxpayer should be included in one NOPA. However, where new issues arise during the disputes process, the Commissioner is not precluded from commencing separate disputes for these new issues. If the parties are still in dispute after the conference phase, the proposed adjustments in multiple NOPAs may, subject to the taxpayer's agreement, be combined into one SOP. Combining multiple issues into one dispute has the benefit of reducing compliance costs and should reduce the time taken in the disputes process.

#### Timeframes to complete the disputes process

93.  If the Commissioner has commenced the disputes process by issuing a NOPA and the dispute remains unresolved, where practicable, the responsible officer must negotiate a timeframe with the taxpayer to ensure that the dispute is progressed in a timely and efficient way.
94.  Although not statutorily required, agreeing to a timeframe is a critical administrative requirement that requires both parties to be ready to progress the dispute in a timely manner.The parties should endeavour to meet the agreed timeframe. Where there are delays in the progress of the dispute the responsible officer will manage the delay including any relationship with internal advisers and liaise with the taxpayer.
95.  If the negotiated timeframe cannot be achieved, the responsible officer will enter into a continuing discussion with the taxpayer to either arrange a new timeframe or otherwise keep them advised of when the disclosure notice and SOP will be issued. This is consistent with the purpose of the disputes process which is to promote the prompt and efficient resolution of disputes. Therefore, the failure to negotiate or adhere to an agreed timeframe will not prevent a case from progressing through the disputes process in a timely manner.
96.  In addition to the above administrative practice, the Commissioner is bound by section 89N(2). Under that provision, if a NOPA has been issued and the parties cannot agree on the proposed adjustment, the Commissioner cannot amend an assessment without completing the disputes process unless any of the exceptions in section 89N apply. These exceptions are as follows:
    1.  In the course of the dispute, the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(i)).
    2.  A taxpayer involved in a dispute, or person associated to them, may take steps to shift, relocate or dispose of the taxpayer's assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax, making the issue of an assessment urgent (section 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii)).
    3.  The taxpayer involved in a dispute or a person associated with them involved in another dispute involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v)).
    4.  The taxpayer fails to comply with a statutory requirement for information relating to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(vi)).
    5.  The parties agree in writing that the dispute should be resolved by the court or TRA without completing the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(viii)).
    6.  The parties agree in writing to suspend the disputes process pending the outcome of a test case (section 89N(1)(c)(ix)).
    7.  The Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to allow more time to complete or dispense with the disputes process (section 89N(3)).
97.  These exceptions are explained in further detail in Appendix 2 to this SPS. If any of these exceptions apply the disputes process will end and the dispute will not go through the adjudication phase.

##### Application of the exceptions in section 89N

98.  The Commissioner's practice is that the parties should endeavour to resolve the dispute as early as possible and this should be a focus at all times throughout the stages of the disputes process.If this is not possible and any of the exceptions in section 89N apply, the Commissioner can amend an assessment without completing the whole disputes process, that is, before the parties accept a NOPA, NOR or SOP that the other has issued, or the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP. This will conclude the disputes process and the dispute will not go through the adjudication phase.
99.  In this circumstance, the taxpayer can challenge the Commissioner's assessment by filing proceedings in the TRA or the High Court within the applicable response period, that is, within two months starting on the date that the notice of assessment is issued.

#### Notice of response (NOR)

#### Taxpayer's response to the commissioner's NOPA: NOR

100.  If a taxpayer disagrees with the Commissioner's proposed adjustment, then, under section 89G(1), they must advise the Commissioner that any or all of the proposed adjustments are rejected by issuing a NOR within the two-month response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner's NOPA is issued. The Commissioner interprets this as requiring Inland Revenue's receipt of the NOR within the response period.
101.  For example, if a NOPA is issued on 9 April 2010, the taxpayer must advise the Commissioner that it is rejected by issuing a NOR to the Commissioner for receipt on or before 8 June 2010. However, taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOR to the Commissioner once they have completed it.
102.  If a taxpayer has not responded to a NOPA issued by the Commissioner reasonable efforts will be made to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period expires to ascertain whether the taxpayer will issue a NOR. Such contact may be made by telephone or letter.
103.  Section 89G(2) specifies the content requirements of a NOR. ;The taxpayer must state concisely in the NOR:
    NaN.  the facts or legal arguments in the Commissioner's NOPA that they consider are wrong, and
    NaN.  why they consider that those facts and arguments are wrong, and
    NaN.  any facts and legal arguments that they rely upon, and
    NaN.  how the legal arguments apply to the facts, and
    NaN.  the quantitative adjustments to any figure proposed in the Commissioner's NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments that the taxpayer relies upon.
104.  In respect of the requirement under section 89G(2)(c) that the taxpayer specifies the facts and legal arguments upon which they are relying, the taxpayer can also refer to legislative provisions, case law and any legal arguments that are raised in the Commissioner's NOPA. The taxpayer does not have to refer to different legislative provisions, case law and legal arguments.
105.  Pursuant to section 89G(2)(e), the requirement for a quantitative adjustment establishes to what extent the taxpayer considers that the Commissioner's adjustment in the NOPA is incorrect. This amount need not be exact, however, every attempt should be made to ensure that it is as accurate as possible. The amount in dispute can be altered, as the dispute progresses irrespective of whether the parties have agreed on the new figure.

#### Deemed acceptance

106.  Under section 89H(1), if the taxpayer:
    NaN.  has not issued a NOR within the two-month response period, and
    NaN.  the Commissioner does not accept a late NOR in terms of section 89K,  
        the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the adjustment that is proposed in the Commissioner's NOPA and section 89I applies. The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer that the deemed acceptance has occurred within two weeks after the two-month response period expires.
107.  Pursuant to section 89I(2), the Commissioner must include or take into account each proposed adjustment that the taxpayer accepts or is deemed to accept in a notice of assessment issued to the taxpayer.

##### Section 89K: the circumstances where the Commissioner may accept late rejections, proposed adjustments or statements of position

_Exceptional circumstances_

108.  The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. The cases regarding "exceptional circumstances", such as _Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752, _Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005, _Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR_ (2001) 17,470 (CA), _Hollis v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,570 and _Balich v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,230, are also relevant.
109.  Section 89K(3) reads:
    *   1.  an exceptional circumstance arises if-
            1.  an event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not rejecting a proposed adjustment, or for not issuing a notice of proposed adjustment or statement of position, within the response period for the notice:
            2.  a disputant is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period:
        2.  an act or omission of an agent of a disputant is not an exceptional circumstance unless -
            1.  it was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that could not have been anticipated, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or
            2.  the agent is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period.

110.  The case law confirms that the definition of exceptional circumstances" in sections 89K(3) and 138D should be applied consistently. The following guidelines have emerged from the case law:
    NaN.  a taxpayer's misunderstanding or erroneous calculation of the applicable response period will usually not be regarded as an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control under section 89K(3)(a),
    NaN.  an agent's failure to advise their client that they have received a notice of assessment or other relevant document that causes the taxpayer to respond outside the applicable response period will not generally be considered to be an exceptional circumstance under section 89K(3)(b) (_Hollis v CIR_), and
    NaN.  an exceptional circumstance can arise if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information regarding the applicable response period given to them by the Commissioner that has caused them to respond outside that response period (_Hollis v CIR_).

111.  See _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996) for some examples of situations that can be an exceptional circumstance" beyond a taxpayer's control.
112.  The exception for lateness arising because of statutory holidays is self-explanatory. The Commissioner can also accept a late NOR where the lateness is minimal, that is, the document was only one to two days late and the other factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion under section 89K(1) are satisfied. (See discussion in paragraph 114.)
113.  For example, the response period ends on Saturday and the taxpayer provides a NOR on the following Tuesday. The Commissioner treats the response period as ending on Monday on the basis of section 35(6) of the Interpretation Act 1999 and accepts that the lateness of the NOR was minimal. That is, the Commissioner has received the NOR within one to two days of Monday, the last day of the response period. If the response period ended on Friday and the taxpayer provided the NOR on the following Monday, the Commissioner would also accept that the lateness is minimal.

114.  Besides the degree of lateness, the Commissioner considers that the exercise of the discretion under section 89K(1) requires that the following factors are also taken into account:
    NaN.  the date on which the NOR was issued, and
    NaN.  the response period within which the NOR should be issued, and
    NaN.  the real event, circumstance or reason why the taxpayer failed to issue the NOR within the response period, and
    NaN.  the taxpayer's compliance history in relation to the tax types under consideration (for example, has the taxpayer paid tax or filed a tax return or NOR late in the past?).

115.  For example, a taxpayer issues a NOR to the Commissioner two days after the applicable response period has expired. The taxpayer does not provide a legitimate reason for the lateness. The taxpayer also has a history of filing late NORs within the minimal allowable lateness period (that is, up to two days outside the applicable response period) and has been advised on the calculation of the response period on more than one occasion.
116.  Although the degree of lateness was minimal on each occasion, the Commissioner would not accept that exceptional circumstances exist in this circumstance. This ensures that the exception is not treated as an extension of the response period in all circumstances.
117.  The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer's application made under section 89K(1)(b) after receiving the relevant NOR or SOP. Where the application is rejected, the Commissioner is required to issue a refusal notice" within one month of receipt of the application (which must include the late notice or SOP). The disputant may challenge the Commissioner's refusal notice in the Taxation Review Authority. If the taxpayer's application is accepted that decision will be communicated in writing to the taxpayer within one month of receipt of the application.
118.  The taxpayer must provide reasons to support their claim that exceptional circumstances exist under section 89K(3). The taxpayer should address the factors referred to in paragraph 114. If the reasons provided are unclear, further information may be requested, giving the taxpayer an opportunity to provide that information before determining whether section 89K applies.
119.  If the Commissioner rejects a taxpayer's application made under section 89K to treat a NOR or SOP as made within the response period, the taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment made in the Commissioner's NOPA.

_Demonstrable intention_

120.  Under section 89K(1)(a)(ii) the Commissioner can also treat a late rejection of the Commissioner's NOPA by a disputant, as being in time where the disputant had a demonstrable intention to enter into or continue the disputes process at the time the disputant failed to act within the applicable response period.
121.  The concept of intention to dispute" reflects the court's consideration of when a dispute should be allowed to continue under the old objection regime in Part 8 of the TAA, in particular, the High Court decision in _Gisborne Mills Ltd v CIR_ (1989) 13 TRNZ 405. Robertson J, in _Gisborne Mills_, held that a factor to be taken into account in determining whether the disputant was entitled to continue with their dispute was that they had consistently asserted that they were entitled to the \[tax outcome they were seeking\]". This was in marked distinction to a person who, never having contemplated seeking a benefit under the taxing legislation, endeavours to take advantage of a matter when they become aware of a decision affecting another taxpayer".
122.  The officials' issues paper, _Disputes: a review_ (July 2010), in relation to an intention to dispute test", noted:
    *   The central tenet of any test should be that the taxpayer demonstrates they have, before the deadline, clearly communicated an intention to formally dispute the matter on certain grounds and have not subsequently modified that position.
123.  To support this general proposition Inland Revenue will consider the following further factors in reaching a view as to whether a taxpayer had a demonstrable intention to dispute:
    *   whether the taxpayer has responded to any Inland Revenue correspondence and has consistently asserted their contrary position regarding the substantive issues;
    *   whether the taxpayer has complied with other parts of the disputes process and their overall tax obligations (for example, if the late document in question is the taxpayer's SOP, have they filed a timely NOR);
    *   whether the taxpayer has corresponded with other relevant parties regarding the dispute, for example, the Minister of Revenue, the Ombudsman or Inland Revenue's Complaints Management Service.

124.  In a dispute where the taxpayer or their agent has not filed a SOP because they have miscalculated the response period (and the degree of lateness does not amount to exceptional circumstances), it could be said that having participated in the earlier stages of the disputes process (including complying with timeframes) that, at the end of the response period, the disputant had a genuine intention to continue with the dispute.
125.  An application will not be accepted if the degree of lateness is unjustified in the circumstances, or it is considered to be designed to defeat the application of the time period or to frustrate the disputes process itself. An example might be a taxpayer who contacts the Commissioner close to a deadline to confirm they intend to dispute, but then does nothing further for some considerable time, effectively rendering the statutory timeframe meaningless.

_Disputant may challenge Commissioner's refusal to accept rejection, NOPA or SOP_

126.  The Commissioner can accept a disputant's late rejection, NOPA or SOP by issuing a notice in favour of the disputant stating that the late rejection, NOPA or SOP will be treated as being given within the applicable response period. On the other hand, where they are not accepted as being on time, the Commissioner must notify the disputant within one month from when the disputant issues a late" notice or statement of position to the Commissioner, of the Commissioner's decision (refusal notice"). The disputant may challenge the Commissioner's refusal notice by filing proceedings with the TRA.

#### Receipt of a taxpayer's NOR

127.  When Inland Revenue receives a taxpayer's NOR, it will usually be forwarded to the responsible officer within five working days.Upon receipt, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following:
    NaN.  the date on which the NOR was issued, and
    NaN.  whether the NOR has been issued within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner's NOPA is issued, and
    NaN.  the salient features of the NOR including any deficiencies in its content.
128.  Where it is practicable, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent by telephone or in writing within 10 working days the NOR has been received.
129.  The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer or their tax agent within one month after receiving the NOR whether it is being considered or has been accepted, rejected in full or in part.
130.  If the NOR is accepted in full, the Commissioner will usually confirm (in writing) that the NOR has been accepted in full and, if applicable, a notice of assessment will be issued within one month.
131.  If the Commissioner must investigate further before deciding to accept or reject a NOR, the responsible officer will regularly update the taxpayer or their agent on the progress of the further analysis or enquiry work that is undertaken.

#### Deficiencies in the content of the NOR

132.  Where Inland Revenue has received a NOR that it considers is deficient (that is, the requirements under section 89G(2) may not be met), where it is possible the responsible Inland Revenue officer will take reasonable steps to have the taxpayer correct the information in the NOR before the response period expires.
133.  The taxpayer will be advised as soon as practicable that the Commissioner considers that the NOR may not meet the requirements of section 89G(2) and why. They will also be advised that any additional or corrected information should be provided within the response period.
134.  Taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOR immediately after they have completed it because they could have insufficient time to rectify any deficiencies if the response period is due to expire.
135.  Generally where the deficiencies are not able to be remedied but the NOR advances sufficient argument to allow the dispute to progress, then the Commissioner will continue with the dispute. The Commissioner's argument that the NOR is deficient will be incorporated into the Commissioner's SOP which will also fully argue the substantive issue.
136.  However, if the NOR received is highly unsatisfactory the Commissioner is unlikely to continue with the dispute. This will be on the grounds that the NOR does not satisfy the requirements set out in section 89G(2).
137.  A NOR is likely to be considered highly unsatisfactory only where the taxpayer's position is materially inconsistent and not capable of coherent explanation, or there is no observable explanation at all of the taxpayer's grounds for dispute. In these situations the taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment under section 89H(1), unless section 89K applies.
138.  In considering the adequacy of the taxpayer's NOR, the Commissioner's view will not be based on the strength or weakness of the taxpayer's argument. The Commissioner will only be concerned with whether the NOR meets its statutory requirements.
139.  The approach outlined above is consistent with that taken by the Court of Appeal in _CIR v Alam and Begum_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,564.

#### Conference phase

##### What is the conference phase of the disputes process?

140.  The conference phase of the disputes process allows the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute to exchange material information relating to the dispute (if this has not already been done prior to the conference phase). More importantly it is an opportunity for the parties to the dispute to try to resolve the differences in their understanding of facts, laws and legal arguments.
141.  The word resolve" in this context is not limited to final resolution of the dispute. Settlement is a possibility but this is not the only objective of the conference phase. The parties may resolve" part of the dispute by agreeing on some of the facts and clarifying some of the legal arguments, while agreeing to disagree on other matters, which will become the focus in the later phases of the disputes process.
142.  Generally, if a dispute remains unresolved after the NOR phase, the conference phase will follow. However, the Commissioner will have fully considered the taxpayer's NOR, including any new records, documents and information mentioned in that document, before determining that the dispute remains unresolved.
143.  The conference phase is an administrative process that aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the dispute. However, the conference phase should not be used by either party for the purpose of delaying the completion of the disputes process. The conference phase can involve more than one meeting between the parties and it is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting.

##### Legal and other advisers attending a conference

144.  If a dispute is not settled earlier, the parties can obtain expert legal or other advice during the conference phase in addition to advice previously obtained. These advisers can attend any meetings in relation to the dispute.

##### Conference facilitation

145.  Conference facilitation is a new feature in the conference phase. A facilitated conference will involve an independent internal facilitator who will promote and encourage structured discussion between Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer on an informed basis and with the _bona fide_ intention of resolving the dispute. The conference facilitator will be a senior Inland Revenue officer who will not have been involved in the dispute or given advice on the dispute prior to the conference phase. The facilitator will have sufficient technical knowledge to understand and lead the conference meeting.
146.  The conference facilitator will not be responsible for making any decision in relation to the dispute, except for determining when the conference phase has come to an end. In particular, it is not the role of the facilitator to undertake settlement of the dispute. If this possibility arises it is the responsibility of the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute.
147.  Having a conference facilitated is optional and a conference can be held without a facilitator but, conference facilitation will be offered to all taxpayers as part of the disputes process. The Commissioner's offer of a facilitated conference will be made in writing (the conference facilitation letter") within one month from the date of issue of the taxpayer's NOR. The conference facilitation letter marks the commencement of the conference phase.
148.  The format of the conference meeting need not be limited to a face-to-face meeting. The parties to the dispute may agree to hold a telephone or video conference. (For reasons of simplicity, the SPS refers to meetings" to include these different conference formats.)
149.  The taxpayer is expected to respond within two weeks from the date of the conference facilitation letter. The taxpayer should indicate whether they will attend the conference meeting, whether they will accept the conference facilitation offer, whether there are any special needs or requirements at the meeting and who else will be attending the meeting. If the taxpayer does not respond within this timeframe, the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute will contact the taxpayer about the conference facilitation letter.

##### Preparation for the conference meeting

150.  When a taxpayer agrees to attend a conference meeting, Inland Revenue will contact the taxpayer within two weeks from the taxpayer's agreement, to establish a timeframe, and agree on how the meeting will be conducted.
151.  Prior to the conference meeting, the taxpayer should inform Inland Revenue whether their advisors will attend the conference meeting.
152.  The parties to the dispute may agree to exchange information relevant to the dispute before the conference meeting. A copy of that information will be provided to the facilitator. The Inland Revenue officers will provide the taxpayer with a list of information that has been given to the facilitator. The taxpayer may request a copy of any information on that list if it is not already in their possession. It is also crucial for the parties to exchange the information prior to the meeting if the agreed format of the conference is a telephone or video conference.
153.  Inland Revenue may decide to concede the dispute after considering the taxpayer's information.The whole disputes process (including the conference phase) would come to an end in these cases.
154.  The conference phase will generally be expected to be completed within three months, but this may vary depending on the facts and complexities of the specific case. A longer conference phase may be justified in some disputes if the parties are engaged in meaningful discussions.
155.  An agenda will be useful for both parties at the conference meeting. An agreed agenda should divide the conference meeting into two parts. The first part of the meeting should involve an exchange of material information and discussion of contentious facts and issues relating to the dispute. Any procedural matters such as the timeframe for completing the disputes process, the adjudication process, time bar waivers and the possibility of opting out of the disputes process will also be discussed.The second part of the meeting, if applicable, would involve negotiation of possible areas of resolution of the dispute. Any communication made and any materials prepared for the purpose of negotiating a settlement or resolution during this part of the meeting will be treated as being on a without prejudice" basis.
156.  Where there is no agenda the conference facilitator will guide the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to discuss the contentious facts and issues at the conference meeting.
157.  Where the option of conference facilitation has been declined, the parties to the dispute should work out the appropriate structure at the conference meeting, bearing in mind that one of the aims of any conference is to reach agreement on some or all the facts and issues and thus, resolve the dispute.

##### At the conference meeting

_Facilitated conference_

158.  The facilitator will:
    NaN.  explain the objectives of the conference phase on the basis of the agreed agenda;
    NaN.  remind the parties of any rules relating to the conference (these will generally have been set out in the conference facilitation letter);
    NaN.  clarify who the parties are at the conference meeting and the capacities they hold (eg, whether they are the authorised tax advisors; whether they have authority to settle the dispute at the meeting);
    NaN.  ask whether the parties agree to record the meeting discussions using audio or video technology (refer to SPS 10/01: _Recording Inland Revenue Interviews_ or any replacement SPS);
    NaN.  run through the agenda;
    NaN.  encourage the parties to present evidence in support of their perceived facts (either at the conference meeting or on a later date if the evidence cannot be provided at the time of the meeting). Where possible, encourage the parties to reach agreement on all the facts of the dispute. If no agreement can be made, encourage the parties to establish the common grounds and address the matters that they agree to disagree. These agreements will be recorded in writing. The agreements will be sent to the taxpayer to verify the correctness and sign by a specified date;
    NaN.  promote constructive discussion of only the contentious tax issues and where possible, encourage both parties to explore the issues, resolve or settle the dispute (subject to our internal revenue delegations and guidelines on settlement). If the contentious tax issues cannot be resolved, ask both parties to do one or more of the following:
        *   At the end of the conference meeting, ask the parties to consider whether the conference phase comes to an end. Consider whether there is need for another meeting, noting that another meeting can be justified if both parties need to exchange further information in support of their tax technical arguments but continuous meetings are discouraged if this is seen as a delaying tactic.
        *   Where the parties agree to end the conference phase and the facilitator considers that the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved, the facilitator can clearly signal the end of the conference phase to the parties.
        *   Agree on the timeframe for completing the disputes process and submitting the dispute to the adjudication process. This includes the timeframe for taxpayers to meet outstanding information requests and Inland Revenue officers' undertaking to provide copies of information relevant to the disputes. The agreed timeframe will also factor in time bar waivers if given by the taxpayer and the time required for any court challenge that relates to documents, which are claimed to be protected by professional legal privilege and tax advice documents, which are claimed to be protected by the non-disclosure rights. Ask the taxpayer whether a time bar waiver will be given if the time bar applicable to the assessment in dispute is imminent.
        *   Clearly indicate whether the communication made and/or documents prepared for the purpose of negotiating potential settlement or resolution of the dispute will be treated as being on a "without prejudice" basis.
        *   Ask the taxpayer to consider whether the opt-out process applies and advise the taxpayer of the right to opt out within the required timeframe, so that it is not necessary to complete the disputes process as required under section 89N and that the dispute will be more efficiently resolved by a hearing authority.
    NaN.  note that any agreement between the parties will be recorded in writing and signed either at the conference meeting by both parties or on a later date after the taxpayer has verified the correctness of the agreement
    NaN.  note that the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute will remain as the first point of contact.

_Unfacilitated conference_

159.  In an unfacilitated conference, the parties at the conference should agree on and perform tasks similar to those listed in paragraphs 158(a) to (h) above.
160.  At the end of the conference meeting, it is important for the Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer to discuss whether they consider that the conference phase has come to an end and record any agreement in writing.

##### After the conference meeting

161.  The following is relevant only if the conference phase does not end at the meeting.

_Facilitated conference_

162.  The facilitator will:
    NaN.  follow up on the agreed matters including the agreed timeframe and exchange of information (but does not include enforcing the agreement between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute);
    NaN.  assess any need to attend a further meeting;
    NaN.  suggest to the parties that the conference phase has ended and ask them to reach an agreement on this matter, then clearly notify the parties of the date on which the conference phase has ended.

_Unfacilitated conference_

163.  In a conference that did not have a facilitator, the Inland Revenue officers will perform these tasks. They may suggest to the taxpayer that the conference phase has ended after all the material information relating to the dispute has been exchanged and all the contentious facts and issues have been discussed. The parties will then agree in writing on the date on which the conference phase has ended. If the parties cannot agree on when to end the conference phase, the Investigations Manager will be responsible for making the decision on ending the conference phase after considering all the parties' relevant reasons and concerns.

##### End of the conference phase

164.  It is important for the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to be fully aware of when the conference phase comes to an end. The conference phase is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting. In most cases, it is expected that the parties involved in the dispute will agree on when the conference phase has ended.Such agreement will be put in writing.

_Facilitated conference_

165.  After a facilitated conference, the facilitator will be responsible for clarifying the agreed end date of the conference phase with the parties.
166.  If the facilitator considers that both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers have exchanged all the material information relevant to the dispute, have fully discussed the tax technical issues and have not resolved the dispute, the facilitator may suggest to the parties that the conference phase can come to its end.

167.  If there is no agreement and the parties' reasons for continuing the conference phase are considered to be insufficient, the conference facilitator can make a decision to end the conference phase and notify the parties of that decision. The following are examples of strong indicators that the conference phase has come to its end:
    NaN.  The taxpayer and/or the tax advisors stop contacting the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute for a few weeks.
    NaN.  The parties did not exchange information notwithstanding that this had been agreed on at the conference meeting, thus leading to the exercise of the Commissioner's powers (eg section 17 notices).
    NaN.  The parties agree to disagree with each other and express interest in progressing to the SOP phase.
    NaN.  The taxpayer appears to be using delaying tactics at the conference phase when the issue in dispute is subject to an imminent time bar.

168.  In rare situations, where conference facilitation is involved and the facilitator is concerned with the parties' decision to end the conference phase before achieving the objectives of the conference meeting, the facilitator may adjourn the meeting and discuss the concerns with the responsible Inland Revenue officers. The facilitator may also contact the taxpayer or the taxpayer's tax advisors to discuss whether the conference phase should come to its end. The facilitator will seek the parties' agreement as to whether or not the conference phase is complete.

_Unfacilitated conference_

169.  Where no conference facilitation is involved, the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers will work out when to end the conference phase. They should consider whether the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved before reaching the agreement. If no agreement can be reached, the Investigations Manager will review the conduct of the parties during the conference phase and make a decision on whether the conference phase has come to an end.

##### After the conference phase

170.  When a dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase has been completed, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice together with a SOP, unless the Commissioner and the taxpayer have agreed to the taxpayer opting out of the disputes process. The disclosure notice and Commissioner's SOP will generally be issued within three months from the end of the conference phase (see paragraphs 209 to 225 for further discussion on the timeframes for issue of the Commissioner's disclosure notice and SOP).
171.  If the taxpayer seeks the Commissioner's agreement to opt out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), they will be required to sign a declaration that all material information relating to the dispute has been provided to the Commissioner.

#### Opt out of the disputes process

172.  Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) provides that the Commissioner and a taxpayer can agree in writing not to complete the disputes process if they are satisfied that the dispute can be more efficiently resolved at a hearing authority (referred to as opt out").
173.  A taxpayer may request to opt out of the remainder of the disputes process. If they do, a decision on whether or not the Commissioner will enter into an opt-out agreement will be made by a senior Inland Revenue officer. In making a decision on opt out, that person will consult with Legal and Technical Services, the Litigation Management Unit, and the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel. The decision-maker will consider the taxpayer's request with reference to all of the specific criteria listed and will also consider if any other factors exist which mean that the dispute can be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority.
174.  Before agreeing to a taxpayer's request to opt out the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase. In addition, the taxpayer must have signed a declaration that all material information has been provided to the Commissioner.
175.  This means that the Commissioner will not agree to opting out unless there has been a conference.

176.  In addition to attending the conference, the Commissioner considers that a taxpayer will have participated meaningfully during the conference phase where:
    NaN.  the taxpayer has provided information as requested by Inland Revenue (if it has not already been provided prior to the conference phase); and
    NaN.  the taxpayer has discussed the contentious facts and issues of the dispute with Inland Revenue. This discussion will have involved identifying and clarifying what the dispute turns on, seeking potential resolution of the dispute or reaching agreements to enable the dispute to move forward to the next phase if it remains unresolved.

177.  If the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase and signed a declaration that all material information has been provided, the Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer's request to opt out of the disputes process in circumstances where one of the following applies:
    NaN.  the total amount of tax in dispute is $75,000 or less except where the dispute is part of a wider dispute;
    NaN.  the dispute turns on issues of fact (eg, facts that are to be determined by reference to expert opinions or valuation) only;
    NaN.  the dispute concerns facts and issues that are waiting to be resolved by a court; or
    NaN.  the dispute concerns facts and issues that are similar to those considered by the Disputes Review Unit of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (OCTC") if similar issues have been considered in a dispute in the past.

178.  Where the dispute does not fall within the criteria listed above at paragraph 177, the Commissioner may still agree to opt out of the disputes process if it is considered that the dispute can be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority.
179.  The taxpayer may request to opt out of the disputes process within two weeks from the end of the conference phase. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing within two weeks from the date of the request whether the request to opt out has been agreed to.
180.  Where the opt-out request has been agreed to and the dispute remains unresolved after taking into account the information and discussion during the conference phase, the Commissioner will issue an amended assessment.
181.  When it is considered that the taxpayer does not meet the criteria for opting out of the disputes process, the taxpayer will be advised of the decision in writing.

##### (a) The $75,000 or less threshold

182.  The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer opting out of the disputes process if the total amount of core tax in dispute is $75,000 or less. The $75,000 or less" threshold does not apply if the dispute is part of a wider dispute that involves a number of taxpayers. An example of this is a tax avoidance arrangement similar to the Trinityforestry scheme" in _Accent Management Ltd v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323; \[2007\] NZCA 230.

183.  The $75,000 or less" threshold excludes:
    *   shortfall penalties, either proposed in the same NOPA as the core tax or proposed in a separate NOPA;
    *   use-of-money interest that results from the Commissioner's proposed adjustment in the NOPA; and
    *   late payment penalties imposed on the taxpayer, if applicable.

184.  In some disputes, the Commissioner may propose adjustments in respect of more than one tax type or more than one return period/income year. The $75,000 or less" threshold applies to the net total amount of tax in the **same** dispute. The threshold will take into account the following:
    *   the proposed adjustments made by the Commissioner in the same NOPA for all return periods and/or income years and tax types;
    *   any variation of the amount of tax in dispute due to the Commissioner's partial acceptance of the taxpayer's NOR; and
    *   any variation of the net total amount of tax in dispute as agreed between the participants during the conference phase.

##### (b) The dispute turns on issues of fact only

185.  The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer's request to opt out if the dispute turns on issues of fact or evidence only.
186.  The "issues of fact" requirement may apply where the disputed facts are to be determined by reference to expert opinions or valuation.
187.  Disputes on tax avoidance issues will not meet the issues of fact" requirement. In these disputes, case law requires consideration of issues such as whether the arrangement has used a specific provision in a way that cannot have been within Parliament's contemplation when it enacted the provision. This will involve analysing mixed questions of law and fact.

##### (c) The dispute concerns facts and issues that are waiting to be resolved by a court

188.  The opt-out process is available if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those that are waiting to be resolved by a court. The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer's request to opt out in those cases.
189.  A taxpayer may become aware of a current court case that concerns facts and issues that they consider to be similar to their dispute. The Commissioner will consider this position when deciding whether to accept the taxpayer's opt out request. In considering a taxpayer's request, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer of its views as to the similarity, but will not comment on the merit of the current court case or the plaintiff's tax affairs due to the secrecy provisions of the TAA.
190.  In some cases, a taxpayer may not be aware at the time of issuing the NOR or during the conference phase of the existence of similar cases that are subject to court proceedings. The taxpayer may still request to opt out of the disputes process without this knowledge. In considering the request, the decision maker will consult with the Litigation Management Unit to determine whether there are any current court cases that concern facts and issues that are considered to be similar to the taxpayer's dispute.

##### (d) The dispute concerns facts and issues that are similar to those considered by the Disputes Review Unit

191.  The opt-out process is available if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those already considered by the Disputes Review Unit. A taxpayer may request to opt out of the disputes process because a previous adjudication decision was in favour of the Commissioner and they consider it would be unlikely that the Commissioner's view will change. In considering the taxpayer's request, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer of its views as to the similarity, but will need to bear in mind the secrecy provisions of the TAA.
192.  In some cases, a taxpayer may not be aware of similar disputes that have been considered by the Disputes Review Unit when the taxpayer issues the NOR or participates at a conference meeting. Inland Revenue officers may be aware of such other similar disputes, and may choose to advise the taxpayer that, should the taxpayer request an opt out, Inland Revenue would be very likely to agree. However, Inland Revenue will need to bear in mind the secrecy provisions of the TAA when considering other disputes.

##### Grounds of assessment where the Commissioner has agreed to opt out

193.  In agreeing to the taxpayer's request for opt out the Commissioner will issue an amended assessment and a notice of assessment to the taxpayer. In doing so the Commissioner will have taken into account the information and legal arguments raised in the NOPA, the NOR and during the conference phase. The taxpayer can then challenge the assessment by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority within the applicable response period, ie two months of receipt of the notice of assessment.
194.  In making an amended assessment, the Commissioner is not bound by the facts, issues, evidence and propositions of law stated in the NOPA and NOR, and the Commissioner is able to take into account information and arguments raised during the conference phase. The Commissioner's administrative practice is that grounds of assessment which have not previously been referred to in the Commissioner's NOPA and the taxpayers' NOR will not be relied on, if they have not been notified or sufficiently discussed during the conference phase.
195.  Where the parties have agreed to opt out the Commissioner will send to the taxpayer at or near the time of issuing the assessment, a letter confirming briefly the grounds of assessment.

#### Progressing disputes throught the disputes process where the dispute affects multiple taxpayers

196.  Sometimes it is necessary for Inland Revenue to deal with a large number of taxpayers that are all affected by the same disputed matter. This can arise in situations where:
    *   the taxpayers are all investors in a particular scheme;
    *   the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same promoter;
    *   the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same tax agent;
    *   there exists a widespread but well-defined common problem involving many unrelated taxpayers (e.g. taxpayers moving their private residence into an LAQC, or a number of taxpayers claiming non-deductible expenses such as fines for overloading).

197.  Given Inland Revenue's limited resources, and bearing in mind taxpayer compliance costs it may not be appropriate for all the cases to proceed through the full disputes process.
198.  The Commissioner's approach to the different situations which arise where a large number of taxpayers are all affected by the same disputed matter is outlined in paragraphs 199 to 208.

##### Situation 1: The Disputes Review Unit has looked at an issue a number of times and consistently taken a view supporting the Commissioner

199.  As discussed in detail previously at paragraphs 172 to 192, the Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer's request to opt out of the remaining parts of the disputes process if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those previously considered by the Disputes Review Unit.
200.  Therefore, in situations where the Disputes Review Unit has looked at an issue a number of times and consistently taken a view supporting the Commissioner agreement between the parties to opt out is an option available to avoid the full disputes process.
201.  In these circumstances the Commissioner will indicate to individual taxpayers that the dispute could be suitable for opt out but as this approach to a dispute requires the taxpayer to request opt out, they still have the choice to progress the dispute through the full disputes process.
202.  It should be noted that before the Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer's request to opt out the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase. In addition, the taxpayer must have signed a declaration that all material information has been provided to the Commissioner.

##### Situation 2: There are a number of cases on the same issue under dispute. One case has been referred to the Disputes Review Unit, who has still to reach a conclusion on the matter

203.  In this situation it may be possible for other affected taxpayers and the Commissioner to merely agree, subject to statutory time bar issues, to place their case "on hold" while the Disputes Review Unit undertakes its analysis.
204.  However, care will need to be taken to ensure that the time bar will not be breached, and consideration should be given to obtaining a time bar waiver.
205.  Again, as this approach requires the taxpayer to agree, the Commissioner can offer it to individual taxpayers but they still have the choice to progress the dispute through the full disputes process.
206.  Taxpayers who agree to place their case on hold" while the Disputes Review Unit considers the issues in question in relation to another taxpayer will not be bound by any decision reached by the Disputes Review Unit and will be free to continue with their dispute should they wish.

##### Situation 3:The Disputes Review Unit has previously looked at an issue and taken a view supporting the taxpayer

207.  It is the Commissioner's policy that a finding for the taxpayer in the initial dispute will usually lead to the other disputes being withdrawn, particularly if the disputes are in respect of the same transaction.
208.  However, in some situations further consideration of the issue is required at a national level before the Commissioner will apply the conclusions reached in a particular adjudication report more broadly to other taxpayers. In those cases, Inland Revenue officers may be advised that a specified or contrary approach (to that adopted by the Disputes Review Unit) is to be followed pending further consideration of the issue at a national level.

#### Disclosure Notice

209.  The Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1), unless the Commissioner:
    NaN.  does not have to complete the disputes process because any of the exceptions under section 89N(1)(c) applies (see earlier discussion), or
    NaN.  does not have to complete the disputes process because the High Court has made an order that the dispute resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3), or
    NaN.  has already issued to the taxpayer a notice of disputable decision that includes or takes account of the adjustment proposed in the NOPA pursuant to section 89M(2).
210.  When issuing a disclosure notice the Commissioner must also provide to the taxpayer the Commissioner's SOP (as discussed below) and include in the disclosure notice a reference to section 138G and a statement regarding the effect of the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule pursuant to section 89M(3).
211.  The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer two weeks before issuing the disclosure notice and SOP that these documents will be issued to them.
212.  Where practicable, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer shortly after the disclosure notice and SOP are issued to ascertain whether the taxpayer has received these documents.
213.  If the taxpayer has not received the Commissioner's disclosure notice, for example, due to a postal error or an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control, the Commissioner will issue another disclosure notice to the taxpayer. In this circumstance, the response period within which the taxpayer must respond with their SOP will commence from the date that the Commissioner issued the initial disclosure notice.
214.  Where the taxpayer cannot issue a SOP within the applicable response period, they may issue a late SOP with an explanation of why it is late. The Commissioner will consider the late SOP in terms of the discretion under section 89K(1). See paragraphs 108 to 126 for further discussion.)

_Issues and propositions of law exclusion rule_

215.  A disclosure notice is the document that triggers the application of the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule. The Commissioner must explain the effect of this rule and refer to section 138G in the disclosure notice. (See paragraph 239 for further discussion.)

_Issue of a disclosure notice_

216.  The Commissioner can issue a disclosure notice at any time on or after the date that either party issues their NOPA.
217.  Usually, the Commissioner will issue a disclosure notice after receiving a NOR, following the conference phase and in accordance with the timeframe agreed with the taxpayer.
218.  Where a disclosure notice is issued earlier (for example, the facts are clear, the taxpayer has agreed on the disputed issues or a conference is not required) the reasons must be documented and explained to the taxpayer.
219.  When deciding whether to issue a disclosure notice before the conference phase has been completed, Inland Revenue officers must be aware that, if the taxpayer discloses any new or novel matters in their SOP, they only have two months to reply under section 89M(8) barring a High Court application before the two-month period expires.(See section 89M(10).)

220.  Where a dispute commenced by the Commissioner remains unresolved after the conference phase, an Inland Revenue officer will usually issue a disclosure notice together with a SOP:
    *   within **three months** from the end of the conference phase; or
    *   within **three months** from the date when the Commissioner advises that the taxpayer's opt out request has been declined;

*   subject to any further time allowed by an appropriate senior manager. (See paragraphs 223 to 225.)

221.  The three-month timeframe will exclude any statutory holidays.
222.  If the last day of the three-month timeframe falls on a weekend, Inland Revenue must issue the disclosure notice and the SOP by the next working day.
223.  While the Commissioner is able to extend the three-month timeframe these extensions should be very rare, because in most disputes, the timeframe is considered to be sufficient for Inland Revenue officers to complete and issue to the taxpayer a disclosure notice and the Commissioner's SOP.

224.  The ability for Inland Revenue to extend the three-month timeframe is provided for because it is recognised that even with good planning and the best endeavours of the Inland Revenue officers involved, there might be occasions on which the disclosure notice and the Commissioner's SOP cannot be issued within the three-month timeframe. This might occur when:
    NaN.  the facts, issues, and law are complex, and/or
    NaN.  the case involves an important issue of precedent and/or the Litigation Management Unit or external advisors are involved in advising on the Commissioner's SOP.

225.  If it is considered that an extension of the timeframe is needed:
    *   approval will first be obtained from an appropriate senior manager;
    *   the taxpayer will then be advised of the estimated date for issue of the Commissioner's SOP. Where the estimated date cannot be met, Inland Revenue will use its best endeavours to keep the taxpayer informed of the progress made in the completion of the Commissioner's SOP.

#### Statement of position(SOP)

226.  Pursuant to section 89M(3), when the Commissioner commences the disputes process, the Commissioner must issue a SOP to the taxpayer together with the disclosure notice.
227.  When the disputed issue relates to a tax type that is subject to the statutory time bar (for example, income tax, GST) that falls within the current income year, the parties will endeavour to complete the disputes process before the time bar starts. The parties can agree to a statutory time bar waiver if they have issued a SOP to each other and there is insufficient time to complete the adjudication process.
228.  However, if no such agreement is reached, section 89N(2)(b) allows the Commissioner to advance to the next stage if the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP and completed the compulsory elements of the disputes process. The Commissioner can amend the assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113.
229.  Whether the Commissioner has adequately considered a SOP will depend on what is a reasonable length of time and level of analysis for that SOP given the circumstances of the case (for example, the length of the SOP and the complexity of the legal issues).
230.  Thus a simple dispute could only take a couple of days to consider adequately while a complex dispute could take a few weeks. If the statutory time bar is imminent the Inland Revenue officer will consider the taxpayer's SOP urgently.

##### Contents of a SOP

231.  The "evidence exclusion rule" was replaced by the "issues and propositions of law exclusion rule" as a consequence of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011, for disputes or challenges relating to a disclosure notice issued on or after 29 August 2011. In these disputes, the disputant and the Commissioner are only confined in challenge proceedings to the issues and propositions of laws disclosed in their respective SOPs. In other words, additional facts and evidence not originally disclosed in the disputant's or Commissioner's SOP may be introduced in challenge proceedings.
232.  For disclosure notices issued before 29 August 2011, the "evidence exclusion rule" still applies and limits the parties to the facts, evidence (excluding oral evidence), issues and propositions of law that either party discloses in their respective SOPs, unless a court order is made under section 138G(2) allowing new facts and evidence to be raised.
233.  However, under either rule, a mistaken description of facts, evidence, issues or propositions of law and submissions made in the SOP can later be amended if the parties agree to include additional information in the SOPs under section 89M(13).
234.  Under section 89M(4) the SOP must be in the prescribed form and must contain sufficient detail to fairly inform the taxpayer of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that the Commissioner wishes to rely on.
235.  The minimum content requirements for a SOP under section 89M(4) are an outline of the relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law. However, to allow the Disputes Review Unit to successfully reach a decision, the SOP must also contain full, complete and detailed submissions.
236.  An outline that consists of a frank and complete discussion of the issues, law, arguments and evidence supporting the argument is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes process. (In very complex cases a full explanation of the relevant evidence and summary of less relevant evidence will be accepted.)
237.  The disputes process does not require that relevant documents are discovered or full briefs of evidence or exhaustive lists of documents exchanged. Rather, providing an outline of relevant evidence in the SOP will ensure that both parties appreciate the availability of evidence in respect of the factual issues in dispute. The Commissioner should ensure that an outline of any expert evidence on which they intend to rely is included in the SOP.
238.  Submissions made in the NOPA phase must be sufficiently concise to enable the parties to progress the dispute without incurring substantial expense. However, at the SOP phase, if the issues are unresolved and likely to proceed to a court for resolution, then full, complete and detailed submissions should be made.
239.  Subject to section 138G(2), the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule prevents the court considering issues and propositions of law that are not included in:
    NaN.  the Commissioner or disputant's SOP, or
    NaN.  any additional information that:
        NaN.  the Commissioner provides under section 89M(8), that is deemed to be part of the Commissioner's SOP under subsection (9), and
        NaN.  the parties provide pursuant to an agreement under section 89M(13), that is deemed to be part of the provider's SOP under subsection (14).

240.  Section 89M(6B) reads:
    *   In subsections 4(b) and 6(b), **evidence** refers to the available documentary evidence on which the person intends to rely, but does not include a list of potential witnesses, whether or not identified by name.
241.  Pursuant to section 89M(6B), only documentary evidence and not potential witnesses must be listed in the SOP. Any witnesses' identities will continue to be protected without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule.
242.  If the SOP discusses shortfall penalties it must also state any other appropriate penalties of lesser percentages and shortfall penalty reductions (for example, voluntary disclosure or previous behaviour reductions) as alternative arguments. This ensures that the appropriate penalties are assessed in all cases. However, the Commissioner cannot propose shortfall penalties at the SOP phase that have not previously been proposed in the Commissioner's NOPA.

##### Receipt of a taxpayer's SOP in response

243.  Where the Commissioner has issued a disclosure notice and SOP, the taxpayer must, subject to section 89M(11), issue a SOP within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the disclosure notice was issued.
244.  Therefore, the Commissioner cannot consider a document that the taxpayer purports to issue as a SOP before the Commissioner has issued the disclosure notice because it will not have been issued within the response period. The taxpayer should resubmit this document after the disclosure notice is issued.
245.  Pursuant to section 89M(11), the taxpayer can apply to the High Court within the response period for more time to reply to the Commissioner's SOP. The taxpayer must show that they had not previously discussed the disputed issue with the Commissioner and, thus, it is unreasonable to reply to the Commissioner's SOP within the response period.
246.  The Commissioner will make a reasonable effort to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period expires to determine whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP in response to the disclosure notice. Such contact can be made by telephone or in writing.

247.  The taxpayer's SOP will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue receives it. Upon receipt, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following:
    NaN.  the date on which the SOP was issued, and
    NaN.  whether the SOP has been issued within the relevant response period, and
    NaN.  the SOP's salient features including any deficiencies in its content.
248.  Where it is practicable, Inland Revenue will acknowledge the taxpayer's SOP as received within 10 working days after receiving it. However, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of any deficiencies in the SOP's content as soon as practicable
249.  A taxpayer who has issued a SOP outside the applicable response period can apply for consideration of exceptional circumstances or that the disputant had a demonstrable intention to continue the dispute under section 89K. The responsible officer must notify the taxpayer of the decision in writing within one month of receiving the disputant's late" SOP (rejection is by way of a "refusal notice").
250.  A taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner's SOP if they do not reply to it with their own SOP within two months after the date that the disclosure notice is issued and where section 89K does not apply. Where practicable, the Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer that deemed acceptance has occurred within two weeks after the date that the response period for the disclosure notice expires.

##### The Commissioner's response

251.  Pursuant to section 89M(8), the Commissioner can, within two months after the taxpayer's SOP is issued, provide to the taxpayer additional information in response to matters that they have raised in their SOP.
252.  The Commissioner can only provide additional information in response to new or novel information or arguments that the taxpayer has raised in their SOP or agreed to add to their SOP under section 89M(13). The Commissioner cannot add further information simply because it was omitted from the Commissioner's SOP (for example, information that was received under a section 17 notice after the SOP was issued).
253.  The additional information must be provided as far as possible in the same format as the SOP to which it relates (that is, in accordance with section 89M(4)). As mentioned above, the additional information can include documentary evidence but not lists of potential witnesses.
254.  If the Commissioner intends to provide additional information to the taxpayer under section 89M(8), the Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of this within two weeks after the taxpayer's SOP is received. However, the timing of this advice can vary depending on the facts and complexity of the dispute. The additional information provided under section 89M(8) is deemed to be part of the Commissioner's SOP. Any new issues or propositions of law forming part of the additional information will be subject to section 138G.
255.  The taxpayer cannot reply to the additional information that the Commissioner provides, unless the parties agree that additional information will be accepted under section 89M(13).

#### Agreement to include additional information

256.  Either party can agree to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13) at any time during the disputes process including after the dispute has been referred to the Disputes Review Unit. Although there is no statutory time limit, the Commissioner's practice is to allow one month (from the date that the Commissioner provides additional information under section 89M(8)) for such an agreement to be reached and information provided.
257.  However, before agreeing to a request made by the taxpayer under section 89M(13) the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer's prior conduct and whether they could have provided the information earlier through the application of due diligence.
258.  The Commissioner will usually also consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information and its capacity to help resolve the dispute and may decide to take it into account in coming to an assessment. In this circumstance, both parties will be expected to cooperate in resolving the relevance and accuracy of any such material. The Commissioner may wish to apply resources to verification and comment and this will be considered by the adjudicator.
259.  If a taxpayer's request to include additional information in their SOP is declined, the reasons must be documented with detailed reference to the taxpayer's conduct, level of cooperation before the request was made and why the information was not provided earlier. The responsible officer will also advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the reasons why their request was declined.
260.  Any agreement to add further information to the SOP will be made subject to the taxpayer agreeing that the Commissioner can include a response to the additional information to the SOPs, if required, within an agreed timeframe.
261.  Any additional information that the parties provide under section 89M(13) will be deemed to form part of the provider's SOP under section 89M(14). Section 138G applies to the additional information.

#### Preparation for Adjudication

262.  The Disputes Review Unit is part of Inland Revenue's Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and represents the final step of the disputes process. The adjudicator's role is to review unresolved disputes by taking a fresh look at a tax dispute and the application of law to the facts in an impartial and independent manner and provide a comprehensive and technically accurate decision that will ensure the correctness of the assessment.
263.  Generally, the adjudicator will make such a decision within three months after the case is referred to the Disputes Review Unit (although sometimes a decision can be made in a few weeks). The length of time taken to make a decision will depend on the number of disputes that are before the Disputes Review Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. [1](#01)
    
264.  The adjudication process is an administrative (rather than a legislative) one. Judicial comments have been made in _C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited and Another, Ch'elle Properties (NZ) Limited v CIR_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 and _ANZ National Bank Ltd and others v C of IR_ _(No. 2)_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,835 indicating that, as a matter of law, it is not strictly necessary for Inland Revenue officers to send all disputes to the Disputes Review Unit for review and Inland Revenue officers are not necessarily bound by the Disputes Review Unit's decisions.
265.  Notwithstanding the above judicial comments, if the parties have not agreed on all the issues at the end of the conference and disclosure phases or to opting out under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), it is the Commissioner's policy and practice that all disputes are to be sent to the Disputes Review Unit for review, irrespective of the complexity or type of issues or amount of tax involved unless any of the following exceptions arise:
    NaN.  the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP for the purposes of section 89N(2)(b) and referred the dispute to the Disputes Review Unit for their preliminary consideration and the Disputes Review Unit has determined that it has insufficient time to reach a decision in respect of the dispute before a statutory time bar would prevent an assessment from being increased (see paragraphs 228 to 230 for further discussion), or
    NaN.  any of the legislative exceptions specified in section 89N(1)(c) apply (see Appendix 2 for further discussion) so that the Commissioner can amend an assessment without first completing the disputes process, or
    NaN.  the High Court has made an order that the disputes process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3) (see Appendix 2 for further discussion).
266.  The decision not to refer the case to adjudication must be made by a senior person in Service Delivery (for example, at the time of writing the delegation was with Assurance Manager level or above). In respect of the first exception mentioned in paragraph 265(a) it is necessary that the parties have exchanged a SOP and it is a matter solely for the Disputes Review Unit to determine whether it has insufficient time to fully consider the dispute.
267.  If the dispute is to be referred to the Disputes Review Unit, the Commissioner should not issue an assessment or amended assessment before the adjudication process is completed unless a time bar is imminent. In this circumstance, the responsible officer will prepare a cover sheet that will record all the documents that must be sent to the Disputes Review Unit.
268.  The cover sheet together with copies of the documents (NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, conference notes, both parties' SOP, additional information, material evidence including expert opinions and a schedule of all evidence held) and any recordings of discussions held during the conference must be sent to the Disputes Review Unit.
269.  If the dispute is to be referred for adjudication, the responsible officer will issue a letter together with a copy of the cover sheet to the taxpayer before sending the submissions, notes and evidence to the Disputes Review Unit. The cover sheet and letter are usually completed within one month after the date that the Commissioner's reply to the taxpayer's SOP (if any) is issued or the response period for the taxpayer's SOP expires.
270.  The purpose of this letter is to seek concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator - primarily concerning documentary evidence that has been disclosed at the SOP phase. This letter will allow no more than 10 working days for a response.
271.  Once the taxpayer has concurred on the materials to be sent to the Disputes Review Unit, those materials will be so forwarded. However, if no response is received from the taxpayer the materials will be forwarded after the 10 working days allowed for the taxpayer's response have elapsed. The adjudicator may also contact the parties after the initial materials have been received to obtain further information.
272.  Where an investigation has covered a number of issues, the cover sheet will outline any issues that the parties have agreed upon and any issues that are still disputed. The adjudicator will only consider the disputed issues and not those issues that have been agreed upon.
273.  Generally, the adjudicator only considers the materials that the parties have submitted. They do not usually seek out or consider further information, unless it is relevant. The adjudicator may consider such additional information notwithstanding that the parties have not agreed that the provider can include this information in their SOP under section 89M(13).
274.  However, any additional material which amounts to a legal or factual issue, or a proposition of law, that the parties have not disclosed in their SOP (or agreed to include in their SOP under section 89M(13)) cannot later be raised in court because the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule in section 138G(1) will apply (as discussed in paragraphs 239 to 241).

#### Adjudication decision

275.  Once a conclusion is reached, the Disputes Review Unit will advise the taxpayer and responsible officer of the decision. The responsible officer will implement any of the Disputes Review Unit's decisions and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment to the taxpayer where applicable.
276.  Where the Disputes Review Unit makes a decision against the Commissioner, the Commissioner is bound by and cannot challenge that decision. The dispute will come to an end.
277.  Where the Disputes Review Unit makes a decision against the taxpayer, they can challenge the assessment (whether made by the Commissioner or taxpayer) or disputable decision if they are within the applicable response period.
278.  If the Commissioner has commenced the disputes process, the taxpayer, if disagreeing with the adjudicator's decision and any later notice of assessment or amended assessment that is issued, can file proceedings in the general jurisdiction of the TRA or the High Court if any of the following conditions under section 138B(1) are met:
    NaN.  the assessment includes an adjustment that the Commissioner has proposed and the taxpayer has rejected within the response period, or
    NaN.  the assessment is an amended assessment that imposes a fresh or increases an existing liability.
    NaN.  A taxpayer can also challenge an assessment that the Commissioner issues before the dispute goes through the adjudication process (for example, when an exception under section 89N(1)(c) applies).
    NaN.  The taxpayer must file proceedings with the TRA or High Court within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the notice of assessment or amended assessment.
    NaN.  If applicable, the responsible officer will implement any decision made by the hearing authority and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 13 October 2011.

### Appendix 1

#### Exceptions to the requirement that the Commissioner must issue a NOPA before making an assessment

##### Exception 1: The assessment corresponds with a tax return

1.  Section 89C(a) reads:
    *   The assessment corresponds with a tax return that has been provided by the taxpayer.
2.  The application of section 89C(a) is limited under the self-assessment rules. Generally, a taxpayer makes an assessment and files a tax return that includes that assessment. If the taxpayer's assessment is supported by the information in the tax return and any underlying source documents that the taxpayer has provided and the Commissioner agrees with the taxpayer's return and assessment there is no need for the Commissioner to invoke the disputes process.
3.  In these circumstances, instead of issuing a notice of assessment the Commissioner will issue a statement of account that confirms the taxpayer's assessment. The statutory response period for the purposes of the disputes process will commence from the date that Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer's assessment.
4.  Sometimes, if there is a deficiency in the taxpayer's tax return, the Commissioner will issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer because section 89C(a) applies. For example, the Commissioner can issue an assessment, where the taxpayer has provided all their income details but omitted to calculate their income tax liability in the tax return.

##### Exception 2: Simple or obvious mistake or oversight

5.  Section 89C(b) reads:
    *   The taxpayer has provided a tax return which, in the Commissioner's opinion, appears to contain a simple or obvious mistake or oversight, and the assessment merely corrects the mistake or oversight.
6.  This exception is intended to apply to a simple calculation error or oversight that Inland Revenue's Processing Centres generally discover with computer edits and simple return checks. This maintains the status quo for the many assessments arising in this situation.
7.  The Commissioner will generally treat the following as a simple mistake or oversight:
    NaN.  an arithmetical error;
    NaN.  an error in transposing numbers from one box to another in a tax return;
    NaN.  double counting, such as inadvertently including in the taxpayer's income the same item twice;
    NaN.  not claiming a rebate to which the taxpayer is entitled or that was incorrectly calculated, for example, the low income rebate for a taxpayer.
8.  A simple or obvious mistake or oversight" can be determined on a case-by-case basis with no dollar limit.The Commissioner may consider whether this exception applies irrespective of whether the taxpayer has requested that the Commissioner makes an amendment under section 113 or applies the exception under section 89C(b).
9.  Where the Commissioner issues an assessment to correct a taxpayer's simple or obvious mistake or oversight, the Commissioner may consider imposing shortfall penalties on the taxpayer, if there is a tax shortfall and the taxpayer has committed one of the culpable acts, for example, lack of reasonable care and not relied on the action or advice of their tax advisor for the purposes of section 141A(2B).

##### Exception 3: Agreement to amend previous tax position

10.  Section 89C(c) reads:
    *   The assessment corrects a tax position previously taken by the taxpayer in a way or manner agreed by the Commissioner and the taxpayer.
11.  This situation can occur if the issue is raised by either the Commissioner or the taxpayer. There is no need to issue a NOPA because no dispute arises.
12.  If the Commissioner proposes the adjustment, this exception cannot apply unless the taxpayer accepts the adjustment. For the purpose of section 89C(c), the agreement between the parties can be oral, but the Commissioner's practice will be to seek written agreement. Section 89C(c) applies if Inland Revenue officers can demonstrate that the Commissioner and taxpayer have agreed on the proposed adjustment.
13.  However, if the parties agree on only one adjustment and dispute others in respect of the same assessment, the Commissioner cannot issue an assessment on the basis of the agreed adjustment because the tax position is not necessarily correct.
14.  Where a taxpayer proposes an adjustment outside the disputes process and the Commissioner agrees, for example a taxpayer makes a request to amend an assessment, the particulars must be recorded in writing and state that the assessment is made in accordance with the Commissioner's practice on exercising the discretion under section 113. (See SPS 07/03: _Requests to amend assessments_.) The Commissioner must also consider if shortfall penalties are applicable.

##### Exception 4: The assessment otherwise reflects an agreement

15.  Section 89C(d) reads:
    *   The assessment reflects an agreement reached between the Commissioner and the taxpayer.
16.  The same procedures apply for section 89C(c) and (d). However, the agreement that the parties reach does not have to relate to a tax position that the taxpayer has previously taken.
17.  For example, if the taxpayer has disputed, but now agrees, that they are a taxpayer" for the purpose of the definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and has not provided a tax return. The Commissioner may issue an assessment to the taxpayer under section 89C(d) to reflect this agreement. The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable.
18.  Another example is where, pursuant to section 6A, the Commissioner settles a tax case and disputes process. In such cases, the Commissioner will usually enter into an individual settlement deed and agreed adjustment in writing with the taxpayer to confirm the settlement.
19.  The Commissioner will then give effect to that settlement deed and agreed adjustment by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer under section 89C(d) without first issuing a NOPA.

##### Exception 5: Material facts and law identical to court proceeding

20.  Section 89C(db) reads:
    *   The assessment is made in relation to a matter for which the material facts and relevant law are identical to those for an assessment of the taxpayer for another period that is at the time the subject of court proceedings.
21.  Pursuant to section 89C(db), the Commissioner can issue an assessment to the taxpayer in relation to the other period that is the subject of court proceedings, without first issuing a NOPA. The Commissioner does not have to follow the disputes process for the same issue in the other period because the matter is before the court to resolve. A dual process towards resolution does not need to be adopted. The Commissioner will also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable.
22.  However, a taxpayer who has been issued with an assessment in relation to another period under section 89C(db), can dispute that assessment by issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D within the applicable response period.
23.  Section 89C(db) is intended to reduce compliance costs. Notwithstanding this provision, the Commissioner can elect to issue a NOPA in respect of the other period in order to resolve the dispute through the disputes process.

##### Exception 6: Revenue protection

24.  Section 89C(e) reads:
    
    *   The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe a notice may cause the taxpayer or an associated person -
    
    NaN.  to leave New Zealand; or
    NaN.  to take steps, in relation to the existence or location of the taxpayer's assets, making it harder for the Commissioner to collect the tax from the taxpayer.
25.  This exception is intended to ensure that the revenue is protected in the relevant circumstances. Section 89C(e) does not require that the taxpayer has physical possession of their assets.
26.  If Inland Revenue officers apply the exception under section 89C(e), this should be supported by evidence of the reasonable grounds" relied on (for example, the taxpayer's correspondence with third parties, application to emigrate overseas and any transcripts of interviews with the taxpayer).

##### Exception 7: Fraudulent activity

27.  Section 89C(eb) reads:
    *   The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity.
28.  Pursuant to section 89C(eb), a taxpayer has been involved in a fraudulent activity if they have engaged or participated in, or been connected with, any fraudulent activity that would have tax consequences for them.
29.  If the taxpayer has not been convicted of an offence relating to a fraudulent activity section 89C(eb) can still apply provided that the Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that the taxpayer has been involved in a fraudulent activity.
30.  If Inland Revenue officers apply the exception under section 89C(eb), this should be supported by sufficient evidence of the "reasonable grounds" relied on. The evidence does not have to be absolute proof but, merely sufficient to verify the reasonable grounds".

##### Exception 8: Vexatious or frivolous

31.  Section 89C(f) reads:
    *   The assessment corrects a tax position previously taken by a taxpayer that, in the opinion of the Commissioner is, or is the result of, a vexatious or frivolous act of, or vexatious or frivolous failure to act by, the taxpayer.
32.  If Inland Revenue officers apply this exception, this should be supported by documentation that evidences:
    NaN.  the action or inaction giving rise to the tax positions previously taken, and
    NaN.  why that action is considered to be vexatious or frivolous and any shortfall penalties/prosecution consideration. Examples of a tax position taken as result of a vexatious or frivolous act are a tax position that is:
        NaN.  clearly lacking in substance, for example, where the taxpayer continues to take the same position that has previously been finalised, or
        NaN.  motivated by the sole purpose of delay.
33.  Where this exception applies, the Commissioner must also consider the imposition of shortfall penalties in respect of the taxpayer's tax position resulting from a vexatious or frivolous act.

##### Exception 9: Taxation Review Authority or court determination

34.  Section 89C(g) reads:
    *   The assessment is made as a result of a direction or determination of a court or the Taxation Review Authority.
35.  For the purpose of section 89C(g), a direction or determination includes any court or TRA decision that affects the particular taxpayer in relation to a specific tax period and a court decision on a test case" that applies to the taxpayer irrespective of whether they were a party to the test case.
36.  The Commissioner must retain a copy of the direction or determination to support the application of this exception. In these circumstances, the Commissioner will endeavour to make an assessment including imposing shortfall penalties, within two weeks after receiving the written direction or determination. However, if the direction or determination relates to a test case the Commissioner can issue an assessment within the period specified under section 89O(5).

##### Exception 10: "Default assessment"

37.  Section 89C(h) reads:
    *   The taxpayer has not provided a tax return when and as required by a tax law.
38.  If section 89C(h) applies because the taxpayer has failed to provide a tax return the Commissioner can make an assessment or amended assessment pursuant to section 106(1) (commonly known as a "default assessment").
39.  Where a taxpayer seeks to dispute a default assessment through the disputes process, the taxpayer must, within the applicable response period (that is, four months from the date that the default assessment is issued):
    NaN.  provide a tax return in the prescribed form for the period to which the default assessment relates (pursuant to section 89D(2C) for GST and section 89D(2) for all other tax types) notwithstanding that the tax return will not include the taxpayer's assessment, and
    NaN.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment.
40.  The requirement to provide a tax return in respect of a default assessment made under section 106(1) before issuing a NOPA is an additional requirement of the disputes process. This ensures that the taxpayer has provided the information that is required by the tax law before they are entitled to dispute the assessment.
41.  If the Commissioner agrees with the taxpayer's NOPA and tax return, the Commissioner will generally amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113, subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 and any other relevant limitations. However, if the Commissioner does not agree with the taxpayer's tax return and NOPA the Commissioner can decide to not amend the default assessment and issue a NOR instead.
42.  If a taxpayer cannot provide a NOPA because they are outside the applicable response period to dispute a default assessment or do not want to enter into the disputes process, they must still provide a tax return.
43.  Although the Commissioner does not have to amend the initial assessment on receipt of the tax return from a defaulting taxpayer, the Commissioner can exercise the discretion to amend under section 113 subject to the time bar in section 108 or 108A and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion.
44.  If the Commissioner decides not to exercise the discretion under section 113 the Commissioner can issue a NOPA in respect of the default assessment under section 89B(1) where, for example, new information received from the taxpayer suggests that the default assessment is incorrect
45.  The Commissioner is not precluded from further investigating an amended assessment issued on the basis of the taxpayer's tax return and, if necessary, issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer.

##### Exception 11: Failure to make or account for tax deductions

46.  Section 89C(i) reads:
    *   The assessment is made following the failure by a taxpayer to withhold or deduct an amount required to be withheld or deducted by a tax law or to account for an amount withheld or deducted in the manner required by a tax law.
47.  This exception is intended to address a taxpayer's failure to withhold, deduct or account to the Commissioner for an amount of tax including PAYE, schedular payments to non-resident contractors and resident withholding tax (RWT"). The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable.
48.  The Commissioner may not apply this exception if there is a dispute that involves statutory interpretation (for example, whether a particular item attracts liability for RWT meaning that the taxpayer was required to withhold or deduct RWT) and/or shortfall penalties.

##### Exception 12: Non-assessed tax return

49.  Section 89C(j) reads:
    *   The taxpayer is entitled to issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of a tax return provided by the taxpayer, and has done so.
50.  If a taxpayer proposes an adjustment in a NOPA with which the Commissioner agrees, an assessment can be issued without first issuing a NOPA. This exception only applies to an adjustment that the taxpayer has proposed in their NOPA under section 89DA(1) within the applicable response period.

##### Exception 13: Consequential adjustment

51.  Section 89C(k) reads:
    *   The assessment corrects a tax position taken by the taxpayer or an associated person as a consequence or result of an incorrect tax position taken by another taxpayer, and, at the time the Commissioner makes the assessment, the Commissioner has made, or is able to make, an assessment for that other taxpayer for the correct amount of tax payable by that other taxpayer...
52.  If transactions affect multiple taxpayers, whether in the same way or in related but opposite ways, the Commissioner can reassess any consequentially affected taxpayers under section 89C(k). This is notwithstanding that the consequentially affected taxpayers have not agreed to the amended assessments.
53.  However, those taxpayers subject to the amended assessments may still issue a NOPA to dispute the consequential adjustment within the applicable response period. The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable.
54.  Section 109(b) deems any assessment that the Commissioner makes to be correct. Therefore, the Commissioner can make any consequential amendment under section 89C(k). However, the Commissioner must be satisfied that there is a direct consequential link between the taxpayers before making any adjustment. For example:
    NaN.  Group loss offsets: if a loss company has claimed losses to which it is not entitled and the Commissioner has amended the loss company's loss assessment to disallow those losses, pursuant to section 89C(k), the Commissioner can also make a separate assessment for the profit company that had offset the loss company's losses against its profits.
    NaN.  GST: the supplier and recipient of a supply have incorrectly assumed that a transaction was GST-exempt. The Commissioner later agrees that the recipient was entitled to a GST input tax credit and issues an assessment to them allowing the credit. The Commissioner can also issue an assessment to the supplier under section 89C(k) in respect of the output tax on the value of the supply.

##### Exception 14: Look-through company

55.  If an assessment will correct a tax position taken by the taxpayer in relation to a tax position taken by a look-through company in a return of income under section 42B, and the Commissioner and the company have completed the disputes process for that return of income and that tax position, the Commissioner can reassess under section 89C(ka) without first issuing a NOPA.

##### Exception 15: Income statement

56.  Section 89C(l) provides that no NOPA is required if the assessment results from an income statement under Part 3A.

##### Exception 16: Write-off of outstanding tax for taxpayers with tax losses

57.  Under section 177C(5), if the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer who has a tax loss, the Commissioner must extinguish all or part of the taxpayer's tax loss, by dividing the amount written off by 33% and reducing the tax loss by that amount.
58.  Under section 89C(lb) the Commissioner does not have to issue a NOPA prior to issuing an assessment which extinguishes all or part of a tax loss in accordance with section 177C(5).

##### Exception 17: Tax credits arising from subparts MA-MF and MZ

57.  Under section 89C(m) no NOPA is required if an assessment includes a calculation of working for families tax credits (identified in subparts MA to MF and MZ of the Income Tax Act 2007).

### Appendix 2

#### Section 89N - Exceptions - When an assessment can be issued without completing the disputes process

1.  If a NOPA has been issued and the dispute is unresolved, the Commissioner can issue an assessment without completing the disputes process under the following circumstances:

##### Exception 1: In the course of the dispute, the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(i)).

2.  Section 89N(1)(c)(i) reads:
    *   (i) the Commissioner notifies the disputant that, in the Commissioner's opinion, the disputant in the course of the dispute has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had an effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process:
3.  This exception applies where the Commissioner may need to act quickly to issue an assessment because it is considered that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has caused undue delay to the progress of the dispute.
4.  For example, in the course of a dispute a taxpayer obstructed Inland Revenue officers in obtaining information from the taxpayer's business premise under section 16. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that it is considered that an offence has been committed under section 143H. The offence has the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process meaning that the Commissioner does not have to complete that process and can amend the taxpayer's assessment under section 113.
5.  Another example of when the exception may apply is where, in the course of a dispute, a taxpayer wilfully refuses to attend an enquiry made under section 19 on the date specified in the Commissioner's notice. In these circumstances, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that that it is considered that an offence has been committed under section 143F that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process. The Commissioner can then exercise the discretion to amend the taxpayer's assessment under section 113 without completing the disputes process.
6.  In order to apply this exception, Inland Revenue officers must form an opinion that is honestly and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the evidence available, that the disputant has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act. The Inland Revenue officer's decision must be clearly documented and stipulate the grounds and reasoning on which it is based.

##### Exception 2: A taxpayer involved in a dispute, or person associated to them, may take steps to shift, relocate or dispose of the taxpayer's assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax, making the issue of an assessment urgent (section 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii)).

7.  If the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer or a person associated with them ("associated person") intends to dispose of assets in order to avoid or defer the payment of an outstanding or pending tax liability, the Commissioner can urgently issue an assessment to the taxpayer. Section 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii) reads:
    2.  the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the disputant may take steps in relation to the existence or location of the disputant's assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax from the disputant:
    3.  the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that a person who is an associated person of the disputant may take steps in relation to the existence or location of the disputant's assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax from the disputant:
8.  In order to issue an assessment on the basis of either of the above exceptions, Inland Revenue officers must record any relevant correspondence and evidence (for example, the directors' written instructions to shift the company's assets overseas, evidence of electronic wiring of funds to overseas countries, transcripts of interviews with the taxpayer, etc) or other grounds for the reasonable belief.

##### Exception 3: The taxpayer involved in a dispute or a person associated with them involved in another dispute involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v)).

9.  Section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v) reads:
    4.  the disputant has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute:
    5.  a person who is an associated person of the disputant and is involved in another dispute with the Commissioner involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the other dispute:
10.  These exceptions apply to any judicial review proceedings that are brought against the Commissioner. In judicial review proceedings, the parties' resources are likely to be directed away from advancing the dispute through the disputes process.
11.  For the purpose of section 89N(1)(c)(v), an associated person of a taxpayer may be involved in a similar issue to the taxpayer even if the issue relates to a different revenue type. For example, if the dispute between the Commissioner and taxpayer relates to PAYE issues, but the dispute between the Commissioner and person associated with the taxpayer relates to income tax the taxpayer may still be involved in similar issues to the person associated with them.
12.  Even if the two disputes relate to the same revenue type, section 89N(1)(c)(v) will not apply in some circumstances. For example, the dispute with the taxpayer relates to the tax treatment of entertainment expenditure, whereas the dispute with the person associated with the taxpayer relates to the capital and revenue distinction of merger expenditure. The Commissioner would not regard these two disputes as involving similar issues.

##### Exception 4: The taxpayer fails to comply with a statutory requirement for information relating to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(vi)).

13.  Section 89N(1)(c)(vi) reads:
    6.  during the disputes process, the disputant receives from the Commissioner a requirement under a statute for information relating to the dispute and fails to comply with the requirement within a period that is specified in the requirement:
14.  Generally, a taxpayer provides information to Inland Revenue voluntarily. However, when this does not occur the Commissioner can seek information from the taxpayer under a statutory provision, for example sections 17 or 19. (The Commissioner's practice regarding section 17 is currently set out in _SPS_ _05/08: Section 17 Notices_.) The requirement for statutory information will specify the period within which the information must be provided. This period will allow the taxpayer reasonable and sufficient time to comply.
15.  Where the taxpayer does not comply with a formal requirement for information that relates to a dispute (for example, as a tactic to delay the progress of the disputes process), the Commissioner can issue an assessment to the taxpayer without first completing the disputes process.

##### Exception 5: The parties agree in writing that the dispute should be resolved by the court or TRA without completing the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(viii)).

16.  Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) reads:
    8.  the disputant and the Commissioner agree in writing that they have reached a position in which the dispute would be resolved more efficiently by being submitted to the court or Taxation Review Authority without completion of the disputes process:
17.  Under this exception, where the Commissioner or taxpayer commences the disputes process, the parties can make such an agreement in writing before either party issues their SOP. This would occur, for example, if the parties could incur excessive compliance and administrative costs in completing the full disputes process relative to the amount in dispute.
18.  This exception allows the taxpayer to bring challenge proceedings against the Commissioner. The parties must have exchanged a NOPA and NOR before the taxpayer can bring challenge proceedings under section 138B(1).
19.  The circumstances under which the Commissioner will enter into such an agreement are discussed in detail from paragraph 172 to 195. This SPS refers to this exception as opting out of the disputes process or "opt out".

##### Exception 6: The parties agree in writing to suspend the disputes process pending the outcome of a test case (section 89N(1)(c)(ix)).

20.  Section 89N(1)(c)(ix) reads:
    9.  the disputant and the Commissioner agree in writing to suspend proceedings in the dispute pending a decision in a test case referred to in section 89O.
21.  Section 89O(2) allows a dispute to be suspended pending the result of a test case. Pursuant to section 89O(3), the parties can agree in writing to suspend the dispute from the date of the agreement until the earliest date that:
    NaN.  the court's decision is made, or
    NaN.  the test case is otherwise resolved, or
    NaN.  the dispute is otherwise resolved.
22.  If the parties agree to suspend the disputes process, any statutory time bar affecting the dispute is stayed. The Commissioner can then make an assessment that is consistent with the test case decision. (However, the taxpayer is not precluded from challenging the Commissioner's assessment under section 89D(1), even if it is consistent with the test case decision.)
23.  The Commissioner must issue an amended assessment or perform an action within the time limit specified in section 89O(5).
24.  Section 89O(5) reads:
    
    *   The Commissioner must make an amended assessment, or perform an action, that is the subject of a suspended dispute by the later of the following:
    
    NaN.  the day that is 60 days after the last day of the suspension:
    NaN.  the last day of the period that -
        1.  begins on the day following the day by which the Commissioner, in the absence of the suspension, would be required under the Inland Revenue Acts to make the amended assessment, or perform the action; and
        2.  contains the same number of days as does the period of the suspension.
25.  If the statutory time bar arising under section 108 or 108A is imminent, section 89O(5) allows the Commissioner more time to complete the disputes process.
26.  For example, the Commissioner commences a dispute and on 1 March 2010 agrees with the taxpayer in writing to suspend the disputes proceedings pending the decision in a designated test case. The disputed issue is subject to a statutory time bar that commences after 31 March 2010 and the taxpayer does not agree to delay its application under section 108B(1)(a). A decision is reached in the test case on 31 July 2010.
27.  The Commissioner must make an amended assessment or perform an action that is the subject of the suspended dispute by 29 September 2010. This date is calculated as follows:
    NaN.  The suspension period commences on the date of the agreement (1 March 2010) and ends on the date of the court's decision in the test case (31 July 2010). This is a period of 153 days.
    NaN.  The last date that the Commissioner can make an amended assessment falls on the later of the following two dates:
        1.  29 September 2010, that is 60 days after the date that the suspension period ends on 31 July 2010 pursuant to section 89O(5)(a), and
        2.  31 August 2010, that is 153 days after the period commences on 1 April 2010 pursuant to section 89O(5)(b).

##### Exception 7: The Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to allow more time to complete or dispense with the disputes process.

28.  Section 89N(3) reads:
    *   … \[T\]he Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order that allows more time for the completion of the disputes process, or for an order that completion of the disputes process is not required.
29.  The Commissioner envisages that this exception will be used if section 89N(1)(c) does not apply and there are exceptional circumstances.
30.  Any application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3) must be based on reasonable grounds. Whether there are reasonable grounds will depend on considerations such as the complexity of the issues in the dispute, whether the taxpayer has caused delays; whether the dispute involves large amounts of revenue or whether there were significant matters in the dispute that were unforeseen by either party and provided a justification for the delay.
31.  For example, due to unusual circumstances the Commissioner does not learn about a proposed adjustment until late. Further delays by the taxpayer and the need for the Commissioner to obtain significant legal advice means that the Disputes Review Unit cannot consider the dispute before the time bar applies. In these circumstances, the Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order that allows more time for the disputes process to be completed under section 89N(3). (Note: This is only an example of a possible unforeseen situation and it is anticipated that there will be a wide variety of circumstances under which an application under section 89N(3) will be appropriate.)
32.  The Commissioner's application to the High Court under section 89N(3) must be made before the four-year statutory time bar falls due.
33.  The Commissioner must also issue an amended assessment within the time limit specified in section 89N(5).Section 89N(5) reads:
    
    *   If the Commissioner makes an application under subsection (3), the Commissioner must make an amended assessment by the last day of the period that -
    
    NaN.  begins on the day following the day by which the Commissioner, in the absence of the suspension, would be required under the Inland Revenue Acts to make the amended assessment; and
    NaN.  contains the total of -
        1.  the number of days between the date on which the Commissioner files the application in the High Court and the earliest date on which the application is decided by the High Court or the application or dispute is resolved:
        2.  the number of days allowed by an order of a court as a result of the application.
34.  Section 89N(5) allows the Commissioner more time to complete the disputes process where the statutory time bar under section 108 or 108A is imminent.
35.  For example, the Commissioner commences the disputes process. On 1 March 2010 the Commissioner applies to the High Court under section 89N(3) for an order allowing more time to complete the process. The disputed issue is subject to a statutory time bar that commences after 31 March 2010 and the taxpayer does not agree to delay its application under section 108B(1)(a) On 30 June 2010, the High Court makes an order that allows the Commissioner's application and gives the Commissioner 30 further days to complete the disputes process.
36.  Pursuant to section 89N(5), the Commissioner must make an amended assessment by 30 August 2010. This date is calculated as follows:
    NaN.  The Commissioner would have one month to make the amended assessment before the statutory time bar commences. That is, 1 March 2010 to 31 March 2010. The period during which an amended assessment must be made under section 89N(5)(a) commences on 1 April 2010.
    NaN.  The period during which the assessment must be made includes 122 days, that is the period between 1 March 2010 and 30 June 2010 (the date of the decision) under section 89N(5)(b)(i) and the 30-day period allowed by the High Court order under section 89N(5)(b)(ii). This is a total of 152 days.
    NaN.  The Commissioner must issue an amended assessment to the taxpayer on the date that is 152 days from 1 April 2010. That is, by 30 August 2010.
37.  During the period from 1 March to 30 August 2010, the parties may continue to attempt to resolve the dispute. This may include exchanging SOPs and going through the adjudication process.
38.  The above example indicates that the Commissioner has more time to complete the disputes process. The time bar will not commence until 30 August 2010.
39.  Where the Commissioner applies to the High Court under section 89N(3) for an order to truncate the disputes process, an assessment must be issued within the period as calculated under section 89N(5). Applying the same facts as in the above example, the Commissioner must issue an assessment to the taxpayer by 30 August 2010.

Withdrawn statement SPS 11/06 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This item also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 23 Issue 09 (November 2011).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") discusses a taxpayer's rights and responsibilities in respect of an assessment or other disputable decision when the taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process.
2.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").
3.  Where the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner's practice is stated in SPS 11/05: _Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue._
4.  The Commissioner regards this SPS as a reference guide for taxpayers and Inland Revenue officers. Where possible, Inland Revenue officers must follow the practices outlined in this SPS.
5.  The disputes resolution process is designed to ensure that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process.
6.  The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an "all cards on the table" approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to a court.
7.  One of the most significant changes introduced by the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011 is the amendments made to the exclusion rule in section 138G of the TAA. The effect of this change is that the Commissioner and disputant are now only restricted to issues and propositions of law disclosed in their respective Statements of Position, in subsequent challenge proceedings. The Commissioner does not view this change as detracting from the desirability, as far as practicable, for both parties to a dispute to disclose all relevant facts and evidence as early as possible in order to resolve a dispute. For the purposes of this SPS, the Commissioner for convenience will refer to the new rule in section 138G as the "issues and propositions of law exclusion rule".
8.  In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment.

### Application

9.  This SPS applies from 13 October 2011 and incorporates legislative changes to the disputes process enacted in the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011.
10.  It replaces SPS 10/05: _Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer_ dated 8 November 2010.

### Background

11.  The tax dispute resolution procedures were introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the Richardson Committee in the _Report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department_ (April 1994) and were designed to reduce the number of disputes by:
    NaN.  promoting full disclosure, and
    NaN.  encouraging the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes, and
    NaN.  promoting the early identification of issues, and
    NaN.  improving the accuracy of decisions.
12.  The disputes resolution process ensures that there is full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process.
13.  The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an "all cards on the table" approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to encourage as far as practicable, the disclosure of all relevant evidence, facts, issues and propositions of law before a case proceeds to a court or hearing authority.
14.  The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps specified in the TAA. The main elements of those steps are the issue of:
    NaN.  A notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA"): this is a notice that either the Commissioner or taxpayer issues to the other advising that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer's assessment, the Commissioner's assessment or other disputable decision (the prescribed form is the _IR770_ _Notice of proposed adjustment_). A NOPA is the formal document which begins the disputes process.
    NaN.  A notice of response ("NOR"): this must be issued by the recipient of a NOPA if they disagree with it (the preferred form is the _IR771 Notice of response_).
    NaN.  A notice rejecting the Commissioner's NOR: this must be issued by the taxpayer if they disagree with the Commissioner's NOR (there is no prescribed form for a notice rejecting the Commissioner's NOR).
    NaN.  A disclosure notice and statement of position ("SOP"): the issue of a disclosure notice by the Commissioner triggers the requirement for the taxpayer to provide a SOP to continue the dispute. Each SOP must provide an outline of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the positions taken. Each party must issue a SOP (the preferred form is the _IR773 Statement_ _of position_). The SOPs are important documents because they limit the issues and propositions of law that either party can rely on if the case proceeds to court to what is included in the SOPs (unless a hearing authority makes an order that allows a party to raise new issues and propositions of law under section 138G(2)).
15.  There are also two administrative phases in the disputes process: the conference and adjudication phases. If the dispute has not been already resolved after the NOR phase, the Commissioner's practice will be to hold a conference. A conference can be a formal or informal discussion between the parties to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues.
16.  If the dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase and the exchange of SOPs, the Commissioner will usually refer the dispute to adjudication, except in limited circumstances. Adjudication involves Inland Revenue independently considering a dispute and is the final phase in the disputes process before the taxpayer's assessment is amended (if it is to be amended) following the exchange of the SOPs.
17.  Timely progression of disputes through the disputes process may require the use of the Commissioner's information-gathering powers (particularly section 17) before and/or during the disputes process.
18.  Inland Revenue has a quality assurance review process known as Core Task Assurance ("CTA") which is designed to ensure that key pieces of work (including NORs and SOPs) are subject to an independent review by Legal and Technical Services before being issued. Given the importance of the disputes process to the Commissioner and to taxpayers, Inland Revenue officers are required to get CTA approval of disputes documents prior to issue.

### Standard Practice and Analysis

#### Assessment

#### Taxpayer's assessment

22.  Section 92(1) reads:
    *   A taxpayer who is required to furnish a return of income for a tax year must make an assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable for the tax year, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due.
23.  Section 92(1) applies to tax on income derived in:
    1.  the 2005-06 and later tax years for a taxpayer whose income year matches the tax year, and
    2.  the corresponding income year for a taxpayer whose income year is different from the 2005-06 and later tax years.
24.  If a taxpayer has to file an income tax return they must make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due. The definition of disputable decision in section 3(1) includes an assessment made by a taxpayer.
25.  Similar requirements apply to a taxpayer who must file a GST return under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GST Act"). For a GST return period that begins on or after 1 April 2005, the taxpayer must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable. Section 92B(1) reads:
    *   A taxpayer who is required under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide a GST tax return for a GST return period must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable by the taxpayer for the return period.
26.  Pursuant to sections 92(2) and 92B(2) the assessment date for an income tax or GST assessment made by a taxpayer is the date that Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer's tax return.
27.  When the taxpayer's assessment is received, the Commissioner's practice is to stamp, either electronically or manually, the tax return with the date of receipt. This date is then entered into Inland Revenue's computerised database and a return acknowledgment form is sent to the taxpayer or agent. This practice ensures that the taxpayer will have a clear record of when their assessment was made.
28.  Under section 92B(3) for a GST assessment and section 92(6) for an income tax assessment, a taxpayer cannot make an assessment of the amount of tax payable for a return period in their tax return if the Commissioner has previously made an assessment of the tax that is payable for that return period. This is commonly known as a "default assessment" and involves the Commissioner making a default determination that estimates the taxpayer's tax liability (for example, if they have missed a return filing deadline).
29.  For further discussion regarding how a taxpayer can dispute a default assessment see paragraphs 42 to 54.

### The Commissioner's assessment

30.  Notwithstanding section 92(1) and subject to the statutory time bar in sections 108 and 108A, the Commissioner can sometimes issue a notice of assessment to a taxpayer.
31.  The Commissioner cannot make an assessment without first issuing a NOPA to a taxpayer, unless an exception under section 89C to the requirement for issuing a NOPA applies.
32.  The exceptions under section 89C are explained in Appendix 1 of SPS 11/05_: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ or any replacement SPS. The Commissioner must ensure that any assessment is made in accordance with section 89C. However, if, on a rare occasion, an assessment was made in breach of section 89C, it will still be regarded as being valid under section 114(a).
33.  If the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D(1).

#### Notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA)

#### A Taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner

34.  A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in the following situations:

##### Situation 1: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner's assessment

35.  Section 89D(1) reads:
    *   If the Commissioner-
        1.  issues a notice of assessment to a taxpayer; and  
            has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment, whether or not in breach of section 89C,-  
            the taxpayer may, subject to subsection (2), issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the assessment.

36.  When the Commissioner issues to a taxpayer a notice of assessment that does not relate to a "default assessment" (as discussed in paragraph 28) without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of the assessment. A taxpayer's response to a default assessment is discussed in Situation 2.
37.  A taxpayer's NOPA is not an assessment. It is an initiating action that allows open and full communication between the parties. A NOPA forms a basis for ensuring that the Commissioner does not issue an assessment without some formal and structured dialogue with the taxpayer in respect of the grounds upon which the Commissioner is issuing any assessment or amended assessment (_McIlraith v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,456).
38.  If the Commissioner has issued an assessment the taxpayer can issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) in respect of any of the considerations that were relevant to making the assessment. This could include preliminary decisions which are necessary to make the assessment, for example, a decision made by the Commissioner under section 89C (_MR Forestry (No 1) Trust Ltd v CIR_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,954).
39.  The taxpayer must issue the NOPA within the applicable "response period" as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the assessment unless the Commissioner accepts a late NOPA under section 89K(1). However, this response period is subject to the exception discussed in Situation 6.
40.  For example, if the Commissioner's notice of assessment is issued on 7 April 2008, under section 89D(1) the taxpayer must issue a NOPA in the prescribed form in respect of the assessment on or before 6 August 2008.
41.  The taxpayer's right to issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) is unaffected, even if, in a very rare circumstance, the Commissioner made the assessment in breach of section 89C. The assessment will be deemed to be valid under section 114(a).

##### Situation 2: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner's default assessment

42.  If a taxpayer has not filed a tax return, the Commissioner can make a default assessment under section 106(1) without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer.
43.  Section 89D(2) reads:
    *   A taxpayer who has not furnished a return of income for an assessment period may dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner only by furnishing a return of income for the assessment period.
44.  A taxpayer that intends to dispute a default assessment through the disputes process must:
    1.  pursuant to section 89D(2) provide a tax return for the period to which the default assessment relates notwithstanding that the tax return cannot include the taxpayer's assessment (section 89D(2A)), and
    2.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the default assessment.
45.  Similar rules apply to a NOPA that a taxpayer issues in respect of a GST default assessment.
46.  Section 89D(2C) reads:
    *   A taxpayer who has not provided a GST tax return for a GST return period may not dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner other than by providing a GST return for the GST return period.
47.  Where a taxpayer has not filed a GST return, the Commissioner can make a GST default assessment without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer.
48.  If a taxpayer wants to dispute a GST default assessment through the disputes process, they must:
    1.  provide a GST return for the periods to which the GST default assessment relates pursuant to section 89D(2C), notwithstanding that the tax return cannot include the taxpayer's assessment (section 89D(2D)), and
    2.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the GST default assessment,  
        within the applicable response period. That is, within four months from the date that the default assessment is issued.
49.  The legislative requirement to provide a tax return in respect of a default assessment made by the Commissioner when issuing a NOPA is an additional requirement of the disputes process. This ensures that the taxpayer has provided the requisite statutory information before they dispute the assessment.
50.  If the Commissioner agrees with taxpayer's tax return and NOPA, the Commissioner will amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 or 108A and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion.
51.  However, if the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer's tax return and NOPA the Commissioner cannot amend the default assessment. Instead, the Commissioner must issue a NOR to the taxpayer within the relevant response period to continue the disputes process.
52.  The taxpayer cannot commence a dispute or challenge proceedings in a hearing authority by simply filing the tax return to which the default assessment relates. The taxpayer must issue a NOPA with their tax return.
53.  If a NOPA is not issued, the Commissioner cannot be compelled to amend the default assessment on receipt of the taxpayer's tax return. However, the Commissioner will amend the assessment under section 113 on the basis of the information provided in the tax return subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion if this would ensure that the assessment was correct. (See SPS 07/03: _Requests to amend assessments_ for further details.)Any amended assessment will be the Commissioner's assessment in this circumstance.
54.  The Commissioner can decide not to amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 on the basis of the tax return provided.

##### Situation 3: NOPA in respect of a deemed assessment made under section 80H

55.  Section 89D(2B) reads:
    *   A taxpayer to whom section 80F applies who has not furnished an amended income statement for an assessment period may dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H only by furnishing an amended income statement for the assessment period.
56.  Section 89D(2B) applies to a taxpayer who derives income solely from salary, wages, interest and dividends and who will receive an income statement from the Commissioner under section 80D(1).
57.  Generally, where the taxpayer considers that the income statement is incorrect, they must advise the Commissioner of the reasons and provide the relevant information to correct the income statement under section 80F(1). This must be done within the statutory time limit. That is, the later of:
    1.  the taxpayer's terminal tax date for the tax year to which the income statement relates, and
    2.  two months after the date that the income statement is issued.
58.  If the taxpayer does not provide the relevant information within the statutory time limit, they will be treated as having filed a tax return under section 80G(2) and made an assessment under section 80H in respect of that income statement. In this case, the date of the deemed assessment under section 80H will be the date that the statutory time limit under section 80F expires.
59.  Pursuant to section 89D(2B), the taxpayer cannot issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of the deemed assessment made under section 80H without first satisfying their statutory obligation to file an amended income statement for the assessment period.
60.  If a taxpayer wants to dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H, they must:
    1.  provide an amended income statement for the assessment period, and
    2.  issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the assessment within the applicable response period (that is, four months after the date that the deemed assessment is issued.)

##### Situation 4: NOPA in respect of a disputable decision that is not an assessment

61.  Under section 89D(3) a taxpayer can issue a NOPA in respect of a disputable decision that is not an assessment. Section 89D(3) reads:
    *   If the Commissioner-
        1.  issues a notice of disputable decision that is not a notice of assessment; and
        2.  the notice of disputable decision affects the taxpayer, -  
            the taxpayer, or any other person who has the standing under a tax law to do so on behalf of the taxpayer, may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the disputable decision.

62.  For the purpose of section 89D(3) a person with standing under a tax law to issue a NOPA on behalf of the taxpayer includes a tax advisor and an approved advisor group.

63.  Section 3(1) defines a "disputable decision" to include:
    *   2.  a decision of the Commissioner under a tax law, except for a decision -
            NaN.  to decline to issue a binding ruling under Part 5A; or
            NaN.  that cannot be the subject of an objection under Part 8; or
            NaN.  that cannot be challenged under Part 8A; or
            NaN.  to issue a Commissioner's notice of proposed adjustment under section 89B, a Commissioner's disclosure notice or statement of position under section 89M, or a challenge notice.

64.  A "decision of the Commissioner under a tax law" generally refers to a tax law that specifically confers a discretion or power on the Commissioner. Paragraph (b)(iii) excludes from the definition of "disputable decision" any decision that cannot be challenged under Part 8A.

65.  For example, if the Commissioner:
    1.  decides not exercise the discretion under- section 113 to amend a taxpayer's income tax assessment, or
    2.  makes a decision under section 108A(3) regarding the application of the time bar, or
    3.  does not agree to a time bar waiver under section 108B,  
        section 138E(1)(e)(iv) (within Part 8A) provides that these decisions cannot be challenged. Therefore, these decisions are not disputable decisions for the purposes of section 89D(3). However, under section 89D(1), the taxpayer can issue a NOPA in respect of the initial assessment if the Commissioner has not previously issued a NOPA in respect of that assessment.

66.  A decision made by the Commissioner under section 108(2) (to increase an assessment) is not of itself, and in the absence of an assessment, a disputable decision. Any challenge to the correctness of the decision must be brought in the context of a challenge to the assessment itself (_Vinelight Nominees Ltd & Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2)_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,519).
67.  Paragraph (b)(iv) of the definition of "disputable decision" in section 3(1) also excludes a decision to issue a Commissioner's notice of proposed adjustment under section 89B, a Commissioner's disclosure notice or statement of position under section 89M, or a challenge notice.
68.  However, a taxpayer may challenge the Commissioner's refusal to accept a late NOPA, NOR of SOP in terms of section 89K(6) in the Taxation Review Authority. The Commissioner's refusal notice is treated for the limited purposes in section 89K(6) as a notice of disputable decision and subject to direct challenge to the Taxation Review Authority, without the need to commence the dispute with a NOPA.
69.  The exceptions specified in paragraph (b) of the definition of "disputable decision" ensure that only substantive issues are disputed as disputable decisions and the procedural components of the disputes process do not, in themselves, give rise to disputes although they may be amenable to judicial review.
70.  The following examples illustrate what is a disputable decision:
    1.  A taxpayer who is a natural person can dispute the Commissioner's decision made under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA 2007") that they are a New Zealand resident for taxation purposes.
    2.  Under section RD 3(5) of the ITA 2007, the Commissioner can determine whether, and to what extent, a payment is subject to PAYE. This determination cannot be challenged by the taxpayer and, therefore, is excluded from the definition of "disputable decision" under section 3(1)(b)(iii). However, an employer or employee can dispute an assessment of tax deductions on the basis that a section RD 3(5) determination on which it is founded is wrong in fact or law.
71.  The taxpayer must issue the NOPA to the Commissioner within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the notice of disputable decision or notice revoking or varying a disputable decision that is not an assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1).-
72.  It is important to note that issuing a NOPA is not the only way that a taxpayer can raise concerns about a disputable decision that they consider is incorrect. They are quite entitled to engage with Inland Revenue to raise concerns about a disputable decision that has been reached or to provide additional information.
73.  However, it is only by issuing a NOPA that a taxpayer can dispute a disputable decision through the disputes process.

##### Situation 5: NOPA in respect of a taxpayer's assessment

74.  Section 89DA(1) reads:
    *   A taxpayer may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of an assessment made by the taxpayer for a tax year or a GST return period if the Commissioner has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment.
75.  If a taxpayer needs to file an income tax return they must also make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability under section 92(1) unless the Commissioner has previously made an assessment for that tax year (section 92(6)).
76.  Section 89DA(1) also applies to a taxpayer's GST assessment for a return period. A taxpayer who has to file a GST return must also make an assessment of the amount of GST payable for the return period under section 92B(1).
77.  The date on which a taxpayer's assessment of income tax is made is the date on which the taxpayer's return of income is received at an office of Inland Revenue (section 92(2)). A taxpayer's assessment of the amount of GST payable is made on the date on which the taxpayer's GST tax return is received at an office of Inland Revenue (section 92B(2)).
78.  Pursuant to section 89DA(1), a taxpayer can issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of their own tax assessment.
79.  The taxpayer's NOPA must be issued within the applicable response period as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1).
80.  The date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment will be determined under section 14B. For example, under section 14B(8), the Commissioner will receive a NOPA that the taxpayer sends by post on the date that it would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.

##### Situation 6: NOPA that relates solely to a research and development tax credit

81.  Under section 89DA(3), a taxpayer can also issue a NOPA that relates solely to a research and development expenditure tax credit arising from a notice of assessment that they have previously issued for the 2008-09 tax year.
82.  The NOPA must be issued within the period that starts on the date on which the Commissioner receives the taxpayer's assessment and ends two years after the latest date on which a taxpayer can provide a return of income for the 2008-09 tax year. This response period is an exception to the general response period that applies for disputing taxpayer assessments.
83.  As the research and development expenditure tax credit has been repealed from the 2009-10 tax year onwards this response period has limited application and it is not intended to discuss it further in this SPS.

#### Contents of a taxpayer's NOPA

84.  A NOPA is the document that commences the disputes process. It is intended to identify the true points of contention and explain the legal or technical aspects of the issuer's position in relation to the proposed adjustment in a formal and understandable manner. This will ensure that information relevant to the dispute is quickly made available to the parties. Section 89F(1) and (3) specifies the content requirements for any NOPA that a taxpayer may issue.

85.  Section 89F reads:
    
    1.  A notice of proposed adjustment must -
        1.  contain sufficient detail of the matters described in subsections (2) and (3) to identify the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant; and
        2.  be in the prescribed form.
    
    …
    
    3.  A notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant must -
        1.  identify the adjustment or adjustments proposed to be made to the assessment; and
        2.  provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the disputant's proposed adjustment or adjustments; and
        3.  state how the law applies to the facts; and
        4.  include copies of the documents of which the disputant is aware at the time that the notice is issued that are significantly relevant to the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant.

86.  The prescribed form for a NOPA as required under section 89F(1)(b) is the [_IR770 Notice of proposed adjustment_ form](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-700-799/ir770-form-prpsd-adjust-return.html)
    . A handwritten NOPA in this form is acceptable. Additional information can also be attached to the prescribed form.
87.  If the Commissioner receives a NOPA that is not in the prescribed form or has insufficient detail under section 89F(1)(a) the Commissioner's practice will be to advise the taxpayer that the NOPA must be in the prescribed form or include sufficient information. If this occurs on the last day of the response period the Commissioner will consider any resubmitted NOPA under section 89K(1) (see paragraph 119).
88.  If the taxpayer's NOPA does not satisfy the content requirements under section 89F(1)(a) and (3) the Commissioner can reject the NOPA and not issue a NOR (see paragraphs 111 to 118 ).
89.  When issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer must state the facts and law in sufficient detail, state how the law applies to the facts, and include copies of the documents that are significantly relevant to the dispute and known to the taxpayer when they issue the NOPA.
90.  The Commissioner cannot treat a tax return provided by the taxpayer as a NOPA because it will not satisfy the requirements in section 89F(1) and (3).
91.  Section 89F(3)(b) requires that the taxpayer's NOPA states the key facts and law concisely and in sufficient detail. The term "sufficient detail" means that the document must contain adequate analysis of the law and facts that are relevant to the dispute. This means sufficient discussion of the law to enable the Commissioner to clearly understand the proposed adjustment.
92.  The Commissioner considers that it is necessary that the taxpayer provides "a statement of the facts and law in sufficient detail" to ensure that they have fully considered issues before they raise them in their NOPA and to reduce further administrative and compliance costs.

_**Identify the proposed adjustment - section 89F(3)(a)**_

93.  The taxpayer must identify the proposed adjustment in their NOPA. This includes for each proposed adjustment:
    1.  the amount or impact of the adjustment, and
    2.  the tax year or period to which the proposed adjustment relates.
94.  The proposed adjustment should be set out as specifically as possible. For example:
    *   "increase the 2007 repairs and maintenance expenditure by $3,000";
    *   "increase the GST input tax deduction by $4,000 in the August 2007 return period".

_**Provide a statement of the facts and law in sufficient detail - section 89F(3)(b)**_

**Facts**

95.  To provide a brief and accurate statement of facts, the taxpayer must focus on the material factual matters relevant to the legal issues. The taxpayer must include the facts necessary for proving all the arguments raised in support of each adjustment, including any facts that are inconsistent with any argument that the Commissioner has previously raised.
96.  The taxpayer should endeavour to disclose all the relevant material facts clearly and with adequate amounts of detail relative to the complexity of the issues. The taxpayer is best suited to do this because they are- usually very familiar with the background and facts that relate to the dispute. Disclosing the background and facts at the NOPA phase helps to resolve the dispute at an earlier stage. However, the taxpayer should not overstate the facts with irrelevant detail or repetition.
97.  In complex cases, the Commissioner expects the taxpayer to explain the relevant facts clearly and methodically. The taxpayer should also assist the Commissioner to understand the background and facts of the dispute, so as to facilitate a speedy resolution of the case. The taxpayer should explain the facts and law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the adjustment. It is unhelpful and can cause delays if the Commissioner has to second guess the factual bases of the taxpayer's case.
98.  For example, in a dispute that involves a complex financial arrangement, the taxpayer should explain each element of it. This includes explaining the background to the financial arrangement, identifying the parties involved, highlighting the relevant clauses in an agreement, etc.

**Law**

99.  Each proposed adjustment should stipulate the relevant section or sections that the taxpayer relies on and including, if a section has multiple independent parts, the applicable subsection(s).
100.  It is important that the taxpayer includes an adequate amount of analysis of the applicable legal principles or tests in their NOPA. If possible these should be supported by case authorities with full citations. For example, in a dispute that involves the tax treatment of a trade-tie payment, the taxpayer must apply the legal principles from a leading case such as _Birkdale Service Station v CIR_ (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. However, it is not necessary to laboriously describe large numbers of precedent cases on the same issue or include extracts from each.

_How the law applies to the facts - section 89F(3)(c)_

101.  The taxpayer must apply the legal arguments to the facts. This ensures that the proposed adjustment is not a statement that appears out of context in relation to the rest of the document. The Commissioner considers that the application of the law to the facts should logically support the proposed adjustment and be stated clearly and in detail.
102.  The taxpayer should present the materials and arguments on which they intend to rely or on which reliance will be placed. That is, if more than one argument supports the same or a similar outcome, all arguments should be made and supported by evidence. For each proposition of law, it is recommended that the NOPA makes a clear link to an outline of supporting facts.

_Include copies of the relevant documents that support the adjustment - section 89F(3)(d)_

103.  The taxpayer must provide full copies of the documents that they know are significantly relevant to the dispute and in existence when they issue the NOPA. This ensures that the Commissioner has all the relevant information necessary to respond to the NOPA.
104.  For example:
    1.  A taxpayer proposes an adjustment to GST input tax credits in their NOPA. The taxpayer must provide copies of the relevant tax invoices as documentary evidence in their NOPA.
    2.  A taxpayer's dispute involves a sale of land transaction. The taxpayer must provide a copy of the sale and purchase agreement and other relevant correspondence between the vendor and the purchaser as documentary evidence in their NOPA.
105.  In some cases, new documentary evidence can emerge, as the dispute progresses. For example, the documentation is quite old and may have been misplaced. The taxpayer may be unaware of these documents when the NOPA was issued. The parties should then exchange this new evidence when it becomes known or available.
106.  Where a taxpayer is aware of a particular document that is significantly relevant to their dispute, but cannot obtain a copy of it, the taxpayer should include the following matters in their NOPA:
    1.  the nature of the document and its relevance to the dispute, and
    2.  the reasonable steps that the taxpayer has taken to obtain a copy of the document, and
    3.  the expected date that the document will be made available to the Commissioner.
107.  However, this practice should not be treated as dispensing with the requirements under section 89F(3)(d). The Commissioner still expects the taxpayer will send copies of the relevant documents mentioned in their NOPA as soon as they become available.

#### Receipt of a taxpayer's NOPA

108.  Inland Revenue will usually assign a taxpayer's NOPA to the responsible officer within five working days after it is received.
109.  After receiving the NOPA, the responsible officer will determine and record the following:
    1.  the date on which the NOPA was issued, whether the NOPA has been issued within the applicable response period and the date by which the Commissioner's response must be issued, and
    2.  the NOPA's salient features including any deficiencies in its content.
110.  Where practicable, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent that it has received the NOPA by telephone or in writing within 10 working days.

##### Deficiencies in the contents of a NOPA

111.  Where Inland Revenue has received a NOPA that it considers deficient (that is, the requirements under section 89F(1)(a) and (3) may not be met), the responsible Inland Revenue officer will take reasonable steps to have the taxpayer correct the information in the NOPA before the response period expires.
112.  The taxpayer will be advised as soon as practicable that the Commissioner considers that the NOPA may not meet the requirements of section 89F(1)(a) and (3) and why. They will also be advised that any additional or corrected information should be provided within the response period.
113.  Taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOPA immediately after they have completed it because they could have insufficient time to rectify any deficiencies if the response period is due to expire.
114.  Generally where the deficiencies are not able to be remedied but the NOPA advances sufficient argument to allow the dispute to progress, then the Commissioner will continue with the dispute. The argument that the NOPA is deficient will be incorporated into the Commissioner's SOP and the Commissioner will also fully argue the substantive issue.
115.  However, if the NOPA received is highly unsatisfactory the Commissioner is unlikely to continue with the dispute. This will be on the grounds that the NOPA does not satisfy the requirements set out in section 89F(1)(a) and (3).
116.  A NOPA is likely to be considered highly unsatisfactory only where the taxpayer's position is materially inconsistent and not capable of coherent explanation, or there is no observable explanation at all of the taxpayer's grounds for dispute. In these situations the dispute will be treated as if it has never commenced (unless the taxpayer resubmits a late NOPA and the Commissioner accepts it under one of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K).
117.  In considering the adequacy of the taxpayer's NOPA, the Commissioner's view will not be based on the strength or weakness of the taxpayer's argument. The Commissioner will only be concerned with whether the NOPA meets its statutory requirements.
118.  The approach outlined above is consistent with that taken by the Court of Appeal in _CIR v Alam and Begum_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,564.

#### NOPA that a taxpayer has issued outside the applicable response period

119.  The Commissioner cannot accept a NOPA that a taxpayer issues under section 89D or 89DA outside the applicable response period, unless an exceptional circumstance arises or the disputant can prove a demonstrable intention to enter into or continue the disputes process under section 89K of the TAA.

_Exceptional circumstances under section 89K_

120.  The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. The cases on "exceptional circumstances", such as _Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752, _Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR_ (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005, _Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR_ (2001) 17,470 (CA), _Hollis v CIR_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,570, and _Balich v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,230 are also relevant. The case law confirms that the Commissioner should apply the definition of "exceptional circumstances" in sections 89K(3) and 138D consistently.
121.  The following guidelines have emerged from the case law:
    1.  a taxpayer's misunderstanding or erroneous calculation of the applicable response period will usually not be regarded as an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control under section 89K(3)(a);
    2.  an agent's failure to advise their client that they have received a notice of assessment or other relevant documents that causes the taxpayer to respond outside the applicable response period will not generally be considered to be an exceptional circumstance under section 89K(3)(b) (_Hollis v CIR_); and
    3.  an exceptional circumstance can arise if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information that the Commissioner has given them that causes them to respond outside the applicable response period (_Hollis v CIR_).
122.  See _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996) for some examples of situations that can be considered "exceptional circumstances" beyond a taxpayer's control.

123.  Section 89K(3) reads:
    *   For the purpose of subsection (1), -
        1.  An **exceptional circumstance** arises if -
            1.  an event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not rejecting a proposed adjustment, or for not issuing a notice of proposed adjustment or statement of position, within the response period for the notice:
            2.  a disputant is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period:
        2.  An act or omission of an agent of a disputant is not an exceptional circumstance unless-
            1.  it was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that could not have been anticipated, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or
            2.  the agent is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period.

124.  The statutory holiday exception is self-explanatory. The Commissioner can also accept a late NOPA where the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, that is, the document was only one to two days late.
125.  For example, the response period ends on a Saturday and the taxpayer provides a NOPA on the following Tuesday. The Commissioner treats the response period as ending on Monday on the basis of section 35(6) of the Interpretation Act 1999 and accepts that the lateness of the NOPA was minimal. That is, the Commissioner received the NOPA within one to two days of Monday, the last day of the response period. If the response period ended on Friday and the taxpayer provided the NOR on the following Monday, the Commissioner would also accept that the lateness is minimal.
126.  Besides the degree of lateness, the Commissioner will consider the following factors when exercising the exceptional circumstances discretion under section 89K(1):
    1.  the date on which the NOPA was issued, and
    2.  the response period within which the NOPA should be issued, and
    3.  the real event, circumstance- or- reason why the taxpayer did not issue the NOPA within the applicable response period, and
    4.  the taxpayer's compliance history in relation to the tax types under consideration (for example, the taxpayer may have a history of paying tax late or filing late tax returns or NOPAs in the past).
127.  For example, a taxpayer issues a NOPA to the Commissioner two days after the applicable response period has expired. The taxpayer does not provide a legitimate reason for the lateness. The taxpayer also has a history of filing late NOPAs within the minimal allowable lateness period (that is, up to two days outside the applicable response period) and has been advised on the calculation of the response period each time.
128.  Although the degree of lateness was minimal each time, the Commissioner would not accept the taxpayer's NOPA in this circumstance. This ensures that the section 89K(3)(b)(ii) exception is not treated as an extension of the response period in all circumstances.
129.  The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer's application made under section 89K(1)(b) after receiving the relevant NOPA. Where the application is rejected, the Commissioner is required to issue a "refusal notice" within one month of receipt of the application (which must include the late NOPA). The disputant may challenge the Commissioner's refusal notice by taking proceedings directly to the TRA. Where the taxpayer's application is accepted, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer of the Commissioner's decision in writing within one month after Inland Revenue receives the application.
130.  If the Commissioner rejects a taxpayer's application made under section 89K(1), the Commissioner can still consider the validity of the taxpayer's tax position in terms of the practice for applying the discretion under section 113. See _SPS 07/03:_ _Requests to amend assessments_ for details of this practice.

_Demonstrable intention_

131.  Under section 89K(1)(a)(ii) the Commissioner can also treat a late NOPA, as being on time where the Commissioner considers that the disputant had a demonstrable intention to enter into or continue the disputes process at the time the disputant failed to act within the applicable response period.
132.  The concept of "intention to dispute" reflects the court's consideration of when a dispute should be allowed to continue under the old objection regime in Part 8 of the TAA - in particular, the High Court decision in _Gisborne Mills Ltd v CIR_ (1989) 13 TRNZ 405. Robertson J, in _Gisborne Mills_, held that a factor to be taken into account in determining whether the disputant was entitled to continue with their dispute was that they had "consistently asserted that they were entitled to the \[tax outcome they were seeking\]". This was "in marked distinction to a person who, never having contemplated seeking a benefit under the taxing legislation, endeavours to take advantage of a matter when they become aware of a decision affecting another taxpayer".
133.  The officials' issues paper, _Disputes: a review_ (July 2010), in relation to an "intention to dispute test", noted:
    *   The central tenet of any test should be that the taxpayer demonstrates they have, before the deadline, clearly communicated an intention to formally dispute the matter on certain grounds and have not subsequently modified that position.
134.  To support this general proposition Inland Revenue will consider the following further factors in reaching a view as to whether a taxpayer had a demonstrable intention to dispute:
    *   whether the taxpayer has responded to any Inland Revenue correspondence and has consistently asserted their contrary position regarding the substantive issues;
    *   whether the taxpayer has complied with other parts of the disputes process and their overall tax obligations (for example, if the late document in question is the taxpayer's SOP, have they filed a timely NOR?);
    *   whether the taxpayer has corresponded with other relevant parties regarding the dispute, for example, the Minister of Revenue, the Ombudsman or Inland Revenue's
135.  In a dispute where the taxpayer or their agent has not filed an SOP because they have miscalculated the response period (and the degree of lateness does not amount to exceptional circumstances), it could be said that having participated in the earlier stages of the disputes process (including complying with timeframes) that, at the end of the response period, the disputant had a genuine intention to continue with the dispute.
136.  An application will not be accepted if the degree of lateness is unjustified in the circumstances, or it is considered to be designed to defeat the application of the time period or to frustrate the disputes process itself. An example might be a taxpayer who contacts the Commissioner close to a deadline to confirm they intend to dispute, but then does nothing further for some considerable time, effectively rendering the statutory timeframe meaningless.

_Disputant may challenge Commissioner's refusal to accept a late NOPA_

137.  The Commissioner can accept a disputant's late NOPA (and a late rejection of the Commissioner's NOPA or late SOP) by issuing a notice in favour of the disputant stating that the late notice will be treated as being given within the applicable response period. On the other hand, where they are not accepted as being on time, the Commissioner must notify the disputant within one month from when the disputant issues a "late" notice or SOP to the Commissioner, of the Commissioner's decision ("refusal notice"). The disputant may challenge the Commissioner's refusal notice by filing proceedings with the TRA.

#### Timeframes to complete the disputes process

138.  If a taxpayer has issued a NOPA to the Commissioner and the dispute remains unresolved, when practicable, the parties should negotiate a timeframe to ensure that the dispute is progressed in a timely and efficient way.
139.  Agreeing to a timeframe is not statutorily required but, rather, is a critical administrative requirement that requires both parties to be ready to progress matters. The parties should endeavour to meet the agreed timeframe. If there are delays in the progress of the dispute the responsible officer must manage the delay including any relationship with internal advisers and liaise with the taxpayer.
140.  If the negotiated timeframe cannot be achieved, the Commissioner must enter into continuing discussions with the taxpayer, either to arrange a new timeframe, or otherwise keep them advised of when the disclosure notice will be issued. Therefore, the failure to negotiate or adhere to an agreed timeframe will not prevent the case from progressing through the disputes process in a timely manner.
141.  In addition to the above administrative practice, the Commissioner is bound by section 89P. Section 89P provides that where the taxpayer initiated NOPA is issued after 29 August 2011, being the date of enactment of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011, then the Commissioner must issue a challenge notice to a disputant within four years of the issue of the disputant's NOPA. Section 89H(3) provides that where the Commissioner fails to meet the four-year timeframe for issuing a challenge notice, then the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the adjustments proposed in the disputant's NOPA.
142.  Under section 89P(3) the Commissioner cannot issue the challenge notice without completing the disputes process (that is, issue a SOP), unless any of the exceptions in section 89N apply. These exceptions are explained in Appendix 2 of SPS 11/05: _Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ or any replacement SPS.

#### Notice of repsonse (NOR)

#### The Commissioner's response to a taxpyer's NOPA: NOR

143.  If the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer's proposed adjustment, then, under section 89G(1) the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer that any or all of their proposed adjustments are rejected by issuing a NOR within the applicable response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer's NOPA is issued. The Commissioner interprets this to mean that the taxpayer must receive the NOR within this period. For example, if a taxpayer issues a NOPA on 9 April 2010, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of its rejection by issuing to them a NOR and they must receive that NOR on or before 8 June 2010.
144.  Where practicable, the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent within 10 working days- before the response period expires to advise whether the Commissioner intends to issue a NOR to them in response to their NOPA. Such contact may be made by telephone or letter.
145.  The Commissioner must issue the NOR to the taxpayer (section 14(3)(a)) or a representative authorised to act on their behalf (section 14(3)(b)). In respect of the latter, it is a question of fact whether the recipient is authorised to receive the NOR on the taxpayer's behalf. The taxpayer must ensure that their NOPA stipulates the name of the person or agent that they have nominated to receive any NOR issued by the Commissioner (_CIR v Thompson_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,375).
146.  If a tax agent sends a NOPA to the Commissioner although the tax agent would appear to have authority to receive the Commissioner's NOR, the Commissioner's practice will be to contact the tax agent to confirm whether the agent can accept service of the NOR.
147.  Section 89G(2) specifies the content requirements for a NOR. The Commissioner must state concisely in the NOR:
    1.  the facts or legal arguments in the taxpayer's NOPA that the Commissioner considers are wrong; and
    2.  why the Commissioner considers that those facts and arguments are wrong; and
    3.  any facts and legal arguments that the Commissioner relies upon; and
    4.  how the legal arguments apply to the facts; and
    5.  the quantitative adjustment to any figures proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments that the Commissioner relies upon.
148.  Under section 89G(2)(e), the requirement for a quantitative adjustment establishes the extent to which the Commissioner considers that the adjustment in the taxpayer's NOPA is incorrect. This amount need not be exact, although, every attempt should be made to ensure that it is as accurate as possible. The amount in dispute can be varied, as the dispute progresses. For example, if the parties agree on new figures at the conference phase.
149.  The Commissioner considers that Inland Revenue has a statutory obligation to inform the taxpayer adequately. Therefore, any NOR that the Commissioner issues to reject the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA must be relatively brief but sufficiently detailed to explain all the relevant facts, quantitative adjustments, issues and law.

#### Deemed acceptance

150.  Section 89H(2) reads:
    *   If the Commissioner does not, within the response period for a notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant, reject an adjustment contained in the notice, the Commissioner is deemed to accept the proposed adjustment and section 89J applies.
151.  If the Commissioner issues a NOR outside the two-month response period, the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA under section 89H(2). This will finish- the dispute and the Commissioner must issue an assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer pursuant to section 89J(1) (see the discussion in paragraphs 157 to 162).
152.  However, the Commissioner is not precluded from later exercising the discretion under section 113 and issuing to the taxpayer an amended assessment that reflects another adjustment for a different issue to that previously accepted under section 89H(2) for the same tax period.
153.  As discussed above, section 89H(3) provides that where the Commissioner fails to meet the 4 year timeframe for issuing a challenge notice, then the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the adjustments proposed in the disputant's NOPA. The Commissioner must assess the disputant incorporating the adjustments which have been deemed to be accepted: section 89J.

##### Exception to deemed acceptance

154.  Notwithstanding section 89H(2), the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for an order that a NOR can be issued outside the two-month response period under section 89L(1). Section 89L only applies if an exceptional circumstance has occurred or prevented the Commissioner from issuing a NOR to the taxpayer within the response period. The Commissioner will endeavour to apply the requirement for exceptional circumstances in section 89L(1)(a) consistently with the similar requirement in section 89K(1)(a) (see discussion in paragraphs 120 to 130).
155.  Under section 89L(3), an "exceptional circumstance":
    *   Is an event or circumstance beyond the control of the Commissioner or an officer of the Department that provides the Commissioner with a reasonable justification for not rejecting an adjustment proposed by a disputant within the response period; and
156.  For example:
    1.  A flood damaged an Inland Revenue office during the applicable response period for a taxpayer's NOPA. The taxpayer's NOPA was lost in the flood. The Inland Revenue officer could not obtain another copy of the NOPA within the applicable response period. The absence of information has prevented the Commissioner from forming a view on the subject matter in dispute. The Commissioner can apply for a High Court order under section 89L for further time to issue a NOR.
    2.  The Inland Revenue officer to whom a taxpayer's NOPA was assigned is absent on annual leave for the remainder of the response period. The Inland Revenue officer does not arrange for another officer to prepare and issue a NOR to the taxpayer within the response period. The Commissioner is deemed to accept the NOPA under section 89H(2). In this circumstance, the Commissioner does not consider that an exceptional circumstance prevented the Inland Revenue officer from rejecting the adjustment within the response period for the purpose of section 89L(1)(a).
157.  The exceptions for deemed acceptance have been extended and amended in respect of disputes where the taxpayer initiated NOPA is issued after 29 August 2011, being the date of enactment of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011. The Commissioner can apply to the High Court for an order allowing the Commissioner to issue a challenge notice past the 4 year limitation period, where there has been an exceptional circumstance as defined in section 89L(3). The Court application must be made within the 4 year period.

##### Implication of section 89J

158.  Under section 89J(1), if the Commissioner accepts or is deemed to accept any adjustment that is proposed in a taxpayer's NOPA, the Commissioner must include or take account of the adjustment in:
    1.  a notice of assessment; and
    2.  any further notice of assessment or amended assessment  
        that is issued to the taxpayer unless the Commissioner has applied to the High Court for an order that a notice can be issued rejecting the proposed adjustment under section 89L(1) and (1B).
159.  In this circumstance, the Commissioner's practice will be not to later issue a NOPA that purports to reverse any proposed adjustment previously accepted under section 89H(2) because section 89J(1) prevents the Commissioner from issuing to the taxpayer a further amended assessment that does not include or take into account the previously accepted adjustment.
160.  However, pursuant to section 89J(2) the Commissioner does not have to issue a notice of assessment or amended assessment that includes or takes into account an adjustment that the Commissioner has, or is deemed to have accepted, if the Commissioner considers that, in relation to the adjustment, the taxpayer:
    1.  was fraudulent; or
    2.  wilfully misled the Commissioner.
161.  If the Commissioner considers that section 89J(2) applies following deemed acceptance under section 89H(2) the Commissioner cannot resume the earlier disputes process but can later issue a NOPA in respect of any of the adjustments proposed in the earlier disputes process.
162.  Any opinion that the Commissioner forms under section 89J(2) must be honestly held, based on a correct understanding of the relevant grounds and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the facts and law available. An opinion formed by the Commissioner under section 89J(2) is a disputable decision for the purposes of section 89D(3).

#### Rejection of the Commissioner's NOR

163.  If the Commissioner has issued a NOR under section 89G(1) that rejects the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer's NOPA, the taxpayer must reject the Commissioner's NOR within the applicable response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner issues the NOR. Otherwise, the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner's NOR under section 89H(3) and the dispute will finish.
164.  The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner's NOR expires to determine whether the taxpayer will reject the Commissioner's NOR in writing. Such contact can be made by telephone or in writing.
165.  The taxpayer must reject the Commissioner's NOR in writing. The written rejection must be issued within the response period and can be in any form. The taxpayer does not have to expressly reject each of the rejections of proposed adjustments that are included in the Commissioner's NOR. The taxpayer's written rejection must simply make it clear that the taxpayer rejects the Commissioner's NOR.
166.  Where practicable, the taxpayer's written rejection will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue has received it and acknowledged as received within 10 working days.
167.  If deemed acceptance occurs (that is, the taxpayer has not rejected the Commissioner's NOR in writing), the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer of this within two weeks after the response period to the Commissioner's NOR has expired.
168.  Under section 138B(3) a taxpayer can file challenge proceedings upon receipt of the Commissioner's NOR. The Commissioner's practice is to treat a notice of proceedings and statement of claim that the taxpayer serves on the Commissioner within the response period commencing challenge proceedings as also being a request for the Commissioner's agreement to opt out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii). The Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer opting out in these circumstances as it is considered that once a challenge is filed the dispute will be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority.
169.  For taxpayer-initiated NOPAs issued after 29 August 2011, being the date of enactment of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011, a new section 138B(3) applies. The new section 138B(3) provides that a disputant may challenge a self-assessment, where the disputant has issued a NOPA which has been rejected by the Commissioner, but only after the Commissioner has issued a challenge notice. As a challenge notice cannot be issued by the Commissioner until the Commissioner issues a SOP (unless one of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c)(viii) applies), a taxpayer is no longer permitted to unilaterally opt out of the disputes process.
170.  Section 89P(4) requires that a challenge notice must state that the Commissioner will not be issuing an amended assessment that includes or takes into account an adjustment proposed by the disputant, and that a challenge may proceed. The Commissioner must issue a challenge notice within 4 years of the disputant issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner: section 89P(1).

#### Conference phase

##### What is the conference phase of the disputes process?

171.  The conference phase of the disputes process allows the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute to exchange material information relating to the dispute (if this has not already been done prior to the conference phase). More importantly it is an opportunity for the parties to the dispute to try to resolve the differences in their understanding of facts, laws and legal arguments.
172.  The word "resolve" in this context is not limited to final resolution of the dispute. Settlement is a possibility but this is not the only objective of the conference phase. The parties may "resolve" part of the dispute by agreeing on some of the facts and clarifying some of the legal arguments, while agreeing to disagree on other matters, which will become the focus in the later phases of the disputes process.
173.  Generally, if a dispute remains unresolved after the NOR phase, the conference phase will follow.
174.  The conference phase is an administrative process that aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the dispute. However, the conference phase should not be used by either party for the purpose of delaying the completion of the disputes process. The conference phase can involve more than one meeting between the parties and it is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting.

##### Legal and other advisers attending a conference

175.  If a dispute is not settled earlier, the parties can obtain expert legal or other advice during the conference phase in addition to advice previously obtained. These advisers can attend any meetings in relation to the dispute.

##### Conference facilitation

176.  Conference facilitation is a new feature in the conference phase. A facilitated conference will involve an independent internal facilitator who will promote and encourage structured discussion between Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer on an informed basis and with the _bona fide_ intention of resolving the dispute. The conference facilitator will be a senior Inland Revenue officer who will not have been involved in the dispute or given advice on the dispute prior to the conference phase. The facilitator will have sufficient technical knowledge to understand and lead the conference meeting.
177.  The conference facilitator will not be responsible for making any decision in relation to the dispute, except for determining when the conference phase has come to an end. In particular, it is not the role of the facilitator to undertake settlement of the dispute. If this possibility arises it is the responsibility of the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute.
178.  Having a conference facilitated is optional and a conference can be held without a facilitator but, conference facilitation will be offered to all taxpayers as part of the disputes process. The Commissioner's offer of a facilitated conference will be made in writing ("the conference facilitation letter") within one month from the date of issue of the taxpayer's rejection of the Commissioner's NOR. The conference facilitation letter marks the commencement of the conference phase.
179.  The format of the conference meeting need not be limited to a face-to-face meeting. The parties to the dispute may agree to hold a telephone or video conference. (For reasons of simplicity, the SPS refers to "meetings" to include these different conference formats.)
180.  The taxpayer is expected to respond within two weeks from the date of the conference facilitation letter. The taxpayer should indicate whether they will attend the conference meeting, whether they will accept the conference facilitation offer, whether there are any special needs or requirements at the meeting and who else will be attending the meeting. If the taxpayer does not respond within this timeframe, the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute will contact the taxpayer about the conference facilitation letter.

##### Preparation for the conference meeting

181.  When a taxpayer agrees to attend a conference meeting, Inland Revenue will contact the taxpayer within two weeks from the taxpayer's agreement to establish a timeframe and agree on how the meeting will be conducted.
182.  Prior to the conference meeting, the taxpayer should inform Inland Revenue whether their advisors will attend the conference meeting.
183.  The parties to the dispute may agree to exchange information relevant to the dispute before the conference meeting. A copy of that information will be provided to the facilitator. The Inland Revenue officers will provide the taxpayer a list of information that has been given to the facilitator. The taxpayer may request a copy of any information on that list if it is not already in their possession. It is also crucial for the parties to exchange the information prior to the meeting if the agreed format of the conference is a telephone or video conference.
184.  Inland Revenue may decide to concede the dispute after considering the taxpayer's information. The whole disputes process (including the conference phase) would come to an end in these cases.
185.  The conference phase will generally be expected to be completed within three months, but this may vary depending on the facts and complexities of the specific case. A longer conference phase may be justified in some disputes if the parties are engaged in meaningful discussions.
186.  An agenda will be useful for both parties at the conference meeting. An agreed agenda should divide the conference meeting into two parts. The first part of the meeting should involve an exchange of material information and discussion of contentious facts and issues relating to the dispute. Any procedural matters such as the timeframe for completing the disputes process, the adjudication process, time bar waivers and the possibility of opting out of the disputes process will also be discussed. The second part of the meeting, if applicable, would involve negotiation of possible areas of resolution of the dispute. Any communication made and any materials prepared for the purpose of negotiating a settlement or resolution during this part of the meeting will be treated as being on a "without prejudice" basis.
187.  Where there is no agenda the conference facilitator will guide the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to discuss the contentious facts and issues at the conference meeting.
188.  Where the option of conference facilitation has been declined, the parties to the dispute should work out the appropriate structure at the conference meeting, bearing in mind that one of the aims of any conference is to reach agreement on some or all the facts and issues and thus, resolve the dispute.

##### At the conference meeting

_Facilitated conference_

189.  The facilitator will:
    1.  explain the objectives of the conference phase on the basis of the agreed agenda;
    2.  remind the parties of any rules relating to the conference (these will generally have been set out in the conference facilitation letter);
    3.  clarify who the parties are at the conference meeting and the capacities they hold (eg, whether they are the authorised tax advisors; whether they have authority to settle the dispute at the meeting);
    4.  ask whether the parties agree to record the meeting discussions using audio or video technology (refer to SPS 10/01: _Recording Inland Revenue Interviews_ or any replacement SPS);
    5.  run through the agenda;
    6.  encourage the parties to present evidence in support of their perceived facts (either at the conference meeting or on a later date if the evidence cannot be provided at the time of the meeting). Where possible, encourage the parties to reach agreement on all the facts of the dispute. If no agreement can be made, encourage the parties to establish the common grounds and address the matters that they agree to disagree. These agreements will be recorded in writing. The agreements will be sent to the taxpayer to verify the correctness and sign by a specified date;
    7.  promote constructive discussion of only the contentious tax issues and where possible, encourage both parties to explore the issues, resolve or settle the dispute (subject to our internal revenue delegations and guidelines on settlement). If the contentious tax issues cannot be resolved, ask both parties to do one or more of the following:
        *   At the end of the conference meeting, ask the parties to consider whether the conference phase comes to an end. Consider whether there is need for another meeting, noting that another meeting can be justified if both parties need to exchange further information in support of their tax technical arguments but continuous meetings are discouraged if this is seen as a delaying tactic.
        *   Where the parties agree to end the conference phase and the facilitator considers that the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved, the facilitator can clearly signal the end of the conference phase to the parties.
        *   Agree on the timeframe for completing the disputes process and submitting the dispute to the adjudication process. This includes the timeframe for taxpayers to meet outstanding information requests and Inland Revenue officers' undertaking to provide copies of information relevant to the disputes. The agreed timeframe will also factor in time bar waivers if given by the taxpayer and the time required for any court challenge that relates to documents, which are claimed to be protected by professional legal privilege and tax advice documents, which are claimed to be protected by the non-disclosure rights. Ask the taxpayer whether a time bar waiver will be given if the time bar applicable to the assessment in dispute is imminent.
        *   Clearly indicate whether the communication made and/or documents prepared for the purpose of negotiating potential settlement or resolution of the dispute will be treated as being on a "without prejudice" basis.
        *   Ask the taxpayer to consider whether the opt-out process applies and advise the taxpayer of the right to opt out within the required timeframe, so that it is not necessary to complete the disputes process as required under section 89N and that the dispute will be more efficiently resolved by a hearing authority.
    8.  note that any agreement between the parties will be recorded in writing and signed either at the conference meeting by both parties or on a later date after the taxpayer has verified the correctness of the agreement;
    9.  note that the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute will remain as the first point of contact.

_Unfacilitated conference_

190.  In an unfacilitated conference, the parties at the conference should agree on and perform tasks similar to those listed in paragraphs 189(a) to (h) above.
191.  At the end of the conference meeting, it is important for the Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer to discuss whether they consider that the conference phase has come to an end and record any agreement in writing.

#### After the conference meeting

192.  The following is relevant only if the conference phase does not end at the meeting.

_Facilitated conference_

193.  The facilitator will:
    1.  follow up on the agreed matters including the agreed timeframe and exchange of information (but does not include enforcing the agreement between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute);
    2.  assess any need to attend a further meeting;
    3.  suggest to the parties that the conference phase has ended and ask them to reach an agreement on this matter, then clearly notify the parties of the date on which the conference phase has ended.

_Unfacilitated conference_

194.  In a conference that did not have a facilitator, the Inland Revenue officers will perform these tasks. They may suggest to the taxpayer that the conference phase has ended after all the material information relating to the dispute has been exchanged and all the contentious facts and issues have been discussed. The parties will then agree in writing on the date on which the conference phase has ended. If the parties cannot agree on when to end the conference phase, the Investigations Manager will be responsible for making the decision on ending the conference phase after considering all the parties' relevant reasons and concerns.

##### End of the conference phase

195.  It is important for the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to be fully aware of when the conference phase comes to an end. The conference phase is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting. In most cases, it is expected that the parties involved in the dispute will agree on when the conference phase has ended. Such agreement will be put in writing.

_Facilitated conference_

196.  After a facilitated conference the facilitator will be responsible for clarifying the agreed end date of the conference phase with the parties.
197.  If the facilitator considers that both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers have exchanged all the material information relevant to the dispute, have fully discussed the tax technical issues and have not resolved the dispute, the facilitator may suggest to the parties that the conference phase can come to its end.
198.  If there is no agreement and the parties' reasons for continuing the conference phase are considered to be insufficient, the conference facilitator can make a decision to end the conference phase and notify the parties of that decision. The following are examples of strong indicators that the conference phase has come to its end:
    1.  The taxpayer and/or the tax advisors stop contacting the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute for a few weeks.
    2.  The parties did not exchange information notwithstanding that this has been agreed on at the conference meeting, thus leading to the exercise of the Commissioner's powers (eg section 17 notices);\\.
    3.  The parties agree to disagree with each other and express interest in progressing to the SOP phase.
    4.  The taxpayer appears to be using delaying tactics at the conference phase when the issue in dispute is subject to an imminent time bar.
199.  In rare situations, where conference facilitation is involved and the facilitator is concerned with the parties' decision to end the conference phase before achieving the objectives of the conference meeting, the facilitator may adjourn the meeting and discuss the concerns with the responsible Inland Revenue officers. The facilitator may also contact the taxpayer or the taxpayer's tax advisors to discuss whether the conference phase should come to its end. The facilitator will seek the parties' agreement as to whether or not the conference phase is complete.

_Unfacilitated conference_

200.  Where no conference facilitation is involved, the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers will work out when to end the conference phase. They should consider whether the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved before reaching the agreement. If no agreement can be reached, the Investigations Manager will review the conduct of the parties during the conference phase and make a decision on whether the conference phase has come to an end.
201.  When a dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase has been completed, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1).
202.  If the taxpayer seeks the Commissioner's agreement to opt out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), they will be required to sign a declaration that all material information relating to the dispute has been provided to the Commissioner.

#### Opt out of the disputes process

203.  Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) provides that the Commissioner and a taxpayer can agree in writing not to complete the disputes process if they are satisfied that the dispute can be more efficiently resolved at a hearing authority (referred to as "opt out").
204.  A taxpayer may request to opt out of the remainder of the disputes process. If they do, a decision on whether or not the Commissioner will enter into an opt-out agreement will be made by a senior Inland Revenue officer. In making a decision on opt out, that person will consult with Legal and Technical Services, the Litigation Management Unit, and the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel. The decision-maker will consider the taxpayer's request with reference to all of the specific criteria listed and will also consider if any other factors exist which mean that the dispute can be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority.
205.  Before agreeing to a taxpayer's request to opt out the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase. In addition, the taxpayer must have signed a declaration that all material information has been provided to the Commissioner.
206.  This means that the Commissioner will not agree to opting out unless there has been a conference.
207.  In addition to attending the conference, the Commissioner considers that a taxpayer will have participated meaningfully during the conference phase where:
    1.  the taxpayer has provided information as requested by Inland Revenue (if it has not already been provided prior to the conference phase); and
    2.  the taxpayer has discussed the contentious facts and issues of the dispute with Inland Revenue. This discussion will have involved identifying and clarifying what the dispute turns on, seeking potential resolution of the dispute or reaching agreements to enable the dispute to move forward to the next phase if it remains unresolved.
208.  If the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase and signed a declaration that all material information has been provided the Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer's request to opt out of the disputes process in circumstances where one of the following applies:
    1.  the total amount of tax in dispute is $75,000 or less except where the dispute is part of a wider dispute;
    2.  the dispute turns on issues of fact (eg, facts that are to be determined by reference to expert opinions or valuation) only;
    3.  the dispute concerns facts and issues that are waiting to be resolved by a court; or
    4.  the dispute concerns facts and issues that are similar to those considered by the Disputes Review Unit of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel if similar issues have been considered in a dispute in the past.
209.  Where the dispute does not fall within the criteria listed at paragraph 208, the Commissioner may still agree to opt out of the disputes process if it is considered that the dispute can be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority.
210.  The taxpayer may request to opt out of the disputes process within two weeks from the end of the conference phase. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing within two weeks from the date of the request whether the request to opt out has been agreed to.
211.  Where the opt-out request has been agreed to and the dispute remains unresolved after taking into account the information and discussion during the conference phase, the Commissioner will issue a challenge notice.
212.  When it is considered that the taxpayer does not meet the criteria for opting out of the disputes process, the taxpayer will be advised of the decision in writing.

##### (a) The $75,000 or less threshold

213.  The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer opting out of the disputes process if the total amount of core tax in dispute is $75,000 or less. The "$75,000 or less" threshold does not apply if the dispute is part of a wider dispute that involves a number of taxpayers. An example of this is a tax avoidance arrangement similar to the "Trinityforestry scheme" in _Accent Management Ltd v CIR_ (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323; \[2007\] NZCA 230.
214.  The "$75,000 or less" threshold excludes:
    *   shortfall penalties, either proposed in the same NOR as the core tax or proposed in a separate NOPA;
    *   use-of-money interest that results from the position taken in the Commissioner's NOR; and
    *   late payment penalties imposed on the taxpayer, if applicable.
215.  In some disputes, the Commissioner may propose adjustments in respect of more than one tax type or more than one return period/income year. The "$75,000 or less" threshold applies to the net total amount of tax in thesame dispute. The threshold will take into account the following:
    *   any variation of the amount of tax in dispute due to the Commissioner's partial acceptance of the taxpayer's NOPA; and
    *   any variation of the net total amount of tax in dispute as agreed between the participants during the conference phase.

##### (b) The dispute turns on issues of fact only

216.  The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer's request to opt out if the dispute turns on issues of fact or evidence only.
217.  The "issues of fact" requirement may apply where the disputed facts are to be determined by reference to expert opinions or valuation.
218.  Disputes on tax avoidance issues will not meet the "issues of fact" requirement. In these disputes, case law requires consideration of issues such as whether the arrangement has used a specific provision in a way that cannot have been within Parliament's contemplation when it enacted the provision. This will involve analysing mixed questions of law and fact.

##### (c) The dispute concerns facts and issues that are waiting to be resolved by a court

219.  The opt-out process is available if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those that are waiting to be resolved by a court. The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer's request to opt out in those cases.
220.  A taxpayer may become aware of a current court case that concerns facts and issues that they consider to be similar to their dispute. The Commissioner will consider this position when deciding whether to accept the taxpayer's opt-out request. In considering a taxpayer's request, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer of its views as to the similarity, but will not comment on the merit of the current court case or the plaintiff's tax affairs due to the secrecy provisions in section 81 of the TAA.
221.  In some cases, a taxpayer may not be aware at the time of issuing the NOPA or during the conference phase of the existence of similar cases that are subject to court proceedings. The taxpayer may still request to opt out of the disputes process without this knowledge. In considering the request, the decision maker will consult with the Litigation Management Unit to determine whether there are any current court cases that concern facts and issues that are considered to be similar to the taxpayer's dispute.

##### (d) The dispute concerns facts and issues that are similar to those considered by the Disputes Review Unit

222.  The opt-out process is available if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those already considered by the Disputes Review Unit. A taxpayer may request to opt out of the disputes process because a previous adjudication decision was in favour of the Commissioner and they consider it would be unlikely that the Commissioner's view will change. In considering the taxpayer's request, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer of its views as to the similarity, but will need to bear in mind the secrecy provisions of the TAA.
223.  In some cases, a taxpayer may not be aware of similar disputes that have been considered by the Disputes Review Unit when the taxpayer issues the NOPA or participates at a conference meeting. Inland Revenue officers may be aware of such other similar disputes, and may choose to advise the taxpayer that, should the taxpayer request an opt out, Inland Revenue would be very likely to agree. However, Inland Revenue will need to bear in mind the secrecy provisions of the TAA when considering other disputes.

##### Challenge notice where the Commissioner has agreed to opt out

224.  In agreeing to the taxpayer's request for opt out the Commissioner will issue a challenge notice to the taxpayer. In doing so the Commissioner will have taken into account the information and legal arguments raised in the NOPA, the NOR and during the conference phase. The taxpayer can then challenge the assessment by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority within the applicable response period, ie two months of receipt of the notice of assessment.
225.  In issuing the challenge notice, the Commissioner is not bound by the facts, issues, evidence and propositions of law stated in the NOPA and NOR, and the Commissioner is able to take into account information and arguments raised during the conference phase. The Commissioner's administrative practice is that grounds of assessment which have not previously been referred to in the Commissioner's NOR and the taxpayers' NOPA will not be relied on, if they have not been notified or sufficiently discussed during the conference phase.
226.  Where the parties have agreed to opt out the Commissioner will send to the taxpayer at or near the time of issuing the challenge notice, a letter confirming briefly the reasons why the Commissioner has not accepted the adjustment proposed by the taxpayer.

##### Challenge under section 138B(4)

227.  It is also possible to shorten the disputes process in circumstances where:
    *   the adjustment relates to a matter for which the material facts and relevant law are identical to another assessment for the taxpayer (for another period) which is the subject of court proceedings; or
    *   the adjustment seeks to correct a tax position taken by the taxpayer (or an associated person) as a consequence or result of an incorrect tax position be taken by another taxpayer, which is the subject of or was the subject of court proceedings.
228.  If the Commissioner agrees that either of the above conditions are met, then he will issue a challenge notice enabling the disputant to file a challenge in a hearing authority.
229.  When a taxpayer wishes to utilise the process to provided for in section 138B(4) it is recommended that contact is made with Inland Revenue prior to the issue of the NOPA to discuss the possibility of using the section.
230.  Where the adjustment relates to one for another period contact should be made with the Inland Revenue staff who are involved in that dispute. It is envisaged that where the parties agree that the section 138B(4) process could apply, an abridged NOPA would be able to be issued in this circumstance cross-referencing to the dispute for the previous period.

#### Progressing disputes throught the disputes process where the dispute affects multiple taxpayers

231.  Sometimes it is necessary for Inland Revenue to deal with a large number of taxpayers that are all affected by the same disputed matter. This can arise in situations where:
    *   the taxpayers are all investors in a particular scheme;
    *   the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same promoter;
    *   the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same tax agent;
    *   there exists a widespread but well-defined common problem involving many unrelated taxpayers (eg taxpayers moving their private residence into an LAQC, or a number of taxpayers claiming non-deductible expenses such as fines for overloading).
232.  Given Inland Revenue's limited resources, and bearing in mind taxpayer compliance costs it may not be appropriate for all the cases to proceed through the full dispute process.
233.  The Commissioner's approach, in the context of taxpayer initiated disputes, to the different situations which arise where a large number of taxpayers are all affected by the same disputed matter is outlined in the following paragraphs.

##### Situation 1: There are a number of cases on the same issue under dispute. One case has been referred to the Disputes Review Unit, who has still to reach a conclusion on the matter

234.  In this situation it may be possible for other affected taxpayers and the Commissioner to merely agree, subject to statutory time bar issues, to place their case "on hold" while the Disputes Review Unit undertakes its analysis.
235.  However, care will need to be taken to ensure that the time bar will not be breached, and consideration should be given to obtaining a time bar waiver.
236.  Again, as this approach requires the taxpayer to agree, the Commissioner can offer it to individual taxpayers but they still have the choice to progress the dispute through the full disputes process.-
237.  Taxpayers who agree to place their case "on hold" while adjudication considers the issues in question in relation to another taxpayer will not be bound by any decision reached by the Disputes Review Unit and will be free to continue with their dispute should they wish.

##### Situation 2:The Disputes Review Unit has looked at an issue before and taken a view supporting the taxpayer

238.  It is the Commissioner's policy that a finding for the taxpayer in previous dispute(s) will usually lead to the other disputes being withdrawn, particularly if the disputes are in respect of the same transaction.
239.  However, in some situations further consideration of the issue is required at a national level before the Commissioner will apply the conclusions reached in a particular adjudication report more broadly to other taxpayers. In those cases, Inland Revenue officers may be advised that a specified or contrary approach (to that adopted by the Disputes Review Unit) is to be followed pending further consideration of the issue at a national level.

#### Disclosure notice

240.  The Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1), unless the Commissioner:
    1.  does not have to complete the disputes process because any of the exceptions under section 89N(1)(c) apply (see the discussion in Appendix 2 of SPS 11/05: _Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ or any replacement SPS), or
    2.  does not have to complete the disputes process because the High Court has made an order that the dispute resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3), or
    3.  has already issued to the taxpayer a notice of disputable decision that includes or takes into account the adjustment proposed in the NOPA pursuant to section 89M(2). Section 89M(1) and (2) reads:
        1.  Unless subsection (2) applies, and subject to section 89N, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment to a disputant at the time or after the Commissioner or the taxpayer, as the case may be, issues the notice of proposed adjustment.
        2.  The Commissioner may not issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment if the Commissioner has already issued a notice of disputable decision that includes, or takes account of, the adjustment proposed in the notice of proposed adjustment.
241.  The meaning of disputable decision is discussed in paragraphs 61 to 71.
242.  The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer two weeks before a disclosure notice is issued that it will be issued to them.
243.  Where practicable, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer shortly after the disclosure notice and SOP are issued to ascertain whether they have received these documents.
244.  If the taxpayer has not received the Commissioner's disclosure notice, for example, due to a postal error or an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control, the Commissioner will issue another disclosure notice to the taxpayer. In this circumstance, the response period within which the taxpayer must respond with their SOP will commence from the date that the Commissioner issued the initial disclosure notice.
245.  Where the taxpayer cannot issue a SOP within the applicable response period, they should issue a late SOP with an explanation of why it is late. The Commissioner will consider the late SOP in terms of the discretion under section 89K(1) (see paragraphs 120 to 130 for details).

_Evidence exclusion rule and issues and propositions of law exclusion rule_

246.  The evidence exclusion rule has been replaced by the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule, in relation to disputes where a disclosure notice is issued on or after 29 August 2011, being the date that the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011 received the royal assent. A disclosure notice is the document that triggers the application of either rule under section 138G(1) and its replacement. The evidence exclusion rule restricts the evidence that the parties can raise in court challenges to matters disclosed in their SOP. (Both parties can refer to evidence raised by either party.) The new issues and propositions of law exclusion rule only confines the taxpayer and Commissioner to the issues and propositions of law set out in their respective SOPs, in subsequent challenge proceedings. There is no restriction on introducing new facts or evidence which has not previously been referred to in either party's SOP.
247.  Any disclosure notice that the Commissioner issues will- explain the effect of the exclusion rules and refer to section 138G.

_Issue of a disclosure notice_

248.  The Commissioner can issue a disclosure notice at any time on or after the date that the taxpayer issues a NOPA because there is no statutory timeframe specifying when the notice must be issued.
249.  The Commissioner does not have to issue a disclosure notice to a taxpayer when they ask for one to be issued. However, the Commissioner will usually discuss such a request with the taxpayer and advise whether a disclosure notice will be issued and, if not, the reasons why and the implications for the dispute.
250.  Generally, the Commissioner's practice is to issue a disclosure notice after the exchange of a NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, the conclusion of the conference phase and in accordance with any timeframe agreed with the taxpayer. The Commissioner will usually issue a disclosure notice within one month after the conference phase has been completed.
251.  When possible, the responsible officer should use the relevant statutory power under the TAA to obtain any information needed to complete the conference or disclosure phases. This will ensure that the disputes process is conducted in a timely and efficient manner. If the Commissioner is waiting for information to be provided pursuant to a statutory power Commissioner will defer issuing a disclosure notice to ensure that any information provided by the taxpayer can be included in the Commissioner's SOP.
252.  If a disclosure notice is issued earlier (for example, the facts are clear, the taxpayer agrees, or a conference is not required) the reasons must be documented and explained to the taxpayer.

#### Taxpayer's statement of position (SOP)

253.  Pursuant to section 89M(5), once the Commissioner has issued a disclosure notice, the taxpayer must issue to the Commissioner a SOP within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the disclosure notice is issued.
254.  The Commissioner cannot consider a document that the taxpayer purports to issue as a SOP before the Commissioner has issued the disclosure notice because it would have been issued outside the applicable response period. The taxpayer must submit another SOP after the disclosure notice is issued to satisfy their obligation under section 89M(5).
255.  Unless an "exceptional circumstance" or "demonstrable intention" in section 89K applies, if the taxpayer issues a SOP to the Commissioner outside the response period, the Commissioner will treat the dispute as if it was never commenced. The Commissioner does not have to issue an assessment to include or take account of the taxpayer's proposed adjustment. Section 89M(7)(b) reads:
    *   7.  A disputant who does not issue a statement of position in the prescribed form within the response period for the statement of position, is treated as follows:  
            …
            2.  if the disputant has proposed the adjustment to the assessment, the disputant is treated as not having issued a notice of proposed adjustment

##### Contents of a taxpayer's SOP

256.  Different elements of a SOP will be binding on the taxpayer, depending on whether the evidence, or issues and propositions of law exclusion rule apply. Either exclusion rule is subject to section 138G(2), which permits any party to a challenge to apply to the court to include new facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law in the challenge.
257.  The taxpayer's SOP must be in the prescribed form (the [_Statement of position (IR773)_](/internet/ird/yoursituation-ind/debt/options-difficulties/ir773-form-sop.html)
     form) and include sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law on which the taxpayer wishes to rely. In particular, the taxpayer must clarify what tax laws are being relied on and advise if any of these are different to those relied on in the taxpayer's NOPA.
258.  However, if the Commissioner receives a SOP that is not in the prescribed form (as described in paragraph 257) the Commissioner's practice will be to advise the taxpayer that the SOP must be in the prescribed form. If this occurs on the last day of the response period the Commissioner will consider the resubmitted SOP under section 89K.

259.  Section 89M(6) reads:
    *   A disputant's statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner,-
        1.  give an outline of the facts on which the disputant intends to rely; and
        2.  give an outline of the evidence on which the disputant intends to rely; and
        3.  give an outline of the issues that the disputant considers will arise; and
        4.  specify the propositions of law on which the disputant intends to rely.

260.  The minimum content requirement for a SOP is an outline of the relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law. To allow the Disputes Review Unit to successfully reach a decision, the outline in the SOP must contain full, complete and detailed submissions.
261.  An outline that consists of a frank and complete discussion of the issues, law, arguments and evidence supporting the arguments is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes process. (In very complex cases the taxpayer should provide a full explanation of the relevant evidence.)
262.  The disputes process does not require that relevant documents are discovered or full briefs of evidence or exhaustive lists of documents exchanged. Rather, providing an outline of relevant evidence in the SOP will ensure that both parties appreciate the availability of evidence in respect of the factual issues in dispute. The taxpayer should include an outline of any expert evidence on which they intend to rely in the SOP.
263.  If the Commissioner considers that the SOP has insufficient detail to allow a correct assessment to be made the SOP can be treated as not complying with the requirements of section 89M(6).

264.  Subject to any order made by the court under section 138G(2), the evidence exclusion rule found in section 138G(1) and the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule found in the replacement section 138G(1) (applying to disclosure notices issued after 29 August 2011) prevents a hearing authority- from considering facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law (where the evidence exclusion rule applies) or issues and propositions of law (where the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule applies) that are not included in:
    1.  the SOP, or
    2.  any additional information that:
        1.  the Commissioner provides under section 89M(8), that is deemed to be part of the Commissioner's SOP under subsection (9), or
        2.  the parties provide pursuant to an agreement under section 89M(13), that is deemed to be part of the provider's SOP under subsection (14).

265.  Section 89M(6B) reads:
    *   In subsection 4(b) and 6(b),evidence refers to the available documentary evidence on which the person intends to rely, but does not include a list of potential witnesses, whether or not identified by name.
266.  Pursuant to section 89M(6B), the SOP must list any documentary evidence but not potential witnesses. Any witnesses' identities will continue to be protected without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule, in disputes where that rule applies.

#### Receipt of a taxpayer's SOP

267.  If a taxpayer has issued a SOP the Commissioner can accept the SOP or issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer's SOP. Furthermore, section 89P allows the Commissioner to issue a challenge notice after the Commissioner has issued the SOP. (However, the Commissioner's practice is to send the dispute through the adjudication process. See paragraphs 287 to 302 for details.)
268.  will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent 10 working days- before the response period expires to determine whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP in response to the disclosure notice. Such contact will be made by telephone or in writing. The taxpayer's SOP will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue receives it. Upon receipt of the SOP, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following:
    1.  the date on which the SOP was issued, and
    2.  whether the SOP has been issued within the relevant response period, and
    3.  the salient features of the SOP including any deficiencies in its content.
269.  Where practicable, the Commissioner will acknowledge that the taxpayer's SOP is received within 10 working days after it is received. However, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of any deficiencies in the SOP's content as soon as they become aware of the deficiency. They will be further advised when the response period expires that those deficiencies must be rectified and whether the Commissioner intends to provide any additional information to the taxpayer.
270.  Where a SOP is issued outside the applicable response period, the taxpayer can apply for consideration of exceptional circumstances or that the disputant had a demonstrable intention to continue the dispute under section 89K. The responsible officer will notify the taxpayer of the decision to accept the application in writing within one month after Inland Revenue has received the taxpayer's application. Where the application is rejected, the responsible officer must notify the taxpayer by issuing a refusal notice.
271.  If the taxpayer issues a SOP outside the applicable response period and none of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K apply, the dispute will be treated as if it was never commenced (see paragraph 255). Where practicable, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of this within 10- working days after the response period for the disclosure notice has expired.

#### Commissioner's SOP in response

272.  When the taxpayer has issued a NOPA, section 89M(3) allows the Commissioner to issue a disclosure notice without a SOP. If the dispute remains unresolved the Commissioner's practice is to issue a SOP that addresses and responds to the substantive items in the- taxpayer's SOP within the applicable response period (that is, within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer issued their SOP).
273.  However, in very rare circumstances the Commissioner may not issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer's SOP. For example, an exception arises under section 89N(1)(c) or the High Court has made an order that the disputes process can be truncated pursuant to an application made under section 89N(3).
274.  If there is insufficient time to provide a SOP in response the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for further time to reply to the taxpayer's SOP under section 89M(10) if the application is made before the response period expires and the Commissioner considers that it is unreasonable to reply within the response period because of the number, complexity or novelty of matters raised in the taxpayer's SOP.
275.  Such applications are expected to be rare but can arise if the taxpayer is less than cooperative with supplying information and/or has failed to maintain proper and adequate records.
276.  The Commissioner's SOP must be in the form that the Commissioner has prescribed under section 35(1) and include sufficient details to fairly inform the taxpayer of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law on which the Commissioner wishes to rely.

277.  Section 89M(4) reads:
    *   The Commissioner's statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the disputant,-
        1.  give an outline of the facts on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and
        2.  give an outline of the evidence on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and
        3.  give an outline of the issues that the Commissioner considers will arise; and
        4.  specify the propositions of law on which the Commissioner intends to rely.

278.  If the Commissioner has issued a SOP, the Commissioner can also provide to a taxpayer additional information in response to matters raised in their SOP under section 89M(8) within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer's SOP is issued.
279.  However, the Commissioner's practice is to issue a SOP to the taxpayer towards the end of the response period to allow sufficient time for gathering any further information in response and considering the SOP's content. This minimises the occasions when additional information needs to be provided under section 89M(8) as the information in question will be in the SOP. In any event, as any additional information must be provided within the same response period as the Commissioner's SOP in most case it will be unlikely that the Commissioner will be able to issue additional information within the response period.
280.  The taxpayer cannot reply to the Commissioner's SOP (or any additional information provided) unless the Commissioner agrees to accept additional information under section 89M(13).

#### Agreement to include additional information

281.  The parties can agree to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13) at any time during the disputes process including after the dispute has been referred to the Disputes Review Unit. Although there is no statutory time limit, the Commissioner's practice is to allow one month (from the later of the date that the Commissioner issues a SOP or provides any additional information under section 89M(8)) for such an agreement to be reached and information provided.
282.  However, before agreeing to a request made by the taxpayer under section 89M(13) the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer's prior conduct and whether they could have provided the information earlier through the application of due diligence.
283.  The Commissioner will usually also consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information and its capacity to help resolve the dispute and may decide to take it into account in coming to an assessment. In this circumstance, both parties will be expected to cooperate in resolving the relevance and accuracy of any such material. The Commissioner may wish to apply resources to verification and comment and this will be considered by the adjudicator.
284.  If a taxpayer's request to add additional information to their SOP is declined, the reasons must be documented with detailed reference to the taxpayer's conduct, level of cooperation before the request was made and why the information was not provided earlier. The responsible officer will also advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the reasons why their request was declined.
285.  Any agreements to add further information to the SOP will be made subject to the taxpayer agreeing that the Commissioner can also include responses to the additional information to the SOP under section 89M(13), if required.
286.  Any additional information that the parties provide under section 89M(13) will be deemed to form part of the provider's SOP under section 89M(14). The evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1) and the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule under the new section 138G(1) apply to the additional information.

#### Preparation for Adjudication

287.  The Disputes Review Unit is part of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and represents the final step in the disputes process. The adjudicator's role is to review unresolved disputes by taking a fresh look at the tax dispute and the application of law to the facts in an impartial and independent manner and provide a comprehensive and technically accurate decision that will ensure the correctness of the assessment.
288.  Generally, the adjudicator will make such a decision within three months after the case is referred to the Disputes Review Unit (although sometimes a decision can be made in a few weeks). The length of time taken to make a decision will depend on the number of disputes that are before the Disputes Review Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes.

289.  Judicial comments have been made in _C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited and Another, Ch'elle Properties (NZ) Limited v CIR_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 and _ANZ National Bank Ltd and others v C of IR_ _(No. 2)_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,835 indicating that, as a matter of law, it is not strictly necessary for Inland Revenue officers to send all disputes to the Disputes Review Unit for review, and Inland Revenue officers are not necessarily bound by the Disputes Review Unit's decisions.
290.  Notwithstanding the above judicial comments, if the parties have not agreed on all the issues at the end of the conference and disclosure phases or to truncate the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), it is the Commissioner's policy and practice that all disputes are to be sent to the Disputes Review Unit for review, irrespective of the complexity or type of issues or amount of tax involved unless any of the following exceptions arise:
    1.  the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer's SOP for the purposes of section 89N(2)(b) and referred the dispute to the Disputes Review Unit for their preliminary consideration and the Disputes Review Unit has determined that it has insufficient time to reach a decision in respect of the dispute before a statutory time bar would prevent the Commissioner from subsequently increasing the assessment (see paragraph 294 for further discussion), or
    2.  any of the legislative exceptions specified in section 89N(1)(c) apply (see Appendix 2 of SPS 11/05_: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ for further discussion) so that the Commissioner can amend an assessment without first completing the disputes process, or
    3.  the High Court has made an order that the disputes process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3).
291.  Inland Revenue officers will adequately consider the facts and legal arguments in the taxpayer's SOP before deciding whether to amend the assessment. It is expected that this will occur only in very rare circumstances.
292.  Whether the Commissioner has adequately considered a SOP will depend on what is a reasonable length of time and level of analysis for that SOP given the circumstances of the case (for example, the length of the SOP and the complexity of the legal issues).
293.  Thus a simple dispute could take only a couple of days to consider adequately while a complex dispute could take a few weeks.
294.  The decision not to refer the case to adjudication must be made by a senior person in Service Delivery (for example, at the time of writing the delegation was with Assurance Manager level or above). In respect of the first exception mentioned in paragraph 290(a) it is necessary that the parties have exchanged a SOP and it is a matter solely for the Disputes Review Unit to determine whether it has insufficient time to fully consider the dispute.
295.  If the dispute is to be referred to the Disputes Review Unit, the Commissioner should not the challenge notice before the adjudication process is completed unless a time bar is imminent. The responsible officer will prepare a cover sheet that records all the documents that must be sent to the Disputes Review Unit.
296.  The cover sheet together with copies of the documents (NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, conference notes, both parties' SOP, additional information, material evidence including expert opinions and a schedule of all evidence held) and any recordings of discussions held during the conference must be sent to the Disputes Review Unit.
297.  When the dispute is to be referred for adjudication, the responsible officer will issue a letter and copy of the cover sheet to the taxpayer before sending the submissions, notes and evidence to the Disputes Review Unit. The cover sheet and letter is usually completed within one month after the date that the Commissioner issues the SOP or provides additional information under section 89M(8).
298.  The purpose of this letter is to seek the taxpayer's concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator - primarily in regard to the documentary evidence that has been disclosed at the SOP phase. This letter will allow the taxpayer no more than 10 working days from when it is received to provide a response.
299.  Once the taxpayer has concurred- on the materials to be sent to the Disputes Review Unit, those materials will usually be so forwarded. However, if the taxpayer does not provide a response the materials will be forwarded within 10 working days after the date that the letter is issued to the taxpayer advising that the materials will be sent to the Disputes Review Unit. The adjudicator can also contact the parties after the initial materials have been received to obtain further information.
300.  Where an investigation has covered multiple issues, the cover sheet will outline any issues that the parties have agreed upon and any issues that are still disputed. The adjudicator can then consider the disputed issues and not reconsider those issues that have been agreed upon.
301.  Generally, the adjudicator only considers the materials that the parties have submitted. They do not usually seek out or consider further information, unless it is relevant. The adjudicator may consider such additional information notwithstanding that the parties have not agreed that the provider can include this information in their SOP under section 89M(13).
302.  However, any additional material which amounts to a legal or factual issue, or a proposition of law, that the parties have not included in their SOP (or is not deemed to be included in their SOP under section 89M(14))- cannot later be raised by the parties as evidence in the TRA or a hearing authority because of the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule in section 138G(1).

#### Adjudication decision

303.  Once a conclusion is reached, the Disputes Review Unit will advise the taxpayer and responsible officer of the decision. The responsible officer will implement the Disputes Review Unit's recommendations and follow up procedures where required, including issuing a notice of assessment to the taxpayer where applicable.
304.  If the Disputes Review Unit makes a decision that is not in the Commissioner's favour, the Commissioner is bound by and cannot challenge that decision. The dispute will come to end. The Commissioner will issue an assessment or challenge notice to the taxpayer to reflect the decision.
305.  If a taxpayer commences the disputes process, they can file challenge proceedings in the TRA- or the High Court within the applicable response period if any of the following conditions are met:
    1.  The Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period and the Commissioner has later issued an amended assessment to the taxpayer (section 138B(2)).
    2.  For taxpayer-initiated disputes where the taxpayer NOPA is issued after 29 August 2011, a new section 138B(3) applies. A taxpayer may issue challenge proceedings where: the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period by a NOR; and the Commissioner has issued a challenge notice to the disputant. The latter requirement has the effect of deferring the commencement of challenge proceedings, as the Commissioner's challenge notice can only generally be issued after the Commissioner has issued a SOP.
    3.  For taxpayer-initiated disputes where the taxpayer NOPA is issued before 29 August 2011 a taxpayer may issue challenge proceedings where the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period by a NOR or other written disputable decision and the Commissioner has not issued an amended assessment (section 138B(3)).
    4.  The Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that is the subject of an adjustment notified to the Commissioner, where:
        *   the adjustment relates to a matter for which the material facts and relevant law are identical to another assessment for the taxpayer (for another period) which is the subject of court proceedings; or
        *   the adjustment seeks to correct a tax position taken by the taxpayer (or an associated person) as a consequence or result of an incorrect tax position taken by another taxpayer, which is the subject of or was the subject of court proceedings; and
        *   the Commissioner has issued a challenge notice.
        *   The Commissioner or taxpayer has issued a disputable decision that is not an assessment- that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period (section 138C).
306.  A taxpayer must file proceedings with the TRA or High Court within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues:
    1.  the amended assessment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138B(2), or
    2.  the challenge notice if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138B(3) or (4), or
    3.  the written disputable decision rejecting the taxpayer's proposed adjustment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138C.
307.  If applicable, the responsible officer will implement any decision made by the hearing authority and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer.

Recording Inland Revenue interviews
===================================

SPS 12/01 sets out IR's practice for using technology to record interviews where it's considered necessary or appropriate to make an electronic recording.

This item will also appear in _Tax Information Bulletin (TIB)_ Vol 23, No 5 (June 2012).

### Introduction

1.  For the purpose of administering the Inland Revenue Acts[1](#1)
     it is often necessary for Inland Revenue officers to conduct interviews with taxpayers and others. The purpose of an interview will range from general information exchanges to resolve queries to formal interviews where there is the potential for litigation.
2.  Interviewees will generally be asked to attend an interview on a voluntary basis, although section 19 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 gives the Commissioner the authority to require any person to attend an interview. Compulsory interviews conducted under section 19 are held when it is considered appropriate by the Commissioner to obtain information from taxpayers or other parties. As a matter of course, all section 19 interviews will be recorded, either by audio or video technology.
3.  As statements made by taxpayers and others during an interview may be admissible as evidence in litigation it is important that all interviews are carried out in a fair and open manner and in a way that will not make the statement inadmissible. It is also important that interviews are clearly recorded and that the questions and answers are unambiguous.
4.  Not all interviews conducted by Inland Revenue will be electronically recorded. In many cases hand-written notes will be sufficient. However, Inland Revenue does record interviews using modern recording technology and this will increasingly become our usual practice in an investigative interview.
5.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue's standard practice for using technology to record interviews where it is considered to be necessary or appropriate to make an electronic recording of an interview.
6.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA").

### Application

7.  This SPS applies from 19 April 2012. It replaces _SPS 10/01 Recording Inland Revenue Interviews_ which was published June 2010 and also produced in in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 22, No 7 (August 2010).
8.  It does not apply to independent contractors conducting interviews on behalf of Inland Revenue, such as a research company contracted to carry out a customer survey, or an external solicitor contracted to carry out a Child Support Review.

### Legislation

9.  Section 19 of the TAA provides:  
      
    **19 Inquiry by Commissioner**
    1.  The Commissioner may, for the purpose of obtaining any information with respect to the liability of any person for any tax or duty under any of the Inland Revenue Acts or any other information required for the purposes of the administration or enforcement of any of those Acts or for the purpose of carrying out any other function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner, by notice, require any person to attend and give evidence before the Commissioner or before any officer of the Department authorised by the Commissioner in that behalf, and to produce all books and documents in the custody or under the control of that person which contain or which the Commissioner or the authorised officer considers likely to contain any such information.
    2.  The Commissioner may require any such evidence to be given on oath and either orally or in writing, and for that purpose the Commissioner or the authorised officer may administer an oath.
    3.  No person summoned or examined under this section shall be excused from answering any question on the ground that the answer may incriminate the person or render the person liable to any penalty or forfeiture.
    4.  No statement made by any such person in answer to any question put to the person shall in criminal proceedings be admissible against the person, except upon a charge of perjury against the person in respect of the person's testimony upon that examination.
    5.  The provisions of the Crimes Act 1961 which relate to perjury are applicable to any inquiry under this section.
    6.  A person required to attend before the Commissioner or an authorised officer may receive out of money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose such sum on account of travelling expenses and loss of time as the Commissioner thinks reasonable and orders accordingly.

10.  Principle 6 of the Privacy Act 1993 provides:
11.  **Principle 6 Access to personal information**
    
    1.  Where an agency holds personal information in such a way that it can readily be retrieved, the individual concerned shall be entitled-
        1.  To obtain from the agency confirmation of whether or not the agency holds such personal information; and
        2.  To have access to that information.
    2.  Where, in accordance with subclause (1)(b) of this principle, an individual is given access to personal information, the individual shall be advised that, under principle 7, the individual may request the correction of that information.
    3.  The application of this principle is subject to the provisions of Parts 4 and 5 of this Act.

11.  Section 27 of the Privacy Act 1993 provides for exceptions to Principle 6, one of which may sometimes apply to Inland Revenue responsibilities for administering the Revenue Acts:
    1.  An agency may refuse to disclose any information requested pursuant to principle 6 if the disclosure of the information would be likely-  
        ...
        3.  To prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the right to a fair trial;... .

### Standard Practice

12.  The electronic recording of interviews either in audio or video format is common practice by regulatory and investigative agencies. There are advantages for both parties in electronically recording an interview, such as:
    *   An interview which is electronically recorded will take less time than one in which the notes are taken by hand;
    *   An electronic recording provides a more accurate record of what was said at the interview and by whom;
    *   Those parties at the interview are able to concentrate fully on the interview instead of there being delays while taking full written notes;
    *   An electronic copy of the interview will, in most cases, be made available to the interviewee shortly after the interview in concluded.
13.  Whilst in many instances it will not be necessary to electronically record an interview it is increasingly becoming Inland Revenue's usual practice to record interviews where:
    *   The issues to which the interview relates are complex or contentious;
    *   There are inconsistencies in evidence gathered or statements made to date;
    *   There are language issues necessitating the use of an interpreter;
    *   The relationship between the interviewee and Inland Revenue has deteriorated;
    *   Where the subject matter of the interview will potentially be used in litigation.
14.  The above are examples only and a desire by Inland Revenue staff to record an interview is not limited to those situations. Further, other than in a section 19 interview, taxpayers who are not comfortable that an interview is to be recorded may decline to attend the interview or may decide to discontinue an interview. So far as is possible, where Inland Revenue intends to record an interview, the taxpayer will be advised of that in advance of the interview.
15.  An interviewee may request that a voluntary interview be recorded. Such requests should be made before the interview so as to allow sufficient time to arrange recording equipment.
16.  Generally, the interviewee will be provided with a copy of the interview recording at the conclusion of the interview, or as soon as practicable afterward.
17.  The purpose of recording an interview is to:
    *   Keep the time required to conduct the interview to a minimum;
    *   Ensure that there is an accurate and impartial record of the questions asked and the responses given and the conduct of the parties at the interview.
18.  Aside from a section 19 interview, attendance at and participation in interviews is voluntary. However, a decision about whether or not to record the interview will be made having regard to the factors listed above. If the interviewee does not agree to the interview being recorded the interviewer will decide whether to cancel or terminate the interview, or to proceed on some alternate basis, such as using hand-written notes.

**_Preliminary matters_**

19.  Compulsory interviews under section 19 will always be electronically recorded, using audio or video recording technology. The interviewee's consent is not required for electronically recording section 19 interviews.
20.  Other than a section 19 interview, if Inland Revenue intends to electronically record an interview the interviewee will usually be advised of that intention when the interview is arranged.
21.  If a decision about electronically recording an interview subsequently changes, the interviewee is to be advised of that decision as soon as practicable before the interview starts.
22.  Where an interviewee is attending an interview voluntarily the interview will only be electronically recorded with the interviewee's consent and co-operation. If the interviewee declines to consent to recording of a voluntary interview, Inland Revenue will respect that decision. There will be no secret recording of interviews.

**_The recording process_** 

23.  There are two ways in which an interview may be recorded - either in handwriting (which may later be transcribed into a more formal memorandum of the interview), or by electronic means, using either audio or video recording technology.
24.  As has been noted, in many situations it is preferable to electronically record interviews rather than using hand-written notes. Video recording is not regularly used but may be used when it is appropriate, such as when the interview is likely to be used evidentially.
25.  Hand-written notes may be taken even when an interview is being recorded electronically.

**_The interview_**

26.  After the formal introduction to the interview, the interviewer will ask the interviewee to acknowledge that the interview is being electronically recorded (and in the case of a voluntary interview, with the consent of the interviewee).
27.  As the interview may be admitted in evidence, it is important that everyone involved in the interview speaks clearly and slowly.
28.  If more than one interviewer is asking questions, they will need to identify themselves for purposes of transcription.

_**Copies**_

29.  The purpose of an interview is to obtain information to assist in fulfilling the Commissioner's duties. For this reason copies of interviews are kept for reference and for use in potential litigation.
30.  Under Principle 6 of Privacy Act 1993[2](#2)
     a person is entitled to ask for a copy of any material that relates to them held by, for example, a government agency or an employer.
31.  **Hand-written interview notes**: If an interview is recorded in writing, the statement will be read back to the interviewee, or the interviewee should be asked to read it. The interviewee will be asked to initial each page except the last, which should be signed with the interviewee's full name. If the handwriting is easily legible, it may not be necessary to have the record typed. If requested, the interviewer, in most cases, will give the interviewee a copy of the statement immediately. If copying facilities are not immediately available, a copy may be posted to the interviewee.
32.  **Digitally recorded interviews:** If a digital recording system is used, the original recording on the hard drive of a laptop computer or hand-held recorder cannot be sealed but will be moved to a permanent and secure storage repository. The technology used by Inland Revenue creates tamper proof recordings and these are transferred to permanent storage under strict controls to ensure future security of related records. The interviewee must be told this. In such cases the interviewer should immediately make copies to CD or DVD (depending on the technology available). One copy is to be sealed in the interviewee's presence. The other copy will become an Inland Revenue file copy.
33.  **Copy of the interview record to the interviewee:** Inland Revenue will, in most cases, give the interviewee a copy of a recorded interview. However, in some cases there may be reason to suspect that giving an interviewee a copy may prejudice the maintenance of the law, which in Inland Revenue's case means the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts.
34.  In cases such as these, the Privacy Act 1993 and the Official Information Act 1982 allow the agency to withhold copies until the investigation has been completed.
35.  Where it is decided not to provide a copy immediately, an interviewee will be told of the decision to withhold that copy, and that one will be supplied at the conclusion of the investigation. The interviewee will be advised of their right under section 67 of the Privacy Act 1993 to seek an investigation and review by the Privacy Commissioner of the Commissioner's decision to withhold the copy.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 19 April 2012.

Late filing penalty (WITHDRAWN)
===============================

Standard practice statement SPS 12/02 sets out the Commissioner's practice for imposing late filing penalties.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the Commissioner's practice for imposing late filing penalties under section 139A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA).
2.  In this SPS all legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated.

### Application

3.  This SPS applies from 9 May 2012 and replaces Standard Practice Statement 05/01 _Late filing penalty_, published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Volume 17, No 1 (February 2005).

### Background

4.  The New Zealand tax system is based on voluntary compliance. It relies on taxpayers voluntarily meeting the IR obligations under the tax laws, for example, by filing tax returns by the due date. Sections 139A and 139AAA impose a penalty on a taxpayer for not filing certain returns by the due date. The purpose of the penalty is to promote voluntary compliance and to ensure penalties for breaches are imposed impartially and consistently.
5.  Late filing penalties for not filing GST returns by due date came into force on 1 April 2008. A late filing penalty may be imposed when GST returns for taxable periods, special returns or other returns due on or after 1 April 2008 are not filed on time. The Inland Revenue, may, however, issue default assessments when GST returns are not filed by the due date.

>     2.  $50, if on the due date for filing the GST return the registered person accounts for tax payable on a payment basis.
> 4.  The Commissioner must-
>     1.  give notice to the registered person that a late filing penalty will be payable for a further failure to file a GST return on time, if the registered person has filed on time all GST returns due for filing in the period-
>         1.  beginning with the later of 1 April 2008 and the day 12 months before the due date; and
>         2.  ending before the due date; or
>     2.  give notice to the registered person that the penalty is payable, if the registered person has not filed on time all GST returns due for filing in the period referred to in paragraph (a).

#### Due date for payment of late filing penalty

6.  The following sections set out the due dates for payment of late filing penalties:
    *   Section 142 (1) - due date in respect of returns and reconciliation statements;
    *   Section 142(1A) - due date in respect of employer monthly schedules;
    *   Section 142(1B) - due date in respect of GST returns required by sections 16 to 18 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

### Discussion

7.  Under section 139A, a late filing penalty applies to:
    *   annual tax returns;
    *   ACC reconciliation statements;
    *   employer monthly schedules;
    *   annual ICA returns required to be filed under section 69(1) and (2)(a) by an Australian ICA company that is not required to file a return of income.
8.  Although section 139A provides for late filing penalties to be imposed in respect of outstanding ACC reconciliation statements, Inland Revenue no longer collects these statements on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation. Therefore, Inland Revenue will not impose late filing penalties in respect of these statements.
9.  The Commissioner must give at least 30 days notice to the taxpayer of the intention to impose a late filing penalty for an annual tax return or ICA return required to be filed by an Australian ICA company. The Commissioner must provide such a notice either in writing or by public notification to a taxpayer or group of taxpayers. If the outstanding return is filed within the 30-day period, or an extension of time is granted to file the outstanding return, the penalty will not be imposed.
10.  For employer monthly schedules, the Commissioner must notify the taxpayer that the late filing penalty is payable where a taxpayer fails to file an employer monthly schedule on time. If the taxpayer has filed on time all monthly schedules due in the past 12 months, the taxpayer will be notified that a late filing penalty will be payable on any further failure to file on time.
11.  The amount of the late filing penalty for annual tax returns is based on the amount of net income. If the net income is:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| *   below $100,000, the penalty is | $50 |
| *   between $100,000 to $1,000,000 (both figures inclusive), | $250 |
| *   above $1,000,000 | $500 |

12.  The amount of the late filing penalty for an employer monthly schedule and an annual ICA return required to be filed by an Australian ICA company is $250.
13.  Under section 139AAA a late filing penalty is imposed when GST returns for taxable periods, special returns or other returns (sections 16, 17 and 18 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) are not filed on time. If the registered person has filed on time all GST returns in the past 12 months, the Commissioner must notify the registered person that the late filing penalty will be payable on any further failure to file a return on time.
14.  The amount of the late filing penalty for a GST return is:
    *   $250 for registered persons who account for GST using the invoice or hybrid basis;
    *   $50 for registered persons who account for GST using the payment basis.

### Standard Practice

#### Imposing the late filing penalty

15.  The Commissioner's practice is that a late filing penalty is imposed on the following:
    *   income tax returns for individuals (IR3)
    *   income tax returns for companies (IR4)
    *   employer monthly schedules (IR348 and IR349)
    *   annual ICA returns required to be filed under section 69(1) and 69(2)(a) by an Australian ICA company that is not required to file a return of income for an income year that corresponds to an imputation year (IR4J);and
    *   GST returns.
16.  A late filing penalty will be imposed in the following circumstances.

_Income tax returns_

17.  A late filing penalty will be imposed in respect of an outstanding IR3 or IR4 income tax return in the following circumstances:
    1.  the return is not filed by the due date, and is not subject to an extension of time arrangement; or
    2.  the return is subject to an extension of time arrangement, and is not filed by the date agreed to in that arrangement; or
    3.  an extension of time arrangement is withdrawn from a client/all clients of a tax agent, and the return(s) are not filed by the date specified when the extension of time was withdrawn; or
    4.  the return is for a client of a tax agent with an extension of time arrangement and is not filed by the 31st of March in the year immediately following the income year to which the return applies.
18.  Before imposing a late filing penalty the Commissioner will provide written notification of at least 30 days, either by public notification or directly to the taxpayer.
19.  The amount of the penalty for outstanding income tax returns is determined from the taxpayer's previous year's net income based on the return filed. Once the return is received the amount of the penalty is checked and if the net income is in a different bracket to the previous year's return, the penalty is amended.
20.  If Inland Revenue has no information on which to base the late filing penalty, or the previous year's return has not been filed, the minimum penalty of $50 is imposed. When the return is received the amount of the penalty is checked and increased where appropriate. If the amount of the late filing penalty is increased, time will be given to pay any additional penalty. The minimum penalty remains payable if the return is subsequently filed and shows a loss.
21.  The due date for payment of a late filing penalty is the later of a date specified by the Commissioner, not being less than 30 days after the date of the notice informing of the imposition of the penalty, and the terminal tax date for the tax year to which the return relates.

_Employer monthly schedules_

22.  The first time an employer fails to file an employer monthly schedule by the due date, the Commissioner will issue a warning notice to the employer advising a late filing penalty will not be imposed this time, but in future if schedules are not filed on time a late filing penalty will be imposed. However Inland Revenue will take a liberal approach in regard to imposing late filing penalty in respect of an employer monthly schedule.
23.  If, within 12 months of the warning notice being issued, a further default in filing a schedule occurs, a late filing penalty will be imposed in respect of that schedule.
24.  If following the warning notice the employer files all employer monthly schedules on time for 12 months and then defaults a further warning notice will be issued.
25.  The due date for payment of a late filing penalty is the 5th or 20th of the month following the month in which the schedule was due to be filed, depending on whether the employer pays PAYE deductions monthly or twice monthly.

_Annual ICA returns_

26.  A late filing penalty will be imposed when the ICA return has not been filed by the due date and at least 30 days written notification of the intention to impose the penalty has been given, either directly to the taxpayer or by public notification.
27.  The due date for payment of a late filing penalty is the later of a date specified by the Commissioner, not being less than 30 days after the date of the notice informing of the imposition of the penalty, or the date by which the company is required to file the annual ICA return.

_GST returns_ 

28.  The first time a registered person files the IR GST return late, they will be advised that if they are late in filing another of the IR GST returns within the next 12 months a late filing penalty will be imposed on that second late return. If the registered person files all the IR GST returns on time for the 12 months following a warning notice and then defaults again, a further warning notice will be issued.
29.  The amount of the late filing penalty for GST returns is:
    *   $250 if the invoice or hybrid basis is used at the time the return is due; or
    *   $50 if the payments basis is used at the time the return is due.
30.  The penalty is due by the 28th of the second month following the end of the relevant taxable period (or 15 February if the return was due 15 January or 7 June if the return was due 7 May).

#### Reversal or remission of late filing penalty

31.  The Commissioner's practice is that the late filing penalty may be reversed if:
    *   the return was filed before the date the late filing penalty was imposed, but had not been "lodged" by Inland Revenue; or
    *   the return or employer monthly schedule was not required to be filed; or
    *   In respect of an employer monthly schedule, the taxpayer did not pay any salary or wages even though a registered employer.
32.  The Commissioner's practice is that the late filing penalty may be remitted if the legislative criteria in regards to the remission of penalties and interest contained in sections 183A or 183D are met. Remission of penalties and interest is discussed in Standard Practice Statement 05/10.
33.  The Commissioner's practice is that the late filing penalty will not be remitted if:
    *   The taxpayer has an extension of time arrangement as a client of a tax agent, but the agent had not notified the Commissioner that the taxpayer was the IR client before the late filing penalty was imposed.
    *   The taxpayer was granted an extension of time arrangement (either as a client of a tax agent or individually), after the late filing penalty was imposed.

Tax Payments - when received in time (WITHDRAWN)
================================================

SPS 14/01 contains changes to the way in which payments made by post and payment made at Westpac branches will be administered, effective from 1 Oct 2014.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement will also appear in _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 26, No 8 (September 2014).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement ("SPS") sets out the Inland Revenue's practice for accepting tax payments as having been made in time. It contains several amendments to the previous SPS, particularly in relation to payments by post and payments made at Westpac.  Those changes will take effect from 1 October 2014.

### Application

2.  This SPS replaces SPS _07/01 Tax payments – when received in time_, which was published in _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol. 19, No. 2 (March 2007).

### Background

3.  SPS _07/01_ set out when Inland Revenue would accept payments as having been received in time, including:

*   Payments by post,
*   Electronic payments (from New Zealand and overseas),
*   Physical delivery,
*   Cash and Eftpos,
*   Post-dated cheques,
*   Weekends and public holidays,
*   Tax pooling, and
*   Tax transfers.

4.  Since SPS 07/01, the GST and provisional tax payment due dates have been aligned. The objective of these changes was to make tax compliance easier for small businesses that operate in New Zealand.

5.  This SPS applies to all tax types, including Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) and Child Support payments.

**Payments by post**

6.  Payments posted to an Inland Revenue postal address, whether they have been posted from within New Zealand or from overseas, must be received on or before the due date.

**New Zealand electronic payments**

7.  Taxpayers may make payments electronically, including by internet banking. A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the due date.

8.  Internet payments must be completed prior to the end of the bank's online business hours to be recorded as received on that specific day. Internet payments after these online business hours will be processed on the next business day.

9.  In the context of electronic payments, "business hours" means the hours a bank makes available to customers to initiate electronic payments on any given day. Payments made after the bank’s online business hours will be processed by the bank on the next business day.

**Overseas electronic payments**

10.  A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the New Zealand due date.

**Physical delivery**

11.  Cheque payments will be accepted as being received in time if it is delivered to an Inland Revenue office on or before the close of business on the due date. Payments by cash must be made at a Westpac branch.

**Cash and Eftpos payments**

12.  Taxpayers may also make payments by cash or by Eftpos at most branches of Westpac. Payments can only be made over the counter and the payment is received in time if it is made by the close of business on the due date. (NOTE: While payment of tax may be made at Westpac branches, Westpac is not authorised to accept returns. Returns may be filed electronically, posted to Inland Revenue or delivered to an Inland Revenue office.)

**Post-dated cheques**

13.  Inland Revenue will not bank post-dated cheques until the specified date. A cheque that is post-dated until a date after the due date, even though it may have been received on or before the due date, will be treated as late. This applies to payments that are posted or physically delivered.

**Weekends and public holidays**

14.  If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), Inland Revenue will accept a payment as being in time if it is received at an Inland Revenue office, at a Westpac branch that will accept Inland Revenue payments or at an Inland Revenue postal address on the next working day.

15.  If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), then an electronic payment will be accepted as being in time when it is credited into an Inland Revenue account on or before the next working day.

**Tax pooling**

16.  Tax pooling involves taxpayers depositing money with a tax pooling intermediary who then deposits that money into a tax pooling account with Inland Revenue. These deposits are not tax payments at this stage. It is when a payment is transferred from the tax pooling account into the taxpayer's tax account that it becomes a tax payment. The date of payment to Inland Revenue is triggered when the tax pooling deposit is transferred into the taxpayer’s account. The effective date of the transfer can be no earlier than the date the deposit was received by Inland Revenue. For more information on the implications of tax pooling refer to _Tax Information Bulletins_, Vol. 15, No. 5 (May 2003) and Vol. 23, No. 8 (October 2011).

**Tax transfers**

17.  For the rules regarding the transfers of overpaid taxes refer to _Tax Information Bulletins_, Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002), Vol. 16, No. 1 (February 2004) and Vol. 17, No. 1 (February 2005).

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 25th day of July 2014.

Standard Practice Statement SPS 15/01 Finalising Agreements in Tax Investigations This statement also appears in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No. 9 (October 2015) Introduction 1. This Standard Practice Statement (“SPS”) sets out the principles and parameters for finalising agreements in tax investigations by resolving issues that may be in dispute. 2. “Dispute” in this context includes both a difference of opinion on the application of the law that may occur during the course of an investigation as well as issues where the formal disputes resolution process contained in Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”) has been initiated . Application 3. This SPS applies from 21 August 2015 and replaces Standard Practice Statement IR-SPS INV-350 Finalising agreements in tax investigations (see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10 No 8 (August 1998)). 4. This SPS applies to agreements reached by resolving disputed issues, whether or not as part of the statutory disputes process, and is intended to be complementary to and not replace the Commissioner’s SPSs relating to disputes, SPS 11/05 Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“SPS 11/05”) and SPS 11/06 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer (“SPS 11/06”) or other publications issued in replacement by the Commissioner. 5. This SPS should also be read in conjunction with IS 10/07 Care and Management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts – Section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“IS 10/07”), SPS 06/03 Reduction of shortfall penalties for previous behaviour (“SPS 06/03”), and SPS 09/02 Voluntary disclosures (“SPS 09/02”) or other publications issued in replacement by the Commissioner. 6. Although, when finalising an investigation, staff should discuss with the taxpayer their ability to pay any taxes that are to be assessed as a result of the final agreement reached (see paragraphs 31 and 32 below), this statement does not apply where the agreement results from negotiations to settle tax debt as provided for by sections 176, 177, 177A, 177B, 177C and 177D of the TAA. In addition, this statement does not apply to settlements 1 ~ Inland Revenue ~ ~ Te Tari Taake involving the use of the Commissioner’s general discretion under section 6A of the TAA including the settlement of litigation. Summary 7. For the purposes of this SPS, “resolution” involves an exchange of information or argument that enables either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer to change their view on how the law applies to that taxpayer’s situation. In such cases the matter will be resolved on the basis of that changed understanding, resulting in either an agreed adjustment or the dispute being abandoned by Inland Revenue. 8. Wherever possible conflicts and disputes between the Commissioner and taxpayers should be resolved by discussion and agreement. Both the Commissioner and taxpayers can help to facilitate this resolution by disclosing in a timely and useful way all relevant information. Issues should not be resolved and agreements finalised for the sake of expediency or involve coercion to complete the investigation. All issues must be resolved issue by issue, based on the law and the evidence available. 9. Although there is an expectation that taxpayers will sign any final agreement in good faith, it is acknowledged that where a final agreement is signed by a taxpayer prior to the issuing of a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) or a Notice of Response (NOR) from the Commissioner, the taxpayer may still potentially contest the issues that were subject to the final agreement, by following the statutory disputes process. However, when a final agreement is entered into after disputes notices have been issued, the signed agreement precludes the taxpayer from commencing a challenge (in a hearing authority) in relation to those issues finalised in the agreement. Background 10. Investigations will generally be finalised by way of either resolving issues that are in dispute or by “settlement”; through the use of the Commissioner’s general discretion contained in section 6A of the TAA. 11. The Commissioner will generally not consider using the general discretion contained in sections 6A of the TAA to finalise an investigation. However, Inland Revenue recognises that good management practices occasionally require departure from normal operational practices in exceptional cases. For this reason Inland Revenue may settle a case outside the terms of this SPS but within the parameters of the care and management provisions. The Commissioner’s view of how the care and management provisions apply is outside the scope of this SPS, but is set out in IS 10/07. 12. Although the Courts have not specifically considered whether the Commissioner can reach settlement with a taxpayer before litigation or the formal disputes process has started, the Commissioner considers that, in principle, there is no impediment to this being done. 2 13. Inland Revenue practice is to endeavour to resolve disputes and other issues arising from tax investigations through the process of reaching resolution with taxpayers by discussion, if at all possible. 14. It is essential for Inland Revenue and taxpayers that a code of good practice in relation to how issues are resolved, and agreements finalised, be defined. This SPS ensures that taxpayers, when attempting to resolve issues with the department that may be in dispute, will be treated consistently, impartially and in accordance with the law by Inland Revenue. 15. These guidelines apply to finalising agreements by resolving issues that may be in dispute in respect of all the Inland Revenue Acts, although the principal focus is on the Income Tax Acts 2004 and 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These comments, with the necessary modifications, apply equally to the other Inland Revenue Acts (as listed in the Schedule to the TAA). Standard Practice Agreements, whether reached by resolution or settlement, must be made on a principled basis 16. Assessments arising as a result of the resolving disputed issues are no different from tax assessments issued in other circumstances and must be made on a principled basis. 17. On many occasions the New Zealand Courts have stated that the Commissioner merely acts in the quantification of tax due, and it is the taxing Acts that charge tax. The Commissioner has a duty to assess the tax properly payable within the terms of the statutory framework and in carrying out that duty the Commissioner must be completely impartial. All assessments arising as a result of resolving disputed issues must conform to the relevant Revenue Act. 18. This does not mean that the Commissioner has an absolute obligation to collect the “right” amount of tax. Section 6A of the TAA charges the Commissioner with the care and management of taxes and so, as stated previously in this SPS, she may be able to settle issues in dispute in some cases. Any settlement must be within the boundaries set out in IS 10/07. The principles relating to the settlement of cases are outside the scope of this SPS. Reaching final agreement through resolution 19. A final agreement reached by resolving issues with a taxpayer represents an agreement on the relevant facts and the application of the law to those facts. The process of resolution is one that will occur on an issue by issue basis. Resolution is not to be seen as a process of bargaining between the parties where issues are traded off against each other. The Commissioner will consider representations from the taxpayer or their adviser on the relevant issues in the dispute and these issues will be resolved on their individual merits. 3 20. Any resolution should be based on a genuine agreement as to the relevant facts and be the result of the application of the law to those facts. Issues should not be resolved and agreements finalised for the sake of expediency or involve coercion to complete the investigation. 21. In the context of formal disputes (where either the Commissioner or the taxpayer has issued a NOPA) the Commissioner accepts that a final agreement will not be reached in all cases. Where agreement is not reached the disputes resolution process will continue to apply and SPSs 11/05 and 11/06 should be followed. Fundamentals of resolution 22. The process of reaching resolution is one that must occur on an issue-by- issue basis. 23. Inland Revenue will not agree to resolve issues in some circumstances. These are: • where such an agreement would mean not assessing an amount which is clearly assessable, or allowing a deduction, rebate or credit that is clearly not allowable; • where agreement would require Inland Revenue to act contrary to a settled view of the law (for example as stated by the Courts, or an Inland Revenue Public Ruling or Interpretation Statement); • where the only consideration is the taxpayer’s ability to pay (for further discussion on this matter please see paragraphs 31 and 32 below); • where an adjustment can be made only on an "all or nothing basis"; that is, either an adjustment would be made for the total amount in question or no adjustment be made at all. For example, the assessability of a transaction may depend solely on such concepts as whether the taxpayer is carrying on a business or whether there was a profit making purpose. Generally, on the facts the taxpayer either satisfies the criteria for assessability of income or the taxpayer is not liable for tax in respect of that transaction; • where the matter relates to use of money interest (UOMI) and/or prosecution action. 24. Situations where Inland Revenue may agree to resolve issues are: • where the quantum of a disputed amount depends on the facts. For example, a claim may be subject to apportionment and there could be doubt as to the correct portion to be allowed (for instance, how much is deductible as business expenditure and how much is non- deductible because of its private nature); • when an adjustment may rely on a question of valuation for which there are competing bases. For example, in the determination of an arm’s length transaction for GST purposes; • when an item may not be subject to precise computation. For example, the estimation of living expenses in an assessment based on assets accretion methodology; and • where an issue of quantum or valuation has been resolved for one period and is likely to apply to prior periods. In these cases, where determination of the taxable income will depend on 4 the facts, a factual position must be agreed between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue. Penalties, tax in dispute, and use of money interest 25. Penalties, if applicable, should be discussed along with the substantive issues and can, where the taxpayer and the Commissioner are able to reach agreement on these, be included in the final agreement. This includes shortfall penalties and late payment penalties. Shortfall penalties will not be used as leverage to achieve an agreement. That is, staff may not impose shortfall penalties of a less culpable category (for example, reducing a penalty for “gross carelessness” to “not taking reasonable care”) to persuade a taxpayer to agree to a proposed adjustment on a substantive tax issue. Conversely, staff may not use the potential of increasing the category of shortfall penalty or the likelihood of prosecution action being taken by the Commissioner, as leverage for finalising tax investigations. 26. The Commissioner may impose civil penalties 1 after a taxpayer has been prosecuted, even where the prosecution is unsuccessful (section 149(4) of the TAA). However, where a shortfall penalty has been imposed on a taxpayer, prosecution action cannot be taken (section 149(5) of the TAA). These are important outcomes for taxpayers and staff should ensure that taxpayers are aware of potential actions that may be taken in their case. For this reason the potential application of shortfall penalties should be discussed with the taxpayer, even in situations where prosecution action is being considered. In these circumstances, and consistent with the “all cards on the table” approach fundamental to the disputes regime, the taxpayer should at least be made aware that the imposition of shortfall penalties and/or prosecution action is being contemplated and may be taken notwithstanding a final agreement being reached on the substantive issues. 27. While it is preferable that final agreements include agreement as to the level of shortfall penalties to be imposed, failure to agree on penalties will not preclude a final agreement on the substantive issues being reached. Where agreement is not reached on the question of penalties the final agreement should note this and inform the taxpayer that the agreement does not cover penalties and that the taxpayer may still be liable for the imposition of shortfall penalties. The taxpayer and their adviser should not be left to make inferences about penalties. 28. The final agreement that is drafted and sent to the taxpayer for their signature should merely reflect the oral agreement already reached. Even where this is done, disagreement over the terms of the written agreement may occur. For example, a situation may arise where the taxpayer reads the agreement, crosses out the paragraph dealing with penalties and returns it to Inland Revenue whereupon the investigator’s team leader/manager signs the agreement as so amended. The taxpayer may in these circumstances believe that Inland Revenue has agreed not to impose any penalty. However, the effect of the amendment made by the taxpayer is simply that penalties are no longer covered by the agreement and accordingly have still to be agreed or, failing agreement, will be addressed through the disputes resolution process. In these circumstances any modification of the document should be discussed with the taxpayer in the first instance. A new document reflecting any accepted changes, and 1 As this term is defined by section 3(1) of the TAA. 5 making it clear that penalties are still to be agreed should then be sent to the taxpayer. 29. In the case of shortfall penalties, discussion can occur and agreement can be reached as to the correct penalty that should be imposed. Where a shortfall penalty is to be imposed then there may also be discussion around the percentage of the penalty (such as whether it may be reduced for previous behaviour, etc., or increased for obstructing the Commissioner in determining the correct tax position in respect of the taxpayer’s tax liabilities). The SPSs dealing with the reduction of shortfall penalties should be referred to, including SPS 06/03 and SPS 09/02. 30. Where an agreement is signed involving an increase in tax payable, an assessment will follow which will set a new due date for the payment of the increased tax. The taxpayer will be liable for UOMI from the original due date. However, provided the interest charged up to the date of assessment and the tax assessed in the notice is paid by the new due date, the UOMI from the date of the notice of assessment will be cancelled (section 183C(1)). Ability of the taxpayer to pay 31. When finalising an investigation, staff should discuss with the taxpayer their ability to pay any additional taxes that are to be assessed as a result of the agreement reached. Staff must also ensure that the taxpayer is aware of how to obtain information relating to Inland Revenue’s debt collection processes and available payment options, including the availability of financial relief. 32. The ability of the taxpayer to pay the tax is not relevant in determining their tax liability. When the facts and law support issuing an assessment but the taxpayer will not be able to pay the tax, the assessment will be issued. The taxpayer should then apply under the relevant sections of the TAA for financial relief by either requesting an instalment arrangement or stating why recovery would place them in serious hardship (sections 177, 177A, 177B, 177C and 177D of the TAA). The administration of the remission and relief provisions of the TAA are outside the scope of this SPS. Timing of final agreements 33. Agreements should be finalised at the completion of an investigation, after discussing the proposed adjustments with the taxpayer and their representatives. It is only after this discussion that any agreement should be formalised in writing. 34. Due to the limitation of time for amending assessments contained in sections 108 and 108A of the TAA it may be necessary, where periods under investigation are about to become time-barred and are not able to be reopened, to finalise the investigation before all issues in dispute have been resolved. In this circumstance, it may be necessary for the Commissioner to seek a final agreement for the agreed issues and issue a Commissioner’s NOPA in respect to those issues that are unresolved. The disputes process will then be followed in respect of these unresolved issues. In circumstances where time-barred years are reopened, the Commissioner will continue to attempt to reach resolution in respect of all issues in dispute or, where agreement cannot be reached, to follow the disputes process. 6 35. Where an investigation covers a number of years, it may be possible to make an assessment on a year-by-year basis so that any dispute may be limited to particular years. Where this situation arises, any agreement reached will not be a precedent for the treatment of future years (except where the matter concerns an adjustment arising from an agreed adjustment in a previous year or where an issue subject to an agreed adjustment spans more than one year). 36. While it is recognised that there may be circumstances where an agreement is finalised post assessment, such an occurrence should be avoided. It should occur only in rare circumstances, such as where the circumstances stated in section 89C of the TAA apply. For instance, the Commissioner has good reason to believe that issuing a NOPA may cause the taxpayer to leave New Zealand and therefore makes an assessment of additional tax in respect of periods under investigation. As it transpires, the taxpayer does not leave the country and a final agreement is subsequently reached with the taxpayer. Form of agreement 37. Where the final agreement reached is straightforward it is considered that use of the form Agreement to amend assessment(s) (IR 774) will be an appropriate means of recording the final agreement (see Appendix). However, in more complex cases a final agreement may be more appropriately recorded in letter form. For instance, a letter may be appropriate in cases where there are a large number of adjustments, a large number of revenues and/or periods subject to adjustment, or the adjustments are legislatively complex. Where a letter is used it must contain, as a minimum, all of the information contained in form IR 774 and be signed and dated by or on behalf of both parties. A copy of the IR 774 (or letter, where one has been used) must be provided to both the taxpayer and any agent that has been acting for the taxpayer at the time that the investigations is finalised. Where no adjustments are required a letter advising them of this fact, and that the investigation has been concluded will be provided to both the taxpayer and any agent that has been acting for the taxpayer. 38. It should be noted that a formal written agreement is not required where the assessment being made is as a result of the Commissioner exercising her discretion to correct an assessment pursuant to a taxpayer’s request in terms of section 113 of the TAA. Please see SPS 07/03 Requests to amend assessments (originally published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 19, No 5 (June 2007)) or other publications issued in replacement by the Commissioner. 39. Where there are many issues in dispute it may not be possible to finalise an agreement in respect of them all. In this situation the disputes resolution process would be limited to the unresolved issues. 40. Where a situation involves a number of taxpayers, for example, partners or shareholders, an agreement reached through resolution with one person may not necessarily form the basis of an agreement for all the other parties. This is because it is important to consider the factual background to each person’s involvement and the tax position taken by that person. 7 Adherence to agreement by Commissioner 41. Where the issues in dispute have been resolved, Inland Revenue will adhere to the terms of this final agreement for the periods subject to the agreement. Re-examination of the taxpayer’s affairs for the periods and issues covered by the final agreement would be undertaken only where, for example, new evidence suggests that the full material facts were not known to the Commissioner at the time of the agreement and in particular that tax avoidance, evasion or fraud has occurred. Any re-examination will also be subject to the time bar rules of sections 108 and 108A of the TAA. 42. Where a period has been adjusted following a partial review of a taxpayer’s affairs (such as, for instance, a review in respect of a single issue following a policy ruling) nothing in this SPS prevents Inland Revenue from later undertaking a further review of that period (other than in respect of the particular issue or issues that have been the subject of the final agreement). Agreement following commencement of disputes process 43. Where the disputes process in Part 4A of the TAA has commenced by the issuing of a NOPA the taxpayer/disputant may not challenge an adjustment that has been agreed to in the final written agreement if: • that adjustment was proposed by the Commissioner during the disputes process, or • that adjustment was a matter specified in a notice from the Commissioner rejecting an adjustment proposed by the taxpayer/disputant during the disputes process. 44. As stated previously, at paragraph 9 above, although the Commissioner has an expectation that taxpayers will sign a final agreement in good faith, it is acknowledged that the taxpayer may, where the dispute process in Part 4A of the TAA has not commenced, subsequently contest the adjustments that have been agreed provided they do so within the statutory time frame and follow the statutory disputes procedures. Failure to negotiate a final agreement 45. Not all issues subject to dispute may be resolved and final agreement reached. During the resolution process Inland Revenue may enter into correspondence and discussions on a "without prejudice" basis. However, where a final agreement is not reached neither Inland Revenue nor the taxpayer may be bound by any factual or legal matters which may have been "agreed" on a without prejudice basis in any unsuccessful attempt to facilitate a final agreement. Authority to approve final agreements 46. The staff member who has undertaken the investigation is not authorised to approve the final agreement. There must be (and be seen to be) objectivity in the approval of final agreements. It is therefore necessary for an independent review of the case to be carried out by a person with authority 8 to approve the agreement. Generally, this will be a team leader or higher level person. 47. In cases where approval of an assessment is required at a certain delegated level, such as sections BG 1 (tax avoidance) of the Income Tax Act 2007, or sections 6 and 6A of the TAA (care and management), approval of any final agreement is to be given at that level. With respect to a scheme involving many participants, once the appropriate delegated person has approved the application of the avoidance provisions, individual agreements may be signed by a team leader.

Writing off outstanding tax (WITHDRAWN)
=======================================

Statement SPS 15/03 sets out the Commissioner's practice for granting financial relief by permanently writing off outstanding tax.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

### Introduction

Standard Practice Statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts.

This statement sets out the Commissioner's practice for granting financial relief by permanently writing off outstanding tax using the Commissioner's discretionary power under s 177C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA). For relief purposes, outstanding tax includes any civil penalty and use-of-money interest.

Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this statement refer to the TAA. The relevant legislative provisions are:

*   s 3, 6, 6A, 14B, 138E, 139B, 139BA, 141D, 141E, 174AA, 176, 177, 177A to 177C; and
*   s LE 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Application

Taxpayers are encouraged to contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible if they think that they may have trouble paying their tax in full by the due date, or that they may experience serious hardship, so that the options for financial relief can be discussed. Taxpayers need not wait for a due date to pass before applying for financial relief.

_The form of the application_

Taxpayers who wish to apply for financial relief may do so by telephone or in writing (including mail sent through Inland Revenue's secure online services). Once an application is received, the Commissioner will determine whether the outstanding tax can be written off on the grounds of serious hardship.

In some cases, the Commissioner will require that the application for financial relief is made in writing (rather than verbally) under s 177(2). This may be where a taxpayer's inability to pay the outstanding tax is caused by a number of factors that require evidence in writing or when a taxpayer has related parties, such as a partnership or company, that have outstanding tax to pay. Where a taxpayer is required to apply for financial relief in writing, they may do so by:

*   delivering the notice in person to an Inland Revenue office during office opening hours;
*   sending the notice by facsimile to an Inland Revenue office;
*   sending mail through Inland Revenue's secure online services; or
*   sending the notice by post to:
    
    PO Box 39050  
    Wellington Mail Centre  
    Lower Hutt 5045.
    

For child support purposes, this statement applies to an amount payable by a "payer", as defined in s 153 of the Child Support Act 1991. That is, a person required to withhold money in accordance with a deduction notice issued by Inland Revenue. However, this statement does not apply to "financial support", as defined in s 2(1) of the Child Support Act 1991 (that is, child support and/or domestic maintenance payable under that Act) or to student loan repayment obligations[1](#ftn01)
.

This SPS applies to write-off decisions made on or after 24 November 2015. This statement replaces SPS 06/02 _Writing off outstanding tax,_which was published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006): 55.

Reviewing a decision

Section 138E(1)(e)(iv) provides that there is no statutory right of challenge to any decision of the Commissioner to grant relief, decline to grant relief, or to cancel relief.

However, if a taxpayer is concerned that their circumstances have not been given proper consideration, they should raise their concern and ask for the decision to be reconsidered. If a taxpayer is still not satisfied, they also have the option to have a decision reviewed by the Office of the Ombudsman or by way of judicial review.

If a taxpayer is not satisfied with the level of service they have received, they can obtain more information about the [Inland Revenue Complaints Management Service](/internet/ird/aboutir/who-we-are/structure/complaints/complaints-management.html)
 or phone 0800 274 138 (Monday to Friday between 8am and 5pm).

### Summary

1.  This statement sets out the factors the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will take into account when considering whether to write off outstanding tax.
2.  Taxpayers who cannot afford to pay their tax in full may apply to Inland Revenue for financial relief under s 177(1). It is better to contact Inland Revenue as early as possible to discuss the options for resolving the debt.
3.  Inland Revenue will negotiate with a taxpayer to determine as soon as possible whether they are eligible for financial relief, what form of relief may be provided and the extent of relief.
4.  Upon receiving a taxpayer's application for financial relief, the Commissioner has four options:
    1.  accept the taxpayer's request;
    2.  seek further information from the taxpayer (this may include financial information and the filing of any outstanding returns);
    3.  make a counter offer; or
    4.  decline the request.
5.  The Commissioner will take into account the following factors when considering whether to write off outstanding tax:
    *   whether the taxpayer is in a position to pay all or part of the outstanding tax immediately;
    *   whether collection of the outstanding tax (in full or part) will place the taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship;
    *   whether the value of the taxpayer's proposal, when compared to other recovery options, would maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from the taxpayer;
    *   whether the taxpayer has filed all required returns; and
    *   any other relevant factors.
6.  To help the Commissioner make a decision on granting relief, a taxpayer may be required to provide additional relevant information (such as financial information) and will also be asked to file any outstanding returns.
7.  If further information is requested, the taxpayer must provide that information within 20 working days (or within any longer period allowed by the Commissioner). Information received outside that timeframe will be treated as a new request for financial relief.
8.  If the Commissioner subsequently declines to grant financial relief, initial and incremental late payment penalties will be imposed and interest will accrue, as if the request for financial relief had not been made.

### Amounts to be written off

9.  The Commissioner must write off outstanding tax that cannot be recovered in the event of a:
    *   bankruptcy;
    *   liquidation; or
    *   distribution of a taxpayer's estate.
10.  The Commissioner has the discretion to write off outstanding tax that cannot be recovered. Where it is agreed that part of the outstanding tax will be paid under an instalment arrangement and the balance written off, the write-off will be made at the time the instalment arrangement is entered into.
11.  Section 177C(3) prohibits the write off of outstanding tax (including the shortfall penalty imposed) when a taxpayer is liable to a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position under s 141D(2) or evasion or a similar act under s 141E(1).
12.  Any tax write-off will be permanent unless:
    *   the taxpayer, being a natural person, declares bankruptcy, or is subject to bankruptcy proceedings being brought by a creditor, within a year of the outstanding tax being written off on the grounds of serious hardship;
    *   the taxpayer, being a company, is liquidated, or in the course of being liquidated, within a year of the outstanding tax being written off on the grounds of serious hardship; or
    *   the tax was written off on the basis of false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer.
13.  The Commissioner may permanently write off outstanding tax under s 174AA(a) when the balance of the tax payable is less than $20.
14.  When a taxpayer enters into an insolvency arrangement under voluntary administration or the "no asset procedure" provisions of the Insolvency Act 2006, the Commissioner will not consider writing off outstanding tax until the taxpayer has been released from debts covered by their insolvency arrangement. Once they are released from their debts, the balance of related outstanding tax will be written off on the basis that it is not recoverable.
15.  A natural person acting as a trustee can apply for financial relief under s 177(1)(a) in respect of the trust's tax debt that the trustee is personally liable for. Any relief that the Commissioner provides to an individual trustee does not extend to other trustees who are jointly and severally liable for payment of a trust's taxes. The Commissioner will action a write-off in such circumstances after all other avenues for collection have been exhausted.

### Tax losses and imputation credits

16.  If the Commissioner decides to write off outstanding tax, she must extinguish all or part of any tax losses carried forward and/or any imputation credits from the taxpayer's most recently filed return of income, to the extent of the write-off.
17.  When a taxpayer has both tax losses and imputation credits carried forward from a previous year, the losses will be extinguished first.
18.  For the Commissioner to accurately determine the value of any losses or imputation credits, a taxpayer must file all outstanding returns of income before a write-off of outstanding tax will be considered.
19.  When the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax, the taxpayer will be notified of this in writing and, if losses or imputation credits remain, the value of any tax losses or imputation credits carried forward.

### Discussion

20.  Taxpayers may apply for financial relief under s 177(1). The financial relief may be in the form of:
    *   an instalment arrangement for all of the outstanding tax;
    *   an instalment arrangement for part of the outstanding tax and a write-off of the remaining balance (a partial write-off); or
    *   a write-off of all of the outstanding tax.

### Considering a taxpayer's application

21.  Section 3(1) defines "outstanding tax" as tax that is payable before or after a due date. Therefore, taxpayers need not wait for a due date to pass before applying for financial relief.
22.  Upon receiving an application for financial relief, the Commissioner may:
    *   accept that not all the outstanding tax will be collectable and consider that a partial or full tax write-off is appropriate in the taxpayer's circumstances;
    *   seek further information from the taxpayer;
    *   make a counter-offer; or
    *   decline the taxpayer's request.

_Consider that a write-off is appropriate_

23.  The initial late payment penalty payable on outstanding tax under s 139B(2)(a) is charged in two stages – 1% payable on the day after the due date, and 4% payable seven days after the due date. The 1% initial late payment penalty will apply regardless of a request for relief being received before the due date. In addition, interest (charged on a daily basis) is payable on the outstanding tax after the due date. However, if the taxpayer requests financial relief before the payment is due, the second stage 4% initial late payment penalty will not be charged from the date a request for relief is received and/or while an instalment arrangement is maintained.
24.  If the outstanding tax is written off, the taxpayer will be advised of that in writing. That notification will include:
    *   the tax type(s), the relevant period(s) and the amount(s) of tax written off; and
    *   any remaining net losses and/or excess imputation credits carried forward (see discussion at \[83\] to \[87\]); and/or
    *   where applicable, the amount of outstanding tax under an instalment arrangement, including any amount of use-of-money interest.

_Seek further information from the taxpayer_

25.  When considering an application for financial relief, the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer's financial circumstances by looking at the information provided with the application, as well as information already held by Inland Revenue. However, the Commissioner may also ask the taxpayer to provide further information. The Commissioner will also ask that any outstanding returns be filed (if applicable).

##### Examples

A taxpayer has outstanding income tax for the 2013 tax year and applies for relief on the ground that the payment will place them in serious hardship. Their income tax return for the 2013 tax year shows a net loss carried forward from an earlier period. However, the 2012 income tax return is yet to be filed.

The Commissioner will require the taxpayer to file their 2012 income tax return, and perhaps provide other information, before a decision can be made on the taxpayer's request for financial relief.

26.  Under s 177(4), if further information is required, the taxpayer needs to provide this information within 20 working days (or a longer period as allowed by the Commissioner). If the further information is not provided until after the time allowed, that information will be treated as a new request when it is received.
27.  Under s 139BA, incremental late payment penalties will not be imposed while waiting for the additional information, provided financial relief is granted. Use-of-money interest will continue to be accrued and charged for this period, even if relief via an instalment arrangement is granted. If relief is provided via a write-off of outstanding tax, the related use-of-money interest will also be remitted under s 183E.

_Make a counter-offer_

28.  After reviewing all the information (including additional information that may have been requested), the Commissioner may make a counter offer. This may occur where she considers that:
    *   the taxpayer can afford to make a lump-sum payment; or
    *   a partial write-off is more appropriate, as an instalment arrangement for part of the outstanding tax can be entered into.

_Decline the taxpayer's request_

29.  Commissioner will decline the taxpayer's request for a write-off if she considers the taxpayer is able to pay the outstanding tax in full or that an instalment arrangement is a better option. For example, the taxpayer may have term deposits or other investments that can be used, or the taxpayer may have the ability to borrow money to pay the outstanding tax.
30.  The Commissioner may also decline a taxpayer's request for a write-off if they have not provided sufficient information to support their request.
31.  When the Commissioner declines a taxpayer's request for financial relief, both initial and incremental late payment penalties will be imposed, and use-of-money interest will accrue, as if the taxpayer had not made the request.

### Factors relevant to the consideration of financial relief

32.  The Commissioner may have regard to a number of factors when considering applications for financial relief. In _Clarke & Money v CIR_,[2](#ftn02)
     Priestley J referred to the following factors as relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s 177:
    1.  the circumstances that led to a taxpayer's outstanding tax;
    2.  the nature and extent of a taxpayer's co-operation and negotiating stance;
    3.  the speed with which a taxpayer has provided requested information and the quality of that information; and
    4.  the Commissioner's duties under ss 6 and 6A(3).

### Maximising the recover of outstanding tax

33.  Under s 176, the Commissioner has a duty to maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from a taxpayer. The Commissioner is therefore obliged to compare the value of the likely recovery from accepting a taxpayer's proposal to any other viable options for recovery. In some cases, it is clear which option will maximise recovery. In other cases, there may be options that could yield similar returns. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine which option will maximise recovery.

_The relationship between the duties in s 176 and ss 6 and 6A_

34.  While s 176 provides that the Commissioner must maximise recovery of outstanding tax, this duty is subject to the overriding obligations to protect the integrity of the tax system (s 6) and to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law (s 6A). Interpretation Statement IS 10/07 Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts provides the Commissioner's view on the application of ss 6 and 6A.[3](#ftn03)
    
35.  In _Raynel v CIR_[4](#ftn04)
    , Randerson J referred to the following "general compromise" approach to the application of ss 6 and 6A:
    *   The obligation to collect the highest net revenue is not absolute. The Commissioner is required to take practicable and lawful steps to recover revenue.
    *   The Commissioner is required to have regard to the resources available to her, the importance of promoting compliance (especially voluntary compliance) by all taxpayers, and the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers.
    *   Sections 6 and 6A(3)(b) emphasise that there is a broader public interest in the integrity of the tax system and in ensuring that taxpayers meet their obligations.
36.  Although the Commissioner will consider each application for financial relief on its own merits, the duty to protect the integrity of the tax system will sometimes require the Commissioner to take action that (in the short term) might not be consistent with the requirement to maximise recovery of outstanding tax.
37.  When a negotiated agreement for payment of all or part of the outstanding tax (such as an instalment arrangement) would yield more than bankruptcy or liquidation action, the Commissioner will usually enter into such an agreement. Any amount not recoverable under the agreement will be written off at the time the agreement is entered into.

##### Examples

A taxpayer has outstanding tax of $100,000 and makes an offer to pay $75,000 over 3 years. The Commissioner considers that bankruptcy would yield only $50,000 and that there are no other viable avenues for recovery. In this instance, the Commissioner would consider writing off $25,000 and entering into an instalment arrangement over three years for $75,000.

Alternatively, a taxpayer has significant outstanding tax as a result of evasion and offers part payment of the tax owing. Information available to Inland Revenue indicates the taxpayer has accumulated an investment property that they could dispose of or use as collateral to raise funds to settle their arrears. As the tax shortfall was due to an evasion offence, the Commissioner is not able to write off the outstanding tax. She would decline the offer and pursue other options.

38.  Randerson J, in Raynel, further noted that, in certain circumstances, the Commissioner may be justified in initiating or continuing enforcement proceedings to secure the wider interests identified by the legislation. This is where there has been a flagrant and on-going failure by a taxpayer to comply with their tax obligations and where recovery is dubious or is likely to result only in a relatively minor proportion of the overall outstanding tax being recovered.
39.  In Rogerson v CIR,[5](#ftn05)
     Potter J held that the Commissioner is entitled to consider a taxpayer's whole history of compliance in the context of the obligation to preserve the integrity of the tax system.

### Inefficient use of the Commissioner's resources

40.  Consistent with the Commissioner's duty under s 6A(3), s 176(2)(a) provides that the Commissioner may not recover outstanding tax if the recovery of the outstanding tax would be an inefficient use of her limited resources. This includes the Commissioner's ability to write off tax under s 177C.
41.  However, a taxpayer cannot require that outstanding tax be written off under s 176(2) simply because they consider that collection would be an inefficient use of the Commissioner's resources. It is for the Commissioner to determine how her limited resources are allocated.
42.  There will be some instances where the cost of collection may be higher than the outstanding tax. Consistent with the Commissioner's obligations under ss 6 and 6A to protect the integrity of the tax system, promote compliance and collect over time the highest net revenue, recovery action may still be considered appropriate.
43.  Decisions to write off are made on a case-by-case basis and will take into account the effect of the proposed write-off on the overall compliance of all taxpayers, not just the taxpayer who has outstanding tax.

### Instances where the Commissioner must write off outstanding tax

44.  Under s 177C(2)(a), the Commissioner must write off amounts that, because of bankruptcy, cannot be recovered.
45.  When a person is bankrupt, the Commissioner will write off outstanding tax that cannot be recovered upon receiving a final dividend or advice from the Official Assignee that there will be no dividend to Inland Revenue (provided that we do not challenge the Official Assignee's advice).
46.  Under s 177C(2)(b), the Commissioner must write off a company's outstanding tax that cannot be recovered because the company is in liquidation.
47.  When an estate has been distributed, the Commissioner must write off any outstanding tax that cannot be recovered upon receiving confirmation from the administrator that the estate has been distributed. However, if, for example, the estate has forgiven a debt owing to the estate without having regard to the estate's ability to meet its tax obligations, the Commissioner may seek payment from the administrator of the estate.

### Serious hardship

48.  Under s 176(2)(b), the Commissioner may not recover outstanding tax to the extent that the recovery would place a taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship.
49.  A natural person who applies for financial relief under s 177(1)(a) on the grounds of serious hardship must be able to explain why recovery would place them in serious hardship. The application should include supporting financial information.
50.  The Commissioner will consider each application on its own merits, bearing in mind her obligations to protect the integrity of the tax system (s 6) and to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law (s 6A).

_Applying the serious hardship provisions_

51.  Under s 177A, when a taxpayer applies for financial relief, the Commissioner must consider whether recovery of the outstanding tax would place the taxpayer (being a natural person) into serious hardship. The reason why that tax is outstanding is not taken into account in determining serious hardship.
52.  Section 177A(3) also states that compliance, and non-compliance, with tax obligations must not be considered by the Commissioner when making a decision as to whether a taxpayer would be in serious hardship.
53.  Under s 177A, the Commissioner makes the decision whether recovering the outstanding tax would place a taxpayer in serious hardship by considering the taxpayer's financial information she holds on the date of the decision. After allowing for payment of a relevant amount of outstanding tax, the Commissioner must determine whether the financial information shows that the taxpayer would likely have significant financial difficulties.
54.  The taxpayer is likely to have significant financial difficulties if, after the application, the following occurs:
    *   the taxpayer or their dependant has a serious illness;
    *   the taxpayer would be unlikely to meet minimum living expenses estimated according to normal community standards of cost and quality;
    *   the taxpayer would be unlikely to meet the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the taxpayer, or of their dependant; or
    *   the taxpayer would be unlikely to meet the cost of education for their dependant.
55.  The Commissioner may also take into account any other factors she thinks relevant. What those other relevant factors may be will depend on a taxpayer's individual circumstances.
56.  While "normal community standards of cost and quality" must be considered in the context of the wider community of all New Zealand, the actual expenditure of taxpayers in different parts of the country may vary. When calculating a taxpayer's minimum living expenses, the Commissioner will consider the costs of food, heating and accommodation in that taxpayer's area, based on information provided by Statistics New Zealand.
57.  Whether a person is a taxpayer's "dependant" will be determined on a case-by-case basis. In determining dependency, the Commissioner will consider:
    *   whether the person depends on the taxpayer for financial support;
    *   what degree of financial support is provided by the taxpayer; and
    *   to what extent providing financial support affects the taxpayer's ability to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards.

_Financial information_

58.  To determine whether a taxpayer would be placed in serious hardship, the Commissioner will request relevant details of that taxpayer's financial position. The requested financial information may include, among other items:
    *   details of income and expenditure (including income and expenditure in relation to relationship property, family and spousal income where appropriate);
    *   assets and liabilities (including relationship property);
    *   a 12-month cash flow projection;
    *   asset valuations;
    *   a statement of financial performance (a profit and loss statement);
    *   a statement of financial position (a balance sheet);
    *   a list of debtors and creditors, including how much is owed to or by the taxpayer, and any vested interest held in another entity (such as a trust).
59.  Written applications for write-off will not be required when it is evident from information already available to the Commissioner that recovery would place a taxpayer in serious hardship. This may happen where a taxpayer requests relief by way of an instalment arrangement, but the information provided shows that repayment, even by way of an instalment arrangement, would place them in serious hardship.

_Part payment of outstanding tax_

60.  In some instances, a taxpayer may be able to pay part of the outstanding tax, but recovery of the full amount would place the person in serious hardship. In these cases, the Commissioner may negotiate a lump-sum payment and/or an instalment arrangement with the taxpayer, with the possibility of writing off any amount considered to be irrecoverable. The irrecoverable amount will be written off at the time the instalment arrangement is entered into.

##### Examples

A taxpayer has outstanding tax of $8,000 and has been putting funds aside to clear this amount by the due date. However, at the due date they have only managed to save $2,000 towards this amount. The taxpayer has the ability to pay $2000 more if it is spread out over 3 months, otherwise they will have difficulty in meeting day-to-day living expenses.

Provided there are no other feasible options for recovery of tax, the Commissioner would accept the lump-sum payment of $2,000, enter into an instalment arrangement for the additional $2,000 and write off the balance of unpaid tax on the grounds of serious hardship.

### Writing off a company's outstanding tax

61.  The Commissioner may also write off a company's outstanding tax under s 177C(1). This is if doing so is consistent with the duty to maximise recovery under s 176(1), subject to the obligations in ss 6 and 6A. As with individuals, Inland Revenue may enter into an instalment arrangement with the company for part of the company's outstanding tax and then write off the remaining balance.
62.  When a company is in liquidation (provided Inland Revenue does not challenge the liquidator's advice), the Commissioner must write off outstanding tax that cannot be recovered upon receiving:
    *   a final distribution; or
    *   advice from the liquidator that there will be no distribution to Inland Revenue.

_Serious hardship and relief companies_

63.  Serious hardship generally applies to natural persons only. A company cannot apply for outstanding tax to be written off on the grounds of serious hardship.
64.  However, the Commissioner will have to consider whether the recovery of outstanding tax owed by a company would cause serious hardship for a shareholder who:
    *   alone or jointly with one other person, owns 50% or more of the shares in the company; or
    *   is a shareholder-employee of a relief company.
65.  Section 3(1) defines a "relief company", in relation to a taxpayer, as a company in which:
    *   the taxpayer owns 50% or more of the shares; or
    *   the taxpayer and 1 other person jointly own 50% or more of the shares; or
    *   the taxpayer is a shareholder-employee, and the company has five or fewer natural persons whose total voting or market value interests in the company exceed 50% and it is not a special corporate entity.

##### Examples

A relief company owes outstanding tax of $300,000 and its only asset is a debit balance in the principal shareholder's current account of $300,000. The shareholder's personal assets are a house and a car. Inland Revenue recognises that any action taken to liquidate this company would place the shareholder in serious hardship. The company agrees to pay Inland Revenue the sum of $220,000, borrowed against the principal shareholder's house. The balance of the outstanding tax will be written off, as collection of the amount would cause the shareholder serious hardship.

### Struck-off companies

66.  The Commissioner cannot consider an application for financial relief of a company that has been removed from the New Zealand register at the Companies Office (been struck off) until that company is restored to the register. This is because the struck-off company has ceased to be a person and therefore is not a taxpayer.
67.  When a company has been struck off, the Commissioner can discuss outstanding tax matters with a person who was a director or authorised officer of the company immediately before it was struck off.
68.  In some cases, the Commissioner may apply to have the company restored to the New Zealand register in order to recover outstanding tax.
69.  The Commissioner may apply to the High Court for appointment of a liquidator to liquidate the struck-off company under s 241 of the Companies Act 1993. The Commissioner may do so even if there is no prospect of recovering the outstanding tax from the struck-off company.

### Voluntary administration

70.  When a company seeks an arrangement with creditors under the voluntary administration provisions, the process is subject to the rules in the Companies Act 1993.
71.  Where the watershed meeting with creditors has resolved that a company may proceed to execute a deed of company arrangement (deed), all parties to the deed are bound in respect of claims as at the "cut-off day". The company is released from its debts to the extent provided in the deed under s 239ACW of the Companies Act 1993.
72.  As a deed may be varied by the creditors or terminated by the court or by creditors, there is no certainty of the amount of tax that will be recovered until the deed moratorium period has elapsed. Consequently, alternative recovery action or write-off will not be considered unless the court or creditors have cause to have the deed overturned. If a deed is terminated, the Commissioner may consider other ways to recover any outstanding tax under s 156 or consider whether the tax should be written off under s 177C(1) on the basis that money received under the deed was the best outcome.
73.  Any subsequent tax outstanding (for example, on-going GST or PAYE obligations not met) during the period of the deed will be the liability of the voluntary administrator within the agreed parameters of Inland Revenue's expectations. Alternatively the Commissioner may reject the proposed deed or an application may be made to the court to overturn the deed. Outstanding tax not recovered under the deed is quantified when the agreed term for a deed has expired and following a final report from the voluntary administrator to the Registrar of Companies advising of the dividend paid to creditors.
74.  As the voluntary administration process is governed by the provisions under the Companies Act 1993, the Commissioner will not consider the financial relief provisions under s 177C until the term of the deed has elapsed and a company has been released from debts to the extent provided in the deed. The Commissioner will then write off the balance not collected under s 177C on the basis that the tax is irrecoverable.

### Writing off a trust's outstanding tax

75.  Trustees are personally liable for trust debts (including tax debts). Consequently, if there is insufficient trust property to pay a trust debt, a trustee may have to pay the debt out of their own resources.
76.  When there is more than one trustee of a trust, those trustees are jointly and severally liable for the trust's tax obligations.
77.  Trustees, in their capacity as natural persons, may experience serious hardship as a result of having to meet a trust's tax debt from their personal resources. The Commissioner will consider serious hardship applications from natural person trustees on a case by case basis and may write off tax on grounds of serious hardship when no other avenue is available for collection.

### No asset procedure

78.  The "no asset procedure" is a one-off process that provides a fresh start to natural persons. The no asset procedure is available as an alternative to bankruptcy for those people who have insufficient income and no assets left to sell to repay debts from $1,000 up to $40,000. The no asset procedure is governed by rules under Part 5 of the Insolvency Act 2006.
79.  Unless the Commissioner has cause to persuade the Official Assignee to reject or overturn the no asset procedure, any tax owed by a taxpayer who is subject to the procedure is effectively frozen and the Commissioner cannot take any recovery action.
80.  Once a taxpayer has been released from debts covered by a no asset procedure, the Commissioner will then write off the balance of the outstanding tax under s 177C(1) on the basis that it is irrecoverable.

### Writing off small amounts of outstanding tax

81.  The Commissioner may permanently write off outstanding tax under s 174AA(a) when the balance of the tax payable is $20 or less.
82.  If it is established later that a taxpayer's assessment or related use-of-money interest calculation was wrong, the Commissioner must amend the taxpayer's account to show the correct tax payable. It follows that any earlier write-off made under s 174AA may also be adjusted to the correct amount of tax payable.

### Tax losses and excess imputation credits

83.  Sections 177C(5), 177C(5B), 177C(5C) and 177C(6) cover what happens when the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer who has tax losses or imputation credits carried forward from a previous year.
84.  If the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer who has net losses, part or all of the taxpayer's tax losses will also be extinguished. The amount extinguished is calculated by dividing the amount written off by 0.33 (if the taxpayer is not a company) or 0.28 (if the taxpayer is a company) and reducing the tax losses by that amount.
85.  If the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer who has imputation credits carried forward from a previous year, all or part of these credits will be extinguished on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
86.  When a taxpayer has both tax losses and imputation credits carried forward from a previous year, the net losses will be extinguished first. A taxpayer's tax losses and/or imputation credits can be extinguished even if the tax written off is not income tax.
87.  The Commissioner needs to know the correct value of losses or imputation credits when making the adjustments required after writing off outstanding tax. Therefore, a taxpayer must file all outstanding tax returns (that is, outstanding returns relating to tax years prior to the tax year in which the outstanding tax arises) before their application for a write-off will be considered. The Commissioner will then calculate the tax losses using the taxpayer's most recently filed income tax return.

##### Examples

In July 2014, a taxpayer asks that their outstanding income tax for the 2014 tax year be written off due to financial difficulties. The taxpayer's 2012 income tax return shows tax losses carried forward to the 2013 tax year. However, the 2013 income tax return remains outstanding.

The write-off will not be considered until the taxpayer has filed their 2013 income tax return, as this will enable the Commissioner to have a full picture of the taxpayer's circumstances.

### When the Commissioner cannot write off outstanding tax

88.  Under s 177C(3), the Commissioner cannot write off outstanding tax if a taxpayer is liable to pay, in relation to that outstanding tax, a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position under s 141D(2) or for evasion or a similar act under s 141E(1), irrespective of whether the taxpayer has been assessed for the shortfall penalty.
89.  With the exception of some prosecution cases, in all instances where a taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty for either an abusive tax position or evasion, it is the Commissioner's practice for that shortfall penalty to be assessed.
90.  However, with respect to prosecution cases, s 149(5) provides that the imposition of a shortfall penalty precludes the subsequent prosecution of the taxpayer for that tax position. Therefore, the Commissioner's practice is not to assess a shortfall penalty in such cases until after the prosecution has been concluded, at which time the Commissioner has a discretion under s 149(4) whether to assess a shortfall penalty. A decision not to assess the shortfall penalty does not mean that the taxpayer was not "liable to pay" the relevant shortfall penalty for the purposes of s 177C(3).
91.  The Commissioner will distinguish between outstanding tax arising from such assessments and other outstanding tax so that part of a taxpayer's total outstanding tax may be written off if the required criteria are met, leaving the tax to which the shortfall penalty applies and the penalty itself outstanding. The other outstanding tax may include any late filing/late payment penalties imposed and accrued use-of-money interest that is payable in the same period as the tax shortfall and related shortfall penalty.
92.  When s 177C(3) prevents a write-off, the only other situation where the Commissioner has the ability to write off the tax shortfall and related penalty is under s 177C(2); that is, in situations of bankruptcy, liquidation or where a taxpayer's estate has been distributed.

##### Examples

A taxpayer has outstanding GST for the 31 March 2014 return period and income tax for the 2013 year. The outstanding income tax of $85,000 includes core tax of $25,000 and a tax shortfall and shortfall penalty amounting to $60,000 for taking an abusive tax position.

The taxpayer meets the criteria for serious hardship, so the outstanding GST may be written off.

However, the outstanding tax and penalty amounting to $60,000 cannot be written off, as the taxpayer is "liable to pay" a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position in relation to that outstanding tax. The Commissioner can write off the $25,000 portion of the outstanding tax that is not related to the abusive tax position and related shortfall penalty.

93.  Consideration of a write-off application will be suspended when a taxpayer challenges the imposition of a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position or evasion in a hearing authority. The Commissioner will not consider writing off that taxpayer's outstanding tax until after the hearing authority has made its ruling.

### Reinstatement of outstanding tax

94.  Under s 177C(4), the Commissioner may only reinstate tax that has been written off if:
    *   she receives, by operation of law, additional funds in respect of a taxpayer after that taxpayer has become bankrupt or has been liquidated; or
    *   additional funds due to a taxpayer's estate are discovered after that taxpayer's estate has been distributed.

##### Examples

The Commissioner writes off a bankrupt taxpayer's outstanding tax under s 177C(2) after the Official Assignee declares that no dividend will be payable. The Official Assignee subsequently discovers a previously unknown bank account with a credit balance and makes a dividend payment to creditors. The Commissioner will reinstate the outstanding tax under s 177C(4) to the extent of the dividend payment and credit the money received to the taxpayer's account.

### Reversal of a write-off

95.  Section 177C(7) allows the Commissioner to reverse a write-off made on the grounds of serious hardship when:
    *   the taxpayer, being a natural person, declares bankruptcy or is subject to bankruptcy proceedings being brought by a creditor, within a year of the outstanding tax being written off on the grounds of serious hardship; or
    *   the taxpayer, being a company is, within a year of the outstanding tax being written off on the grounds of serious hardship, liquidated or in the course of being liquidated; or
    *   tax was written off on the basis of false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer.

1 Standard Practice Statement SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments Introduction Standard Practice Statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Standard Practice Statement (“SPS”) sets out Inland Revenue’s practice for exercising the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) discretion under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. It is intended both to provide direction to those Inland Revenue staff delegated to use the discretion in s 113 and to give guidance to taxpayers and their advisors in formulating requests for amendments. Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”). Application This SPS applies from 1 April 2016. It replaces all previous policies and standard practices regarding the exercise of the discretion under s 113, including SPS 07/03 Requests to Amend Assessments (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 5 (June 2007): 8) but excluding QB 09/04 The relationship between section 113 of the TAA and the proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act when a registered person has not claimed an input tax deduction in an earlier taxable period (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 6 (August 2009): 53). Summary Section 113 and the Commissioner’s discretion 1.The Commissioner acknowledges that in a self-assessment regime taxpayers will occasionally take an incorrect tax position and that correcting these positions is an integral part of tax administration. Section 113 contains a broad discretion allowing the Commissioner to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. 2.The Commissioner’s policy is generally to use the discretion to correct a tax position, subject to the criteria described in this Statement. 3.The criteria applied when determining whether to exercise the s 113 discretion are based on the care and management principles contained in ss 6 and 6A of the TAA. WITHDRAWN - replaced by SPS 20/03 2 Care and management of the taxes 4. Section 6(1) of the TAA requires that the Commissioner’s best endeavours are used to protect the integrity of the tax system, including taxpayers’ perceptions of that integrity. In carrying out this function, the Commissioner is bound not only to protect the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially and according to law, but also to have regard to the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law. Section 15B of the TAA sets out taxpayers’ responsibilities. 5. To discharge her s 6A(3) duties, the Commissioner must compare the available courses of action as to their likely effect on the amount of net revenue she collects over time. To do this, the Commissioner must consider the short- and long-term implications of each course of action and have regard to all three factors listed in s 6A(3): available resources, the promotion of compliance (especially voluntary compliance) by all taxpayers and the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. 6. Inland Revenue has limited resources to undertake what sometimes can be a lengthy verification process to determine whether an assessment should be amended. Accordingly, it is consistent with the obligation of taxpayers under s 15B, and with ss 6(1) and 6A(3), for the Commissioner to limit the amount of time and other resources that will be spent investigating amendment requests. Not all requested amendments, therefore, will necessarily be made. The process used to consider s 113 requests 7. In considering s 113 requests, the Commissioner must be assured that the amendment the taxpayer seeks will ensure the assessment is correct when amended, even if it was also correct beforehand. Where the Commissioner is not initially convinced that the amendment requested will result in a correct assessment, a decision must be made to commit Inland Revenue’s limited resources to considering the request further. 8. Once the Commissioner, having decided to commit appropriate resources to the issue, is satisfied that making the requested amendment will result in a correct assessment being issued, the assessment will be amended. This is unless there is a residual reason, other than her limited resources, why she should not do so. 9. In undertaking this approach, the Commissioner breaks the inquiry down into four possible phases (see further at \[34\]):  Initial examination of the request to see if the matter can be disposed of simply.  If it cannot, consider whether the Commissioner should apply additional resources to consider the request further.  Determine whether a correct assessment will result from the requested amendment.  Finally, determine whether there is any residual reason (other than her limited resources) why the Commissioner should not make the requested amendment. Considering simple amendment requests and voluntary disclosures 10. The Commissioner will follow the process set out in this SPS in determining whether the amendment requested will lead to the making of a correct assessment. 11. There may be very obvious errors that require little consideration. For instance, if a request is made to correct an arithmetic, transposition or keying error made by either the taxpayer or Commissioner, the correction will be made without further consideration. WITHDRAWN 3 Factors the Commissioner may consider in more complex cases 12. When exercising the s 113 discretion in more complex cases, the Commissioner will evaluate any amendment request using the care and management principles. To best inform this care and management decision, the Commissioner will objectively consider the relevant factors discussed in this SPS (as required on a case-by-case basis). How does a taxpayer make a request to amend their assessment? 13. Requests to correct obvious errors, such as arithmetic, transposition and keying errors, may be made to Inland Revenue by telephone or in writing. 14. Requests to amend returns where the tax effect of the amendment requested is $10,000 or less may generally be made by telephone or in writing. 15. Requests to amend returns where the tax effect of the amendment requested is greater than $10,000 must be made in writing. 16. Taxpayers or their agents making amendment requests must supply the Commissioner with all relevant information to substantiate the merits of the amendment requested. How does s 113 relate to s 113A and the proviso to s 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985? 17. Where the taxpayer is able to make the required correction for themselves in a later period, the Commissioner’s practice is generally not to expend limited resources considering whether to exercise the discretion under s 113 in these circumstances. This is because both s 113A and the proviso to s 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”) provide a specific mechanism by which the taxpayer is able to self-correct the error. As such, the taxpayer does not need to request that the Commissioner amend an assessment under s 113 to make the correction. This outcome is more consistent with the scheme of the legislation, which requires that taxpayers take responsibility for correct assessments wherever possible.

The Commissioner acknowledges that both taxpayers and the Commissioner will occasionally make errors and that correcting these is an integral part of tax administration. 19. Section 113 contains a broad discretion allowing the Commissioner to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. This SPS outlines the general principles that will be followed. 20. The Commissioner will generally agree to amend assessments that are requested where the result can be clearly shown to be correct. This is subject to the criteria described below. It must also be borne in mind that, as a matter of law, the Commissioner cannot be compelled either to investigate amendment requests or subsequently to amend the assessments. 1 21. In determining whether to exercise the s 113 discretion, the Commissioner will evaluate an amendment request using the care and management principles in ss 6 and 6A of the TAA, while balancing the obligations of taxpayers to make correct self- assessments. 1 CIR v Wilson (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 (CA); Lawton v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,042 (CA). WITHDRAWN 5 22. The care and management principles are discussed below and more detailed guidance can be found in Interpretation Statement IS 10/07 Care and Management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts – Section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2 Care and management of the taxes Section 6: Integrity of the tax system 23. Section 6(1) of the TAA requires the Commissioner to use her best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system, including taxpayers’ perceptions of that integrity. In carrying out this function, the Commissioner is bound not only to protect the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially and according to law, but also to have regard to the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law. Section 15B of the TAA sets out taxpayers’ responsibilities and, in particular, the obligations to: (aa) if required under a tax law, make an assessment: (a) unless the taxpayer is a non-filing taxpayer, correctly determine the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer under the tax laws: (b) deduct or withhold the correct amounts of tax from payments or receipts of the taxpayer when required to do so by the tax laws: 24. Given this, the Commissioner may consider a taxpayer’s compliance history when deciding whether to apply s 113 to an amendment request. Although not decisive, a particularly poor compliance history may support the Commissioner declining to make the requested amendment where, in her opinion, making such an amendment would not promote other taxpayers’ perceptions of the integrity of the tax system or voluntary compliance (see further at \[55\] and \[56\] below). Section 6A 25. Section 6A (together with s 6) was enacted to provide the framework within which the Commissioner administers the tax system. Section 6A(3) clarifies the Commissioner’s overall objective in carrying out those functions. 26. To discharge her s 6A(3) duties, the Commissioner must compare the available courses of action as to their likely effect on the amount of net revenue collected over time. To do this, the Commissioner must consider the short- and long-term implications of each course of action and have regard to all three factors listed in s 6A(3). These factors are:  the resources available to the Commissioner (s 6A(3)(a));  the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts (s 6A(3)(b)); and  the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers (s 6A(3)(c)). 27. The practical effect of the words is that the Commissioner can adopt courses of action that forgo the collection of the highest net revenue:  in the short term, if it is considered that this will enable the collection of more net revenue in the longer term; and  from particular taxpayers, if it is considered that this will enable more net revenue to be collected from all taxpayers. 2 More information on this statement can be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: “IS 10/07”). WITHDRAWN 6 28. The words notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts in s 6A(3) mean that the Commissioner can carry out the course of action she considers will collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, even if it results in less tax being collected than is imposed, or required to be collected, by another provision. However, the words within the law in s 6A(3) also mean that the Commissioner must act consistently with the rest of the Inland Revenue Acts. Resources available to the Commissioner 29. Inland Revenue has limited resources to undertake what sometimes could be lengthy verification processes to determine whether the proposed amendment would result in a correct assessment. When meeting the obligation to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law under s 6A(3), the Commissioner must consider the resources available, promoting compliance (especially voluntary compliance) by all taxpayers, and taxpayers’ compliance costs. 30. Accordingly, it is consistent with the obligation under s 6A(3) for the Commissioner to limit the amount of time and other resources that will be spent investigating amendment requests. Not all requested amendments will necessarily be made. Ensuring a balance between time spent considering an amendment request and other activities is also consistent with the obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system under s 6(1). 31. The Commissioner will be reluctant to agree to investigate the correctness of an amendment request that would require the application of disproportionate amounts of Inland Revenue resources (that is, excessive resources when compared to the amount of tax at stake). This is not to say that the Commissioner will only use minimal resources to determine the correctness of amendment requests or never agree to complex amendment requests. The extent and relevance of a taxpayer’s disclosure and the amount of tax at stake for the amendment request will indicate the amount of the Commissioner’s resources needed to consider whether making the requested amendment will lead to a correct assessment being issued. The process used to consider s 113 requests 32. As stated in Westpac Securities NZ Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 3 (“Westpac”) at \[65\], “...the focus of the inquiry as to whether the power was available would be centred on whether the amendment the taxpayer seeks to have made will ensure the assessment is correct when amended, even if it was also correct beforehand”. 33. Once a taxpayer is able to show that making the requested amendment will result in a correct assessment being issued, the next step involves “the Commissioner’s decision whether or not to exercise her discretion in a particular case”. 4 34. In undertaking this approach, the Commissioner breaks the exercise into phases:  Phase one: An initial examination of the request. If it is clear and obvious that an error has occurred and that the error can be easily corrected, then the amendment will be made, subject to the application of phase four. The request will not have to progress through phases two and three. Conversely, if it is clear and obvious that agreeing to the request will not result in a correct assessment, the request will be declined at this phase. 3 \[2014\] NZHC 3377, (2014) 26 NZTC ¶21-118. 4 Westpac at \[66\]. WITHDRAWN 7  Phase two: If it is unclear whether agreeing to the request will result in a correct assessment being issued, the Commissioner will need to consider whether additional limited resources should be applied to consider the request further.  Phase three: In cases where it is decided to apply further resources, the Commissioner will consider whether a correct assessment will result from the requested amendment.  Phase four: Determine whether there is any residual reason (other than her limited resources) why the Commissioner should not make the requested amendment. The following flowchart illustrates the progress of a s 113 request through the four phases: Each of these phases is summarised below: Phase One: Initial examination of request 35. The Commissioner receives many thousands of requests each year, pointing out errors that have been made by both taxpayers and the Commissioner, and requesting that the appropriate assessment be amended. At this phase, the Commissioner considers the apparent merits of all s 113 requests. This consideration is based on the facts that are presented by the taxpayer in their request (and Section 113 request received by CIR Phase One: CIR examines the merits of the s 113 request Phase Two: CIR considers whether to apply limited resources Phase Three: Will a correct assessment result from the amendment requested? Phase Four: Is there any reason why the CIR should not make the assessment? CIR agrees to amend assessment Decline request Correct assessment cannot be issued CIR not willing to apply resources No Yes Unclear whether a correct assessment can be issued CIR willing to apply resources Yes No Correct assessment able to be issued WITHDRAWN 8 those that may already be known to the Commissioner). In the vast majority of these cases the facts are clear and it is obvious that making the requested amendment will correct an error that has been made. Conversely, it may be equally clear that making the requested amendment will not result in a correct assessment being able to be made. The aim of this phase is to act as a “filter” for these clearly correct/incorrect requests and, once the Commissioner has considered the merits of the request, to either decline the request or progress the request directly to phase four, and to do so with the minimum use of the Commissioner’s resources. There can be a number of factors that determine whether a request is able to be progressed to phase four (or declined) at this point, for instance:  If the amendment is being requested to correct an arithmetic, transposition or keying error made by either the taxpayer or Commissioner, the correction will be made without further consideration. See \[36\] below.  Has the taxpayer provided all the required information and has the request been made in the appropriate format? If not, the matter will not proceed unless the necessary information is provided. Note that this factor might also emerge at a later stage, when the Commissioner has begun to examine the question more closely, in which case the matter might not proceed further unless the necessary information can be easily provided by the taxpayer. See further at \[37\] and \[64\] to \[67\].  Is the taxpayer under investigation by Inland Revenue or involved in a dispute with the Commissioner? If so, the request is unlikely to proceed, subject to the outcome of any dispute. See further at \[44\] and \[75\] to \[78\].  Is the amendment able to be made by the taxpayer in a later period? See further at \[86\] to \[93\].  Is the period that the taxpayer wishes to have amended subject to a statutory time bar? For example, where the Commissioner is unable to refund an amount of tax because the period subject to the amendment request is time barred, resources will not be applied to considering the request for that statute-barred period further. See further at \[79\] to \[84\]. Arithmetic, transposition and keying errors 36. As already stated above, if a request is made to correct an arithmetic, transposition or keying error made by either the taxpayer or Commissioner, the correction will be made without further consideration. The Commissioner has already made a decision, based on the care and management principles discussed above, to allocate resources to ensure previously incorrect assessments are corrected. This is on the basis that the amendment required is straightforward and the amount of resources required is minor. Phase Two: Whether the Commissioner will apply resources to consider the request further 37. Given what has already been stated at phase one (at \[35\] above), the majority of s 113 requests will not need to be considered at this phase. Those cases that do need to be considered will be cases where, following the phase one consideration of the merits of the request, it remains uncertain whether acceding to the request will result in a correct assessment. These cases will be more complex. At this second phase, the Commissioner must decide whether to devote her limited resources to resolving requests when their correctness remains uncertain after the initial examination. In some cases, a balancing of the factors set out below will mean that the Commissioner can simply decide under s 113 to take the matter no further. This is because the courts have recognised that the allocation of resources is a matter for the Commissioner and she does not necessarily have to allocate resources to determine whether a proposed WITHDRAWN 9 amendment is indeed correct. Resource consideration commences at this phase and continues throughout the s 113 process. 38. The more easily verifiable the correctness of the proposed amendment is, the more likely it will be that the Commissioner will allocate resources to making the requested amendment. Where the proposed adjustment is merely arguable or involves disputed facts or statutory interpretation, it is less likely that the Commissioner will devote resources to processing the request further (see further at \[41\] to \[44\]). Factors the Commissioner may consider at Phase Two when determining whether to devote resources to considering the remaining requests 39. The cases that remain after phase one are those where it is not immediately certain that making the requested amendment will result in a correct assessment. Therefore, the Commissioner needs to determine if continuing to consider the request justifies the commitment of additional resources. 40. When determining whether to apply the s 113 discretion to these more complex cases, the Commissioner will evaluate any amendment request using the care and management principles discussed at \[23\] to \[31\] above. These care and management factors, as relevant on a case-by-case basis, will each be weighed up in reaching a decision. This is a balancing exercise where it will be rare for one factor to be determinative. Even if it is decided to proceed, it may later be necessary to re- evaluate the position if, for example, further information is needed and the issue becomes particularly difficult to resolve. The Commissioner may later determine that no further resources will be applied to the request. Primacy of disputes resolution process 41. Requesting an amendment under s 113 cannot be used as an alternative means of considering the merits of the assessment by circumventing the statutory disputes procedure. 5 Further, the Commissioner does not consider it appropriate to use s 113 to amend assessments when the facts of a case or the interpretation of the law to those facts is at issue. Disputed facts and statutory interpretation, or instances where the facts or law is unclear, should properly be considered using the disputes resolution process. 42. If a taxpayer is aware that they had the disputes resolution procedure available to them and did not engage with that process within the available time period, but then attempts to use s 113 to challenge an assessment outside the disputes resolution timeframe, the Commissioner will take this into account in deciding whether to decline the amendment request. 6 43. To accede to a taxpayer’s amendment request in these circumstances would potentially mean treating that taxpayer more advantageously than others who, in line with the statutory scheme of the TAA, use the disputes resolution regime to seek amendment to assessments. Section 6(2)(c) of the TAA requires that the Commissioner protect the rights of taxpayers to have their tax affairs treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other taxpayers. As Wylie J observed in Arai Korp (at \[68\]), a taxpayer who has sat on their hands and done nothing is not entitled to expect preferential treatment. 5 Tannadyce Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2011\] NZSC 158, (2011) 25 NZTC ¶20-103. 6 Arai Korp Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2013\] NZHC 958, (2013) 26 NZTC ¶21,014. WITHDRAWN 10 44. As stated previously, the Commissioner will not amend assessments while any item of those assessments remains the subject of a current dispute under Part 4A. The Commissioner will make any required amendment at the conclusion of the disputes process. In practice this means that resources will not be applied to the case. Whether the subject matter of the request could apply to other taxpayers 45. The focus of this factor is on whether the request could also have application for other taxpayers and, if so, the extent to which this would impact on the Commissioner’s resources. Commonly, in such cases, it will make sense for the matter to be considered further for the Commissioner to clarify the position for all taxpayers potentially affected. The more important the precedent value, the more likely it is that resources will be applied. How similar requests have been treated by the Commissioner 46. Similarly, if the Commissioner has allowed other requests with the same facts and legal analysis, then this would be a factor that would generally support exercising the discretion. However, if an assessment was previously amended under s 113 on what the Commissioner now considers to be an incorrect basis, then that would not provide authority for treating similar requests in the same manner. Whether the request is a voluntary disclosure 47. The Commissioner will, as a matter of practice, always apply resources to considering a s 113 request that amounts to a voluntary disclosure (in that the request discloses a tax shortfall). This is on the basis that resources will be applied to considering whether the disclosure is full and complete and whether a shortfall penalty should be imposed in accordance with the process set out in SPS 09/02 Voluntary disclosures. Therefore, she is not applying any additional resources in considering the s 113 request. See further at \[71\] to \[73\]. Whether the taxpayer took their original position relying on advice from the Commissioner 48. As a matter of practice, the Commissioner will generally follow public statements. However, the Commissioner is not strictly bound by such statements or other advice unless they are binding rulings that apply to the particular taxpayer and arrangement. 7 49. From time to time, the Commissioner will take the view that advice that has previously been given is incorrect. This may occur, for example, where the court clarifies the law or the Commissioner takes a different view of the law. 50. Where the Commissioner has given incorrect advice (other than a binding ruling), this does not operate to change the tax legally payable on the basis of the correct application of the law (because the Commissioner cannot simply choose to alter the statutory basis of an assessment 8 ). However, it may mean that an assessment previously made on the basis of that advice is now incorrect. Accordingly, that assessment may be corrected by the Commissioner following the application of the principles set out in this SPS, for example, provided it is possible to correctly establish the correct position without undue application of the Commissioner’s resources. 7 CIR v Ti Toki Cabarets (1989) Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,874 (CA); Lemmington Holdings Ltd (No 2) v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,576 (HC); Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 21,694 (HC). 8 Vestey v IRC (1979) 3 All ER 976 (HL); R v IRC, ex p Wilkinson \[2006\] 1 All ER 529 (HL) WITHDRAWN 11 51. The Commissioner’s statement Status of the Commissioner’s advice 9 more fully sets out the status of advice that is given by the Commissioner. It discusses the circumstances in which a change of view will be applied retrospectively and may therefore result in the approval of requests to amend existing assessments made in reliance on the former view of the Commissioner. Whether there has been a delay in making the request 52. This factor relates to the length of time since the original position was first taken or the taxpayer became aware of the issue, or between the taxpayer becoming aware of the issue and the s 113 request. 53. When a substantial amount of time has passed between the events relevant to the proposed amendment and the request, it may be difficult for the Commissioner to ascertain and/or verify the relevant facts. The longer that time the more this factor supports a decision not to investigate the request further, after making a preliminary review of the adequacy of the material. The size of the proposed amendment 54. If the size of the amendment is large in absolute terms or material for the taxpayer, this might be a factor that supports the Commissioner devoting resources to determine the correctness of the amendment. Conversely, very small amounts might not justify the allocation of resources when the care and management factors are viewed as a whole, unless it is a very straightforward case. This factor should never be decisive however. Taxpayer’s compliance history 55. The Commissioner may take a taxpayer’s compliance history into consideration when deciding whether to apply resources to an amendment request. Although never decisive, a particularly poor compliance history may support the Commissioner’s decision not to devote resources to consider the correctness of the requested amendment. 10 This may occur, for instance, when a taxpayer’s compliance history means the Commissioner is unable to accept the evidence for the requested amendment at face value and considers that, as a result, further investigation is required. 56. Agreeing to the requested amendment in this circumstance, without further investigation, could be seen as undermining other taxpayers’ perceptions of the integrity of the tax system and voluntary compliance. It is emphasised that declining a s 113 request in this circumstance will be a rare occurrence and will require the approval of a senior officer. Any other considerations relevant to the particular case 57. The above list of factors is intended to be comprehensive, recognising the broad discretionary power contained in s 113, but not to be exhaustive. There may be other considerations arising out of a particular case that are relevant in determining what impact the proposed course of action for that particular case would have on voluntary compliance and on the integrity of the tax system, including taxpayer perception of that integrity. 9 More information on this Statement may be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: “status of Commissioners advice”) 10 Arai Korp; Charter Holdings Ltd v C of IR (No 2) \[2015\] NZHC 2041, (2015) 27 NZTC ¶22-022 WITHDRAWN 12 Phase Three: Whether a correct assessment will result from the requested amendment 58. Where it is decided to apply additional resources to consider the requested amendment (which will most often be the case), the Commissioner will then consider the merits of the request and act accordingly. Sometimes this will require further information to be provided by the taxpayer and additional technical analysis to be undertaken. This step may take some time. The position requested must be consistent with the Commissioner’s view of the law, on the facts presented. If, after examining the request, the Commissioner concludes that a correct assessment can be issued, the request will be progressed to phase four. However, if the requested position is contrary to the Commissioner’s view of the law, or the Commissioner remains uncertain that a correct assessment can be made, the request will be declined. In addition, if the commitment of resources proves to be much greater than anticipated in the context of the matters raised during this phase, the request will revert to phase two and the issue of the Commissioner’s resources will be reconsidered. Phase Four: Final Considerations: Whether the discretion will always be exercised 59. When the Commissioner is satisfied the amendment requested will lead to the making of a correct assessment, that assessment will be made unless a relatively rare circumstance exists that suggests that, on balance, the integrity of the tax system will be undermined. These circumstances can include, for example: (a) Where the request is, or is part of, a tax avoidance arrangement. This is because, while the requested adjustment may be a correct interpretation of the law when considered in isolation, the Commissioner would not be convinced that the resulting assessment would be correct given the presence of tax avoidance. The Commissioner’s view of the law on tax avoidance is set out in Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 – Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 11 (b) Where a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to amend an assessment from one correct tax position to another position that is also correct When a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to amend an assessment from one correct tax position to another tax position that is also correct, the fact the original position was correct is a factor the Commissioner may take into account in deciding whether to use her discretion to make the amendment requested. As stated by Clifford J in Westpac at \[67\]: There could be any number of valid reasons why the Commissioner may decline to exercise her discretion in situations of regretted correct tax positions including where the taxpayer appears to be gaming the system. ... The fact that Westpac, a well resourced, sophisticated and well advised taxpayer says that it “erred” when the relevant offset elections were made may be a proposition that the Commissioner will need to consider carefully when deciding whether or not to exercise her discretion. 11 More information on this Statement may be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword “interpretation of BG 1”). WITHDRAWN 13 Two matters flow from these judicial comments. Firstly, whether a taxpayer erred in taking their original tax position is a factor the Commissioner may take into account in deciding whether to make the requested adjustment. A taxpayer could be said to have “erred” where they did not take the tax position they intended, through mistake or oversight, or the tax position they took, though technically possible and therefore already correct, was not one they would have taken if they had been in possession of all the relevant facts at that time. If the request arises from such an oversight, it is more likely the amendment will be made than if the request is simply the result of the taxpayer changing their mind. This is because the TAA places an obligation on taxpayers to make self- assessments correctly and it is not contemplated that unlimited additional variations can be made at a cost to the Commissioner. Amendments should not be able to be made merely at will. On this basis, a request for multiple changes to tax positions will also be unlikely to be agreed to. The Commissioner may also take into account the fact a taxpayer is “well resourced, sophisticated and well advised” and therefore generally better equipped to be able to provide evidence that they erred in taking their original position. 60. To allow an amendment in these circumstances may have a negative impact on other taxpayers’ perceptions of the integrity of the tax system, especially as they relate to the concepts of statutory timeframes 12 , certainty and their own future voluntary compliance. In these instances, the decision not to apply the discretion will be made by a senior Inland Revenue officer, with advice from the Legal and Technical Services group. How does a taxpayer make a request to amend their assessment? Mode of request 61. A request to correct obvious errors, such as arithmetic, transposition and keying errors may be made by telephone or in writing. 13 62. A request to make adjustments other than these obvious errors must be made as follows:  Requests to amend returns where the tax effect of the amendment requested is $10,000 or less may be made by telephone or in writing. However, where the request is made by telephone, Inland Revenue may ask that these requests be put in writing, especially where, for example, there are consequential adjustments that may need to be made to other returns or taxpayers.  Requests to amend returns where the tax effect of the amendment requested is greater than $10,000 must be made in writing. 63. To ensure there is a clear record of the amendment request made by a taxpayer, other than a request to adjust for an obvious error (as provided in \[61\] above), the ability to accept an amendment request by telephone is limited to calls that are received by Inland Revenue at a site that has call recording. For practical purposes, this means that a taxpayer will need to call using one of Inland Revenue’s 0800 numbers. Where a call is received by a site that does not have call recording, the taxpayer may be asked to put their request in writing. An amendment request for an 12 Wilson; Charter Holdings Ltd 13 “in writing” includes by electronic means. WITHDRAWN 14 obvious error that is made by telephone should also be made by calling one of Inland Revenue’s 0800 numbers. However, these requests will be dealt with irrespective of whether the site receiving the call has call recording. Information required with request 64. The onus is on the taxpayer to provide all relevant information with their amendment request. This information will enable the Commissioner to consider the merits of the amendment request and verify that the amendment will lead to a correct assessment. Providing all relevant information at this early stage will help to have the request dealt with in the truncated phase one/phase four process (see further at \[35\] above). 65. If insufficient information is provided to enable the Commissioner to confirm that a correct assessment will result from the requested amendment, the request may be declined or the taxpayer will be asked to supply the missing information (if this is known). Where a request is declined because of insufficient information, the taxpayer is able to reapply once the missing information is obtained. 66. As stated previously in this SPS, whether the Commissioner will devote resources to determine the correctness of the amendment requested is something that will continue to be considered throughout this verification process, using care and management principles. The Commissioner must make appropriate resourcing decisions using these principles, regardless of the effort and resources committed by the taxpayer. 67. Taxpayers or their agents making amendment requests under s 113 must supply the Commissioner with all relevant information to substantiate the merits of the amendment requested. This should include the following (as relevant):  the tax types and periods containing the tax position that the taxpayer wishes to amend;  the decrease in tax liability 14 that will result from any amendment;  a description of the original tax position, including the background circumstances and the reasons the original tax position was taken;  the nature of the amendment, including any relevant tax laws;  how and why the need for the amendment was identified;  details of any incorrect advice given directly to the taxpayer by Inland Revenue and how the taxpayer relied on that advice;  the action required to ensure correctness;  all relevant documents and records or other information supporting the amendment request;  whether the taxpayer is aware of any relevant view published by the Commissioner and the extent to which the taxpayer’s amended tax position is consistent with that published view. Amending assessments Advice to taxpayers 68. Where the decision is to decline to amend the assessment, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of the decision and the reasons the request was declined. Where the request has been made by telephone, the decision to decline and the reasons for declining the request may be given during the telephone call. If a 14 An amendment request that results in an increase in the tax payable is a voluntary disclosure and will be dealt with by following the process set out in SPS 09/02 Voluntary disclosures. See \[71\] – \[73\] below. WITHDRAWN 15 final decision cannot be given at the time the telephone call is received, the final decision (to decline the request, together with the reasons for declining) may be given either by a telephone call to the taxpayer (or their agent) or in writing. Consequential adjustments 69. When amending an assessment, the Commissioner will ensure that all consequential adjustments to other tax types and/or periods (including other taxpayers’ assessments) are made once they are confirmed by the affected taxpayers. That may mean that in some cases the Commissioner will require further information before making such consequential amendments. Fresh or increased liability 70. Under s 113(2), if any amended assessment imposes a fresh or increased liability, the Commissioner will give written notice to the taxpayer. Voluntary disclosures 71. For the purposes of this SPS, a “voluntary disclosure” is defined as any amendment request that, if accepted by the Commissioner, would result in an increase in the tax payable by a taxpayer or a decrease in the amount of any loss available to be utilised by the taxpayer. 72. Where a taxpayer makes an amendment request that is a voluntary disclosure, that disclosure must follow the process outlined in SPS 09/02 Voluntary disclosures 15 or any SPS issued in replacement. Further information on the voluntary disclosure process may also be found in Parts 3 and 4 of the guide IR280 Putting your tax returns right 16 or any guide issued in replacement. 73. Once a taxpayer’s voluntary disclosure has been accepted as being valid by the Commissioner, s 113 provides the legislative authority for effecting the reassessment. Generally, a similar approach to that outlined in this SPS will apply, except that the Commissioner will always commit resources to the request (See \[47\] above). Shortfall penalties 74. Where an amendment request that constitutes a voluntary disclosure imposes a fresh liability or increases an existing liability, the taxpayer may also be liable to a shortfall penalty. Whether a shortfall penalty will be imposed and whether the penalty will be reduced to take account of the voluntary disclosure are matters that will be considered as part of the voluntary disclosure process. This is discussed further in SPS 09/02 Voluntary disclosures. Related matters Investigations 75. Inland Revenue undertakes various types of investigation activities. For the purposes of this SPS, an investigation means any examination of a taxpayer’s financial affairs to verify that they have paid the correct amount of tax and complied with their tax obligations. 15 More information on this Statement may be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword “SPS 09/02”). 16 More information on this guide may be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword “IR280”). WITHDRAWN 16 76. Irrespective of whether there is a current dispute, if the period and tax type relating to an amendment request is already under investigation, the Commissioner will make any appropriate consequential amendments. That is, if the Commissioner is already devoting resources to verifying the correctness of an assessment, all reasonable consequential effects of the investigation (including the amendment request) will be considered as part of that process. 77. The Commissioner may make any consequential adjustments (that is, adjustments not requested by the taxpayer under investigation) to the taxpayer’s other assessments or to other taxpayers affected by adjustments resulting from the investigation. The consequential adjustments could relate to the same or different tax types. 78. If the Commissioner agrees with the amendment request, then (subject to the limitations set out below) the amendments will be incorporated into the amended assessment arising from the investigation. The Commissioner cannot amend an assessment to reflect an amendment request before finalising the position for the other issues arising from the investigation. The amendments will be treated in the same way as any other agreed adjustments arising out of the investigation. Time limits on increasing assessments 79. Generally the Commissioner cannot increase previously assessed amounts (or decrease the amount of net loss) after the expiration of four years from the end of the tax year in which the income tax returns were provided (ss 108, 108A). 80. As stated at \[71\], for the purposes of this SPS, a “voluntary disclosure” is defined as any amendment request that, if accepted by the Commissioner, would result in an increase in the tax payable by a taxpayer or a decrease in the amount of any loss available to be utilised by the taxpayer. Given this, whether the period subject to the voluntary disclosure is time barred is a matter that will be considered as part of that process. Time limits on tax refunds 81. Before the Commissioner is able to refund an amount of overpaid tax, she must first exercise her s 113 discretion. As stated previously in this SPS, where the Commissioner is unable to refund an amount of tax because the period subject to the amendment request is time barred, resources will not be applied to considering the request for that statute-barred period. Generally, the Commissioner is unable to refund an amount of overpaid tax where the four-year period in s 108 of the TAA has expired. For all taxes (other than GST), this rule, together with a number of exceptions to it, is set out in Subpart RM of the Income Tax Act 2007. Time limits on GST refunds 82. As with the refund of other taxes, before the Commissioner makes a refund of overpaid GST she must first decide whether to exercise the s 113 discretion. Where it is decided to apply resources, the general rule is that the Commissioner cannot refund an amount of overpaid GST after the expiry of the four-year period in s 108A of the TAA. The exceptions to this general rule are set out in s 45 of the GST Act. Amended assessments after expiry of the four-year time limit for increasing assessments 83. As noted above, in some instances there are exceptions to the general four-year time limit for the Commissioner either to increase an assessment or make a refund. When a taxpayer requests a refund after the four-year limitation period, in considering the refund request the Commissioner will also incorporate any debit adjustments that WITHDRAWN 17 would have been made but for the application of the four-year time limit. This will ensure the correctness of the assessment. 84. Because, generally, the Commissioner cannot increase an assessment outside the four-year limitation period, if the amount of any required debit adjustment exceeds the refund requested by the taxpayer, the amendment will not be made. Default assessments 85. If the Commissioner has raised assessments under s 106 of the TAA (commonly known as default assessments) and the taxpayer subsequently files tax returns for those default assessments outside the relevant response periods, the Commissioner will treat the tax returns as amendment requests. The Commissioner will generally amend the assessments under s 113 after confirming that the tax returns contain correct tax positions. In addition, if the taxpayer is within the relevant response periods, they should consider issuing notices of proposed adjustments under s 89D(1) along with their tax returns to preserve their disputes rights against the possibility that the Commissioner may decline the exercise of the s 113 discretion. What is the relationship between s 113 and s 113A? 86. Under s 113, errors are generally required to be corrected in the return period in which they arose. However, s 113A allows taxpayers to correct minor errors made in income tax returns (including RWT and NRWT), FBT returns or GST returns in the next return that is due after the discovery of the error. 87. A minor error includes an error that was caused by a clear mistake, simple oversight or mistaken understanding on the taxpayer’s part and that, for a single return, causes a discrepancy in the assessment of that return of $1,000 17 or less. When calculating the $1,000 18 discrepancy, income tax, FBT and GST returns are each treated separately. 88. While the Commissioner is not prevented from exercising the discretion under s 113 where the taxpayer is able to make the required correction themselves in a later period, the Commissioner’s practice is generally not to expend resources in these circumstances. This is because s 113A provides a specific mechanism by which the taxpayer is able to correct the error themselves. As such, the taxpayer does not need to request that the Commissioner amend an assessment under s 113 to make the correction. 89. However, in certain circumstances the Commissioner will exercise the discretion under s 113, notwithstanding that the taxpayer is able to make the required correction using s 113A. Without limiting those circumstances, some examples include:  Where the error has occurred in a taxpayer’s final return for that revenue type and therefore there is no future return in which to make an adjustment under section 113A.  Where not correcting the error in an earlier period using s 113 will negatively impact an entitlement of the taxpayer. For example, where making the amendment under s 113 will increase the taxpayer’s Working for Families tax credit entitlement from that earlier date. 17 Previously $500. Amended by section 112 of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017, with effect from 1 April 2017. 18 As above n 17. WITHDRAWN 18 90. Taxpayers are not required to notify the Commissioner specifically of the corrections made under s 113A. However, Inland Revenue may review error adjustments as part of its investigation activity to ensure the adjustments were correct. Inland Revenue expects taxpayers to maintain sufficient records to substantiate any adjustments made and explain the reasons that the minor error arose in the first place. 91. For further information regarding the application of s 113A, please see the item Correction of minor errors in subsequent returns included in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 1 (February 2010): 30. What is the relationship between s 113 and the proviso to s 20(3) of the GST Act? 92. When a registered person has not claimed a GST input tax deduction in an earlier taxable period then, under the proviso to s 20(3) of the GST Act, the person can claim that deduction in a later period. This contrasts with the treatment of the same error afforded by s 113, which would be to correct the earlier GST return to which the input tax deduction related. 93. While the Commissioner is not prevented from exercising the discretion under s 113, the presence of the specific provision in s 20(3) for this type of GST error means that the Commissioner’s practice is generally not to exercise the discretion in these circumstances. Because s 20(3) provides taxpayers with a specific mechanism to correct their failure to claim the GST input tax deduction, the Commissioner’s view is that a general provision such as s 113 should not be used. For further guidance see QB 09/04 The relationship between section 113 of the TAA and the proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act when a registered person has not claimed an input tax deduction in an earlier taxable period. 19 This outcome is considered to be more consistent with the scheme of the legislation and in particular s 15B, which requires that taxpayers take responsibility for correct assessments wherever possible. Challenge rights 94. A taxpayer cannot challenge the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion under s 113 by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority. 20 However, the exercise of this discretion (or the decision not to make the amendment requested) may be subject to judicial review. Reconsideration and complaint rights 95. If a taxpayer is concerned that their circumstances have not been given proper consideration, they should raise their concern with the staff member that considered their request and ask for the decision to be reviewed by a more senior officer. 96. If a taxpayer is still not satisfied with the level of service they receive, they can obtain more information about the Inland Revenue Complaints Management Service at http://www.ird.govt.nz/how-to/disputes/findout-disputes-cmplts-mgmnt-srvc.html or phone 0800 274 138 (Monday to Friday between 8am and 5pm). 19 More information on this statement may be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword “QB 09/04”). 20 Section 138E(1)(e)(iv) WITHDRAWN 19 This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 01 April 2016 Graham Tubb Group Tax Counsel Legal and Technical Services WITHDRAWN 20 Appendix Legislation Of particular relevance to the Commissioner when considering requests to amend assessments are the following sections of the TAA: Section 6 Responsibility on Ministers and officials to protect integrity of tax system (1) Every Minister and every officer of any government agency having responsibilities under this Act or any other Act in relation to the collection of taxes and other functions under the Inland Revenue Acts are at all times to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system.

CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Standard Practice Statement SPS 16/05 Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue INTRODUCTION Standard Practice Statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Standard Practice Statement (“SPS”) sets out the Commissioner’s rights and responsibilities with a taxpayer in respect of an adjustment to an assessment when the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process. Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). Where a taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner’s practice is set out in ED0188: Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer. The Commissioner regards this SPS as a reference guide for taxpayers and Inland Revenue officers. Where possible, Inland Revenue officers must follow the practices outlined in this SPS. The disputes resolution process is designed to ensure that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process. The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case proceeds to a court. This SPS has been updated to include minor amendments to the ”response period” as defined in the TAA, and also the introduction of the new communications framework contained in sections 14 to 14G. Where the legislation requires notification of something in terms of section 14C, this statement is written in terms of that notice being “in writing”. The new communications framework requires that the notice be delivered by way of post, by personal delivery, by electronic means or by facsimile. The use of the term “in writing” is not intended to imply that delivery is limited to being by post. For further explanation of the new communications framework, refer to Tax Information Bulletin Vol.28 No.7 (August 2016). In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N(1)(c)) must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment. WITHDRAWN - replaced by SPS 23/01 CLASSIFIED PUBLIC APPLICATION This SPS applies from 10 October 2016 and incorporates legislative changes to the disputes process enacted in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016, and also the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016 which introduced the new communications framework. It replaces SPS 11/05: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue dated 13 October 2011. STANDARD PRACTICE Background 1.The tax disputes resolution procedures were introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the Richardson Committee in the Report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department (April 1994) and were designed to reduce the number of disputes by: (a) promoting full disclosure, and (b) encouraging the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes, and (c) promoting the early identification of issues, and Précis of changes to SPS 11/05 Apart from what are general style and grammar changes, this SPS incorporates the new definition of “response period” contained in section 89AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”). It also includes changes necessary as a result of the introduction of the communications framework contained in sections 14 to 14G of the TAA. Some of the examples given in the SPS have also been updated. How these changes impact on the Statement: There are changes to the definition of “response period” when a disputant’s NOPA or SOP is received late but it is determined that exceptional circumstances exist. Where the Commissioner or the Courts accept that exceptional circumstances exist, the response period will commence from the day on which the Commissioner issues a notice in favour of the taxpayer, or the day on which a taxpayer’s challenge to the Commissioner’s refusal under section 89K(4) is finally judged successful by the Taxation Review Authority (or the day the Commissioner concedes). This aspect had not been covered by the previous SPS. The new sections 14 to 14G of the TAA provide a legislative framework that facilitates information flows between the Commissioner and a person, and between two persons where the tax legislation governs that interaction. At the same time as introducing the new provisions, terminology referring to specific modes of communication was also changed to reflect the wording of the new framework. The previous SPS contained a number of references to certain informal or administrative communications that are not specifically provided for in the legislation. Where practical and appropriate, the new SPS is written to reflect wording that is consistent with the law. For example, in various places the previous SPS used the word “inform” to describe the communication between the Commissioner and a taxpayer. However, often the law does not require such communication. This is an administrative process. The word “inform” is covered by section 14B of the TAA. As such, the new SPS uses the word “advise”. This avoids any confusion as to whether this communication is a legislative requirement. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (d) improving the accuracy of decisions. 2.The disputes resolution process ensures that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process. 3.The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure and encourage as far as practicable, the disclosure of all relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law before a case proceeds to a court or hearing authority. 4.In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N(1)(c)) must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment. 5.The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps specified in the TAA. The main elements of those steps are the issue of: (a) a notice of proposed adjustment (“NOPA”): this is a notice that either the Commissioner or taxpayer issues to the other advising that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer’s assessment, the Commissioner’s assessment or other disputable decision (the prescribed form is the Notice of proposed adjustment (IR 770)). A NOPA is the formal document which begins the disputes process; (b) a notice of response (“NOR”): this must be issued by the recipient of a NOPA if they disagree with it (the preferred form is the Notice of response (IR 771)); (c) a disclosure notice and statement of position (“SOP”): the issue of a disclosure notice and SOP by the Commissioner triggers the requirement for the taxpayer to provide a SOP to continue the dispute. Each SOP must provide an outline of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the positions taken. Each party must issue a SOP (the preferred form is the Statement of position (IR 773)). The SOPs are important documents because they limit the issues and propositions of law that either party can rely on if the case proceeds to court to what is included in the SOP (unless a hearing authority makes an order that allows a party to raise new issues and propositions of law under section 138G(2)). 6.There are also two administrative phases in the disputes process: the conference and adjudication phases. If the dispute has not been already resolved after the NOR phase, the Commissioner’s practice will be to hold a conference. A conference can be a formal or informal discussion between the parties to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues. 7.If the dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase, the Commissioner will prepare a SOP and refer the dispute to adjudication, except in certain circumstances. One of the circumstances where the Commissioner will not refer a dispute to adjudication is where the Commissioner and the taxpayer have agreed in writing not to complete the disputes process (referred to as “opt out”, see paragraphs 162 to 185). 8.Adjudication involves an independent review of the dispute by Inland Revenue’s Disputes Review Unit, which was formed to provide an internal but impartial review of unresolved disputes. Adjudication is the final phase in the disputes process before WITHDRAWNWITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC the taxpayer’s assessment is amended (if it is to be amended) following the exchange of the SOPs. 9.Timely progression of disputes through the disputes process may require the use of the Commissioner’s information-gathering powers (particularly section 17) before and/or during the disputes process. 10.Inland Revenue has a quality assurance review process known as Critical Task Assurance (“CTA”) which is designed to ensure that key pieces of work (including NOPAs and SOPs) are subject to an independent review by Legal and Technical Services (“LTS”) before being issued. Given the importance of the disputes process to the Commissioner and to taxpayers, Inland Revenue officers are required to get CTA approval of disputes documents prior to issue.

Any failure to meet these administrative timeframes will WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC not invalidate subsequent actions of the Commissioner or prevent the case from going through the disputes process. Paragraph in the SPS Key actions Indicative timeframes The Commissioner’s NOPA 30 The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer that a NOPA will be issued. Usually within five working days before the date that the Commissioner issues a NOPA, but this may happen earlier. 35 The Commissioner will confirm whether the taxpayer has received the Commissioner’s NOPA (either by telephone or in writing). Within 10 working days from the date that the Commissioner’s NOPA is issued, where practicable. Taxpayer’s NOR 90 The taxpayer issues a NOR in response to the Commissioner’s NOPA within the applicable response period. Within two months from the date that the Commissioner’s NOPA is issued, unless section 89K applies. 92 The Commissioner will confirm whether the taxpayer will issue a NOR. Usually two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner’s NOPA expires. 117 The Commissioner will forward the taxpayer’s NOR to the responsible officer. Usually within five working days after the taxpayer’s NOR is received. 118 The Commissioner will acknowledge the receipt of the taxpayer’s NOR. Usually within 10 working days after the taxpayer’s NOR is received. 123 The Commissioner will advise that the taxpayer’s NOR is deficient, but the two-month response period has not expired. Inland Revenue officers will advise the taxpayer or their agent immediately after they become aware of the deficiency. 107 The Commissioner will consider the application of section 89K, where a taxpayer’s NOR has been issued outside the applicable response period. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer of the outcome within one month of receipt of the disputant’s “late” notice. If the application is rejected, a refusal notice will be issued. 96 The taxpayer is deemed to accept the Commissioner’s NOPA, because they failed to issue a NOR within the applicable response period and section 89K does not apply in the case of a late NOR. At the end of the two-month period starting on the date of issue of the Commissioner’s NOPA. 96 The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that they are deemed to accept the Commissioner’s NOPA. Usually two weeks after the response period to the Commissioner’s NOPA has expired. 119 The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer whether their NOR is being considered, has been accepted, or rejected in full or part. Usually within one month after the taxpayer’s NOR is received. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 120 If the taxpayer’s NOR has been accepted in full, the dispute finishes and Inland Revenue will take appropriate actions (for example, issue an amended assessment). Usually within one month after the advice of acceptance of the NOR is issued. Conference phase 137 The Commissioner will write to the taxpayer to initiate the conference phase and to offer a facilitated conference. The Commissioner’s offer of a facilitated conference will be made in writing within one month from the date of issue of the taxpayer’s NOR. The conference letter marks the start of the conference phase. 139 The taxpayer will advise Inland Revenue whether they will attend the conference meeting, and whether they will accept the conference facilitation offer. Usually within two weeks of receipt of the conference facilitation letter. If the taxpayer does not respond within this timeframe, the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute will contact the taxpayer about the letter. 140 When a taxpayer agrees to attend a conference meeting, Inland Revenue will contact the taxpayer to establish a timeframe, and agree on how the meeting will be conducted. Usually within two weeks following the taxpayer’s agreement to a conference. 144 Conference meeting(s) and further information exchange between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. The suggested average timeframe of the conference phase is three months, subject to the facts and complexity of the dispute. Opt out 169 The taxpayer may seek to opt out of the disputes resolution process. Within two weeks from the end of the conference phase. 169 Inland Revenue officer will advise the taxpayer whether the request to opt out has been agreed to. Usually within two weeks from the date of the taxpayer’s request to opt out. Disclosure notice and the Commissioner’s SOP 201 The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer that a disclosure notice and the Commissioner’s SOP will be issued. Usually within two weeks before the date that the Commissioner’s disclosure notice and SOP are issued. 210 The Commissioner will issue a disclosure notice and the Commissioner’s SOP. Usually within three months from the end of the conference phase or within three months from the date when the Commissioner advises that the taxpayer’s opt out request has been declined. Taxpayer’s SOP 233 The taxpayer must issue a SOP within the response period for the disclosure notice. Within two months after the date that the disclosure notice is issued, unless section 89K applies. 236 The Commissioner will confirm whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP. Usually two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner’s disclosure notice expires. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 237 The taxpayer’s SOP is forwarded to the responsible officer. Usually within five working days after the taxpayer’s SOP is received. 238 The Commissioner will acknowledge the receipt of the taxpayer’s SOP. Usually within 10 working days after the taxpayer’s SOP is received. 238 The Commissioner will advise that the taxpayer’s SOP is deficient, but the two-month response period has not expired. Inland Revenue officers will advise the taxpayer or their agent as soon as they become aware of the deficiency. 239 The Commissioner will consider the application of section 89K, where the taxpayer’s SOP has been issued outside the applicable response period. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer of the outcome within one month of receipt of the disputant’s late SOP. If the application is rejected, a refusal notice will be issued. 240 The Commissioner will advise that taxpayer is deemed to accept the Commissioner’s SOP, because they failed to issue a SOP within the applicable response period and section 89K does not apply. Usually two weeks after the response period for the disclosure notice expires. Addendum to the Commissioner’s SOP 241 The Commissioner can provide additional information via an addendum to the Commissioner’s SOP under section 89M(8) within the response period for the taxpayer’s SOP. Within two months after the taxpayer’s SOP is issued. 244 The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer whether additional information to the Commissioner’s SOP will be provided via an addendum under section 89M(8). Usually within two weeks after the taxpayer’s SOP is received, subject to the facts and complexity of the dispute and the available response period. 246 The Commissioner will consider whether to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13). Usually within one month after the date that the Commissioner’s addendum is issued. Adjudication 259 The Commissioner will prepare a cover sheet and issue a letter (including a copy of the cover sheet) to the taxpayer to seek their concurrence of the materials to be sent to the adjudicator. Usually within one month after the date that the Commissioner’s addendum (if any) is issued or within one month from the date that the response period for the taxpayer’s SOP to expire. 260 The taxpayer must respond to the Commissioner’s letter. Within 10 working days after the date that the Commissioner’s letter is issued. 261 The Commissioner will forward materials relevant to the dispute to the Disputes Review Unit. Usually after the taxpayer has concurred on the materials to be sent to the Disputes Review Unit or after the 10 working days allowed for the taxpayer’s response have elapsed if no response is received. 253 Adjudication of the disputes case. Usually within three months after the date that the Disputes Review Unit receives the dispute files depending on WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC the number of disputes that are before the Disputes Review Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. ANALYSIS NOTICE OF PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT (NOPA) The Commissioner must issue a NOPA before making an assessment 14.The Commissioner must issue a NOPA before making an assessment (including an assessment of shortfall penalties but excluding other civil penalties and interest), unless an exception to the requirement that a NOPA be issued applies under section 89C. For a detailed discussion of these exceptions see Appendix 1. 15.Nevertheless, even if the Commissioner, in a very unlikely event, made an assessment in breach of section 89C, the assessment would be regarded as being valid under section 114(a). 16.Each exception under section 89C can apply independently or together depending on the circumstances. However, the Commissioner can also choose to issue a NOPA before making an assessment notwithstanding that an exception under section 89C applies. A disputable decision 17.Pursuant to the definition in section 3(1), a disputable decision is: (a) an assessment, or (b)a decision that the Commissioner makes under a tax law, except for a decision: (i)to decline to issue a binding ruling, or (ii) that cannot be the subject of an objection or challenge, or (iii)that is left to the Commissioner’s discretion under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8), (10) and 89N(3). 18.The Commissioner will generally issue a NOPA before issuing an assessment that takes into account a disputable decision. 19.For example, the Commissioner issues a notice of disputable decision to a taxpayer in relation to their residency status. The Commissioner will generally issue a NOPA where it is proposed to adjust any assessment to take into account that decision. A Taxpayer can dispute an assessment that is issued without a NOPA 20.The Commissioner can issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA under section 89C in the circumstances outlined above. Although the Commissioner must always endeavour to apply the exceptions under section 89C correctly, any assessment made in breach of section 89C will still be treated as valid under section 114(a). 21.Where the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can dispute the assessment through the disputes process under section WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 89D(1). (See SPS 16/06: Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer or any replacement SPS.) 22.However, where the Commissioner issues a NOPA to a taxpayer and they accept the proposed adjustment by written agreement or are deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment, then section 89I(1) precludes the taxpayer from challenging the assessment. 23.However, section 89I cannot apply if the Commissioner and taxpayer have agreed on an adjustment before entering into the disputes process. The parties can dispute the amended assessment, notwithstanding the previous agreement. When the Commissioner can issue a NOPA 24.Section 89B specifies when the Commissioner can issue a NOPA. 25.Under section 89B(1) the Commissioner can issue one NOPA for multiple issues, tax types and periods. Alternatively, the Commissioner can issue multiple NOPAs for the same issue and period, consistent with the obligation to correctly make an assessment within the four-year statutory time period. 26.An investigation will have been substantially completed, the facts ascertained, and the proposed adjustment identified and discussed with the taxpayer before a formal NOPA is issued. The Commissioner may actively use her powers to require production of documents in order to ensure that a sustainable position can be taken in the NOPA. The NOPA will also have been quality checked by Legal and Technical Services. 27.A NOPA is not an assessment. It is an initiating action that allows open and full communication between the parties. If possible, the taxpayer will be given the opportunity to settle a dispute by entering into an agreed adjustment with Inland Revenue before the Commissioner issues a NOPA. 28.However, the Commissioner or taxpayer is not precluded from issuing a NOPA in respect of any amended assessment that the Commissioner has previously issued to reflect the agreed adjustment. 29.A NOPA forms a basis for ensuring that the Commissioner does not issue an assessment without some formal and structured dialogue with the taxpayer in respect of the grounds upon which the Commissioner will issue any assessment or amended assessment (McIlraith v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,456). 30.Once an investigation has commenced, the intended approach must be discussed with the taxpayer. If the Commissioner decides to issue a NOPA, the responsible officer will endeavour to advise the taxpayer at least five working days before the date that the NOPA is issued. This is to allow the taxpayer time to consider their position and/or seek advice. However, the taxpayer can also be advised earlier. 31.The Commissioner will endeavour to ensure that any issues relating to the same period and tax type are kept together in the dispute. 32.The Commissioner can also exercise certain statutory powers (for example, issuing a section 17 notice) after a dispute has commenced and will continue to investigate the facts that relate to the dispute. 33.If the parties agree upon some and dispute other proposed adjustments for the same tax period and type, the Commissioner cannot issue an assessment that reflects any agreed adjustment already accepted under section 89J(1) until all the remaining WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC disputed issues are resolved (even if the Commissioner does not pursue the disputed issue further) or determined by the Disputes Review Unit. That is, the Commissioner will not issue a “partial” or “interim” assessment under section 89J(1) if the Commissioner is not satisfied that the assessment is correct. 34.However, where the statutory time bar is about to fall due, the Commissioner can issue an assessment to reflect both the agreed and disputed adjustment, provided that the requirements of section 89N are met. (See paragraphs 88 to 89 for further discussion.) 35.Where it is practicable, Inland Revenue officers will contact the taxpayer or their tax agent within 10 working days after the NOPA is issued to ensure that it has been received. Inland Revenue officers making written contact should comply with sections 14 to 14G. Exceptions to the statutory time bar Time bar waivers 36.If it is contemplated that the disputes process cannot be completed before the statutory time bar period for amending an assessment commences, the parties can agree in writing pursuant to section 108B(1)(a) to waive the time bar by up to 12 months to enable the full disputes process to be applied. 37.The taxpayer can also give written notice to the Commissioner and waive the time bar for a further six months after the end of the 12-month period under section 108B(1)(b) to allow sufficient time for the dispute to progress through the adjudication process. This notice must be given to the Commissioner within the initial 12-month period. 38.A statutory time bar waiver must be agreed in writing on the prescribed form (Notice of waiver of time bar (IR 775)) and delivered to the Commissioner before the relevant four-year period expires. 39.The statutory time bar waiver only applies to those issues that the parties have identified and understood before the initial statutory time bar. Other issues not so identified will still be subject to the original statutory time bar, unless section 108(2) or 108A(3) applies. (See paragraph44.) The Commissioner’s application to the High Court under section 89N(3) 40.If a NOPA has been issued and the disputes process cannot be completed before the statutory time bar period expires, the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for more time to complete the process. (See the discussion regarding section 89N(3) in paragraphs 28 to 39 of Appendix 1 of this SPS.) 41.However, where the Disputes Review Unit has insufficient time (that is, before the statutory time bar arises or further time allowed under section 108B(1) to fully consider a matter submitted to it expires) the matter will be returned to the responsible officer to decide whether to issue an assessment or amended assessment or to accept the taxpayer’s position. Section 89N(2)(b) allows the Commissioner to amend an assessment at any time after the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer’s SOP in relation to the particular period. (See paragraphs 218 to 220 for further discussion.) Exceptions under section 89N 42.When a NOPA has been issued, the Commissioner will follow the disputes process unless an exception under section 89N applies. The application of section 89N is WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC discussed in detail in Appendix 1. The Commissioner must obtain and document administrative approval for any departure from the full disputes process. Limitations on the Commissioner issuing a NOPA 43.Under section 89B(4), the Commissioner cannot issue a NOPA: (a)if the proposed adjustment is the subject of challenge proceedings, or (b) after the statutory time bar has expired. 44.The time bar that arises under sections 108 and 108A prevents the Commissioner from issuing an assessment that increases the amount assessed. The Commissioner can still issue an assessment that decreases the amount of the initial assessment subject to the limitation on refunding overpaid tax under sections RM 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA 2007”) and 45(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 45.However, the Commissioner is not subject to the statutory time bar that arises under sections 108 and 108A, if the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has: (a) provided a fraudulent or wilfully misleading tax return (section 108(2)(a)), or (b) omitted income for which a tax return must be provided that is of a particular nature or source (section 108(2)(b)), or (c) knowingly or fraudulently failed to make a full and true disclosure of the material facts necessary to determine their GST payable (section 108A(3)). 46.Furthermore, the Commissioner is not subject to the statutory time bar that arises under section 108 if a taxpayer has a remaining tax credit to which section LA 6(1) of the ITA 2007 applies and the Commissioner seeks to amend an assessment or determination to give effect to section LA 6(3) of the ITA 2007 (section 108(3B)). 47.When considering whether the exception under section 108(2)(b) applies, the Commissioner will disregard omissions of relatively small amounts of income by applying the principle of de minimis non curat lex (Babington v C of IR \[1957\] NZLR 861). 48.The Commissioner accepts that the time bar ensures finality in relation to assessments, is a key protection for most taxpayers and the exclusions from its protection must be only invoked where there is an adequate basis in fact and law to support their operation. Section 89B(4)(b) requires that the Commissioner initially decides whether an exception to the time bar applies, for example, whether a tax return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading, before determining whether a NOPA can be issued under section 89B(1). 49.Any opinion that the Commissioner forms regarding the application of the exceptions to the time bar must be honestly held and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the evidence available and the relevant law. The decision must be clearly documented and include reference to the grounds and reasoning on which it is based. 50.Any decision to examine a particular period (which would otherwise be time barred) on the basis that section 108(2)(a)–(b) or section 108A(3) may apply, is not, in itself, a disputable decision. Nor is any decision that is made under section 108A, in itself, a disputable decision. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 51.Any NOPA where the CIR is proposing an adjustment on the basis that the exception to the time bar in either section 108(2)(a)–(b) or section 108A(3) applies will set out the reasons why the CIR does not consider that the time bar applies. 52.The Commissioner is generally limited to a four-year period within which a taxpayer’s assessment can be increased following an investigation or in certain other circumstances. In respect of a dispute, the assessment is amended (if necessary) after the disputes process is completed. The Commissioner will endeavour to undertake the various steps involved in the process within the four-year period. 53.Section 89B(4)(a) applies to individual proposed adjustments. Where the proposed adjustment is the subject of court proceedings, the Commissioner cannot issue a NOPA in respect of those proposed adjustments. However, the Commissioner can issue a separate NOPA to the taxpayer in relation to the same tax period provided it relates to a different adjustment. 54.For example, a taxpayer challenges the deductibility of feasibility expenditure in the 2009 tax year pursuant to section 138B. The Commissioner can also issue a NOPA to the same taxpayer in relation to the tax treatment of a bad debt in the same tax year. Contents of the Commissioner’s NOPA 55.A NOPA is the document that commences the disputes process. It is intended to identify the points of contention and explain the legal or technical aspects of the issuer’s position in relation to the proposed adjustment in a formal and understandable manner. This will ensure that information relevant to the dispute is quickly made available to the parties. Section 89F(1) and (2) specifies the content requirements for any NOPA that the Commissioner may issue. 56.Under section 89F(1)(b), the NOPA must be in the prescribed form (Notice of proposed adjustment (IR 770)). A ny NOPA that the Commissioner issues must identify in sufficient detail the adjustment proposed and explain concisely the facts and law that relate to the adjustment and how the law applies to the facts. When preparing a NOPA the Commissioner will endeavour to avoid repeating facts, arguments or using unnecessary detail. 57.Section 89F(2)(b) requires that the NOPA states the key facts and law concisely and in sufficient detail. The Commissioner must ensure that the document is relatively brief and simple to enable the parties to quickly progress the dispute without incurring substantial expenses or excessive preparation time but also detailed enough to explain all the issues relevant to the dispute. The Commissioner’s NOPAs should be concise, accurate, coherent and logically presented. In preparing a NOPA Inland Revenue officers should avoid unnecessarily using legalistic language. 58.The Commissioner should identify (but not reproduce in full) the relevant legislation and legal principles derived from leading cases. These references should be in sufficient detail to clarify the grounds for the proposed adjustment. However, lengthy quotations from cases should be avoided. 59.The Commissioner has a statutory obligation to advise a taxpayer adequately, but it is recognised that the matters relevant to the dispute will be set out in greater detail at the SOP phase if the dispute is not resolved. 60.Therefore, what is included in a NOPA or NOR is not conclusive as between the parties because they can introduce further grounds or information or adjust the quantum of the proposed adjustments later in the disputes process (CIR v Zentrum WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Holdings Limited (2006) 22 NZTC 19,912). However, the parties cannot propose another adjustment involving new grounds and a fresh liability at the SOP phase. 61.The Commissioner must always endeavour to issue a NOPA that has sufficient details, is of a high standard and has been considered by Legal and Technical Services. The Commissioner must endeavour to advise the taxpayer during the conference phase of any new grounds, information or reduction in quantum that will be introduced in the SOP. 62.If the Commissioner decides to increase the quantum of any proposed adjustment after the NOPA is issued the Commissioner must issue a new NOPA to the taxpayer. 63.Although candid and complete exchanges of information are implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes process, the Commissioner’s practice will be to ensure that the NOPA is, within those limits, as brief as practicable. 64.The content of any NOPA that the Commissioner issues must satisfy all the requirements specified in section 89F(2)(a) to (c). Identify adjustments or proposed adjustments – section 89F(2)(a) 65.The Commissioner must consider in respect of each proposed adjustment: (a) the income amount or impact of the adjustment, and (b) the tax year or period to which the proposed adjustment relates, and (c) whether use-of-money interest will apply. 66.The Commissioner will also consider whether shortfall penalties and/or other appropriate penalties of lesser percentages apply. That is, where sufficient evidence is held to support the imposition of the penalties and this can be justified (by reference to any relevant guidelines.) Shortfall penalties 67.Shortfall penalties are separate items of adjustment that must be explained and supported in the same manner as the underlying tax shortfall. Section 94A(2) also requires that shortfall penalties must be assessed the same way as the underlying tax. Even though assessments of shortfall penalties relate to the underlying tax they are not subject to the time bars that arise under section 108 or 108A. 68.Where there is sufficient evidence to suggest that shortfall penalties should be imposed, the relevant Inland Revenue officer must ensure that the shortfall penalties are proposed in the same NOPA as the substantive issues. However, the officer can dispense with this practice if any of the following exceptions apply: (a) The evidence supporting the imposition of shortfall penalties does not become available until after the Commissioner has issued the NOPA on the substantive issues. In such circumstances, a separate NOPA may be issued in respect of the shortfall penalties at a later stage. (b) Before entering into the disputes process, a taxpayer has accepted the proposed adjustment in relation to the substantive issues, but not accepted the imposition of the shortfall penalties. In this circumstance, the Commissioner may still issue a NOPA to the taxpayer for the proposed penalties. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (c) The taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure of the substantive issues to the Commissioner and the only disputed issue relates to the imposition of the shortfall penalties. (d) Prosecution action is being considered and shortfall penalties also apply because the taxpayer has committed one of the culpable acts (for example, evasion), in most instances the Commissioner must first complete any prosecution action against the taxpayer before the shortfall penalties can be imposed. 69.Pursuant to section 149(5), if shortfall penalties have been imposed the Commissioner cannot subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position unless the shortfall penalties are imposed under section 141ED. Therefore, the Commissioner may omit proposing shortfall penalties in a NOPA if prosecution is being considered as an option. The Commissioner must issue a new NOPA in respect of any shortfall penalties that are to be imposed after the prosecution. 70.Furthermore, the Commissioner cannot propose shortfall penalties at the SOP phase if they were not previously proposed in a Commissioner’s NOPA. State the facts and law − section 89F(2)(b) Facts 71.To provide a concise statement of facts, the Commissioner must focus on the material factual matters relevant to the legal issues. This includes, for each proposed adjustment, the facts relevant to proving all arguments made in support of the adjustment including any facts that are inconsistent with any arguments that the taxpayer has previously raised. 72.The Commissioner should endeavour to state all the material facts in brief, so as to avoid irrelevant detail or repetition. For example, where the parties both know the background to the disputed issues, a summary of the facts in the NOPA will suffice. Where possible, the Commissioner will refer to and/or append any documents that have previously set out the facts on which the Commissioner relies. 73.Although the Commissioner will make every attempt to be concise in the NOPA, the Commissioner considers that the explanation of the material facts should be relative to the complexity of the issues. Law 74.Under section 89F(2)(b) the Commissioner must state the law concisely by including an outline of the relevant legislative provisions and principles derived from leading cases that affect the proposed adjustment. 75.It is sufficient that the Commissioner explains the nature of the legal arguments without providing lengthy quotations from the relevant case law. How the law applies to the facts − section 89F(2)(c) 76.The Commissioner must apply the legal arguments to the facts to ensure that the proposed adjustment is not a statement that appears out of context. The application of the law to the facts must be stated concisely and logically support the proposed adjustment. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 77.The Commissioner must outline all relevant materials and arguments (including alternative arguments) on which the Commissioner intends to rely. If more than one argument supports the same or a similar outcome, the NOPA must include all the arguments. 78.The issues and propositions of law exclusion rule under section 138G(1) does not apply to the issues and propositions of law that are raised in the Commissioner’s NOPA. That is, the Commissioner is not restricted to raising the same issues and propositions of law that are specified in the NOPA at the SOP phase or in challenge proceedings that the taxpayer has commenced where a disclosure notice has not been issued. Size and length of Commissioner’s NOPAs General guidelines 79.The length of a Commissioner’s NOPA will necessarily vary from case to case. The maximum length of a Commissioner’s NOPA is administratively capped at 30 pages. The 30-page limit excludes any discussion on shortfall penalties (if included in the same Commissioner’s NOPA as the substantive issues), the last page of instructions on “What to do next”, and schedules that show complicated calculations and diagrams. The application of the 30-page limit is subject to the following further restrictions: (a) For disputes involving less than $5,000 of tax (excluding evasion and tax avoidance issues), the Commissioner’s NOPA should not exceed five pages. (b) Where the dispute concerns one issue only (for example, the imposition of shortfall penalties), the Commissioner’s NOPA should not exceed 10 pages. 80.A longer Commissioner’s NOPA may be appropriate, where the dispute concerns multiple issues or the issue is very complex and involves a substantial amount of tax. 81.The Commissioner will strive to keep NOPAs as short as possible, but this will be balanced with the need to achieve the objective of issuing the NOPA (ie, sufficiently communicating to the recipient the proposed adjustments and the reasons for them). Inland Revenue officers are required to get approval before a Commissioner’s NOPA can exceed the 30-page limit. 82.Wherever practicable, all adjustments proposed for a particular taxpayer should be included in one NOPA. However, where new issues arise during the disputes process, the Commissioner is not precluded from commencing separate disputes for these new issues. If the parties are still in dispute after the conference phase, the proposed adjustments in multiple NOPAs may, subject to the taxpayer’s agreement, be combined into one SOP. Combining multiple issues into one dispute has the benefit of reducing compliance costs and should reduce the time taken in the disputes process. Timeframes to complete the disputes process 83.If the Commissioner has commenced the disputes process by issuing a NOPA and the dispute remains unresolved, where practicable, the responsible officer must negotiate a timeframe with the taxpayer to ensure that the dispute is progressed in a timely and efficient way. 84.Although not statutorily required, agreeing to a timeframe is a critical administrative requirement that requires both parties to be ready to progress the dispute in a timely manner. The parties should endeavour to meet the agreed timeframe. Where there WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC are delays in the progress of the dispute the responsible officer will manage the delay including any relationship with internal advisers and liaise with the taxpayer. 85.If the negotiated timeframe cannot be achieved, the responsible officer will enter into a continuing discussion with the taxpayer to either arrange a new timeframe or otherwise keep them advised of when the disclosure notice and SOP will be issued. This is consistent with the purpose of the disputes process which is to promote the prompt and efficient resolution of disputes. Therefore, the failure to negotiate or adhere to an agreed timeframe will not prevent a case from progressing through the disputes process in a timely manner. 86.In addition to the above administrative practice, the Commissioner is bound by section 89N(2). Under that provision, if a NOPA has been issued and the parties cannot agree on the proposed adjustment, the Commissioner cannot amend an assessment without completing the disputes process unless any of the exceptions in section 89N apply. These exceptions are as follows: 1)In the course of the dispute, the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(i)). 2)A taxpayer involved in a dispute, or person associated to them, may take steps to shift, relocate or dispose of the taxpayer’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax, making the issue of an assessment urgent (section 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii)). 3)The taxpayer involved in a dispute or a person associated with them involved in another dispute involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v)). 4)The taxpayer fails to comply with a statutory requirement for information relating to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(vi)). 5)The parties agree in writing that the dispute should be resolved by the court or TRA without completing the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(viii)). 6)The parties agree in writing to suspend the disputes process pending the outcome of a test case (section 89N(1)(c)(ix)). 7)The Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to allow more time to complete or dispense with the disputes process (section 89N(3)). 87.These exceptions are explained in further detail in Appendix 2 to this SPS. If any of these exceptions apply the disputes process will end and the dispute will not go through the adjudication phase. Application of the exceptions in section 89N 88.The Commissioner’s practice is that the parties should endeavour to resolve the dispute as early as possible and this should be a focus at all times throughout the stages of the disputes process. If this is not possible and any of the exceptions in section 89N apply, the Commissioner can amend an assessment without completing the whole disputes process, that is, before the parties accept a NOPA, NOR or SOP that the other has issued, or the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer’s SOP. This will conclude the disputes process and the dispute will not go through the adjudication phase. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 89.In this circumstance, the taxpayer can challenge the Commissioner’s assessment by filing proceedings in the TRA or the High Court within the applicable response period, that is, within two months starting on the date that the notice of assessment is issued. NOTICE OF RESPONSE (NOR) Taxpayer’s response to the commissioner’s NOPA: NOR 90.If a taxpayer disagrees with the Commissioner’s proposed adjustment, then, under section 89G(1), they must advise the Commissioner that any or all of the proposed adjustments are rejected by issuing a NOR within the two-month response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner’s NOPA is issued. The Commissioner interprets this as requiring Inland Revenue’s receipt of the NOR within the response period. 91.For example, if a NOPA is issued on 9 April 2010, the taxpayer must advise the Commissioner that it is rejected by issuing a NOR to the Commissioner for receipt on or before 8 June 2010. However, taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOR to the Commissioner once they have completed it. 92.If a taxpayer has not responded to a NOPA issued by the Commissioner reasonable efforts will be made to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period expires to ascertain whether the taxpayer will issue a NOR. Such contact may be made by telephone or letter. 93.Section 89G(2) specifies the content requirements of a NOR. The taxpayer must state concisely in the NOR: (a)the facts or legal arguments in the Commissioner’s NOPA that they consider are wrong, and (b) why they consider that those facts and arguments are wrong, and (c) any facts and legal arguments that they rely upon, and (d) how the legal arguments apply to the facts, and (e)the quantitative adjustments to any figure proposed in the Commissioner’s NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments that the taxpayer relies upon. 94.In respect of the requirement under section 89G(2)(c) that the taxpayer specifies the facts and legal arguments upon which they are relying, the taxpayer can also refer to legislative provisions, case law and any legal arguments that are raised in the Commissioner’s NOPA. The taxpayer does not have to refer to different legislative provisions, case law and legal arguments. 95.Pursuant to section 89G(2)(e), the requirement for a quantitative adjustment establishes to what extent the taxpayer considers that the Commissioner’s adjustment in the NOPA is incorrect. This amount need not be exact, however, every attempt should be made to ensure that it is as accurate as possible. The amount in dispute can be altered, as the dispute progresses irrespective of whether the parties have agreed on the new figure. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Deemed acceptance 96.Under section 89H(1), if the taxpayer: (a) has not issued a NOR within the two-month response period, and (b) the Commissioner does not accept a late NOR in terms of section 89K, the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the adjustment that is proposed in the Commissioner’s NOPA and section 89I applies. The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer that the deemed acceptance has occurred within two weeks after the two-month response period expires. 97.Pursuant to section 89I(2), the Commissioner must include or take into account each proposed adjustment that the taxpayer accepts or is deemed to accept in a notice of assessment issued to the taxpayer. Section 89K: the circumstances where the Commissioner may accept late rejections, proposed adjustments or statements of position Exceptional circumstances 98.The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. The cases regarding “exceptional circumstances”, such as Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752, Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005, Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 17,470 (CA), Hollis v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,570 and Balich v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,230, are also relevant. 99.Section 89K(3) reads: (a)an exceptional circumstance arises if— (i)an event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not rejecting a proposed adjustment, or for not issuing a notice of proposed adjustment or statement of position, within the response period for the notice: (ii)a disputant is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period: (b)an act or omission of an agent of a disputant is not an exceptional circumstance unless— (i)it was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that could not have been anticipated, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or (ii)the agent is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period. 100.The case law confirms that the definition of “exceptional circumstances” in sections 89K(3) and 138D should be applied consistently. The following guidelines have emerged from the case law: (a) a taxpayer’s misunderstanding or erroneous calculation of the applicable response period will usually not be regarded as an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control under section 89K(3)(a), (b) an agent’s failure to advise their client that they have received a notice of assessment or other relevant document that causes the taxpayer to respond WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC outside the applicable response period will not generally be considered to be an exceptional circumstance under section 89K(3)(b) (Hollis v CIR), and (c) an exceptional circumstance can arise if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information regarding the applicable response period given to them by the Commissioner that has caused them to respond outside that response period (Hollis v CIR). 101. See Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996) for some examples of situations that can be an “exceptional circumstance” beyond a taxpayer’s control. 102. The exception for lateness arising because of statutory holidays is self-explanatory. The Commissioner can also accept a late NOR where the lateness is minimal, that is, the document was only one to two days late and the other factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion under section 89K(1) are satisfied. (See discussion in paragraph 104.) 103. For example, the response period ends on Saturday and the taxpayer provides a NOR on the following Tuesday. The Commissioner treats the response period as ending on Monday on the basis of section 35(6) of the Interpretation Act 1999 and accepts that the lateness of the NOR was minimal. That is, the Commissioner has received the NOR within one to two days of Monday, the last day of the response period. If the response period ended on Friday and the taxpayer provided the NOR on the following Monday, the Commissioner would also accept that the lateness is minimal. 104. Besides the degree of lateness, the Commissioner considers that the exercise of the discretion under section 89K(1) requires that the following factors are also taken into account: (a) the date on which the NOR was issued, and (b) the response period within which the NOR should be issued, and (c) the real event, circumstance or reason why the taxpayer failed to issue the NOR within the response period, and (d) the taxpayer’s compliance history in relation to the tax types under consideration (for example, has the taxpayer paid tax or filed a tax return or NOR late in the past?). 105. For example, a taxpayer issues a NOR to the Commissioner two days after the applicable response period has expired. The taxpayer does not provide a legitimate reason for the lateness. The taxpayer also has a history of filing late NORs within the minimal allowable lateness period (that is, up to two days outside the applicable response period) and has been advised on the calculation of the response period on more than one occasion. 106. Although the degree of lateness was minimal on each occasion, the Commissioner would not accept that exceptional circumstances exist in this circumstance. This ensures that the exception is not treated as an extension of the response period in all circumstances. 107. The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer’s application made under section 89K(1)(b) after receiving the relevant NOR or SOP. Where the application is rejected, the Commissioner is required to issue a “refusal notice” within one month of receipt of the application (which must include the late notice or SOP). The disputant may challenge the Commissioner’s refusal notice in the Taxation Review WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Authority. If the taxpayer’s application is accepted that decision will be communicated in writing to the taxpayer within one month of receipt of the application. 108. The taxpayer must provide reasons to support their claim that exceptional circumstances exist under section 89K(3). The taxpayer should address the factors referred to in paragraph 104. If the reasons provided are unclear, further information may be sought, giving the taxpayer an opportunity to provide that information before determining whether section 89K applies. 109. If the Commissioner rejects a taxpayer’s application made under section 89K to treat a NOR or SOP as made within the response period, the taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment made in the Commissioner’s NOPA. Demonstrable intention 110. Under section 89K(1)(a)(ii) the Commissioner can also treat a late rejection of the Commissioner’s NOPA by a disputant, as being in time where the disputant had a demonstrable intention to enter into or continue the disputes process at the time the disputant failed to act within the applicable response period. 111.The concept of “intention to dispute” reflects the court’s consideration of when a dispute should be allowed to continue under the old objection regime in Part 8 of the TAA, in particular, the High Court decision in Gisborne Mills Ltd v CIR (1989) 13 TRNZ 405. Robertson J, in Gisborne Mills, held that a factor to be taken into account in determining whether the disputant was entitled to continue with their dispute was that they had “consistently asserted that they were entitled to the \[tax outcome they were seeking\]”. This was “in marked distinction to a person who, never having contemplated seeking a benefit under the taxing legislation, endeavours to take advantage of a matter when they become aware of a decision affecting another taxpayer”. 112.The officials’ issues paper, Disputes: a review (July 2010), in relation to an “intention to dispute test”, noted: The central tenet of any test should be that the taxpayer demonstrates they have, before the deadline, clearly communicated an intention to formally dispute the matter on certain grounds and have not subsequently modified that position. 113. To support this general proposition Inland Revenue will consider the following further factors in reaching a view as to whether a taxpayer had a demonstrable intention to dispute: whether the taxpayer has responded to any Inland Revenue correspondence and has consistently asserted their contrary position regarding the substantive issues; whether the taxpayer has complied with other parts of the disputes process and their overall tax obligations (for example, if the late document in question is the taxpayer’s SOP, have they filed a timely NOR); whether the taxpayer has corresponded with other relevant parties regarding the dispute, for example, the Minister of Revenue, the Ombudsman or Inland Revenue’s Complaints Management Service. 114. In a dispute where the taxpayer or their agent has not filed a SOP because they have miscalculated the response period (and the degree of lateness does not amount to exceptional circumstances), it could be said that having participated in the earlier WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC stages of the disputes process (including complying with timeframes) that, at the end of the response period, the disputant had a genuine intention to continue with the dispute. 115. An application will not be accepted if the degree of lateness is unjustified in the circumstances, or it is considered to be designed to defeat the application of the time period or to frustrate the disputes process itself. An example might be a taxpayer who contacts the Commissioner close to a deadline to confirm they intend to dispute, but then does nothing further for some considerable time, effectively rendering the statutory timeframe meaningless. Disputant may challenge Commissioner’s refusal to accept rejection, NOPA or SOP 116.The Commissioner can accept a disputant’s late rejection, NOPA or SOP by issuing a notice in favour of the disputant stating that the late rejection, NOPA or SOP will be treated as being given within the applicable response period. On the other hand, where they are not accepted as being on time, the Commissioner must notify the disputant within one month from when the disputant issues a “late” notice or statement of position to the Commissioner, of the Commissioner’s decision (“refusal notice”). The disputant may challenge the Commissioner’s refusal notice by filing proceedings with the TRA. Receipt of a taxpayer’s NOR 117. When Inland Revenue receives a taxpayer’s NOR, it will usually be forwarded to the responsible officer within five working days. Upon receipt, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following: (a) the date on which the NOR was issued, and (b) whether the NOR has been issued within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner’s NOPA is issued, and (c) the salient features of the NOR including any deficiencies in its content. 118. Where it is practicable, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent by telephone or in writing within 10 working days the NOR has been received. 119. The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer or their tax agent within one month after receiving the NOR whether it is being considered or has been accepted, rejected in full or in part. 120.If the NOR is accepted in full, the Commissioner will usually confirm (in writing) that the NOR has been accepted in full and, if applicable, a notice of assessment will be issued within one month. 121. If the Commissioner must investigate further before deciding to accept or reject a NOR, the responsible officer will regularly update the taxpayer or their agent on the progress of the further analysis or enquiry work that is undertaken. Deficiencies in the content of the NOR 122. Where Inland Revenue has received a NOR that it considers is deficient (that is, the requirements under section 89G(2) may not be met), where it is possible the responsible Inland Revenue officer will take reasonable steps to have the taxpayer correct the information in the NOR before the response period expires. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 123. The taxpayer will be advised as soon as practicable that the Commissioner considers that the NOR may not meet the requirements of section 89G(2) and why. They will also be advised that any additional or corrected information should be provided within the response period. 124. Taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOR immediately after they have completed it because they could have insufficient time to rectify any deficiencies if the response period is due to expire. 125. Generally where the deficiencies are not able to be remedied but the NOR advances sufficient argument to allow the dispute to progress, then the Commissioner will continue with the dispute. The Commissioner’s argument that the NOR is deficient will be incorporated into the Commissioner’s SOP which will also fully argue the substantive issue. 126. However, if the NOR received is highly unsatisfactory the Commissioner is unlikely to continue with the dispute. This will be on the grounds that the NOR does not satisfy the requirements set out in section 89G(2). 127.A NOR is likely to be considered highly unsatisfactory only where the taxpayer's position is materially inconsistent and not capable of coherent explanation, or there is no observable explanation at all of the taxpayer's grounds for dispute. In these situations the taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment under section 89H(1), unless section 89K applies. 128.In considering the adequacy of the taxpayer’s NOR, the Commissioner’s view will not be based on the strength or weakness of the taxpayer’s argument. The Commissioner will only be concerned with whether the NOR meets its statutory requirements. 129. The approach outlined above is consistent with that taken by the Court of Appeal in CIR v Alam and Begum (2009) 24 NZTC 23,564. CONFERENCE PHASE What is the conference phase of the disputes process? 130. The conference phase of the disputes process allows the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute to exchange material information relating to the dispute (if this has not already been done prior to the conference phase). More importantly it is an opportunity for the parties to the dispute to try to resolve the differences in their understanding of facts, laws and legal arguments. 131.The word “resolve” in this context is not limited to final resolution of the dispute. Settlement is a possibility but this is not the only objective of the conference phase. The parties may “resolve” part of the dispute by agreeing on some of the facts and clarifying some of the legal arguments, while agreeing to disagree on other matters, which will become the focus in the later phases of the disputes process. 132. Generally, if a dispute remains unresolved after the NOR phase, the conference phase will follow. However, the Commissioner will have fully considered the taxpayer’s NOR, including any new records, documents and information mentioned in that document, before determining that the dispute remains unresolved. 133. The conference phase is an administrative process that aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the dispute. However, the conference phase should not be used by either party for the purpose of delaying the completion of the disputes process. The WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC conference phase can involve more than one meeting between the parties and it is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting. Legal and other advisers attending a conference 134. If a dispute is not settled earlier, the parties can obtain expert legal or other advice during the conference phase in addition to advice previously obtained. These advisers can attend any meetings in relation to the dispute. Conference facilitation 135. Conference facilitation is a feature in the conference phase. A facilitated conference will involve an independent internal facilitator who will promote and encourage structured discussion between Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer on an informed basis and with the bona fide intention of resolving the dispute. The conference facilitator will be a senior Inland Revenue officer who will not have been involved in the dispute or given advice on the dispute prior to the conference phase. The facilitator will have sufficient technical knowledge to understand and lead the conference meeting. 136. The conference facilitator will not be responsible for making any decision in relation to the dispute, except for determining when the conference phase has come to an end. In particular, it is not the role of the facilitator to undertake settlement of the dispute. If this possibility arises it is the responsibility of the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute. 137. Having a conference facilitated is optional and a conference can be held without a facilitator but, conference facilitation will be offered to all taxpayers as part of the disputes process. The Commissioner’s offer of a facilitated conference will be made in writing (“the conference facilitation letter”) within one month from the date of issue of the taxpayer’s NOR. The conference facilitation letter marks the commencement of the conference phase. 138. The format of the conference meeting need not be limited to a face-to-face meeting. The parties to the dispute may agree to hold a telephone or video conference. (For reasons of simplicity, the SPS refers to “meetings” to include these different conference formats.) 139. The taxpayer is expected to respond within two weeks from the date of the conference facilitation letter. The taxpayer should indicate whether they will attend the conference meeting, whether they will accept the conference facilitation offer, whether there are any special needs or requirements at the meeting and who else will be attending the meeting. If the taxpayer does not respond within this timeframe, the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute will contact the taxpayer about the conference facilitation letter. Preparation for the conference meeting 140. When a taxpayer agrees to attend a conference meeting, Inland Revenue will contact the taxpayer within two weeks from the taxpayer’s agreement, to establish a timeframe, and agree on how the meeting will be conducted. 141. Prior to the conference meeting, the taxpayer should advise Inland Revenue whether their advisors will attend the conference meeting. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 142. The parties to the dispute may agree to exchange information relevant to the dispute before the conference meeting. A copy of that information will be provided to the facilitator. The Inland Revenue officers will provide the taxpayer with a list of information that has been given to the facilitator. The taxpayer may seek a copy of any information on that list if it is not already in their possession. It is also crucial for the parties to exchange the information prior to the meeting if the agreed format of the conference is a telephone or video conference. 143. Inland Revenue may decide to concede the dispute after considering the taxpayer’s information. The whole disputes process (including the conference phase) would come to an end in these cases. 144. The conference phase will generally be expected to be completed within three months, but this may vary depending on the facts and complexities of the specific case. A longer conference phase may be justified in some disputes if the parties are engaged in meaningful discussions. 145. An agenda will be useful for both parties at the conference meeting. An agreed agenda should divide the conference meeting into two parts. The first part of the meeting should involve an exchange of material information and discussion of contentious facts and issues relating to the dispute. Any procedural matters such as the timeframe for completing the disputes process, the adjudication process, time bar waivers and the possibility of opting out of the disputes process will also be discussed. The second part of the meeting, if applicable, would involve negotiation of possible areas of resolution of the dispute. Any communication made and any materials prepared for the purpose of negotiating a settlement or resolution during this part of the meeting will be treated as being on a “without prejudice” basis. 146. Where there is no agenda the conference facilitator will guide the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to discuss the contentious facts and issues at the conference meeting. 147. Where the option of conference facilitation has been declined, the parties to the dispute should work out the appropriate structure at the conference meeting, bearing in mind that one of the aims of any conference is to reach agreement on some or all the facts and issues and thus, resolve the dispute. At the conference meeting Facilitated conference 148. The facilitator will: (a) explain the objectives of the conference phase on the basis of the agreed agenda; (b) remind the parties of any rules relating to the conference (these will generally have been set out in the conference facilitation letter); (c) clarify who the parties are at the conference meeting and the capacities they hold (eg, whether they are the authorised tax advisors; whether they have authority to settle the dispute at the meeting); (d) ask whether the parties agree to record the meeting discussions using audio or video technology (refer to SPS 12/01: Recording Inland Revenue Interviews or any replacement SPS);Interviews WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (e)run through the agenda; (f)encourage the parties to present evidence in support of their perceived facts (either at the conference meeting or on a later date if the evidence cannot be provided at the time of the meeting). Where possible, encourage the parties to reach agreement on all the facts of the dispute. If no agreement can be made, encourage the parties to establish the common grounds and address the matters that they agree to disagree. These agreements will be recorded in writing. The agreements will be sent to the taxpayer to verify the correctness and sign by a specified date; (g) promote constructive discussion of only the contentious tax issues and where possible, encourage both parties to explore the issues, resolve or settle the dispute (subject to our internal revenue delegations and guidelines on settlement). If the contentious tax issues cannot be resolved, suggest both parties to do one or more of the following: At the end of the conference meeting, suggest the parties consider whether the conference phase comes to an end. Consider whether there is need for another meeting, noting that another meeting can be justified if both parties need to exchange further information in support of their tax technical arguments but continuous meetings are discouraged if this is seen as a delaying tactic. Where the parties agree to end the conference phase and the facilitator considers that the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved, the facilitator can clearly signal the end of the conference phase to the parties. Agree on the timeframe for completing the disputes process and submitting the dispute to the adjudication process. This includes the timeframe for taxpayers to meet outstanding information requests and Inland Revenue officers’ undertaking to provide copies of information relevant to the disputes. The agreed timeframe will also factor in time bar waivers if given by the taxpayer and the time required for any court challenge that relates to documents, which are claimed to be protected by professional legal privilege and tax advice documents, which are claimed to be protected by the non-disclosure rights. Ask the taxpayer whether a time bar waiver will be given if the time bar applicable to the assessment in dispute is imminent. Clearly indicate whether the communication made and/or documents prepared for the purpose of negotiating potential settlement or resolution of the dispute will be treated as being on a “without prejudice” basis. Suggest the taxpayer consider whether the opt-out process applies and advise the taxpayer of the right to opt out within the required timeframe, so that it is not necessary to complete the disputes process as required under section 89N and that the dispute will be more efficiently resolved by a hearing authority. (h) note that any agreement between the parties will be recorded in writing and signed either at the conference meeting by both parties or on a later date after the taxpayer has verified the correctness of the agreement; (i)note that the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute will remain as the first point of contact. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Unfacilitated conference 149. In an unfacilitated conference, the parties at the conference should agree on and perform tasks similar to those listed in paragraphs 148(a) to (h) above. 150. At the end of the conference meeting, it is important for the Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer to discuss whether they consider that the conference phase has come to an end and record any agreement in writing. After the conference meeting 151. The following is relevant only if the conference phase does not end at the meeting. Facilitated conference 152. The facilitator will: (a) follow up on the agreed matters including the agreed timeframe and exchange of information (but does not include enforcing the agreement between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute); (b) assess any need to attend a further meeting; (c) suggest to the parties that the conference phase has ended and ask them to reach an agreement on this matter, then clearly notify the parties of the date on which the conference phase has ended. Unfacilitated conference 153. In a conference that did not have a facilitator, the Inland Revenue officers will perform these tasks. They may suggest to the taxpayer that the conference phase has ended after all the material information relating to the dispute has been exchanged and all the contentious facts and issues have been discussed. The parties will then agree in writing on the date on which the conference phase has ended. If the parties cannot agree on when to end the conference phase, the Investigations Manager will be responsible for making the decision on ending the conference phase after considering all the parties’ relevant reasons and concerns. End of the conference phase 154. It is important for the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to be fully aware of when the conference phase comes to an end. The conference phase is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting. In most cases, it is expected that the parties involved in the dispute will agree on when the conference phase has ended. Such agreement will be put in writing. Facilitated conference 155. After a facilitated conference, the facilitator will be responsible for clarifying the agreed end date of the conference phase with the parties. 156.If the facilitator considers that both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers have exchanged all the material information relevant to the dispute, have fully discussed the tax technical issues and have not resolved the dispute, the facilitator may suggest to the parties that the conference phase can come to its end. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 157.If there is no agreement and the parties’ reasons for continuing the conference phase are considered to be insufficient, the conference facilitator can make a decision to end the conference phase and notify the parties of that decision. The following are examples of strong indicators that the conference phase has come to its end: (a)The taxpayer and/or the tax advisors stop contacting the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute for a few weeks. (b) The parties did not exchange information notwithstanding that this had been agreed on at the conference meeting, thus leading to the exercise of the Commissioner’s powers (eg section 17 notices). (c) The parties agree to disagree with each other and express interest in progressing to the SOP phase. (d) The taxpayer appears to be using delaying tactics at the conference phase when the issue in dispute is subject to an imminent time bar. 158. In rare situations, where conference facilitation is involved and the facilitator is concerned with the parties’ decision to end the conference phase before achieving the objectives of the conference meeting, the facilitator may adjourn the meeting and discuss the concerns with the responsible Inland Revenue officers. The facilitator may also contact the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s tax advisors to discuss whether the conference phase should come to its end. The facilitator will seek the parties’ agreement as to whether or not the conference phase is complete. Unfacilitated conference 159. Where no conference facilitation is involved, the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers will work out when to end the conference phase. They should consider whether the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved before reaching the agreement. If no agreement can be reached, the Investigations Manager will review the conduct of the parties during the conference phase and make a decision on whether the conference phase has come to an end. After the conference phase 160. When a dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase has been completed, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice together with a SOP, unless the Commissioner and the taxpayer have agreed to the taxpayer opting out of the disputes process. The disclosure notice and Commissioner’s SOP will generally be issued within three months from the end of the conference phase (see paragraphs 199 to 215 for further discussion on the timeframes for issue of the Commissioner’s disclosure notice and SOP). 161. If the taxpayer seeks the Commissioner’s agreement to opt out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), they will be required to sign a declaration that all material information relating to the dispute has been provided to the Commissioner. OPT OUT OF THE DISPUTES PROCESS 162. Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) provides that the Commissioner and a taxpayer can agree not to complete the disputes process if they are satisfied that the dispute can be more efficiently resolved at a hearing authority (referred to as “opt out”). 163. A taxpayer may seek to opt out of the remainder of the disputes process. If they do, a decision on whether or not the Commissionner will enter into an opt-out agreement WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC will be made by a senior Inland Revenue officer. In making a decision on opt out, that person will consult with Legal and Technical Services, the Litigation Management Unit , and the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel. The decision-maker will consider the taxpayer’s request with reference to all of the specific criteria listed and will also consider if any other factors exist which mean that the dispute can be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority. 164. Before agreeing to a taxpayer’s preference to opt out the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase. In addition, the taxpayer must have signed a declaration that all material information has been provided to the Commissioner. Any agreement will be recorded in a document. 165. The Commissioner will not agree to opting out unless there has been a conference. 166. In addition to attending the conference, the Commissioner considers that a taxpayer will have participated meaningfully during the conference phase where: (a) the taxpayer has provided all relevant information as indicated by Inland Revenue (if it has not already been provided prior to the conference phase); and (b) the taxpayer has discussed the contentious facts and issues of the dispute with Inland Revenue. This discussion will have involved identifying and clarifying what the dispute turns on, seeking potential resolution of the dispute or reaching agreements to enable the dispute to move forward to the next phase if it remains unresolved. 167. If the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase and signed a declaration that all material information has been provided, the Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer’s preference to opt out of the disputes process in circumstances where one of the following applies: (a) the total amount of tax in dispute is $75,000 or less except where the dispute is part of a wider dispute; (b) the dispute turns on issues of fact (eg, facts that are to be determined by reference to expert opinions or valuation) only; (c) the dispute concerns facts and issues that are waiting to be resolved by a court; or (d) the dispute concerns facts and issues that are similar to those considered by the Disputes review Unit of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (“OCTC”) if similar issues have been considered in a dispute in the past. 168. Where the dispute does not fall within the criteria listed above at paragraph 167, the Commissioner may still agree to opt out of the disputes process if it is considered that the dispute can be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority. 169. The taxpayer may seek to opt out of the disputes process within two weeks from the end of the conference phase. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing within two weeks from the date of the request whether the request to opt out has been agreed to. 170. Where the opt-out has been agreed to and the dispute remains unresolved after taking into account the information and discussion during the conference phase, the Commissioner will issue an amended assessment. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 171. When it is considered that the taxpayer does not meet the criteria for opting out of the disputes process, the taxpayer will be advised of the decision in writing. (a ) The $75,000 or less threshold 172. The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer opting out of the disputes process if the total amount of core tax in dispute is $75,000 or less. The “$75,000 or less” threshold does not apply if the dispute is part of a wider dispute that involves a number of taxpayers. An example of this is a tax avoidance arrangement similar to the “Trinity forestry scheme” in Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323; \[2007\] NZCA 230. 173.The “$75,000 or less” threshold excludes: shortfall penalties, either proposed in the same NOPA as the core tax or proposed in a separate NOPA; use-of-money interest that results from the Commissioner’s proposed adjustment in the NOPA; and late payment penalties imposed on the taxpayer, if applicable. 174. In some disputes, the Commissioner may propose adjustments in respect of more than one tax type or more than one return period/income year. The “$75,000 or less” threshold applies to the net total amount of tax in the same dispute. The threshold will take into account the following: the proposed adjustments made by the Commissioner in the same NOPA for all return periods and/or income years and tax types; any variation of the amount of tax in dispute due to the Commissioner’s partial acceptance of the taxpayer’s NOR; and any variation of the net total amount of tax in dispute as agreed between the participants during the conference phase. (b ) The dispute turns on issues of fact only 175. The Commissioner will agree to opt out if the dispute turns on issues of fact or evidence only. 176.The “issues of fact” requirement may apply where the disputed facts are to be determined by reference to expert opinions or valuation. 177. Disputes on tax avoidance issues will not meet the “issues of fact” requirement. In these disputes, case law requires consideration of issues such as whether the arrangement has used a specific provision in a way that cannot have been within Parliament’s contemplation when it enacted the provision. This will involve analysing mixed questions of law and fact. (c ) The dispute concerns facts and issues that are waiting to be resolved by a court 178. The opt-out process is available if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those that are waiting to be resolved by a court. The Commissioner will agree to opt out in those cases. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 179. A taxpayer may become aware of a current court case that concerns facts and issues that they consider to be similar to their dispute. The Commissioner will consider this position when deciding whether to agree to opt out. In considering whether to agree to opt out, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer of its views as to the similarity, but will not comment on the merit of the current court case or the plaintiff’s tax affairs due to the secrecy provisions of the TAA. 180. In some cases, a taxpayer may not be aware at the time of issuing the NOR or during the conference phase of the existence of similar cases that are subject to court proceedings. The taxpayer may still seek to opt out of the disputes process without this knowledge. In considering whether to agree to opt out, the decision maker will consult with the Litigation Management Unit to determine whether there are any current court cases that concern facts and issues that are considered to be similar to the taxpayer’s dispute. (d ) The dispute concerns facts and issues that are similar to those considered by the Disputes Review Unit 181. The opt-out process is available if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those already considered by the Disputes Review Unit. A taxpayer may seek to opt out of the disputes process because a previous adjudication decision was in favour of the Commissioner and they consider it would be unlikely that the Commissioner’s view will change. In considering the taxpayer’s request, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer of its views as to the similarity, but will need to bear in mind the secrecy provisions of the TAA. 182. In some cases, a taxpayer may not be aware of similar disputes that have been considered by the Disputes review Unit when the taxpayer issues the NOR or participates at a conference meeting. Inland Revenue officers may be aware of such other similar disputes, and may choose to advise the taxpayer that, should the taxpayer seek an opt out, Inland Revenue would be very likely to agree. However, Inland Revenue will need to bear in mind the secrecy provisions of the TAA when considering other disputes. Grounds of assessment where the Commissioner has agreed to opt out 183.In agreeing to the taxpayer’s request for opt out the Commissioner will make an amended assessment and issue a notice of assessment to the taxpayer. In doing so the Commissioner will have taken into account the information and legal arguments raised in the NOPA, the NOR and during the conference phase. The taxpayer can then challenge the assessment by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority within the applicable response period, ie two months of the issue of the notice of assessment. 184. In making an amended assessment, the Commissioner is not bound by the facts, issues, evidence and propositions of law stated in the NOPA and NOR, and the Commissioner is able to take into account information and arguments raised during the conference phase. The Commissioner’s administrative practice is that grounds of assessment which have not previously been referred to in the Commissioner’s NOPA and the taxpayers’ NOR will not be relied on, if they have not been notified or sufficiently discussed during the conference phase. 185. Where the parties have agreed to opt out the Commissioner will send to the taxpayer at or near the time of the assessment, a letter confirming briefly the grounds of assessment. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC PROGRESSING DISPUTES THROUGH THE DISPUTES PROCESS WHERE THE DISPUTE AFFECTS MULTIPLE TAXPAYERS 186. Sometimes it is necessary for Inland Revenue to deal with a large number of taxpayers who are all affected by the same disputed matter. This can arise in situations where: the taxpayers are all investors in a particular scheme; the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same promoter; the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same tax agent; there exists a widespread but well-defined common problem involving many unrelated taxpayers (e.g. a number of taxpayers claiming non-deductible expenses such as fines for overloading). 187.Given Inland Revenue’s limited resources, and bearing in mind taxpayer compliance costs it may not be appropriate for all the cases to proceed through the full disputes process. 188.The Commissioner’s approach to the different situations which arise where a large number of taxpayers are all affected by the same disputed matter is outlined in paragraphs 189 to 198. Situation 1: The Disputes Review Unit has looked at an issue a number of times and consistently taken a view supporting the Commissioner 189. As discussed in detail previously at paragraphs 162 to 182, the Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer’s request to opt out of the remaining parts of the disputes process if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those previously considered by the Disputes Review Unit. 190. Therefore, in situations where the Disputes Review Unit has looked at an issue a number of times and consistently taken a view supporting the Commissioner agreement between the parties to opt out is an option available to avoid the full disputes process. 191. In these circumstances the Commissioner will indicate to individual taxpayers that the dispute could be suitable for opt out but as this approach to a dispute requires agreement to opt out, the taxpayers still have the choice to progress the dispute through the full disputes process. 192. It should be noted that before the Commissioner will agree to opt out the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase. In addition, the taxpayer must have signed a declaration that all material information has been provided to the Commissioner. Situation 2: There are a number of cases on the same issue under dispute. One case has been referred to the Disputes Review Unit, who has still to reach a conclusion on the matter 193. In this situation it may be possible for other affected taxpayers and the Commissioner to merely agree, subject to statutory time bar issues, to place their case "on hold" while the Disputes Review Unit undertakes its analysis. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 194. However, care will need to be taken to ensure that the time bar will not be breached, and consideration should be given to obtaining a time bar waiver. 195. Again, as this approach requires the taxpayer to agree, the Commissioner can offer it to individual taxpayers but they still have the choice to progress the dispute through the full disputes process. 196.Taxpayers who agree to place their case “on hold” while the Disputes Review Unit considers the issues in question in relation to another taxpayer will not be bound by any decision reached by the Disputes Review Unit and will be free to continue with their dispute should they wish. Situation 3: The Disputes Review Unit has previously looked at an issue and taken a view supporting the taxpayer 197.It is the Commissioner’s policy that a finding for the taxpayer in the initial dispute will usually lead to the other disputes being withdrawn, particularly if the disputes are in respect of the same transaction. 198. However, in some situations further consideration of the issue is required at a national level before the Commissioner will apply the conclusions reached in a particular adjudication report more broadly to other taxpayers. In those cases, Inland Revenue officers may be advised that a specified or contrary approach (to that adopted by the Disputes Review Unit) is to be followed pending further consideration of the issue at a national level. DISCLOSURE NOTICE 199. The Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1), unless the Commissioner: (a) does not have to complete the disputes process because any of the exceptions under section 89N(1)(c) applies (see earlier discussion), or (b) does not have to complete the disputes process because the High Court has made an order that the dispute resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3), or (c) has already issued to the taxpayer a notice of disputable decision that includes or takes account of the adjustment proposed in the NOPA pursuant to section 89M(2). 200. When issuing a disclosure notice the Commissioner must also provide to the taxpayer the Commissioner’s SOP (as discussed below) and include in the disclosure notice a reference to section 138G and a statement regarding the effect of the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule pursuant to section 89M(3). 201. The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer two weeks before issuing the disclosure notice and SOP that these documents will be issued to them. 202. Where practicable, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer shortly after the disclosure notice and SOP are issued to ascertain whether the taxpayer has received these documents. 203. If the taxpayer has not received the Commissioner’s disclosure notice, for example, due to a postal error or an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control, the Commissioner will issue another disclosure notice to the taxpayer. In this circumstance, the response period within which the taxpayer must respond with their WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC SOP will commence from the date that the Commissioner issued the initial disclosure notice. 204. Where the taxpayer cannot issue a SOP within the applicable response period, they may issue a late SOP with an explanation of why it is late. The Commissioner will consider the late SOP in terms of the discretion under section 89K(1). (See paragraphs 98 to 116 for further discussion.) Issues and propositions of law exclusion rule 205. A disclosure notice is the document that triggers the application of the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule. The Commissioner must explain the effect of this rule and refer to section 138G in the disclosure notice. (See paragraph 229 for further discussion.) Issue of a disclosure notice 206. The Commissioner can issue a disclosure notice at any time on or after the date that either party issues their NOPA. 207. Usually, the Commissioner will issue a disclosure notice after receiving a NOR, following the conference phase and in accordance with the timeframe agreed with the taxpayer. 208. Where a disclosure notice is issued earlier (for example, the facts are clear, the taxpayer has agreed on the disputed issues or a conference is not required) the reasons must be documented and explained to the taxpayer. 209. When deciding whether to issue a disclosure notice before the conference phase has been completed, Inland Revenue officers must be aware that, if the taxpayer discloses any new or novel matters in their SOP, they only have two months to reply under section 89M(8) barring a High Court application before the two-month period expires. (See section 89M(10).) 210. Where a dispute commenced by the Commissioner remains unresolved after the conference phase, an Inland Revenue officer will usually issue a disclosure notice together with a SOP: within three months from the end of the conference phase; or within three months from the date when the Commissioner advises that the taxpayer’s opt out request has been declined; subject to any further time allowed by an appropriate senior manager. (See paragraphs 213 to 215.) 211. The three-month timeframe will exclude any statutory holidays. 212. If the last day of the three-month timeframe falls on a weekend, Inland Revenue must issue the disclosure notice and the SOP by the next working day. 213. While the Commissioner is able to extend the three-month timeframe these extensions should be very rare, because in most disputes, the timeframe is considered to be sufficient for Inland Revenue officers to complete and issue to the taxpayer a disclosure notice and the Commissioner’s SOP. 214. The ability for Inland Revenue to extend the three-month timeframe is provided for because it is recognised that even with good planning and the best endeavours of the WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Inland Revenue officers involved, there might be occasions on which the disclosure notice and the Commissioner’s SOP cannot be issued within the three-month timeframe. This might occur when: (a)the facts, issues, and law are complex, and/or (b)the case involves an important issue of precedent and/or the Litigation Management Unit or external advisors are involved in advising on the Commissioner’s SOP. 215. If it is considered that an extension of the timeframe is needed: approval will first be obtained from an appropriate senior manager; the taxpayer will then be advised of the estimated date for issue of the Commissioner’s SOP. Where the estimated date cannot be met, Inland Revenue will use its best endeavours to keep the taxpayer informed of the progress made in the completion of the Commissioner’s SOP. STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) 216. Pursuant to section 89M(3), when the Commissioner commences the disputes process, the Commissioner must issue a SOP to the taxpayer together with the disclosure notice. 217. When the disputed issue relates to a tax type that is subject to the statutory time bar (for example, income tax, GST) that falls within the current income year, the parties will endeavour to complete the disputes process before the time bar starts. The parties can agree to a statutory time bar waiver if they have issued a SOP to each other and there is insufficient time to complete the adjudication process. 218. However, if no such agreement is reached, section 89N(2)(b) allows the Commissioner to advance to the next stage if the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer’s SOP and completed the compulsory elements of the disputes process. The Commissioner can amend the assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113. 219. Whether the Commissioner has adequately considered a SOP will depend on what is a reasonable length of time and level of analysis for that SOP given the circumstances of the case (for example, the length of the SOP and the complexity of the legal issues). 220. Thus a simple dispute could only take a couple of days to consider adequately while a complex dispute could take a few weeks. If the statutory time bar is imminent the Inland Revenue officer will consider the taxpayer’s SOP urgently. Contents of a SOP 221.The “evidence exclusion rule” was replaced by the “issues and propositions of law exclusion rule” as a consequence of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011, for disputes or challenges relating to a disclosure notice issued on or after 29 August 2011. In these disputes, the disputant and the Commissioner are confined in challenge proceedings to the issues and propositions of laws disclosed in their respective SOPs. In other words, additional facts and evidence not originally disclosed in the disputant’s or Commissioner’s SOP may be introduced in challenge proceedings. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 222. For disclosure notices issued before 29 August 2011, the “evidence exclusion rule” still applies and limits the parties to the facts, evidence (excluding oral evidence), issues and propositions of law that either party discloses in their respective SOPs, unless a court order is made under section 138G(2) allowing new facts and evidence to be raised. 223. However, under either rule, a mistaken description of facts, evidence, issues or propositions of law and submissions made in the SOP can later be amended if the parties agree to include additional information in the SOPs under section 89M(13). 224. Under section 89M(4) the SOP must be in the prescribed form and must contain sufficient detail to fairly inform the taxpayer of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that the Commissioner wishes to rely on. 225. The minimum content requirements for a SOP under section 89M(4) are an outline of the relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law. However, to allow the Disputes Review Unit to successfully reach a decision, the SOP must also contain full, complete and detailed submissions. 226. An outline that consists of a frank and complete discussion of the issues, law, arguments and evidence supporting the argument is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes process. In very complex cases a full explanation of the relevant evidence and summary of less relevant evidence will be accepted. 227. The disputes process does not require that relevant documents are discovered or full briefs of evidence or exhaustive lists of documents exchanged. Rather, providing an outline of relevant evidence in the SOP will ensure that both parties appreciate the availability of evidence in respect of the factual issues in dispute. The Commissioner should ensure that an outline of any expert evidence on which they intend to rely is included in the SOP. 228. Submissions made in the NOPA phase must be sufficiently concise to enable the parties to progress the dispute without incurring substantial expense. However, at the SOP phase, if the issues are unresolved and likely to proceed to a court for resolution, then full, complete and detailed submissions should be made. 229. Subject to section 138G(2), the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule prevents the court considering issues and propositions of law that are not included in: (a) the Commissioner or disputant’s SOP, or (b) any additional information that: (i)the Commissioner provides under section 89M(8), that is deemed to be part of the Commissioner’s SOP under subsection (9), and (ii)the parties provide pursuant to an agreement under section 89M(13), that is deemed to be part of the provider’s SOP under subsection (14). 230. Section 89M(6B) reads: In subsections 4(b) and 6(b), evidence refers to the available documentary evidence on which the person intends to rely, but does not include a list of potential witnesses, whether or not identified by name. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 231. Pursuant to section 89M(6B), only documentary evidence and not potential witnesses must be listed in the SOP. Any witnesses’ identities will continue to be protected without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule. 232. If the SOP discusses shortfall penalties it must also state any other appropriate penalties of lesser percentages and shortfall penalty reductions (for example, voluntary disclosure or previous behaviour reductions) as alternative arguments. This ensures that the appropriate penalties are assessed in all cases. However, the Commissioner cannot propose shortfall penalties at the SOP phase that have not previously been proposed in the Commissioner’s NOPA. Receipt of a taxpayer’s SOP in response 233. Where the Commissioner has issued a disclosure notice and SOP, the taxpayer must, subject to section 89M(11), issue a SOP within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the disclosure notice was issued. 234. Therefore, the Commissioner cannot consider a document that the taxpayer purports to issue as a SOP before the Commissioner has issued the disclosure notice because it will not have been issued within the response period. The taxpayer should resubmit this document after the disclosure notice is issued. 235. Pursuant to section 89M(11), the taxpayer can apply to the High Court within the response period for more time to reply to the Commissioner’s SOP. The taxpayer must show that they had not previously discussed the disputed issue with the Commissioner and, thus, it is unreasonable to reply to the Commissioner’s SOP within the response period. 236. The Commissioner will make a reasonable effort to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period expires to determine whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP in response to the disclosure notice. Such contact can be made by telephone or in writing. 237. The taxpayer’s SOP will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue receives it. Upon receipt, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following: (a) the date on which the SOP was issued, and (b) whether the SOP has been issued within the relevant response period, and (c) the SOP’s salient features including any deficiencies in its content. 238. Where it is practicable, Inland Revenue will acknowledge the taxpayer’s SOP as received within 10 working days after receiving it. However, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of any deficiencies in the SOP’s content as soon as practicable. 239. A taxpayer who has issued a SOP outside the applicable response period can apply for consideration of exceptional circumstances or that the disputant had a demonstrable intention to continue the dispute under section 89K. The responsible officer must notify the taxpayer of the decision in writing within one month of receiving the disputant’s “late” SOP (rejection is by way of a “refusal notice”). 240. A taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner’s SOP if they do not reply to it with their own SOP within two months after the date that the disclosure notice is issued and where section 89K does not apply. Where practicable, the Commissioner WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC will usually advise the taxpayer that deemed acceptance has occurred within two weeks after the date that the response period for the disclosure notice expires. The Commissioner’s response 241. Pursuant to section 89M(8), the Commissioner can, within two months after the taxpayer’s SOP is issued, provide to the taxpayer additional information in response to matters that they have raised in their SOP. 242. The Commissioner can only provide additional information in response to new or novel information or arguments that the taxpayer has raised in their SOP or agreed to add to their SOP under section 89M(13). The Commissioner cannot add further information simply because it was omitted from the Commissioner’s SOP (for example, information that was received under a section 17 notice after the SOP was issued). 243. The additional information must be provided as far as possible in the same format as the SOP to which it relates (that is, in accordance with section 89M(4)). As mentioned above, the additional information can include documentary evidence but not lists of potential witnesses. 244. If the Commissioner intends to provide additional information to the taxpayer under section 89M(8), the Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of this within two weeks after the taxpayer’s SOP is received. However, the timing of this advice can vary depending on the facts and complexity of the dispute. The additional information provided under section 89M(8) is deemed to be part of the Commissioner’s SOP. Any new issues or propositions of law forming part of the additional information will be subject to section 138G. 245. The taxpayer cannot reply to the additional information that the Commissioner provides, unless the parties agree that additional information will be accepted under section 89M(13). Agreement to include additional information 246. Either party can agree to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13) at any time during the disputes process including after the dispute has been referred to the Disputes Review Unit. Although there is no statutory time limit, the Commissioner’s practice is to allow one month (from the date that the Commissioner provides additional information under section 89M(8)) for such an agreement to be reached and information provided. 247. However, before agreeing to include additional information under section 89M(13) the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer’s prior conduct and whether they could have provided the information earlier through the application of due diligence. 248. The Commissioner will usually also consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information and its capacity to help resolve the dispute and may decide to take it into account in coming to an assessment. In this circumstance, both parties will be expected to cooperate in resolving the relevance and accuracy of any such material. The Commissioner may wish to apply resources to verification and comment and this will be considered by the adjudicator. 249.If a taxpayer seeks to include additional information in their SOP is declined, the reasons must be documented with detailed reference to the taxpayer’s conduct, level of cooperation before the request was made and why the information was not provided earlier. The responsible officer will also advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the reasons why their request was declined. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 250. Any agreement to add further information to the SOP will be made subject to the taxpayer agreeing that the Commissioner can include a response to the additional information to the SOPs, if required, within an agreed timeframe. 251. Any additional information that the parties provide under section 89M(13) will be deemed to form part of the provider’s SOP under section 89M(14). Section 138G applies to the additional information. Preparation for Adjudication 252. The Disputes Review Unit is part of Inland Revenue’s Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and represents the final step of the disputes process. The adjudicator’s role is to review unresolved disputes by taking a fresh look at a tax dispute and the application of law to the facts in an impartial and independent manner and provide a comprehensive and technically accurate decision that will ensure the correctness of the assessment. 253. Generally, the adjudicator will make such a decision within three months after the case is referred to the Disputes Review Unit (although sometimes a decision can be made in a few weeks). The length of time taken to make a decision will depend on the number of disputes that are before the Disputes Review Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. 1 254. The adjudication process is an administrative (rather than a legislative) one. Judicial comments have been made in C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited and Another, Ch’elle Properties (NZ) Limited v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 and ANZ National Bank Ltd and others v C of IR (No. 2) (2006) 22 NZTC 19,835 indicating that, as a matter of law, it is not strictly necessary for Inland Revenue officers to send all disputes to the Disputes Review Unit for review and Inland Revenue officers are not necessarily bound by the Disputes Review Unit’s decisions. 255. Notwithstanding the above judicial comments, if the parties have not agreed on all the issues at the end of the conference and disclosure phases or to opting out under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), it is the Commissioner’s policy and practice that all disputes are to be sent to the Disputes Review Unit for review, irrespective of the complexity or type of issues or amount of tax involved unless any of the following exceptions arise: (a)the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer’s SOP for the purposes of section 89N(2)(b) and referred the dispute to the Disputes Review Unit for their preliminary consideration and the Disputes Review Unit has determined that it has insufficient time to reach a decision in respect of the dispute before a statutory time bar would prevent an assessment from being increased (see paragraphs 218 to 220 for further discussion), or (b) any of the legislative exceptions specified in section 89N(1)(c) apply (see Appendix 2 for further discussion) so that the Commissioner can amend an assessment without first completing the disputes process, or (c) the High Court has made an order that the disputes process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3) (see Appendix 2 for further discussion). 1 For further information on the timeframe for adjudication of disputes see the article titled “Adjudication Unit – Its role in the dispute resolution process” that was published in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 10 (November 2007). WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 256. The decision not to refer the case to adjudication must be made by a senior person in Service Delivery (for example, at the time of writing the delegation was with Area Manager level or above). In respect of the first exception mentioned in paragraph 255(a) it is necessary that the parties have exchanged a SOP and it is a matter solely for the Disputes Review Unit to determine whether it has insufficient time to fully consider the dispute. 257.If the dispute is to be referred to the Disputes Review Unit, the Commissioner should not issue an assessment or amended assessment before the adjudication process is completed unless a time bar is imminent. In this circumstance, the responsible officer will prepare a cover sheet that will record all the documents that must be sent to the Disputes Review Unit. 258. The cover sheet together with copies of the documents (NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, conference notes, both parties’ S OP, additional information, material evidence including expert opinions and a schedule of all evidence held) and any recordings of discussions held during the conference must be sent to the Disputes Review Unit. 259.If the dispute is to be referred for adjudication, the responsible officer will issue a letter together with a copy of the cover sheet to the taxpayer before sending the submissions, notes and evidence to the Disputes Review Unit. The cover sheet and letter are usually completed within one month after the date that the Commissioner’s reply to the taxpayer’s SOP (if any) is issued or the response period for the taxpayer’s SOP expires. 260. The purpose of this letter is to seek concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator − primarily concerning documentary evidence that has been disclosed at the SOP phase. This letter will allow no more than 10 working days for a response. 261. Once the taxpayer has concurred on the materials to be sent to the Disputes Review Unit, those materials will be so forwarded. However, if no response is received from the taxpayer the materials will be forwarded after the 10 working days allowed for the taxpayer’s response have elapsed. The adjudicator may also contact the parties after the initial materials have been received to obtain further information. 262. Where an investigation has covered a number of issues, the cover sheet will outline any issues that the parties have agreed upon and any issues that are still disputed. The adjudicator will only consider the disputed issues and not those issues that have been agreed upon. 263. Generally, the adjudicator only considers the materials that the parties have submitted. They do not usually seek out or consider further information, unless it is relevant. The adjudicator may consider such additional information notwithstanding that the parties have not agreed that the provider can include this information in their SOP under section 89M(13). 264. However, any additional material which amounts to a legal or factual issue, or a proposition of law, that the parties have not disclosed in their SOP (or agreed to include in their SOP under section 89M(13)) cannot later be raised in court because the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule in section 138G(1) will apply (as discussed in paragraphs 229 to 231). Adjudication decision 265. Once a conclusion has been reached, the Disputes Review Unit will advise the taxpayer and responsible officer of the decision. The responsible officer will implement any of the Disputes Review Unit’s decisions and follow up procedures WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC where required including issuing a notice of assessment to the taxpayer where applicable. 266. Where the Disputes Review Unit makes a decision against the Commissioner, the Commissioner will not challenge that decision. The dispute will come to an end. 267. Where the Disputes Review Unit makes a decision against the taxpayer, they can challenge the assessment (whether made by the Commissioner or taxpayer) or disputable decision if they are within the applicable response period. 268.If the Commissioner has commenced the disputes process, the taxpayer, if disagreeing with the adjudicator’s decision and any later notice of assessment or amended assessment that is issued, can file proceedings in the general jurisdiction of the TRA or the High Court if any of the following conditions under section 138B(1) are met: (a) the assessment includes an adjustment that the Commissioner has proposed and the taxpayer has rejected within the response period, or (b) the assessment is an amended assessment that imposes a fresh or increases an existing liability. 269. A taxpayer can also challenge an assessment that the Commissioner issues before the dispute goes through the adjudication process (for example, when an exception under section 89N(1)(c) applies). 270. The taxpayer must file proceedings with the TRA or High Court within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the notice of assessment or amended assessment. 271. If applicable, the responsible officer will implement any decision made by the hearing authority and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer. This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 10 th October 2016. Rob Wells LTS Manager – Technical Standards WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC APPENDIX 1 EXCEPTIONS TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE COMMISSIONER MUST ISSUE A NOPA BEFORE MAKING AN ASSESSMENT Exception 1: The assessment corresponds with a tax return 1.Section 89C(a) reads: The assessment corresponds with a tax return that has been provided by the taxpayer. 2.The application of section 89C(a) is limited under the self-assessment rules. Generally, a taxpayer makes an assessment and files a tax return that includes that assessment. If the taxpayer’s assessment is supported by the information in the tax return and any underlying source documents that the taxpayer has provided and the Commissioner agrees with the taxpayer’s return and assessment there is no need for the Commissioner to invoke the disputes process. 3.In these circumstances, instead of issuing a notice of assessment the Commissioner will issue a statement of account that confirms the taxpayer’s assessment. The statutory response period for the purposes of the disputes process will commence from the date that Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer’s assessment. 4.Sometimes, if there is a deficiency in the taxpayer’s tax return, the Commissioner will issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer because section 89C(a) applies. For example, the Commissioner can issue an assessment, where the taxpayer has provided all their income details but omitted to calculate their income tax liability in the tax return. Exception 2: Simple or obvious mistake or oversight 5.Section 89C(b) reads: The taxpayer has provided a tax return which, in the Commissioner's opinion, appears to contain a simple or obvious mistake or oversight, and the assessment merely corrects the mistake or oversight. 6.This exception is intended to apply to a simple calculation error or oversight that Inland Revenue’s Processing Centres generally discover with computer edits and simple return checks. This maintains the status quo for the many assessments arising in this situation. 7.The Commissioner will generally treat the following as a simple mistake or oversight: (a)an arithmetical error; (b)an error in transposing numbers from one box to another in a tax return; (c)double counting, such as inadvertently including in the taxpayer’s income the same item twice; (d)not claiming a rebate to which the taxpayer is entitled or that was incorrectly calculated, for example, the low income rebate for a taxpayer. 8.A “simple or obvious mistake or oversight” can be determined on a case-by-case basis with no dollar limit. The Commissioner may consider whether this exception applies irrespective of whether the taxpayer seeks that the Commissioner makes an amendment under section 113 or applies the exception under section 89C(b). WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 9.Where the Commissioner issues an assessment to correct a taxpayer’s simple or obvious mistake or oversight, the Commissioner may consider imposing shortfall penalties on the taxpayer, if there is a tax shortfall and the taxpayer has committed one of the culpable acts, for example, lack of reasonable care and not relied on the action or advice of their tax advisor for the purposes of section 141A(2B). Exception 3: Agreement to amend previous tax position 10.Section 89C(c) reads: The assessment corrects a tax position previously taken by the taxpayer in a way or manner agreed by the Commissioner and the taxpayer. 11.This situation can occur if the issue is raised by either the Commissioner or the taxpayer. There is no need to issue a NOPA because no dispute arises. 12.If the Commissioner proposes the adjustment, this exception cannot apply unless the taxpayer accepts the adjustment. For the purpose of section 89C(c), the agreement between the parties can be oral, but the Commissioner’s practice will be to seek written agreement. Section 89C(c) applies if Inland Revenue officers can demonstrate that the Commissioner and taxpayer have agreed on the proposed adjustment. 13.However, if the parties agree on only one adjustment and dispute others in respect of the same assessment, the Commissioner cannot issue an assessment on the basis of the agreed adjustment because the tax position is not necessarily correct. 14.Where a taxpayer proposes an adjustment outside the disputes process and the Commissioner agrees, for example a taxpayer seeks to amend an assessment, the particulars must be recorded in writing and state that the assessment is made in accordance with the Commissioner’s practice on exercising the discretion under section 113. (See SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments.) The Commissioner must also consider if shortfall penalties are applicable. Exception 4: The assessment otherwise reflects an agreement 15.Section 89C(d) reads: The assessment reflects an agreement reached between the Commissioner and the taxpayer. 16.The same procedures apply for section 89C(c) and (d). However, the agreement that the parties reach does not have to relate to a tax position that the taxpayer has previously taken. 17.For example, if the taxpayer has disputed, but now agrees, that they are a “taxpayer” for the purpose of the definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and has not provided a tax return. The Commissioner may issue an assessment to the taxpayer under section 89C(d) to reflect this agreement. The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable. 18.Another example is where, pursuant to section 6A, the Commissioner settles a tax case and disputes process. In such cases, the Commissioner will usually enter into an individual settlement deed and agreed adjustment in writing with the taxpayer to confirm the settlement. 19.The Commissioner will then give effect to that settlement deed and agreed adjustment by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer under section 89C(d) without first issuing a NOPA. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Exception 5: Material facts and law identical to court proceeding 20.Section 89C(db) reads: The assessment is made in relation to a matter for which the material facts and relevant law are identical to those for an assessment of the taxpayer for another period that is at the time the subject of court proceedings. 21.Pursuant to section 89C(db), the Commissioner can issue an assessment to the taxpayer in relation to the other period that is the subject of court proceedings, without first issuing a NOPA. The Commissioner does not have to follow the disputes process for the same issue in the other period because the matter is before the court to resolve. A dual process towards resolution does not need to be adopted. The Commissioner will also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable. 22.However, a taxpayer who has been issued with an assessment in relation to another period under section 89C(db), can dispute that assessment by issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D within the applicable response period. 23.Section 89C(db) is intended to reduce compliance costs. Notwithstanding this provision, the Commissioner can elect to issue a NOPA in respect of the other period in order to resolve the dispute through the disputes process. Exception 6: Revenue protection 24.Section 89C(e) reads: The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe a notice may cause the taxpayer or an associated person – (i)to leave New Zealand; or (ii)to take steps, in relation to the existence or location of the taxpayer’s assets, making it harder for the Commissioner to collect the tax from the taxpayer. 25.This exception is intended to ensure that the revenue is protected in the relevant circumstances. Section 89C(e) does not require that the taxpayer has physical possession of their assets. 26.If Inland Revenue officers apply the exception under section 89C(e), this should be supported by evidence of the “reasonable grounds” relied on (for example, the taxpayer’s correspondence with third parties, application to emigrate overseas and any transcripts of interviews with the taxpayer). Exception 7: Fraudulent activity 27.Section 89C(eb) reads: The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity. 28.Pursuant to section 89C(eb), a taxpayer has been involved in a fraudulent activity if they have engaged or participated in, or been connected with, any fraudulent activity that would have tax consequences for them. 29.If the taxpayer has not been convicted of an offence relating to a fraudulent activity section 89C(eb) can still apply provided that the Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that the taxpayer has been involved in a fraudulent activity. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 30.If Inland Revenue officers apply the exception under section 89C(eb), this should be supported by sufficient evidence of the “reasonable grounds” relied on. The evidence does not have to be absolute proof but, merely sufficient to verify the “reasonable grounds”. Exception 8: Vexatious or frivolous 31.Section 89C(f) reads: The assessment corrects a tax position previously taken by a taxpayer that, in the opinion of the Commissioner is, or is the result of, a vexatious or frivolous act of, or vexatious or frivolous failure to act by, the taxpayer. 32.If Inland Revenue officers apply this exception, this should be supported by documentation that evidences: (a)the action or inaction giving rise to the tax positions previously taken, and (b)why that action is considered to be vexatious or frivolous and any shortfall penalties/prosecution consideration. Examples of a tax position taken as result of a vexatious or frivolous act are a tax position that is: (i)clearly lacking in substance, for example, where the taxpayer continues to take the same position that has previously been finalised, or (ii) motivated by the sole purpose of delay. 33.Where this exception applies, the Commissioner must also consider the imposition of shortfall penalties in respect of the taxpayer’s tax position resulting from a vexatious or frivolous act. Exception 9: Taxation Review Authority or court determination 34.Section 89C(g) reads: The assessment is made as a result of a direction or determination of a court or the Taxation Review Authority. 35.For the purpose of section 89C(g), a direction or determination includes any court or TRA decision that affects the particular taxpayer in relation to a specific tax period and a court decision on a “test case” that applies to the taxpayer irrespective of whether they were a party to the test case. 36.The Commissioner must retain a copy of the direction or determination to support the application of this exception. In these circumstances, the Commissioner will endeavour to make an assessment including imposing shortfall penalties, within two weeks after receiving the written direction or determination. However, if the direction or determination relates to a test case the Commissioner can issue an assessment within the period specified under section 89O(5). Exception 10: “Default assessment” 37.Section 89C(h) reads: The taxpayer has not provided a tax return when and as required by a tax law. 38.If section 89C(h) applies because the taxpayer has failed to provide a tax return the Commissioner can make an assessment or amended assessment pursuant to section 106(1) (commonly known as a “default assessment”). WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 39.Where a taxpayer seeks to dispute a default assessment through the disputes process, the taxpayer must, within the applicable response period (that is, four months from the date that the default assessment is issued): (a)provide a tax return in the prescribed form for the period to which the default assessment relates (pursuant to section 89D(2C) for GST and section 89D(2) for all other tax types) notwithstanding that the tax return will not include the taxpayer’s assessment, and (b)issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment. 40.The requirement to provide a tax return in respect of a default assessment made under section 106(1) before issuing a NOPA is an additional requirement of the disputes process. This ensures that the taxpayer has provided the information that is required by the tax law before they are entitled to dispute the assessment. 41.If the Commissioner agrees with the taxpayer’s NOPA and tax return, the Commissioner will generally amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113, subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 and any other relevant limitations. However, if the Commissioner does not agree with the taxpayer’s tax return and NOPA the Commissioner can decide to not amend the default assessment and issue a NOR instead. 42.If a taxpayer cannot provide a NOPA because they are outside the applicable response period to dispute a default assessment or do not want to enter into the disputes process, they must still provide a tax return. 43.Although the Commissioner does not have to amend the initial assessment on receipt of the tax return from a defaulting taxpayer, the Commissioner can exercise the discretion to amend under section 113 subject to the time bar in section 108 or 108A and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion. 44.If the Commissioner decides not to exercise the discretion under section 113 the Commissioner can issue a NOPA in respect of the default assessment under section 89B(1) where, for example, new information received from the taxpayer suggests that the default assessment is incorrect. 45.The Commissioner is not precluded from further investigating an amended assessment issued on the basis of the taxpayer’s tax return and, if necessary, issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer. Exception 11: Failure to make or account for tax deductions 46.Section 89C(i) reads: The assessment is made following the failure by a taxpayer to withhold or deduct an amount required to be withheld or deducted by a tax law or to account for an amount withheld or deducted in the manner required by a tax law. 47.This exception is intended to address a taxpayer’s failure to withhold, deduct or account to the Commissioner for an amount of tax including PAYE, schedular payments to non-resident contractors and resident withholding tax (“RWT”). The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable. 48.The Commissioner may not apply this exception if there is a dispute that involves statutory interpretation (for example, whether a particular item attracts liability for RWT meaning that the taxpayer was required to withhold or deduct RWT) and/or shortfall penalties. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Exception 12: Non-assessed tax return 49.Section 89C(j) reads: The taxpayer is entitled to issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of a tax return provided by the taxpayer, and has done so. 50.If a taxpayer proposes an adjustment in a NOPA with which the Commissioner agrees, an assessment can be issued without first issuing a NOPA. This exception only applies to an adjustment that the taxpayer has proposed in their NOPA under section 89DA(1) within the applicable response period. Exception 13: Consequential adjustment 51.Section 89C(k) reads: The assessment corrects a tax position taken by the taxpayer or an associated person as a consequence or result of an incorrect tax position taken by another taxpayer, and, at the time the Commissioner makes the assessment, the Commissioner has made, or is able to make, an assessment for that other taxpayer for the correct amount of tax payable by that other taxpayer... 52.If transactions affect multiple taxpayers, whether in the same way or in related but opposite ways, the Commissioner can reassess any consequentially affected taxpayers under section 89C(k). This is notwithstanding that the consequentially affected taxpayers have not agreed to the amended assessments. 53.However, those taxpayers subject to the amended assessments may still issue a NOPA to dispute the consequential adjustment within the applicable response period. The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable. 54.Section 109(b) deems any assessment that the Commissioner makes to be correct. Therefore, the Commissioner can make any consequential amendment under section 89C(k). However, the Commissioner must be satisfied that there is a direct consequential link between the taxpayers before making any adjustment. For example: (a)Group loss offsets: if a loss company has claimed losses to which it is not entitled and the Commissioner has amended the loss company’s loss assessment to disallow those losses, pursuant to section 89C(k), the Commissioner can also make a separate assessment for the profit company that had offset the loss company’s losses against its profits. (b)GST: the supplier and recipient of a supply have incorrectly assumed that a transaction was GST-exempt. The Commissioner later agrees that the recipient was entitled to a GST input tax credit and issues an assessment to them allowing the credit. The Commissioner can also issue an assessment to the supplier under section 89C(k) in respect of the output tax on the value of the supply. Exception 14: Look-through company 55.If an assessment will correct a tax position taken by the taxpayer in relation to a tax position taken by a look-through company in a return of income under section 42B, and the Commissioner and the company have completed the disputes process for that return of income and that tax position, the Commissioner can reassess under section 89C(ka) without first issuing a NOPA. Exception 15: Income statement WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 56.Section 89C(l) provides that no NOPA is required if the assessment results from an income statement under Part 3A . Exception 16: Write-off of outstanding tax for taxpayers with tax losses 57.Under section 177C(5), if the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer who has a tax loss, the Commissioner must extinguish all or part of the taxpayer's tax loss. Where the taxpayer is not a company, the amount written off is divided by 0.33, reducing the tax loss by that amount. Where the taxpayer is a company, the amount written off is divided by 0.28, reducing the tax loss by that amount. 58.Under section 89C(lb) the Commissioner does not have to issue a NOPA prior to issuing an assessment which extinguishes all or part of a tax loss in accordance with section 177C(5). Exception 17: Tax credits arising from subparts MA–MF and MZ 59.Under section 89C(m) no NOPA is required if an assessment includes a calculation of working for families tax credits (identified in subparts MA to MF and MZ of the Income Tax Act 2007). WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC APPENDIX 2 SECTION 89N − EXCEPTIONS − WHEN AN ASSESSMENT CAN BE ISSUED WITHOUT COMPLETING THE DISPUTES PROCESS 1.If a NOPA has been issued and the dispute is unresolved, the Commissioner can issue an assessment without completing the disputes process under the following circumstances: Exception 1: In the course of the dispute, the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(i)). 2.Section 89N(1)(c)(i) reads: (i)the Commissioner notifies the disputant that, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the disputant in the course of the dispute has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had an effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process: 3.This exception applies where the Commissioner may need to act quickly to issue an assessment because it is considered that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has caused undue delay to the progress of the dispute. 4.For example, in the course of a dispute a taxpayer obstructed Inland Revenue officers in obtaining information from the taxpayer’s business premise under section 16. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that it is considered that an offence has been committed under section 143H. The offence has the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process meaning that the Commissioner does not have to complete that process and can amend the taxpayer’s assessment under section 113. 5.Another example of when the exception may apply is where, in the course of a dispute, a taxpayer wilfully refuses to attend an enquiry made under section 19 on the date specified in the Commissioner’s notice. In these circumstances, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that that it is considered that an offence has been committed under section 143F that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process. The Commissioner can then exercise the discretion to amend the taxpayer’s assessment under section 113 without completing the disputes process. 6.In order to apply this exception, Inland Revenue officers must form an opinion that is honestly and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the evidence available, that the disputant has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act. The Inland Revenue officer’s decision must be clearly documented and stipulate the grounds and reasoning on which it is based. Exception 2: A taxpayer involved in a dispute, or person associated to them, may take steps to shift, relocate or dispose of the taxpayer’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax, making the issue of an assessment urgent (section 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii)). 7.If the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer or a person associated with them (“associated person”) intends to dispose of assets in order to avoid or defer the payment of an outstanding or pending tax liability, the Commissioner can urgently issue an assessment to the taxpayer. Section 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii) reads: WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (ii)the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the disputant may take steps in relation to the existence or location of the disputant’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax from the disputant: (iii)the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that a person who is an associated person of the disputant may take steps in relation to the existence or location of the disputant’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax from the disputant: 8.In order to issue an assessment on the basis of either of the above exceptions, Inland Revenue officers must record any relevant correspondence and evidence (for example, the directors’ written instructions to shift the company’s assets overseas, evidence of electronic wiring of funds to overseas countries, transcripts of interviews with the taxpayer, etc) or other grounds for the reasonable belief. Exception 3: The taxpayer involved in a dispute or a person associated with them involved in another dispute involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v)). 9.Section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v) reads: (iv)the disputant has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute: (v)a person who is an associated person of the disputant and is involved in another dispute with the Commissioner involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the other dispute: 10.These exceptions apply to any judicial review proceedings that are brought against the Commissioner. In judicial review proceedings, the parties’ resources are likely to be directed away from advancing the dispute through the disputes process. 11.For the purpose of section 89N(1)(c)(v), an associated person of a taxpayer may be involved in a similar issue to the taxpayer even if the issue relates to a different revenue type. For example, if the dispute between the Commissioner and taxpayer relates to PAYE issues, but the dispute between the Commissioner and person associated with the taxpayer relates to income tax the taxpayer may still be involved in similar issues to the person associated with them. 12.Even if the two disputes relate to the same revenue type, section 89N(1)(c)(v) will not apply in some circumstances. For example, the dispute with the taxpayer relates to the tax treatment of entertainment expenditure, whereas the dispute with the person associated with the taxpayer relates to the capital and revenue distinction of merger expenditure. The Commissioner would not regard these two disputes as involving similar issues. Exception 4: The taxpayer fails to comply with a statutory requirement for information relating to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(vi)). 13.Section 89N(1)(c)(vi) reads: (vi)during the disputes process, the disputant receives from the Commissioner a requirement under a statute for information relating to the dispute and fails to comply with the requirement within a period that is specified in the requirement: 14.Generally, a taxpayer provides information to Inland Revenue voluntarily. However, when this does not occur the Commissioner can seek information from the taxpayer under a statutory provision, for example sections 17 or 19. (The Commissioner’s practice regarding section 17 is currently set out in OS 13/02: Section 17 Notices.) The requirement for statutory information will specify the period within which the information must be provided. This period will allow the taxpayer reasonable and sufficient time to comply. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 15.Where the taxpayer does not comply with a formal requirement for information that relates to a dispute (for example, as a tactic to delay the progress of the disputes process), the Commissioner can issue an assessment to the taxpayer without first completing the disputes process. Exception 5: The parties agree in writing that the dispute should be resolved by the court or TRA without completing the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(viii)). 16.Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) reads: (viii) the disputant and the Commissioner agree, recording their agreement in a document, that they have reached a position in which the dispute would be resolved more efficiently by being submitted to the court or Taxation Review Authority without completion of the disputes process: 17.Under this exception, where the Commissioner or taxpayer commences the disputes process, the parties can make such an agreement before either party issues their SOP. This would occur, for example, if the parties could incur excessive compliance and administrative costs in completing the full disputes process relative to the amount in dispute. 18.This exception allows the taxpayer to bring challenge proceedings against the Commissioner. The parties must have exchanged a NOPA and NOR before the taxpayer can bring challenge proceedings under section 138B(1). 19.The circumstances under which the Commissioner will enter into such an agreement are discussed in detail from paragraph 162 to 185. This SPS refers to this exception as opting out of the disputes process or “opt out”. Exception 6: The parties agree in writing to suspend the disputes process pending the outcome of a test case (section 89N(1)(c)(ix)). 20.Section 89N(1)(c)(ix) reads: (ix)the disputant and the Commissioner agree, recording their agreement in a document, to suspend proceedings in the dispute pending a decision in a test case referred to in section 89O. 21.Section 89O(2) allows a dispute to be suspended pending the result of a test case. Pursuant to section 89O(3), the parties can agree, recording their agreement in a document, to suspend the dispute from the date of the agreement until the earliest date that: (a)the court’s decision is made, or (b) the test case is otherwise resolved, or (c) the dispute is otherwise resolved. 22.If the parties agree to suspend the disputes process, any statutory time bar affecting the dispute is stayed. The Commissioner can then make an assessment that is consistent with the test case decision. (However, the taxpayer is not precluded from challenging the Commissioner’s assessment under section 89D(1), even if it is consistent with the test case decision.) 23.The Commissioner must issue an amended assessment or perform an action within the time limit specified in section 89O(5). WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 24.Section 89O(5) reads: The Commissioner must make an amended assessment, or perform an action, that is the subject of a suspended dispute by the later of the following: (a)the day that is 60 days after the last day of the suspension: (b)the last day of the period that – (i)begins on the day following the day by which the Commissioner, in the absence of the suspension, would be required under the Inland Revenue Acts to make the amended assessment, or perform the action; and (ii)contains the same number of days as does the period of the suspension. 25.If the statutory time bar arising under section 108 or 108A is imminent, section 89O(5) allows the Commissioner more time to complete the disputes process. 26.For example, the Commissioner commences a dispute and on 1 March 2010 agrees with the taxpayer in writing to suspend the disputes proceedings pending the decision in a designated test case. The disputed issue is subject to a statutory time bar that commences after 31 March 2010 and the taxpayer does not agree to delay its application under section 108B(1)(a). A decision is reached in the test case on 31 July 2010. 27.The Commissioner must make an amended assessment or perform an action that is the subject of the suspended dispute by 29 September 2010. This date is calculated as follows: (a) The suspension period commences on the date of the agreement (1 March 2010) and ends on the date of the court’s decision in the test case (31 July 2010). This is a period of 153 days. (b) The last date that the Commissioner can make an amended assessment falls on the later of the following two dates: (i)29 September 2010, that is 60 days after the date that the suspension period ends on 31 July 2010 pursuant to section 89O(5)(a), and (ii)31 August 2010, that is 153 days after the period commences on 1 April 2010 pursuant to section 89O(5)(b). Exception 7: The Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to allow more time to complete or dispense with the disputes process. 28.Section 89N(3) reads: ... \[T\]he Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order that allows more time for the completion of the disputes process, or for an order that completion of the disputes process is not required. 29.The Commissioner envisages that this exception will be used if section 89N(1)(c) does not apply and there are exceptional circumstances. 30.Any application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3) must be based on reasonable grounds. Whether there are reasonable grounds will depend on considerations such as the complexity of the issues in the dispute, whether the taxpayer has caused delays; whether the dispute involves large amounts of revenue WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC or whether there were significant matters in the dispute that were unforeseen by either party and provided a justification for the delay. 31.For example, due to unusual circumstances the Commissioner does not learn about a proposed adjustment until late. Further delays by the taxpayer and the need for the Commissioner to obtain significant legal advice means that the Disputes Review Unit cannot consider the dispute before the time bar applies. In these circumstances, the Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order that allows more time for the disputes process to be completed under section 89N(3). (Note: This is only an example of a possible unforeseen situation and it is anticipated that there will be a wide variety of circumstances under which an application under section 89N(3) will be appropriate.) 32.The Commissioner’s application to the High Court under section 89N(3) must be made before the four-year statutory time bar falls due. 33.The Commissioner must also issue an amended assessment within the time limit specified in section 89N(5). Section 89N(5) reads: If the Commissioner makes an application under subsection (3), the Commissioner must make an amended assessment by the last day of the period that - (a)begins on the day following the day by which the Commissioner, in the absence of the suspension, would be required under the Inland Revenue Acts to make the amended assessment; and (b)contains the total of - (i)the number of days between the date on which the Commissioner files the application in the High Court and the earliest date on which the application is decided by the High Court or the application or dispute is resolved: (ii)the number of days allowed by an order of a court as a result of the application. 34.Section 89N(5) allows the Commissioner more time to complete the disputes process where the statutory time bar under section 108 or 108A is imminent. 35.For example, the Commissioner commences the disputes process. On 1 March 2010 the Commissioner applies to the High Court under section 89N(3) for an order allowing more time to complete the process. The disputed issue is subject to a statutory time bar that commences after 31 March 2010 and the taxpayer does not agree to delay its application under section 108B(1)(a). On 30 June 2010, the High Court makes an order that allows the Commissioner’s application and gives the Commissioner 30 further days to complete the disputes process. 36.Pursuant to section 89N(5), the Commissioner must make an amended assessment by 30 August 2010. This date is calculated as follows: (a) The Commissioner would have one month to make the amended assessment before the statutory time bar commences. That is, 1 March 2010 to 31 March 2010. The period during which an amended assessment must be made under section 89N(5)(a) commences on 1 April 2010. (b) The period during which the assessment must be made includes 122 days, that is the period between 1 March 2010 and 30 June 2010 (the date of the decision) under section 89N(5)(b)(i) and the 30-day period allowed by the High Court order under section 89N(5)(b)(ii). This is a total of 152 days. (c) The Commissioner must issue an amended assessment to the taxpayer on the date that is 152 days from 1 April 2010. That is, by 30 August 2010. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 37.During the period from 1 March to 30 August 2010, the parties may continue to attempt to resolve the dispute. This may include exchanging SOPs and going through the adjudication process. 38.The above example indicates that the Commissioner has more time to complete the disputes process. The time bar will not commence until 30 August 2010. 39.Where the Commissioner applies to the High Court under section 89N(3) for an order to truncate the disputes process, an assessment must be issued within the period as calculated under section 89N(5). Applying the same facts as in the above example, the Commissioner must issue an assessment to the taxpayer by 30 August 2010. WITHDRAWN
