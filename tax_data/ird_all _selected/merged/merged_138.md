Te pupiri i te moni kāore i kerēmetia Holding unclaimed money
=============================================================

What

Money with no traceable owner

Who

Organisations and people who cannot find the owner of money

When

After 5 years

A holder of unclaimed money is a person or organisation which holds money for an owner who cannot be located.  

Generally, money will become unclaimed where the owner has not interacted with the money for 5 years. Where an owner has more than one account with the same organisation or person, the owner’s activity on one account will prevent the money in all of the owner’s accounts from becoming unclaimed.

Example: Sabena has two accounts with the same bank

Sabena has $1,000 in a savings account at a bank. She is keen to save the money, so she decides to leave the $1,000 untouched and doesn’t withdraw any money for 10 years. She also holds an on-call account with the bank which she often accesses for her everyday purchases. Sabena’s interaction with her on-call account will stop the funds in both accounts from becoming unclaimed.

### Monetary thresholds

Amounts which are more than $100 will become unclaimed money under the Act. Amounts which are $100 or less and owed to the same owner (such that they collectively exceed $100) are also unclaimed money.

For amounts $100 or less you have two choices.

*   Send them to us as unclaimed money
*   Keep them for an alternative purpose such as donating to charity

If you keep money of $100 or less, you will need to consider how to treat it for tax purposes. Owners will still have a claim on you for any sums of $100 or less that  you do not send to us.

Our Public Rulings BR Pub 17/01 and BR Pub 17/02 cover the income tax treatment of unclaimed amounts of $100 or less and amounts of $100 or less held on trust.

[BR Pub 17/01 and BR pub 17/02](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/rulings/public/br-pub-1701-br-pub-1702-br-pub-1701-income-tax-treatment-of-unclaimed-amounts-of-100-or-less-and-br-)

### Types of unclaimed money with specific guidelines

Unclaimed money with specific guidelines includes the following.

*   renewing term deposit
*   holiday pay
*   situations where a former client has been overcharged

### Money in a renewing term deposit

Money in a renewing term deposit is usually either reinvested at the end of the term or paid to its owner. If a term deposit is the only investment a customer has with an organisation, the 5 year deeming period starts after the investment term rolls over for the first time. Once the deeming period starts the money becomes unclaimed if there is no interaction between the owner and the organisation. The holder must still make reasonable efforts to locate the customer.

The holder does not have to pay the money to us until the deposit matures. Not breaking the deposit before it ends means the owner is not financially disadvantaged. The unclaimed money should be sent to us in the next relevant filing period.

### Remediation of holiday pay

If an employer cannot find a past employee (or the executor of their will), the holiday pay becomes unclaimed 5 years after the date the amount is calculated as owing to the employee. If no payment to the employee is made, the employer does not have to deduct PAYE.  The full gross amount should be sent  to us as unclaimed money. Refer to Commissioner’s Statement CS 17/02.

### A former client cannot be located

Organisations holding unclaimed money should make reasonable efforts to find the owner of the money and repay it. For example an organisation discovers it overcharged a former client but cannot locate the client to return the money. Rather than hold the money for 5 years, the organisation may choose to pay the money to us earlier.

For more guidance on these and other matters relating to unclaimed money (including making reasonable efforts to locate an owner and transitional information) see the Special report pages 51-64.

Holiday Act remediation payments for former employees
=====================================================

If we notify you that you're entitled to a payment, you need to log into our remediation payment portal to receive it.

[Getting a Holiday Act remediation payment for former employees](/topics/holiday-act-remediation-payments-for-former-employees/getting-a-holiday-act-remediation-payment-for-former-employees)
 

[Remediation portal](https://ess.myobpayglobal.com/IRHolidaysAct/)

We have found that we underpaid employees under the Holidays Act 2003.

If you were employed by Inland Revenue (IR) at any time on or after 18 August 2011, you may be entitled to a remediation payment for incorrectly calculated holidays and leave. 

We are contacting former IR staff from 27 June 2022 who are entitled to a payment. We will contact you first by text, then by email and finally by post.

The Holidays Act and why employees were underpaid 
--------------------------------------------------

The Holidays Act 2003 sets out how payment for leave and final pay is to be calculated and paid.

The Holidays Act is a complex piece of legislation which can be interpreted in several different ways. This means many organisations, including the NZ Police and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) (which regulates the Holidays Act), have miscalculated holiday pay.

How far back we'll correct payments
-----------------------------------

We have agreed with the Labour Inspectorate to correct payments back to mid-August 2011. we are required to go back 6 years from the date of non-compliance. Calculations will start from the beginning of the second pay period in August 2011 (18 August 2011).

Payroll issues being addressed by the remediation payments
----------------------------------------------------------

The issues relate to entitlements under the Holidays Act 2003, mainly to the payment of:

*   annual holidays
*   bereavement leave
*   alternative holidays
*   public holidays
*   sick leave
*   domestic violence leave.

Checking the leave payment recalculations
-----------------------------------------

We have contracted a third-party supplier who has worked with us for several years and has performed similar work with other agencies. They have built a tool to recalculate the payment for every instance of leave across the remediation period to ensure that employees have received at least minimum entitlements under the Holidays Act 2003.

### Recalculating annual leave

We’ve recalculated annual leave to ensure that we’ve paid [ordinary weekly pay](/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b3205639B-7076-42F4-882C-CC6C5C68EC7F%7d%40en)
 or [average weekly earnings](/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7bA8A539BC-C792-4337-9A57-FACBB4AA0DE3%7d%40en)
, whichever is higher.

### Recalculating other leave types

We’ve recalculated other leave types – bereavement, alternative holidays, public holidays, sick leave and domestic violence leave - to ensure relevant daily pay has been paid. Where it has not been possible or practical to work out [relevant daily pay](/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7bCFE6AAB1-2FEE-472E-9200-27C54BC01D9E%7d%40en)
, we have used [average daily pay](/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b82C4F4E0-23C6-4663-8507-B4CF229539F2%7d%40en)
 in the remediation calculations.

Any annual leave cash-ups will have the first week from gross earnings. 

We’ve recalculated annual leave payments after a period of parental leave to ensure that they are paid at the average weekly earnings rate. Following an Inland Revenue policy change on 20 December 2013, we have ensured that annual leave is paid at the higher of [ordinary weekly pay](/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b3205639B-7076-42F4-882C-CC6C5C68EC7F%7d%40en)
 and [average weekly earnings](/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7bA8A539BC-C792-4337-9A57-FACBB4AA0DE3%7d%40en)
. 

### Overtime and standby

We’ve reviewed the regularity of payments such as overtime and standby. If they are counted as regular at the time leave is taken, then they are included in the calculations for annual, bereavement, alternative holidays, public holidays, sick leave and domestic violence leave.

### Casual employees

We've reviewed casual employee records to work out if a public holiday would have been a working day for them. If it was a working day, we've calculated and paid the right daily pay or average daily pay.  

Unions
------

We have engaged with our unions about the remediation payments.

Entitlement to remediation payments
-----------------------------------

Holiday payment errors typically affect employees who have received payments over and above their normal salary. These can include:

*   some allowances 
*   regular overtime 
*   standby
*   employees who have changed their hours of work. 

Remediation payment amounts
---------------------------

The remediation calculations compare what was paid with what should have been paid for each instance of leave. The amount that people will receive will vary depending on the circumstances for each individual employee, for example their hours worked or payments made during the remediation period.

A significant number of employees will not receive a payment. Half of those people entitled to a payment will receive less than $100.

Why are we paying such small amounts?
-------------------------------------

We are making all payments even if you are due 1 cent. We have a legislative obligation to pay everyone correctly even if it is only a small payment.

Overpayments
------------

Some people have been overpaid. We’ve decided not to recover these overpayments. This is in line with other government agencies. These overpayments are not included in the 52 weeks gross earnings for subsequent annual holiday calculations.

Underpayments
-------------

Underpayments are included in the 52 weeks gross earnings for subsequent annual holiday payment calculations. The underpayments will be paid to current and former employees.

Once you’ve received your letter, please email us if you require further information or have any concerns about overpayments and underpayments in your remediation calculations.

Impact on tax and benefits
--------------------------

The remediation payments will be treated as an ‘extra pay’ for tax purposes. We encourage you to contact us or other relevant organisations for advice about whether your remediation payment affects any agreement you have about:

*   agreement you have with them about your current earnings, 
*   benefits, 
*   child support 
*   working for families
*   any other matters.

Our website has useful information on the tax treatment of lump sum payments such as an arrears payment.

You can also contact us directly.

[Contact us](/contactus)

KiwiSaver and superannuation contribution deductions
----------------------------------------------------

KiwiSaver deductions and contributions will be calculated as part of the remediation payment.

Other superannuation contributions won't be calculated or deducted due to the way in which they're calculated.

Student loan deductions
-----------------------

Student loan repayments will be calculated as part of the remediation payment.

Home detention for COVID tax fraud
==================================

**29 November 2023** A Te Awamutu man has been sentenced to home detention after falsely claiming COVID-19 money meant to help businesses recover after the pandemic.   
   
Nathanael Thomas Ballard was charged with dishonestly and without claim of right applying for Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans (SBCS) and a Resurgence Support Payment (RSP). He was sentenced in the Te Awamutu District Court on 27 November to 8-and-a-half month’s home detention.  
   
Ballard was listed as a director of Pure Quality Services Ltd (PQSL) when it was incorporated in September 2016 but stopped that role in January 2017. He had ‘owner’ access to the company’s myIR account and didn’t cancel it when he stopped being a director. He also had a myIR account in his own name.  
   
In April 2020, the Government announced the ‘high trust’ Small Business Cashflow Scheme to support small business which were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
   
In May 2020, Ballard applied for an $11,800 SBCS loan in his own name which was approved and paid out. He knew he wasn’t entitled to the money because he didn’t have an existing and viable business.  
   
Two days later he repeated the application procedure this time for $19,000 using the company name. He was caught out when PQSL’s current director told IR Ballard had applied for and received the money without his knowledge or consent.  
   
In February 2021, Ballard tried to make a claim for the Resurgence Support Payment falsely stating he had been in business for 6 months and that the business was viable and ongoing. IR declined the application.  
   
The total paid out by IR was $30,800, and the total Ballard was unsuccessful in obtaining was $1,732.  
   
Since June 2022, Inland Revenue has been conducting a review of some customers who received one or more of the RSP, SBCS and the COVID-19 Support payment to make sure customers met the eligibility criteria and used the payments within the terms and conditions.   
   
So far, Inland Revenue has successfully prosecuted eight customers, including Nathanael Ballard, for SBCS fraud involving $7,789,073.00.  
   
There are 23 other cases before the courts involving $778,569. Four people are awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty.   
   
Customers identified for SBCS fraud have also been fraudulent across other COVID-19 products and taxes and involved other government agencies.  
   
There is one case being run by the Serious Fraud Office involving an approx. $2.1 million fraud of the wage subsidy scheme (run by the Ministry of Social Development) plus SBCS & GST fraud (run by IRD).  
   
The SBCS loan scheme closes at the end of December. Applications are still coming in and Inland Revenue continues to see applications being made and is still identifying fraud in some of those applications.

Horse racing club entitled to GST input deduction on stakes paid to GST-registered riders and trainers
======================================================================================================

This case involved the issue of entitlement to input tax deductions under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

Case

Canterbury Jockey Club v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 2569

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

This case involved the issue of entitlement to input tax deductions under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”) for stakes payments paid to GST registered trainers and jockeys in the horse racing industry.

Canterbury Jockey Club Inc (“CJC”) had claimed GST input deductions on stakes payments paid to GST registered trainers and riders in horse races CJC conducted. CJC argued trainers and riders provide services to it on race days for consideration in the form of stakes payments, and therefore it was entitled to GST input deductions for stakes payments made to trainers and riders who win.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) argued that trainers and riders did not supply services to CJC and the stakes payments made by CJC were not consideration for any services. Trainers and riders instead supply services only to the horse owners.

### Impact

The case establishes the GST position, with respect of stakes paid to GST-registered riders and trainers, for similarly situated clubs in the horse racing industry.

### Facts

CJC is an incorporated society, and a “racing club” under s 5 of the Racing Act 2013. It is registered for GST with a taxable activity of horse racing. Racing clubs such as CJC are responsible for organising, managing and promoting race meetings where horses compete in races for prize money which is known as stakes or stakes money. The New Zealand Racing Board (NZRB) oversees the racing industry and conducts betting on racing for the harness, greyhound and thoroughbred horse racing codes. Betting may only occur at race meeting conducted by registered racing clubs. Profits from betting by NZRB are distributed to the three racing codes.

New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing (“NZTR”) is the governing body overseeing the thoroughbred racing code. It distributes NZTR’s share of NZRB’s profits among its registered racing clubs, including CJC.

NZTR establishes, enforces and amends the Rules of Racing 2013 (“the Rules”) which govern the various relationships and interactions between, among others, registered clubs, horse owners, trainers and riders. The Racing Act gives NZTR the sole authority to make and administer the Rules and to provide for “prize money and other stakes”. NZTR regulates what stakes are paid for, to whom, and in how many pools. From 1 June 2013, the Rules came into effect by which NZTR (on behalf of clubs) must pay to the owners, trainers and riders their share of their stake money. NZTR also collects, on behalf of clubs, entry fees payable when a horse is nominated and accepted for a race and distributes the stake money.

Stakes payments are paid to reward the connections of a horse that finishes in a stakebearing place. They also serve to attract owners and trainers to enter their horses into the club’s races, thereby increasing the quality of horses and number of people engaging with race meetings.

Horse trainers usually receive a monthly fee from horse owners and are in the business of providing services of training horses. Riders are normally engaged by the trainer, but the owner may also be involved. The rider is paid a set fee to ride at races, regardless of the outcome of the race.

Clubs are not a party to either of these arrangements and most trainers and riders are GST registered. Trainers are described as “the agent for the owner” and it is rare for owners to nominate their horse for a race, instead it is the horse’s trainer who normally does this.

The Rules prescribe that NZTR, on behalf of the clubs, shall pay stakes to trainers and riders directly. NZTR is required to deduct any amount of tax that it is legally obliged to deduct from the stakes and issue, on behalf of the club, any tax invoice required. Those that receive stake payments and who are GST registered, must pay GST on the stakes payments.

The clubs collect the GST on the stakes payments for payment to the IRD. Clubs file their own GST returns and make any required GST payments to IRD directly.

CJC filed its GST return for the period ending 30 September 2013 excluding a claim for input tax credits of $102,428.82 for stakes payments made to GST registered trainers and riders. CJC did so with the intention of proposing an adjustment, which it did on 18 December 2013, increasing CJC’s total purchases and expenses (including GST) by $102,428.82 and in turn increasing the GST refund owed to CJC by $13,360.28 for the period.

The Commissioner rejected the proposed adjustment on 13 February 2014 and issued a Notice of Response (“NOR”) the next day. CJC then challenged the NOR by way of this test case, as a representative club for the racing industry.

### Decision

_Do trainers and riders supply services to CJC?_

Regarding the meaning of “supply”, the Court found there must be a transfer of something to someone else as well as a nexus or connection between the payment and the supply of services, with reciprocity in the legal relationship between both parties. The Court accepted that there was a legal arrangement between CJC and rider/trainer participants that was governed by the Rules which imposed enforceable and reciprocal obligations, and such obligations can give rise to a supply for GST purposes. The Court made no finding as to whether the Rules created a contractual relationship between CJC and trainers/riders as in any case, a contractual relationship was not critical to determining the issues here.

Regarding the services provided by riders and trainers on race day, the Court accepted that trainers and riders do not contract with CJC to provide services and that they provide training and riding services to the owners, for which they are paid. However, a contract is not necessary for there to be a ‘supply of services’ (as held in the Court of Appeal decision in _Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032 (CA)). The Court found that trainers and riders do provide services to CJC on race day by entering the race, participating in accordance with the Rules, and providing a stake winning performance. The Court came to that conclusion due to three factors:

1.  CJC works in the promotion of its horse races. Its profit is largely from betting, which itself is advanced by having a more competitive pool of racehorses;
2.  The Rules since 2013 require NZTR to pay stake money, plus GST, on behalf of CJC to trainers and riders, and to render tax invoices for CJC to pay GST. The Court held it would be “problematic” for the Commissioner to deny input tax deductions when a club (through NZTR) must ensure the GST component is paid for the trainers’ and riders’ services on race day (at \[83\]); and
3.  Without the input tax deductions being claimed by CJC, the GST payment on stake money is not neutral (GST was intended to be broad-based and neutral).

Regarding the Commissioner’s argument that the riders and trainers provided a benefit, for which CJC paid stakes money, rather than services, the Court found that participation by trainers and riders on race day is a supply of services from which CJC derives a benefit. That benefit does not affect the fact that there is a supply for services.

_Are stakes payments to trainers and riders consideration for the services provided?_

In considering whether there was a sufficiently strong connection or nexus between the payment of stakes and the supply of goods to constitute consideration, the Court found the payment must induce the trainers/riders to provide their services on race day and that the payment of stakes did, in fact, induce the trainers/riders to perform. Thus, the payments were consideration for their services. Consideration was given here regardless of whether the parties were in a contractual relationship or not.

The Commissioner submitted that the stakes payments were actually “prizes” given as a reward to a winner, rather than “fees” contingent on success. The Court rejected that argument and found that stakes payments are consideration for the services of trainers and riders and are treated as such under both the Rules and in practice, because in the hands of GST registered participants, the stakes payments are GST liable.

Overall the Court found that CJC was entitled to GST input tax deductions for stakes payments made to GST registered trainers and riders in horse races conducted by CJC.

Horticultural plants - replacement plants and economic amortisation rates
=========================================================================

2004 amendments mean the CIR can make determinations listing types of plants and provide amortisation rates on the estimated useful life of each type listed.

**_Sections CG 11(7), DO 4, DO 4B, DO 4C, DO 4D, DO8(c), FD 10(3)(b), OB 1 and Schedule 7, Part A, item 12 of the Income Tax Act 1994_**

**_Sections DO 4, DO 4B, DO 4C, DO 4D, DO 4E, DO5,_** **_DV 13, OB 1 and Schedule 7, Part A, item 8 of the Income Tax Act 2004_**

**_Sections 44C and 91AAB of the Tax Administration Act_** **_1994_**

### Introduction

Under amendments to the Income Tax Acts 1994 and 2004 and the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be able make determinations to list various types of plants and provide specific amortisation rates that reflect the estimated useful life of each type listed.

When the Commissioner sets a particular rate for a type of plant, that rate will apply instead of a default rate for plants that are not of a type listed. The amortisation rate set by the Commissioner for a plant will be based on the estimated useful life of the plant.

The plants listed by the Commissioner also qualify under rules that allow immediate deductions for a limited proportion of replacement planting. The rules for replacement plants are designed to give certainty in law but flexibility for managing plantations.

The amendments apply from the 2003-04 income year but, in practice, come into effect in accordance with the Commissioner's determinations.

### Background

An immediate deduction for plants was previously allowed by the Commissioner only for the replacement of a small number of dead or destroyed plants of the same species and variety. As such, the scope of what was considered a repair to or maintenance of a plant extended to include a limited amount of replacement planting in addition to other repair and maintenance activities such as pruning - though a significant limitation was that, to be deductible, replacements had to be made on a like-for-like plant basis.

If a plant is replaced to repair or maintain its productive contribution to a business, the most commercially appropriate plant should be used. Ideally, the replacement plant should not be limited to the same type of plant as that replaced but should be of a type that represents the best choice for the business - this might be an improved or different type of plant. Other considerations include the number of plants that would be economic to replace at a time. In some cases it is desirable to replace whole rows of plants or an area of plants for reasons including the control of disease, to provide consistent growing conditions or simply to make use of the same type of plants being planted elsewhere on the same orchard or in the same horticultural business.

These concerns were raised by the New Zealand Fruitgrowers Federation, who sought a more certain legal position to provide more flexibility to manage replanting activities, particularly so that using the most commercially desirable varieties would not produce different tax effects when that meant a different plant would be used.

### Key features

#### Who do the rules apply to

In most cases the rules will apply to commercial horticultural growers like orchardists, though the rules are cast in broader terms to apply to a person who carries on a horticultural business on land developed for that purpose.

#### What do the rules relate to

The rules relate to expenditure on the development of land by planting horticultural plants - typically this will be an orchard.

Expenditure incurred from planting the kinds of plants listed by the Commissioner must be amortised at the rates determined by the Commissioner, based on the estimated useful life of those plants. An exception is provided so that some expenditure incurred in planting may be deducted in the year it is incurred if the plants are replacement plants. In either case this is the treatment for "listed horticultural plants".

Expenditure incurred from planting plants that are not listed by the Commissioner is deducted under a rule provided for "non-listed horticultural plants". It retains the same treatment that was previously provided for vines and trees and operates as a kind of default rule for horticultural plants not listed by the Commissioner.

#### Amortising planting expenditure

Under section DO 4C of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section DO 4B of the Income Tax Act 2004, expenditure on planting listed horticultural plants must be amortised at the rates determined by the Commissioner under section 91AAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless it is deducted in relation to planting replacement plants under section DO 4D of the 1994 Act or section DO 4C of the 2004 Act.

Non-listed horticultural plant expenditure must be amortised at the 12 percent rate provided under section DO 4 and item 12 in Part A of Schedule 7 of the 1994 Act or section DO 4 and item 8 in Part A of Schedule 7 of the 2004 Act.

#### Deducting replacement planting expenditure

Section DO 4D of the 1994 Act and section DO 4C of the 2004 Act allow a limited amount of replacement planting expenditure to be fully deducted in the year it is incurred. These deductions are limited to a maximum of 15% of an orchard being replaced over a three-year period. Allowing some replacement planting expenditure to be deducted is comparable to the treatment of repair and maintenance expenditure such as for pruning plants. Within a three-year period, replacements in any one year may be deducted in that year in relation to up to 7.5% of an orchard. Thus if 7.5% of an orchard is replaced and immediately deducted in each of the first two years of a three-year period, no replacement planting can be deducted in the third year of that period.

These rules are based on allowing up to 5% of an orchard on average to be replaced and deducted in a year. Any other replacements must be capitalised and amortised using the rates set by the Commissioner.

For example, 4% of an orchard could be replaced and deducted under this rule for the current year when in the preceding year 7.5% and the year prior to that 3.5% of the orchard was replaced and deducted. Replacement planting of more than 4% of the orchard in the current year would have to be amortised.

The proportion of the orchard replaced is measured by reference to the land affected by replacement planting activities. Changing the density at which plants are planted should not affect the extent to which a deduction is allowed for replacement plantings.

#### Writing off planting expenditure

A plant that is not replaced with a plant for which an immediate deduction is taken can be written off by deducting its book value when it ceases to exist or to be used as part of a business to derive income (section DO 4C(5) and section DO 4B(6)).

However, if a plant is replaced with a replacement plant for which an immediate deduction is taken, the plant cannot be written off because it is, in effect, treated as repairing and maintaining an existing plant. For tax purposes, the new plant is treated as a continuation of the old plant. Thus the book value of the old plant can be allocated to the new plants or any other plants, such as those in the same block. The rules leave it open for growers to choose the method of allocating these book values in a way that best suits their business (section DO4C(6) and section DO 4B(7)).

#### Definitions

Key definitions in both the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts are "diminished value", "estimated useful life", "listed horticultural plant", "non-listed horticultural plant", "planting", "plot", "replacement area fraction" and "replacement plant".

#### Application date

The amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 came in to force on 21 December 2004, the date of Royal assent, and apply from the 2003-04 income years. The amendments relating to listed horticultural plants will not have effect until an administrative determination is made by the Commissioner under new section 91AAB in the amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 come into force from 1 April 2005. A related consequential amendment is made to section 44C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, also with force from 1 April 2005.

Tono ki tētahi aweretanga tautoko tamaiti ina kei rō hōhipera, kei rō whare herehere rānei Apply for a child support exemption while in hospital or prison
==========================================================================================================================================================

If you're a prison inmate, hospital or rehabilitation centre patient for at least 13 weeks in a row, you can apply for an exemption to stop or reduce your child support payments.

Prisoners must apply for an exemption while still in prison.

Hospital patients have up to 3 months after leaving hospital to apply for an exemption.

To qualify for this exemption, your taxable income must be:

*   only from investment income
*   less than the minimum annual rate for that child support year.

[Child support annual rates](/child-support/types/formula-assessment/amount/annual-rates)
  
  
You may still qualify if you're earning a benefit at the hospital rate or a full benefit for part of the time you're in the hospital.

Prison allowances do not count as income, though salary and wages through a release-to-work programme do. If you are receiving salary and wages from a release-to-work programme, you will not qualify for the exemption and will need to continue paying child support.

Before you start
----------------

You'll need your:

*   IRD number
*   postal address before going into prison or the hospital
*   contact details
*   expected investment and other income for the [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})

He pēhea te tukanga wenewene nā te Kaikomihana i kōkiri e mahi ai How the Commissioner-initiated disputes process works
=======================================================================================================================

We send you a Notice of proposed adjustment
-------------------------------------------

If we want to adjust a return you've filed, we'll generally send you a Notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) first. This notice will include: 

*   details of the amount we want to adjust
*   the facts and tax laws that support the adjustment we are proposing
*   how the law applies to the facts.

### Outcome 

If you accept all our adjustments we'll issue a new assessment in line with our amounts and the matters ends there. 

If you disagree with any part of our notice, the process continues with Step 2. 

You send us a Notice of response (NOR)
--------------------------------------

You'll send us a Notice of response (NOR) - IR771. This notice must be sent within 2 months from the date we issued the NOPA, otherwise you're deemed by law to have accepted our NOPA. 

Your notice must include:

*   the change you want to any amounts on our NOPA
*   the facts that support the change you want
*   why you think your view is correct.

You can also list on the notice the documents you've attached.

### Outcome

If we accept your notice we'll issue a new assessment in line with your amount or the assessment in your return stands, and the matter ends there.

If we disagree with your notice, the process continues.

[Notice of response IR771 2020 (PDF 84KB) Download form](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir700---ir799/ir771/ir771-2020.pdf?modified=20220912201432&modified=20220912201432)

We have a conference about the dispute
--------------------------------------

We get together to:

*   exchange relevant information and documents about the dispute
*   try and resolve differences about the facts, laws and legal arguments.

This can be done over the phone or in person. You can choose to have a senior Inland Revenue staff member act as a facilitator for the conference. This facilitator will have had no previous involvement with the dispute.

### Outcome

If we reach an agreement at the conference, we'll issue a new assessment to reflect that agreement.

If we cannot reach an agreement at the conference, you can ask for our agreement to opt out of the rest of the disputes process if you think that the dispute can be more efficiently resolved at the Taxation Review Authority or High Court. If we agree to your request to opt out we'll issue a new assessment and the process continues at Step 7.

If we cannot reach an agreement at the conference or on your opt-out request, the process continues. 

We send you a Disclosure notice and our Statement of position
-------------------------------------------------------------

A Disclosure notice will be sent with our Statement of position (SOP). This statement will include: 

*   an outline of the facts, documentary evidence and propositions of law we're relying on
*   an outline of the issues we consider are in dispute. 

If the dispute goes to the Taxation Review Authority or High Court, we cannot introduce any issues or propositions of law that were not in our SOP unless you agree to it. This is called the Issues and propositions of law exclusion rule. 

A judge may allow previously undisclosed issues and propositions of law to be raised in very limited circumstances. 

You send us a Statement of position (SOP)
-----------------------------------------

Use the Statement of position (SOP) - IR773 form. This form must include: 

*   the facts that support your view 
*   the questions that need to be answered to resolve the dispute
*   why you think your view is correct
*   a list of the evidence you're relying on. 

This statement must be sent within 2 months of when we issued the Disclosure notice, otherwise you're deemed by law to have accepted our SOP.

If the dispute goes to the Taxation Review Authority or High Court, the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule says that it cannot introduce any issues and propositions of law that were not in your SOP. The only way you can introduce new issues and positions of law is if we agree to it. 

A judge may allow previously undisclosed issues and propositions of law to be raised in very limited circumstances. 

If you SOP discloses matters that we were not previously aware of, we're allowed by law to issue an addendum to our SOP within the 2 months of when you issued your SOP. 

In most cases, if no agreement is reached by this stage the case will go to our Disputes Review Unit for consideration. 

[Statement of position IR773 2020 (PDF 84KB) Download form](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir700---ir799/ir773/ir773-2020.pdf?modified=20220912201441&modified=20220912201441)

The Disputes Review Unit completes an adjudication report
---------------------------------------------------------

The Disputes Review Unit staff are independent experts within Inland Revenue who'll take a fresh look at the case. They'll consider the following in each of the SOPs:

*   facts
*   evidence
*   legal principles
*   issues raised.

The Disputes Review Unit will reach a decision and send a copy of the adjudication report to you and the Inland Revenue staff member involved. 

### Outcome

If the Disputes Review Unit decides in your favour: 

*   your return stands
*   we'll issue a new assessment in line with the amount in your NOR.

The matter will end at this point. 

If the Disputes Review Unit decides in our favour, we'll issue a new assessment in line with the amounts we proposed.

If you accept this decision the matter ends there. 

If you do not accept this decision the process continues.

Taxation Review Authority or the High Court
-------------------------------------------

You may take your case to the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court. The Taxation Review Authority has less strict rules of evidence, usually costs less and is not open to the public. 

You have 2 months to do this from the date of the new assessment based on the adjudication report decision. 

You'll receive information about how to take your case to the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court with your new assessment. 

It's up to you to prove your position in the Taxation Review Authority or High Court. You must prove:

*   the assessment is wrong
*   why the assessment is wrong
*   the amount by which the assessment is wrong.

However, if we've assessed you for a shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act we must prove the assessment is correct.

Your responsibilities
---------------------

### Deadlines

We must both meet a series of deadlines throughout the disputes process.

If you do not take the required action within the time limit given, you'll be deemed by law to have accepted our position unless: 

*   exceptional circumstances apply 
*   you have demonstrated you intended to enter into or continue the disputes process. 

Exceptional circumstances are events that are entirely outside your control or your agent's control and that could not have been reasonably anticipated. 

### Correspondence

Once you've written any correspondence please send it to us. 

*   Rejection of our Notice of response (NOR)
*   Statement of position (SOP)

If you've been in contact with an Inland Revenue staff member about the dispute, send all your correspondence to that person. Otherwise send your correspondence to: 

Inland Revenue  
PO Box 39010  
Wellington Mail Centre  
Lower Hutt 5045

If you have a myIR account, you can send your dispute document to us electronically in one of the following 2 ways:

*   by using the myIR message service where the dispute document must be identified by selecting the Disputes Documents category
*   by using the Upload requested document service and entering the relevant response code, if you have been issued one.

We do not consent to receiving a dispute document by other electronic means, unless this has been specifically agreed with you.

=============================================================================================================================================================================

What

A voluntary savings and investment scheme to help you save for your retirement

When

Choose a plan that suits you best

KiwiSaver is a voluntary, work-based retirement savings scheme. Independent KiwiSaver providers run the savings schemes. You can choose one of them to manage your savings.

KiwiSaver is for all New Zealand citizens and permanent residents living or normally living in New Zealand. Members can still get New Zealand Superannuation when they reach 65.

You are automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver if you are:

*   eligible to be enrolled
*   starting work with a new employer
*   aged between 18 and 65.

If you are eligible to join KiwiSaver
-------------------------------------

If you are eligible for KiwiSaver but not yet a KiwiSaver member you can enrol by:

*   asking your employer for a KiwiSaver employee information pack and completing a KiwiSaver deduction form
*   choosing a provider and signing directly with them. 

If you're a salary or wage earner your employer may enrol you in KiwiSaver when you start a new job. You can stay enrolled, or you can opt out.

If you’re already employed but not a KiwiSaver member you can join either through your employer or through a KiwiSaver provider. Once you’ve joined, you will not be able to opt out.

If you stay enrolled you'll contribute either 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of your before tax pay.  If you do not choose a contribution rate, your employer will deduct the default rate of 3%. You'll contribute through wage deductions. If you're enrolled in KiwiSaver and under the age of 18, your employer will still deduct KiwiSaver.

If you're self-employed or not working, you can join KiwiSaver by contacting a KiwiSaver provider directly.

[KiwiSaver providers](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/joining-kiwisaver/kiwisaver-providers)

How KiwiSaver works for employers
---------------------------------

Employers work out if new employees are eligible for automatic enrolment in KiwiSaver. They also enrol existing employees if they choose to opt in to KiwiSaver.

Employers send the details of all enrolments to us and also send us new employee KiwiSaver opt out requests.

Employers make KiwiSaver deductions from their employees' pay. They also make a compulsory minimum contribution of 3% towards their employees' KiwiSaver savings -  unless they are already contributing to another superannuation fund for their employees. 

An employer will also stop payments if their employee has a savings suspension, or if they’re given notice by us or their employee that contributions are to stop.

Employers cannot give you financial advice.

Inland Revenue and KiwiSaver
----------------------------

Employers pay employee deductions and employer contributions to us with the rest of their payroll deductions like tax.

We also manage voluntary contributions from employees, self-employed people and those not working. Any money paid to us for KiwiSaver we pass on to KiwiSaver providers. We also administer requests for opt-outs and savings suspensions.

If you were automatically enrolled and do not choose a scheme, we will allocate you to one of our default schemes or to your employer's chosen scheme. Or you can opt in to a scheme via your employer.

We cannot give you financial advice.

KiwiSaver providers
-------------------

KiwiSaver scheme providers invest their members’ KiwiSaver savings to make a greater return on the savings for their retirement. They also have the main relationship with members.

KiwiSaver providers can give you financial advice.

The government KiwiSaver contribution
-------------------------------------

There is a yearly government KiwiSaver contribution to some members. KiwiSaver providers apply for this government contribution on behalf of their members. The amount of the government contribution depends on how much a member has contributed to their fund from 1 July to 30 June. The maximum amount the government contributes is $521.43. 

Finding out more about retirement planning
------------------------------------------

We can't give you financial advice, and neither can your employer.

For free and balanced information about getting ready for your retirement, you can go to the Sorted website.

[Sorted.org.nz](https://sorted.org.nz/)
  
  
Contact a financial advisor for independent financial advice on:

*   your financial situation
*   KiwiSaver and how it works
*   if KiwiSaver is right for you
*   how to choose a scheme or investment product.

The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) regulates financial advisors. The FMA can give you information on financial advisors and a list of authorised financial advisors. Financial advisors must be licensed.

What

Taxable supply information you need to provide or get.

Who

GST-registered customers.

When

You sell or buy goods or services as part of your taxable activity.

Providing and requesting taxable supply information
---------------------------------------------------

Taxable supply information must be provided to GST registered buyers within 28 days of a request (or by an alternative date agreed to by the parties) for supplies over $200.

You must keep taxable supply information for any goods and services you buy or sell.

What taxable supply information must show
-----------------------------------------

The taxable supply information you need to provide or keep depends on the value and the type of supply.

Our handy online tool below will help you decide on the records you need to keep when you buy or sell goods and services.

In the past, you needed to keep a single physical document, like a tax invoice, as evidence of a transaction.

Now, various records like invoices, bank statements, supplier agreements, and contracts can be used on their own, or in combination, to support the figures in your GST returns.

Sellers can provide taxable supply information to a customer using an automated direct exchange between the buyer's and seller's software, for example PEPPOL eInvoicing:

We send you a Notice of response (NOR)
--------------------------------------

We'll send you a Notice of response (NOR) within 2 months of the date you issued your Notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). 

Our notice will: 

*   give reasons why we disagree with your proposed changes
*   specify the amounts we consider are correct. 

### Outcome

If you accept our notice we'll issue a new assessment in line with our amounts or the original assessment stands, and the matter ends there.

You disagree with our NOR
-------------------------

If you disagree with our NOR you must write and tell us within 2 months of the date we issued it. 

### Outcome 

If you do not disagree with our NOR, you're deemed by law to have accepted it. 

If you write to say you disagree, then the process continues.

Conference between both parties
-------------------------------

We get together to: 

*   exchange relevant information and documents about the dispute
*   try to resolve differences about facts, laws and legal arguments. 

This can be done over the phone or in person. You can choose to have a senior Inland Revenue staff member act as a facilitator for the conference. This facilitator will have had no previous involvement with the dispute. 

### Outcome 

If we reach an agreement at the conference, we'll issue a new assessment to reflect that agreement. 

If we cannot reach an agreement at the conference, you can ask for our agreement to opt out of the rest of the disputes process if you think that the dispute can be more efficiently resolved at the Taxation Review Authority or High Court. If we agree to your request to opt out, we'll send you a Challenge notice and the process continues with Step 9. 

If we cannot reach an agreement at the conference, or on your opt-out request, the process continues with Step 5.

We send you a Disclosure notice
-------------------------------

A Disclosure notice requires you to complete a Statement of position (SOP) - IR773 if you want to continue the dispute.

You send us a Statement of position (SOP)
-----------------------------------------

Gather the following information to complete the Statement of position - IR773.

*   Facts that support your view. 
*   The questions that need to be answered to resolve the dispute. 
*   Why you think your view is correct. 
*   A list of the evidence that you're relying on. 

This statement must be sent within 2 months from the date we issued the Disclosure notice, otherwise you're deemed by law to have not initiated the dispute. 

If the dispute goes to the Taxation Review Authority or High Court, you cannot introduce any issues or propositions of law that were not in your SOP unless we agree to it. This is called the Issues and propositions of law exclusion rule. 

 A judge may allow previously undisclosed issues and propositions of law to be raised in very limited circumstances.

We send you a SOP
-----------------

Once you issue your SOP, we have 2 months to issue ours. If the dispute goes the Taxation Review Authority or High Court, the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule says that we cannot  introduce any new issues or propositions of law that were not in our SOP. The only way we can introduce new issues and propositions of law is if you agree to it. 

A judge may allow previously undisclosed issues and propositions of law to be raised in very limited circumstances. 

In most cases, if no agreement is reached by this stage the dispute will go to our Disputes Review Unit for consideration. 

The Disputes Review Unit completes an adjudication report
---------------------------------------------------------

The Disputes Review Unit staff are independent experts within Inland Revenue who'll take a fresh look at the case. They'll consider the following in each of the SOPs:

*   facts
*   evidence
*   legal principles
*   issues raised.

The Disputes Review Unit will reach a decision and send a copy of the adjudication report to you and the Inland Revenue staff member involved.

### Outcome

If the Disputes Review Unit decides in your favour, we will do the following in line with the amounts you proposed and the matter ends there.

*   Issue a new assessment.
*   Make a disputable decision.

If the Disputes Review Unit decides in our favour then your return, or the assessment or disputable decision we made, stands. The Disputes Review Unit will include a Challenge notice in the letter advising of the adjudication report decision.

If you accept this decision, the matter ends there. 

If you do not accept this decision, the process continues. 

Taxation Review Authority or the High Court
-------------------------------------------

You can take your case to the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court. Most people have their case heard before the Taxation Review Authority because it is less formal, usually costs less and is not open to the public. 

You have 2 months to do this from the date of: 

*   the Challenge notice
*   the new assessment based on the adjudication report decision. 

You'll receive information about how to take your case to the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court with the Challenge notice or new assessment.

It's up to you to prove your position in the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court. You must prove: 

*   the assessment or disputable decision is wrong
*   why the assessment or disputable decision is wrong 
*   the amount by which the assessment or disputable decision is wrong. 

However, if we've assessed you for a shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act, we must prove the assessment is correct.

Your responsibilities
---------------------

### Deadlines

We must both meet a series of deadlines throughout the disputes process.

If you do not take the required action within the time limit given, you'll be deemed by law to have accepted our position unless: 

*   exceptional circumstances apply 
*   you have demonstrated you intended to enter into or continue the disputes process. 

Exceptional circumstances are events that are entirely outside the control of you or your agent that could not have been reasonably anticipated. 

### Correspondence

Once you've written any correspondence please send it to us. 

*   Notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA)
*   Rejection of our Notice of response (NOR)
*   Statement of position (SOP)

If you've been in contact with an Inland Revenue staff member about the dispute, send all your correspondence to that person. Otherwise send your correspondence to: 

Inland Revenue  
PO Box 39010  
Wellington Mail Centre  
Lower Hutt 5045

If you have a myIR account, you can send your dispute document to us electronically in one of the following 2 ways:

*   by using the myIR message service where the dispute document must be identified by selecting the Disputes Documents category
*   by using the Upload requested document service and entering the relevant response code, if you have been issued one.

We do not consent to receiving a dispute document by other electronic means, unless this has been specifically agreed with you.

[Apply for a ruling](/apply-for/apply-for-a-ruling "Apply for a ruling")

How to apply for a ruling
=========================

It's important you provide all relevant information, as part of your ruling application, due to the binding nature of private and product rulings. We need to fully understand what's going on, how you consider the tax laws apply, and why you hold that view.

Because private and product rulings are often about complex issues, and submissions need to be made on how the tax laws apply, you should consider using a professional tax advisor to help prepare your application.

Application form
----------------

See the [forms and guides](/apply-for/apply-for-a-ruling/guides-and-forms)
 page for the relevant application form.

You can also email [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b393e2722252c380b22392f652c243d3f652531)
.

* * *

What to include in your application
-----------------------------------

We need all the relevant details and information. If we request further information, this could delay the time to complete the ruling. If you do not give us sufficient information, we may decline to rule. Remember that a ruling will not be binding on Inland Revenue if information has been omitted or misrepresented in some way in the application.

By law, you must include the following in your application:

*   the identity of the person(s) who are applying for the ruling (the applicant(s))
*   all relevant facts and documents
*   the tax laws you want a ruling on (see What we can rule on)
*   the propositions of law (or legal arguments) relevant to the issues raised
*   a draft ruling (see [guides and forms](/apply-for/apply-for-a-ruling/guides-and-forms)
    ).

You also need to tell us:

*   the period(s) or tax year(s) which the application relates to, and
*   details of any ruling application that has been lodged about the arrangement for another period(s) or tax year(s).

If you're an agent or applying on behalf of more than one person, you also need to show that you have the written consent of the applicant(s) to apply on their behalf.

If you're applying for a product ruling, you need to tell us why it isn't practicable to identify the other parties and why the characteristics of the taxpayers who may enter into the arrangement will not affect the content of the ruling. If you are a promoter of the “product” , you also need to provide us with a statutory declaration that you have disclosed all relevant facts, and that the facts are correct.

* * *

Facts and documents
-------------------

You must give details of all the relevant facts and send copies of all documents relevant to the ruling, including:

*   the names of all of the parties to the arrangement (in addition to the applicant(s)), including the counterparties involved in any steps or transactions
*   a detailed description of the transactions and steps involved, including an explanation of what the arrangement is intended to achieve
*   copies of relevant legal documents or draft documents
*   recent financial statements for the applicant(s) (in some applications).

Each different arrangement or fact situation requires a separate application. If you want a binding ruling on any alternatives, you must make separate applications, and show you are "seriously contemplating" each one.

We can ask you for further information at any time during the process. If, after a reasonable period, you do not provide this information, we may decline to make a ruling, and charge you for the time we've already spent on the application. You can decide to go ahead with the ruling at a later date, but you will have to apply again and provide us with the information we requested.

Where the application of the tax laws to the arrangement depends on certain facts being true or certain events occurring, we may decide to include assumptions or conditions in a ruling. The ruling will not be binding on Inland Revenue if you do not satisfy these assumptions or conditions, and we can check whether this is the case after a ruling has been issued.

* * *

Propositions of law (legal arguments)
-------------------------------------

It’s important that your application fully discusses any legal arguments that relate to the issues raised by your application. If you do not provide sufficient analysis, we might ask for further submissions from you, or be required to do additional research, which could add to our fees and the time taken.

For an application for a private or product ruling, relevant propositions of law include:

*   sections of any legislation that are relevant to the application (including any relevant non-tax legislation, eg the Companies Act 1993)
*   legal reasons and appropriate case law that support the interpretation of the section(s) you have adopted
*   possible arguments contrary to the interpretation you are seeking and legal reasons and authoritative support for these
*   other material or relevant matters or sources of information that Inland Revenue should know about.

* * *

Draft ruling
------------

You need to include a draft ruling with your application. This helps us understand exactly what you want the ruling to cover, and focuses our consideration on the key issues.

There is a draft ruling template on our [guides and forms](/apply-for/apply-for-a-ruling/guides-and-forms)

Tax Policy

How we develop tax policy
=========================

How tax policy is developed
---------------------------

Since 1995, tax policy has been developed using the Generic Tax Policy Process. This is a process designed to ensure better, more effective tax policy development through early consideration of all aspects – and likely impacts – of proposals, and increased opportunities for public consultation.

What the policy process is intended to achieve
----------------------------------------------

The process has three main objectives. They are to:

*   encourage early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals, such as their revenue impact, compliance and administrative costs, and economic and social objectives;
*   provide opportunities for substantial external contribution to policy formulation;
*   clarify the responsibilities and accountabilities of participants in the process, particularly those of the Policy and Regulatory Stewardship, and the Treasury.

From broad option to detailed proposal
--------------------------------------

A major reform may pass through the five distinct phases of the policy process, moving from the conceptual to the concrete. The stages are:

*   **Strategic**: which involves the development of an economic strategy, fiscal strategy and three-year revenue strategy. Broad policy proposals may be publicised through channels such as Budget documentation.
*   **Tactical**: which involves the development of a three-year work programme and an annual resource plan to implement the revenue strategy. The process allows the initial scoping and development of broad policy options, and may involve external consultation at this point, often by means of a high-level 'green' paper, or discussion document.
*   **Operational**: which consists of detailed policy design, detailed consultation, and gaining Ministerial and Cabinet approval of recommendations. Again, discussion documents, or 'white' papers in this case, may be used for purposes of consultation. Proposed reforms may be revised in light of the submissions received. This phase culminates in Government approval of practical tax policy initiatives that are ready to be introduced into Parliament and implemented.
*   **Legislative**: in which the detailed policy recommendation is translated into legislation. This occurs in parallel with the operational phases described above, which speeds up the process by ensuring legislation is ready for introduction into Parliament once all policy issues have been resolved. It also ensures the proposed reforms can be expressed clearly in legislation. External consultation takes place through public submissions to the select committee considering the bill.
*   **Implementation and review**: which include the post-implementation review of new legislation, after it has had time to 'bed in', and identification of remedial issues that need correcting for the new legislation to have its intended effect. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage.

Who's responsible for what
--------------------------

The Generic Tax Policy Process does not specify the precise roles to be played by Inland Revenue and the Treasury in developing tax policy. Rather, it allows these roles to be determined in accordance with the comparative advantage of each department.

Inland Revenue is primarily responsible for the detailed design, implementation and review of tax policy – in other words, for the operational, legislative, and implementation and review phases of the process. We do, however, also take part in the strategic and tactical phases of the process, along with the Treasury.

Our role
--------

The Policy and Regulatory Stewardship group within Inland Revenue strengths lies in its ability to strategically manage tax and related social policy issues from identification through to implementation. This involves a variety of activities:

*   Identifying tax and related social policy issues through our links with the rest of Inland Revenue, other government departments and the private sector.
*   Developing detailed policy proposals to deal with those issues, and planning how the proposed reforms will be managed through to implementation and review.
*   Managing the process of consultation.
*   Managing the process of obtaining Ministerial and Cabinet approval of the proposed reforms.
*   Drafting legislation to give effect to them, and managing the passage of legislation from introduction into Parliament through to enactment.
*   Reviewing the effectiveness of the reform after it is implemented.

The policy result
-----------------

The Generic Tax Policy Process means that major tax initiatives are subject to public scrutiny at all stages of their development. As a result, we have the opportunity to develop more practical options for reform by drawing on information provided by the private sector and the people who will be affected. The process also gives us greater opportunity to explain to interested parties the rationale underlying proposed reforms, thus improving their long-term sustainability.
HYBRIDS COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE 1 As with all other provisions of the law, self-assessment requires taxpayers to determine their taxable income considering the potential application of the hybrid provisions. The following table should assist taxpayers to determine whether or not they are likely to need to consider the application of the hybrid provisions. The table also contains a reference to the relevant section, and some comments to assist in determining whether or not the section will in fact give rise to denial of a deduction or additional income. The last column identifies which item in the BEPS disclosure form the taxpayer should tick if the relevant section does in fact apply to them. Like the rest of this commentary, these questions do not replace the law, and cannot be relied on to identify every hybrid mismatch situation. Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 1. Are you claiming a deduction under a financial instrument for a payment to a related non-resident, where either: the payment was not taxable income for the non-resident in another country in an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the income year in which you are claiming a deduction; or you do not know whether (or when) the payment was taxable income in another country. FH 3 – deductions on hybrid financial instrument rules Any time you claim a deduction under a financial instrument (generally this will be a loan, derivative, or other financial arrangement, but for this purpose the definition is slightly broader) where the payee is non-resident and related to you, you should check the foreign tax treatment of the payment. Is the related party including the payment in its taxable income as interest, or as income taxable at the same rate as interest? If it is, is that inclusion expected to occur in an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the income year in which you are claiming a deduction for the payment? If the answer to either question is no, you need to consider sections FH 3 of the hybrid rules before claiming a deduction. The definitions of “financial instrument” and “related” are in section FH 15. Hybrid payment disclosure 1 This text and table were published in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 31, No 3 (April 2019) and reproduced for the special report on hybrid and branch mismatch rules (see https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2019-sr-beps-final/overview). Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 2. Do you hold shares in a foreign company where you have treated the dividend on those shares as exempt income, and either: the payment was deductible to the payer in another country, or otherwise gave rise to some form of tax relief; or you do not know how the payment was treated by the payer. CW 9(3) – deductible dividends A dividend from a foreign country is not exempt from tax under section CW 9(1) if the payment is deductible to the payer or otherwise meets the definition of a “deductible foreign equity distribution” in section YA 1. Hybrid receipt disclosure 3. Have you received a payment under a financial instrument with a non-resident related person where either: that person is entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief for payments under the arrangement in tax periods that end more than two years before the beginning of the income year in which you expect to recognise the income from those payments; or that person is entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief for payments under the arrangement which will not be included in your income you do not know whether or not that is the case. FH 4 –income on hybrid financial instruments rule If a non-resident is entitled to a deduction (or equivalent tax relief) for a payment to a New Zealand related party in relation to a financial instrument in a tax period ending more than 24 months before the beginning of the income year in you treat the payment is treated as income in New Zealand, or you do not treat the payment as income at all, you must recognise the income at the same time it is deducted by the payer, under section FH 4. Hybrid receipt disclosure Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 4. Are you claiming a deduction for a payment to a non-resident member of your control group where any of the following applies: A.under a foreign tax law, the payment is not taxed because you and the payee are treated as the same person; B.the payee is treated as transparent by the tax law of the country where it is formed; or C.the payee is not taxable on the income because it is treated by the payee as received in a country where the payee is not resident. D.you do not know the answer to any of questions A to C. FH 5 hybrid entities primary and FH 7 reverse hybrids Any time you make a payment to a non-resident member of your control group, you need to consider whether or not the payee is treating you as a separate entity for purposes of its tax law. For example, it may not be treating you as a separate entity if you and the payee are members of the same consolidated group in that country. If it is not treating you as a separate entity, you need to consider section FH 5 before deducting any expenditure you have incurred. You also need to consider whether the payee is not taxed on the amount because: it is fiscally transparent in the country where it is formed or operates; or one country (generally the country where the payee is tax resident) exempts the income because it is treated as referable to activities in a third country, but the third country does not tax the income because it does not treat it as referable to such activities. In these two cases, you need to consider section FH 7 before deducting any expenditure you have incurred. “Control group” is defined in section FH 15. A & D Hybrid entity/Branch/D ual resident disclosure and Hybrid payment disclosure B-D. Hybrid payment disclosure 5. Are you a branch of a non-resident, and claiming a deduction in relation to activities occurring outside New Zealand (“head office activities”)? FH 5 branches primary If you are entitled to a deduction in New Zealand for amounts reflecting activities occurring outside New Zealand, and those amounts are more than an allocation of third party costs (eg they reflect a profit margin for the offshore activity), you need to consider section FH 5 of the Act before taking a deduction for those amounts. Generally, section FH 5 denies a deduction if the same profit margin is not income in the other country. Hybrid entity /Branch/Dual resident disclosure and Hybrid Payment disclosure Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 6. Are you a member of a tax consolidated group who has received a payment from another member of the group that relates to the offshore activities of the payer. FH 6 hybrid entities defensive If yes, has the payer claimed a deduction in the other country for that payment? If yes, you are likely to be required by section FH 6 of the hybrid rules to include the payment in income. If the other country has hybrid rules, it should deny a deduction for the payment, so section FH 6 will not apply. Hybrid receipt disclosure 7. Do you have a foreign branch which is entitled under the tax law where it operates to a deduction for activities carried on by you in New Zealand. FH 6 branches defensive If yes, is the deduction in the other country more than an allocation of your New Zealand costs (ie it reflects a profit margin for New Zealand)? If yes, you need to consider whether section FH 6 requires you to include the additional amount deducted in your New Zealand income (if you are not already doing so). If the other country has hybrid rules that apply to the payment, it should deny a deduction for any mismatch amount, so section FH 6 will not apply. Hybrid receipt disclosure 8. Do you have a foreign branch, or an interest in an entity in another country which is related to you and which you treat as fiscally transparent for New Zealand tax (for example a foreign partnership). FH 8 – double deduction primary rule If the answer is yes, you need to determine whether there is another person in that country who for foreign tax purposes is able to offset your share of any branch or entity loss against its income. If there is, you need to consider whether section FH 8 denies you a deduction for the expenditure incurred through the branch or by the entity. Double deduction disclosure Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 9. Are you a branch of a non-resident, or is there a non-resident entity in your control group: who is treated under a foreign tax law as paying a pro rata portion of the amounts paid by you? whose foreign tax law treatment of your expenditure you are not aware of? FH 9 – double deduction defensive rule If you are a non-resident who is entitled to a tax deduction in New Zealand for some of your expenditure, that expenditure may be deductible in two (or more) countries. Similarly if you are a resident who is fiscally transparent under the tax law applying to any of your owners. If the other country does not have a hybrid rule that denies a deduction in the other country (that is, a rule equivalent to section FH 8) you need to consider section FH 9 before deducting any expenditure you have incurred Hybrid entity /Branch/Dual resident disclosure and Double deduction disclosure 10. Are you a dual resident company? FH 10 If yes, as well as not being able to group any loss with the income of another company (section IC 7(2)), you need to consider section FH 10 of the hybrid rules before deducting any expenditure you have incurred. Note that dual residence can arise very easily and can be unintended. For example, a company that is incorporated in New Zealand and managed and controlled in another country may be dual resident. Hybrid entity /Branch/Dual resident disclosure 11. Are you claiming a deduction for a payment to a member of your control group in a country without hybrid rules? FH 11 If yes, is that payment part of an arrangement or flow of funds that involves a hybrid mismatch within your control group. The payment will be part of such an arrangement or flow of funds for these purposes if it funds, directly or indirectly, a hybrid mismatch within your control group. There is no need for any connection between the payment and the hybrid mismatch. You need to take into account all information within your possession in making this determination. Where the deduction is material, you should make enquiry of your group tax function as to whether the payment is part of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. If there is not a clear “no”, given on the basis of reasonable enquiry, then no deduction should be claimed. Imported mismatch disclosure Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 12. Are you claiming a deduction for a payment under an arrangement, other than those identified above, where there are any indications that the arrangement has been undertaken on the basis that it will produce a deduction/no inclusion outcome that would give rise to counteraction under the hybrid rules if the arrangement were entered into with a related party or a control group member. FH 3 – FH 7 and FH 11 Taxpayers are expected to consider all information within their knowledge and control in order to determine whether a payment is made under a structured arrangement as defined in section FH 15. If you are making a payment under a structured arrangement, you need to consider the possible application to payments under that arrangement of all of sections FH 3 to FH 7 and FH 11 of the hybrid rules. As applicable, depending on the nature of the mismatch. For more information refer to Administration of the imported mismatch rule - section FH 11 - ird.govt.nz/os-21-02

[All Student loans dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Student loans])

If you're outside of New Zealand for around 5 out of 6 months, you might become overseas-based and your student loan will stop being interest free. Your loan repayments will be based on the size of your loan balance and your loan could start getting bigger. 

Working out when you become overseas-based
------------------------------------------

Becoming overseas-based depends on how long you're away for.

### The 32 day rule

It is possible to be overseas for an extended time and still be a New Zealand based borrower.

If you are present in New Zealand for 32 days or more in a 184-day period, you are a New Zealand based borrower and we will not charge you interest

The 32-day rule is law. If you are in New Zealand 31 days or less you are overseas based.

This means:

*   the 32 days in New Zealand can be at any point during the 184 days , including at the end.
*   the 32 days do not need to be in a row, they can be made up of multiple visits to New Zealand during the 184 days.
*   you cannot be overseas for more than 152 days in a row at any one time.

If you become overseas-based, your student loan will no longer be interest-free from the day after you left New Zealand.

If you leave New Zealand for more than 325 days, you may also become a non-resident taxpayer.

[Tax residency status for individuals](/international-tax/individuals/tax-residency-status-for-individuals)

### Travel details in myIR

The 'Travelling overseas' section in myIR makes it easier to keep track of how long you're away from New Zealand and calculate when interest is charged. You'll find this section under the 'I want to...' menu in your student loan account.

You can also check the dates you travel to or from New Zealand. This only shows the date you travelled into or out of the country and does not include information about where you travelled.

[Log in to myIR](https://myir.ird.govt.nz/_/)

Your repayments will be based on your student loan balance
----------------------------------------------------------

Your student loan repayments are based on your loan balance when you become overseas-based, not your total income. However, there are some countries where we still treat you as being New Zealand-based.

[Living overseas with a student loan](/student-loans/living-overseas-with-a-student-loan)

Add a nominated person or alternative contact person to your account
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It's a good idea to set up a nominated person to help you keep up-to-date with your loan while you're overseas, but you do not have to. Depending on the permissions you grant them, your nominated person will be able to view and make updates to your student loan, and any other, account.

[Nominated person](/managing-my-tax/getting-someone-to-act-on-my-behalf/nominated-person)
 

You can add an alternative contact person to your student loan account in myIR. If in any situation we cannot contact you, we'll contact your alternative contact person to let them know we want to talk to you about your student loan. They will not be able to view or update your student loan, or any other, account in myIR (unlike a nominated person).

You'll need to add an alternative contact person to your student loan account if you apply for a temporary repayment suspension.

[All Student loans dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Student loans])

If you're living, studying or working in New Zealand long-term, you're considered New Zealand-based. This means you're entitled to an interest-free student loan and your loan repayments are based on your income.

Working out when you become New Zealand-based
---------------------------------------------

When you return to New Zealand, after 183 days, you'll:

*   become New Zealand-based if you're back in New Zealand for at least 152 of those 183 days
*   remain overseas-based if you're out of New Zealand for at least 32 of those 183 days.

If you're back for more than 152 days, but less than 183 days before leaving again, you may still be considered overseas-based. Contact us so we can discuss your situation.

If you become New Zealand-based, your student loan will be interest-free from the day you arrived back in New Zealand.

### Travel details in myIR

The 'Travelling overseas' section in myIR makes it easier to keep track of how long you're away from New Zealand and calculate when interest is charged. You'll find this section under the 'I want to...' menu in your student loan account. 

You can also check the dates you travel to or from New Zealand. This only shows the date you travelled into or out of the country and does not include information about where you travelled.

[Log in to myIR](https://myir.ird.govt.nz)

Your repayments will be based on how much you earn each year
------------------------------------------------------------

Your student loan repayments are based on your yearly income (before tax) when you become New Zealand-based.

Example: Jane returns to New Zealand 
------------------------------------- 

Day 1: Arrives in New Zealand 
------------------------------

**23 July**

Jane arrives back in New Zealand, having lived in London for the past few years. The day they return begins the day count.

Day 2 - day 151: Settles back into New Zealand
----------------------------------------------

**24 July to 20 December**

Jane settles back into life in New Zealand and starts a new job. Because they have a student loan, Jane makes sure to use the M SL tax code.

Day 152: Departs New Zealand
----------------------------

**21 December**

Over the Christmas break, Jane spends 3 weeks catching up with friends in Fiji.

Day 173: Returns to New Zealand
-------------------------------

**11 January**

Jane comes back to New Zealand after catching up with friends in Fiji.

Day 183: Jane is now considered New Zealand-based
-------------------------------------------------

 **21 January**

It has now been 183 days since Jane arrived back in New Zealand. They have been out of New Zealand for 20 of those days.

Jane is considered New Zealand-based. 

Any interest charged on their student loan from the day they first returned to New Zealand, 23 July, is written off.

Kua tonoa au ki te whakaoti i tētahi puka tāke takitahi (IR3) I've been asked to complete an individual tax return - IR3
========================================================================================================================

The [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
 is from 1 April to 31 March. After the end of the tax year, we work out if you either:

*   paid the right amount of tax
*   have a refund
*   have more tax to pay.

To do this, we use the information we have about your income and tax types. We'll know about any taxed income you received during the year, such as salary or wages.

[My income is taxed before I get paid](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/how-income-is-taxed/my-income-is-taxed-before-i-get-paid)

What you'll need to provide are amounts and sources of untaxed income like:

*   self-employment
*   overseas
*   rental property including Airbnb and Bookabach
*   'under the table' cash jobs
*   an estate, trust or partnership.

[My income is not taxed before I get paid](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/how-income-is-taxed/my-income-is-not-taxed-before-i-get-paid)

Reasons for completing an individual tax return - IR3
-----------------------------------------------------

Some of the common reasons we ask customers to complete an individual tax return (IR3) are because they:

*   received untaxed income in the previous tax year
*   received income as a shareholder in a company, or as a beneficiary of a trust in the previous tax year
*   received interest or dividends from a partnership, look-through company, trust or estate
*   have overdue tax returns
*   are registered for GST - unless they're an IR56 taxpayer
*   are registered as an employer - unless they're an IR56 taxpayer, or their only employee is a nanny or private domestic worker, or they got individualised funding for payments to a disabled person or Ministry of Health funded family care
*   use the Accounting Income Method (AIM) to work out their provisional tax
*   have a non-standard [balance date](/api/glossary/item?id={28AACCE7-DC17-4ED8-B93C-9BEEFB29DA97})
    .

If any of these situations apply to you, you'll need to give us more information by filing an IR3.

[Complete my individual income tax return - IR3](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-tax-year/individual-income-tax-return---ir3/complete-my-individual-income-tax-return---ir3)

If none of these apply to you, or you do not think you need to complete an IR3, contact us to discuss your situation.

[Income tax - contact us](/contactus/income-tax)

Changing income types
---------------------

You need to let us know when you've got a new type of income or when you've stopped getting an existing type.

The easiest way to do this is through myIR but you can also call us.

[Income tax - contact us](/contactus/income-tax)

I've told you about changes to my income types. Do I still need to complete an IR3?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Even if you stop getting an income type during the tax year you still need to complete an IR3 at the end of that tax year.

For example, if you were earning self-employed income and decided part way through the year to work for a company and receive regular salary or wage income, we'll still need you to file an IR3 to ensure you've declared all your income from when you were self-employed.

Te tuakiri me te āhei Identity and access
=========================================

Identity management and privacy concerns are important to us. Our gateway services are accessed over the internet, and access is controlled through security applied with authentication and authorisation mechanisms to keep our systems and customer information safe.

### Our services are restricted

Digital service providers wanting to integrate with us need to go through an approval process. 

Identity and access services 
-----------------------------

We provide 3 types of identity and access services to use with gateway services:

*   OAuth authentication
*   Machine-to-Machine authentication (M2M)
*   SH authentication.

For access to myIR File Upload and Gateway Services detailed technical documentation, register your organisation or login to Gateway Customer Support Portal using the links below.

### OAuth authentication

This authentication service is a token auth implementation using OAuth 2.0 for both cloud and native (desktop) client applications. 

### Machine-to-Machine (M2M) authentication

This authentication service utilises a client signed JSON Web Token (JWT) and is only available for service providers integrating through cloud service.

The service is available to use from **April 2020 (R4 Release)** for certain API services only. 

### SSH authentication

This authentication service is only available for service providers integrating to secure FTP file transfer services. 

How identity and access works
-----------------------------

We provide mechanisms for authentication and authorisation for both the end user and organisation entity types. Our security protocols include transport layer encryption, digital certificates, and access tokens.

The end user authentication and authorisation mechanism is token authorisation (OAuth 2.0). Both cloud or native (desktop) application options are enforced for client applications and authenticate end users using their myIR user ID and password to grant the application access to their Inland Revenue information.

The organisational authentication and authorisation mechanisms include:

*   Machine 2 Machine (M2M)
*   SSH Keys.

The M2M mechanism uses a client signed JSON Web Token (JWT) to sign messages, which lets us identify the service provider or a customer of a service provider.

Secure FTP file transfer services require a service provider to supply their public PGP key for file encryption. We supply our public SSH key in order to gain access to the service provider FTP server.

Find out more about security measures:

[Security measures for gateway services](/digital-service-providers/guides-and-docs/gws-architecture/security-measures)

Security protocols
------------------

The following security protocols apply when using our gateway services:

| Aspect | Standard/ protocol | Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transport layer encryption | TLS | 1.2 |
| Digital certificates for mutual authentication | X.509 | RFC 5280 profile |
| Access tokens | OAuth | 2.0 |

Transport level security
------------------------

At a network level, access to our services is restricted to approved providers. This includes access to our test environments.

For integration through a cloud end point:

*   A TLS mutual authentication using the TLS 1.2 specification is applied across all gateway services in PROD and QUAL environments. This is not applicable for desktop client applications.
*   In the mock services environment, TLS mutual authentication is not used but IP address white listing is applied.

TLS connection requirements:

| Cloud providers | Desktop providers |
| --- | --- |
| Incoming connections are identified using client side X509 certificates. | Desktop providers must connect through one-way TLS. |
| The client side X509 certificates must be from a certificate of authority and cannot be self-signed. | No client side X509 certificates required. |

\[Interpretation guideline issued by Adjudication & Rulings on 14/10/03, previously released as exposure draft IG0007\] NON-RESIDENT SOFTWARE SUPPLIERS’ PAYMENTS DERIVED FROM NEW ZEALAND—INCOME TAX TREATMENT Introduction The income tax treatment of computer software transactions is important in view of the rapid development of computer software technology (including the means by which it is transferred) in recent years, the increase in the importation of such technology into New Zealand, and the international trend towards more consistent tax treatment. This Interpretation Guideline deals with the income tax treatment, under New Zealand domestic law and double tax agreements, of payments derived from New Zealand by non-resident suppliers of computer software. It considers the tax implications, for non-resident suppliers, of the most common types of computer software transactions. In particular, the following transactions are discussed: 1. a sale of the copyright in a computer program 2. a licence of a copyright right in a computer program 3. a sale of a copy of a computer program subject to copyright 4. a lease of a copy of a computer program 5. a supply of services for the development or modification of a computer program 6. the supply of know-how relating to a computer program. The Guideline addresses the following income tax issues: • The proper character, for income tax purposes, of payments made to non-residents for supplies of computer programs – in particular, whether the payments are royalties, business or rental income, for services, or non-taxable receipts; and • The possible income tax treatments for each payment type under domestic law (including non-resident withholding tax) and double taxation agreements. This Guideline takes account of the international trend toward conformity in the tax treatment of computer software transactions. The conclusions reached in this Guideline are consistent with the conclusions of the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, Model Tax Conventions: Four Related Studies, Issues in International Taxation No. 4 (1992 OECD Report) which have now been adopted in the Commentary to Article 12 (Royalties) of the OECD Model Tax Convention. In addition, the conclusions reached in this Guideline are also consistent with the regulations issued by the United States Internal Revenue Service, \[Treasury Regulation §1.861-18 Classification of transactions involving computer programs\]. These regulations were reviewed because of the fact that the United States is more advanced than any other single jurisdiction in considering the legal ramifications of 1 computer related transactions. The approach adopted by the Internal Revenue Service is, in many respects, similar to that adopted in this Guideline. Due to this similarity, a series of illustrative examples has been included based on examples included by the Internal Revenue Service in its regulations. This Guideline supersedes the item relating to payments for the use of computer software contained in Public Information Bulletin 168 (published in January 1988 and subsequently withdrawn in Taxation Information Bulletin, Vol 10, No 7, July 1998) and applies to transactions occurring on or after the date of publication. This Guideline applies equally to related and unrelated parties where the parties are dealing on arm’s length terms and no avoidance issues arise. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Legislation The legislative provisions relevant to the supply of computer software by a non- resident include: • Section CD 2, which provides that the gross income of any person includes all royalties. • The definition of the term “royalty” in section OB 1, which includes: a payment of any kind, whether periodical or not and however described or computed, to the extent to which it is derived as consideration for— (a) The use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right: (b) ... (c) ... (d) ... (e) The supply of scientific, technical, industrial, or commercial knowledge or information: (f) The supply of any assistance which is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of anything referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (e): (g) ... whether or not that payment is an instalment of the purchase price of any real or personal property: • Section NG 2, which imposes non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on every person who derives non-resident withholding income. Such income includes royalties derived from New Zealand by a non-resident. NRWT is imposed at the rate of 15 percent on such royalties. However, this rate may be modified to a rate of 10 percent by a double taxation agreement. • Section OE 4(1), which sets out the classes of income deemed to be derived from New Zealand, and includes: (a) Income derived from any business wholly or partly carried on in New Zealand: (b) Income derived from any business carried on out of New Zealand to the extent that that income consists of \[certain classes of income, including royalties\]: ... 2 (l) Income derived from the sale or other disposition of any property, corporeal or incorporeal, situated in New Zealand: ... (q) Income derived from contracts made or wholly or partly performed in New Zealand: (r) Royalties ... : (s) Payments of any kind to the extent to which they are paid as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, in New Zealand, any personal property, ... : • Double taxation agreements (DTAs) that reduce New Zealand tax on certain New Zealand-sourced income derived by a non-resident. The relief available depends on the non-resident’s country of residence and the nature of the income derived from New Zealand. In this Guideline the following two principal types of income, covered in DTAs, are discussed: • Business profits Business profits (or income) from the sale of goods or services, with a New Zealand source, are not normally taxed in New Zealand if relief exists under a relevant DTA, unless the non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand (as defined in the applicable DTA) and the particular business profit is attributable to the permanent establishment. • Royalties Each DTA has a royalty article that defines the term “royalty”. Generally, the article limits the New Zealand income tax rate on royalty income derived by a non-resident. Terminology for computer software The term “computer program” is not defined in the Income Tax Act 1994 or any of New Zealand’s DTAs. For the purposes of this Guideline “computer program” means: encoded instructions that cause a computer to perform a particular task or produce a particular result. The term “computer software” is used in this Guideline to encompass both the singular and plural of “computer program”. To be consistent with the terminology of the computer industry, the word “program” will be spelt the American way throughout this Guideline. Software transaction categories The tax treatment of any computer software transaction depends on the terms of the particular agreement between the parties, having regard to all the circumstances of the case. Computer software transactions can generally be classified into two types – those relating to the copyright rights in the computer program and those relating to copies of the program protected by copyright. Functionally, the two types of transaction relate to the use of copyright and the use of a copy of the program respectively. 3 In most situations it will be clear whether the transaction relates to aspects of copyright or to the use of a copy of the program. However, there are situations where the true character of the transaction is difficult to determine. For example, some pre- packaged software products include “licensing” agreements that make it difficult to decide whether the transaction is dealing with copyright, or the sale of a product subject to copyright. From a tax perspective the answer is important, as consideration received from a transaction involving use of, or right to use, a copyright is a royalty, whereas consideration received from a transaction involving the use of, or the right to use, a computer program is not. Software copyright protection The Copyright Act 1994 provides software with copyright protection by specifying that computer programs are treated as literary works (see the definition of “literary work” in section 2 of that Act). The protection given by copyright law is a principal source of value of a computer program to the owner of the copyright. Under the Copyright Act, copyright is a property right that exists, in accordance with the Act, in original works including literary works (section 14). The copyright owner is given exclusive rights to do acts that have the copyright protection (section 16). Accordingly, where a copy of a book is purchased, subject to copyright protection, the buyer is bound to comply with the restrictions inherent in copyright protection. Copyright is concerned with the negative right of preventing the unauthorised copying of physical material. In providing copyright protection, the distinction between transactions involving copyright and transactions involving works subject to copyright is recognised. This distinction applies to all literary works protected by copyright and, for present purposes, is relevant when considering the nature of transactions involving computer programs. Copyright rights The Copyright Act 1994 sets out certain “restricted acts” that infringe copyright. The Copyright Act makes it clear that the owner of the copyright has the exclusive right to do any of the listed restricted actions. The inclusion of a computer program as a “literary work”, under copyright law, assists in developing the proper tax treatment of software. In terms of copyright law, a computer program is treated like any other copyrighted product; for example a book, video or sound recording. When copyrighted products, such as books or recordings, are acquired from non- resident suppliers for personal use or for use within the purchaser’s business, the transaction generates business profits. It is also generally agreed internationally that the sale of a book, video cassette, or compact disc for personal or business use does not generate royalties. However, if the transferee acquires the right to exploit the underlying copyright in the product, as when a publisher acquires the right to print a 4 book, then the transaction generates royalties. The critical difference in this latter transaction is that, in commercial terms, the transaction concerns the use of copyright. Internationally, there is a trend to align the treatment of computer software to that of other copyrighted products. In the 1992 OECD Report, the OECD concluded, when interpreting Article 12 of the Model Convention (the Royalties article), in relation to software that: Payments made in connection with software represent royalties within the meaning of Article 12 only in circumstances where there is a limited grant of rights (not amounting to a change in ownership) for the commercial development or exploitation of the software. Payments for software, whether “bundled” or not, which is acquired for the personal or business use of the purchaser do not represent royalties. This view as to the proper application of the royalty article in relation to software is consistent with the view taken in the Guideline. While the OECD view is not binding domestically in New Zealand, it is still relevant in relation to the view adopted in the Guideline as in all material respects the domestic law definition, as it applies to software, is not different to the various definitions used in New Zealand’s DTAs. For the purposes of this Guideline, the distinction between acquiring a program for personal or business use and acquiring it for commercial exploitation through the use of one or more of the copyright rights will be an essential determinant in identifying the category in to which a transaction falls. In circumstances where a supplier grants a customer the ability to exploit the supplier’s copyright rights in a program, the transaction will be a copyright right transaction. Where a customer is not granted the ability to exploit the copyright rights in the program, but merely acquires the right to use a copy of the program for personal or business use, the transaction will be a copyrighted article transaction. The distinction will be most relevant in circumstances such as where there is a grant of a restricted copyright right. In those circumstances a consideration of whether an ability to exploit the copyright in the program has been granted will enable a determination of whether the transaction is actually a copyright right transaction or the supply of an article subject to copyright. Obviously where there is the grant of an unrestricted copyright right in the program, there will have been the grant of the ability to exploit the copyright and the transaction will be a copyright right transaction. For the purposes of this Guideline, the following rights of the copyright owner are the most relevant in the context of computer programs: • the right to copy the program; • the right to issue copies of the program to the public, whether by sale or otherwise; and • the right to adapt the program. Nature and tax treatment of receipts For income tax purposes the critical issue, in respect of any computer software transaction, is determining what is in fact transferred. In this part of the Guideline the 5 most common types of computer software transactions are examined and some of the possible tax implications are discussed under the following headings: 1. Sale of a copyright right in a computer program. 2. Licence of a copyright right in a computer program. 3. Sale of a copy of a computer program (also referred to in this Guideline as a “copyrighted article”). 4. Lease of a copy of a computer program. 5. Supply of services for the development or modification of a computer program. 6. Supply of know-how relating to a computer program. 1. Sale of copyright rights Copyright, like any asset, can be disposed of for value by the owner. A sale or assignment of copyright results in the ownership of the copyright rights being alienated either permanently or for a limited period. This alienation of the ownership of the rights means that the consideration derived is not for “the use of the rights” and therefore is not treated as a royalty. This view accords with that of the High Court in DB Group Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,446, which confirmed that a payment for the outright sale of copyright rights does not fall within the definition of royalty in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. In this situation the purchaser has bought the rights to the copyright as distinct from the “right to use” the copyright. (See also the Court of Appeal decision in The Trustees of the CB Simkin Trust v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,117, for a discussion on the distinction between the right to intellectual property and the right to use intellectual property.) Tax implications The tax implications of any particular transaction will depend upon the facts of that transaction. However, as it is not a royalty for the purposes of section CD 2, the consideration derived by a non-resident supplier from a sale or assignment of copyright rights in a computer program will generally be a non-taxable receipt, unless the income is otherwise deemed to be derived from New Zealand under section OE 4(1). The most likely situation where this will occur is where the non-resident supplier is carrying on a business in New Zealand which includes supplying such copyright rights. If the supplier is in such a business, the payment will be business income of the supplier. However, any New Zealand tax implications may be mitigated by the application of a relevant DTA. For example, in the case of a non-resident supplier who is carrying on a business in New Zealand which includes supplying copyright rights, if the supplier is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, any business income will generally not be taxable in New Zealand under the business profits article of the applicable DTA, provided the supplier does not have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. 2. Licence of a copyright right 6 If a computer software transaction involves the transfer of some but not all the substantial rights in the copyright (i.e. a transfer of partial rights) to a New Zealand recipient, it will generally be a licence. A licence “provides an excuse for an act which would otherwise be unlawful as, for example, ... the infringement of a copyright. It is an authority to do something which would otherwise be wrongful, illegal or inoperative” (per Latham CJ in FCT v United Aircraft Corporation \[1943\] 2 AITR 458, at 464). For the purposes of this Guideline, in a licence transaction a transfer of partial rights is granted by the holder of the respective rights to the licensee. This may be compared to an alienation of a portion of the ownership of the copyright rights which would be treated as a sale or an assignment. A licence to use software copyright generates royalty income under paragraph (a) of the royalty definition in section OB 1 \[consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright\]. Under a normal licensing agreement, the licensee has the right to use the copyright in the program (as distinct from simply using a copy of the computer program which is subject to copyright protection). Usually this right is used to make copies of the computer program for the purpose of public distribution. For the purposes of this Guideline such licences are referred to as “reproduction licences”. Tax implications – non-resident withholding tax As stated above, the tax implications of any particular transaction will depend upon the facts of that transaction. However, non-residents are liable to New Zealand income tax on royalties derived from New Zealand. Under section OE 4(1)(r) royalties are deemed to be derived from New Zealand if they are: • paid by a person who is resident in New Zealand and not paid in respect of a business carried on by the person outside New Zealand through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand; or • paid by a person who is not resident in New Zealand and are allowed as a deduction to the person for the purposes of tax in New Zealand. Such royalties, derived from New Zealand by a non-resident, are deemed to be non-resident withholding income by section NG 1(2)(a) and are liable to NRWT at a rate of 15 percent on the gross payments (section NG 2(1)(c)). This rate is generally reduced to 10 percent if the non-resident recipient is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA. A person paying royalties to a non-resident is required, at the time of making the payment, to deduct the NRWT from the amount of the royalty (section NG 8) and pay the amount of the deduction to the Commissioner. In the case of copyright royalties, NRWT is a final tax. No separate income tax liability is imposed under an annual assessment (see section NG 3(1)(b)). 3. Sale of a copyrighted article 7 A supply of a copyrighted program (i.e. a copy of a computer program subject to copyright) generally does not include a supply of copyright. The copyright remains with the owner of the original work. The supply of a copyrighted program essentially gives the recipient the right to use the program for personal or business use. This right is separate from a right to use the copyright for commercial exploitation. Generally the program is supplied in perpetuity, and usually the only condition is that the purchaser complies with the copyright protection. The sale of a copy of a computer program is analogous to the sale of other copyrighted works such as books and video tapes. When a copy of a literary work in which intellectual property such as copyright resides is sold, it is clear that the sale of the article does not affect the intellectual property in it; the ownership of the article is distinct from the ownership of the intellectual property. For example, when a copy of a book is purchased, the purchaser does not also acquire copyright rights. This Guideline takes a similar approach to the sale of copies of computer programs when there is no accompanying transfer of any copyright rights. An important distinction is therefore drawn between the use of the copyright in a computer program (discussed above) and the use of a copy of the computer program subject to copyright. The fact that there may be copyright restrictions on the nature of the use to which the program may be put by the recipient (for example, not to make and sell copies) is not relevant. Such restrictions do not affect the character of the transaction as a sale, in the same way as similar restrictions do not affect the treatment of a sale of a copy of a book. End-user licences Many software transactions involve some form of end-user licence or user agreement. One common example of this is what is often referred to as a “shrink-wrap” licence. Shrink-wrap licences are generally issued for mass produced software, where the software is sold to an end-user via a distributor. In those circumstances, there is little scope for the software author, or copyright owner, to insist that end-users sign a licence agreement prior to them acquiring the software. The copyright owner’s response to this has been to develop the use of “tear-me-open” or “shrink-wrap” licences. The volume of programs produced makes it physically and commercially impractical for the copyright owner and the ultimate purchaser to deal directly with each other. The copyright owner attempts to bind the ultimate purchaser to the terms of a software licence by stipulating that if the purchaser undertakes a specified act, such as opening the cellophane wrapper which covers the box which encloses the software, or uses the program for the first time then the terms of the licence are accepted. A shrink-wrap licence is a specialised form of end-user licence, which is only used when the copyright owner and the end-user do not deal directly with each other. In other software supply contracts, the copyright owner is in a direct contractual relationship with the ultimate purchaser and a software licence is also issued to protect the owner’s copyright interests. Usually these licences are restrictive in nature 8 and allow the purchaser to use the program on only one computer at a time. Other restrictions may exist that prohibit renting or leasing the program. In most situations, these restrictions are intended to protect the copyright interest in the program. Prior to explicit recognition of computer programs as “literary works” in the Copyright Act 1994, copyright owners were compelled to ensure their rights were fully protected. The main function of an end-user licence is to provide the owner with protection against piracy and unauthorised exploitation of its copyright. The existence of a “licensing” agreement suggests that an end-user licence transaction involves some kind of “a right to use”, but, on further examination, a different conclusion may be drawn. In Buckley & Young v CIR (1978) NZTC 61,271 the Court of Appeal set out the relevant steps to take in deciding the character of payments made and benefits provided in a transaction. The Court considered that the starting point in any examination of a transaction is the documentation embodying the transaction. However, the Court continued: Analysis of the documentation may not determine the true character of the payments made. Indeed, the contract may be silent or equivocal as to the quality which ought to be attributed to the payment in question. In that situation evidence of surrounding circumstances may be of particular significance in determining what the contractual expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view. The critical issue with a computer software transaction that includes any form of end- user licence, is determining what the contract between the parties is trying to achieve from a practical and business perspective. Is the consideration paid for the copy of the copyrighted program or for a licence to use the copyright? The correct answer emerges when one examines, from a commercial perspective, the purpose of an end-user licence. A reproduction licence gives the licensee the valuable right to exploit the software copyright by reproducing the software for external distribution. An end-user licence does not. Generally the terms of an end-user licence, such as a shrink-wrap licence, are an assertion of the rights of the copyright owner. Rather than allowing exploitation of the copyright, the terms make it clear that such exploitation is prohibited. The licence in such situations generally provides that: (a) The user acquires a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence which authorises the licensee to use the software, and (b) The licensee is permitted to make back-up copies of the software for operational and security purposes. The purpose of the licence is to contractually restrict the purchaser from exploiting any of the rights protected by the copyright. The licence is not for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright (as in the case of a reproduction licence), but to prohibit use of the copyright. The licence is a vehicle to further assert the copyright owner’s rights. There is no transfer of the copyright. From a practical and business 9 perspective, the contract between the parties is for the provision of a copy of a copyrighted article. This approach to pre-packaged or shrink-wrap software is consistent with the 1992 OECD Report that considered that the “purchaser has done no more than purchase a product”. Further, the OECD did not consider it relevant that the product was protected by copyright and that there were restrictions on the use to which it could be put by the purchaser. Accordingly, any transaction involving end-user licences of the nature described above, should be treated as a sale of a copyrighted article. On the basis of this view, if computer software is supplied for personal or business use, the purchaser is generally buying a copy of the computer program. Provided there has been no transfer of accompanying copyright rights and the copy has not been transferred for a finite period (and therefore is not hired), the transaction is properly characterised as a sale of a copyrighted article. The accompanying licence is for the purpose of providing further protection to the owner of the copyright. The purchaser is not paying for the right to use the copyright, and accordingly there is no royalty derived by the non-resident. Tax implications Once again it is important to note that the tax implications of any particular transaction will depend upon the facts of that transaction. However, the payments will not be a “royalty” for the purposes of section CD 2. Payments derived from sales of computer programs may be treated as business income of the non-resident supplier from the sale of trading stock where the supplier carries on business in New Zealand. If the supplier is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, such business income will generally not be taxable in New Zealand under the business profits article of the applicable DTA, unless the non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. If the payments received by the non-resident supplier are not deemed to be derived from New Zealand under any of the source rules in section OE 4(1), then the payments will be non-taxable receipts for the non-resident supplier. 4. “Lease” of a copyrighted article If a computer program copy has been supplied for a finite period without accompanying copyright rights in the program, the supply will generate rental income. It is common for this type of transaction to be called a “lease”. While the transaction has attributes common to a lease – the legal right of exclusive possession for a stipulated period of time – in law, it is better characterised as a bailment or hire as it does not relate to land. A bailment can take many forms, but it is normal for it to be a hire of goods or a chattel lease. A hire of goods is a contract by which the hirer obtains the right to use the chattel hired, in return for payment to the owner of the price of the hiring. Such payments are referred to as rental payments. A chattel lease, on the other hand, has 10 been introduced by modern commercial methods. While not technically a “lease”, as it does not relate to an interest in land, a chattel lease is a contract which, depending on its terms, does create an equitable right of some kind in the subject of the lease (Bristol Airport plc v Powdrill \[1990\] 2 All ER 493, 502). Payments made pursuant to a chattel lease are referred to in this Guideline as rental payments. Where parties enter into a transaction for the right to use software for a finite period (as opposed to a right to commercially exploit the copyright rights) then the respective rights and obligations of such a transaction are equivalent to those in a lease. Accordingly, it is the Commissioner’s view that such transactions be treated equivalently for income tax purposes. Tax implications The tax implications of any particular transaction will depend upon the facts of that transaction. In the case of rental payments made in relation to a chattel lease there may be several possible tax implications. Rental payments may be deemed to be derived from New Zealand by the operation of section OE 4(1)(s) which states: Payments of any kind to the extent to which they are paid as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, in New Zealand, any personal property, being payments— (i) That are paid by a person who is resident in New Zealand; or (ii) That are paid by a person who is not a resident in New Zealand and are allowed as a deduction to the person for the purposes of tax in New Zealand: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to income which is deemed to be derived from New Zealand by virtue of paragraph (r): \[note that paragraph (r) deals with royalties\] It is also possible that section OE 4(1)(q), which provides that income derived from contracts made or wholly or partly performed in New Zealand is deemed to be derived from New Zealand, may apply. Under Part E of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, contract payments made to non-resident contractors are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 15 percent. A contract payment is defined as “...any payment...made for the contract activity to the non-resident contractor...”. A contract activity includes “\[t\]he granting, providing, or supplying of the use, or the right to use, in New Zealand, ... any personal property...” (regulation 2). Such withholding tax deductions are not a minimum or a final tax liability, but merely a payment on account of the contractor’s annual New Zealand income tax liability. Payments made may constitute business income of the non-resident “lessor”. Where the non-resident is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, generally such business income will not be taxable in New Zealand under the business profits article of the applicable DTA, unless the non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Rental payments derived by non-resident “lessors” of computer programs may fall under the royalty articles of New Zealand’s DTAs. Most of New Zealand’s DTAs include, in the definition of the term royalties, payments made, “... as a consideration 11 for the use of, or the right to use,... industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment...”. The Commissioner accepts that leased computer software will not by itself constitute equipment, but considers that it can be part of equipment, within this royalty definition, where it is an integral part of an identifiable item of industrial, scientific or commercial equipment. The Commissioner considers that in order to determine whether software is an integral part of an identifiable item of industrial, scientific or commercial equipment, a functionality test should be applied. Where the software is critical or essential to the function of the equipment, i.e., the software is necessary to enable the equipment to perform its primary function, the software will be an integral part of the equipment. Questions to ask are whether the software is part of the means by which the equipment performs its function? Does the equipment run the software, or is the software required to run the equipment? In the Commissioner’s opinion it is only where the software satisfies this test of functionality in relation to an item of equipment that it will be considered to be an integral part of that equipment. Software which is embedded in an identifiable item of equipment, and is essential to the function of that equipment, will be an integral part of that equipment. However, the Commissioner considers that the fact that software is not embedded in an item of equipment will not automatically preclude that software from being an integral part of that equipment. A hire or lease of a copy of a computer program from a non-resident supplier may also come within the definition of a “finance lease” in section OB 1. Payments made under such leases are subject to the finance lease regime in sections FC 8A to FC 8I. Under this regime the finance lease is effectively treated as a sale and loan back transaction, with each lease payment apportioned between a principal repayment and an interest component. Income derived by the non-resident supplier from the loan under the finance lease is treated as interest (section FC 8F). Under section CE 1(1)(a) interest is included in a person’s gross income. Section NG 2 imposes NRWT on interest income derived from New Zealand by a non-resident. NRWT will be imposed at a rate of 15 percent on such interest, unless the approved issuer levy is paid. However, the 15 percent rate may be modified by a DTA to 10 percent. 5. Supply of services for the development or modification of computer programs For many reasons computer programs may need to be modified, enhanced, or developed over their useful commercial life. Non-residents may be engaged to perform these tasks. Usually the non-resident is supplying a service to the owner or user of the program. However, in some situations the non-resident supplies know- how (discussed in the following section), and the correct nature of the supply in any situation depends on the facts and surrounding circumstances of the supply and the agreement made between the parties. A service is generally considered to be some activity that helps or benefits, or conduct tending to the advantage of another, e.g. professional assistance. The underlying theme of a service is that the provider (supplier) is doing something for the recipient. This view accords with the concept of supplying a service for the purposes of the 12 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (see, for example, Case S65 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,408). It is not practical to list all the types of services that can be supplied by a non- resident, but certain indicators may exist that lend support to there being a supply of services. For example, a service is supplied when the benefit of the modification, enhancement, development, etc., is for the recipient. Evidence showing that the ownership of the result or product of the service resides with the recipient supports the view that services have been provided. In a similar vein, if the supply involves an additional modification of the computer program and the copyright in the modification resides with the recipient, then this factor also supports a finding that a service has been provided. Tax implications The tax implications of a transaction involving the supply of services will depend upon the facts of the particular transaction. In general, payments for the supply of services for the development or modification of computer programs \[not connected with a licence of copyright rights or know-how\] will be treated as business income of a non-resident supplier. This income will have a New Zealand source to the extent of the value of the services performed in New Zealand under section OE 4(1)(a) \[income derived from any business wholly or partly carried on in New Zealand\] or section OE 4(1)(q) \[income derived from any contract made or wholly or partly performed in New Zealand\], and will therefore be liable to New Zealand income tax. Such payments for services performed in New Zealand are generally subject to non- resident contractors’ withholding tax under Part E of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 at a rate of 15 percent. This tax operates as an interim tax on behalf of the non-resident supplier’s New Zealand income tax liability. However, under a relevant DTA, a payment for the supply of services normally will fall under either the “business profits” article or the “independent personal services” article. Generally, under the business profits article such payments will not be taxable in New Zealand if the supplier is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA and the supplier does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Where the independent personal services article applies, the payments will generally not be taxable in New Zealand provided the supplier is not present in New Zealand for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the income year or the supplier does not have a “fixed base” regularly available in New Zealand to perform the service. 6. Supply of know-how relating to computer programs A payment derived as consideration for the supply of “scientific, technical, industrial, or commercial knowledge or information” (generally referred to as “know-how”) is a royalty under paragraph (e) of the royalty definition in section OB 1. \[Note that the following discussion is a general discussion of the concept of know-how as it relates 13 to computer programs and is not intended to be a definitive statement on the scope of paragraph (e) of the royalty definition.\] The term “know-how” is difficult to define with any precision. One leading description was given by Lord Radcliffe in Rolls-Royce v Jeffrey \[1962\] 1 All ER 801. This description has been usefully summarised in Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases (5 th ed, Sweet and Maxwell) at p 1,395 as follows: “Know-how” is the fund of technical knowledge and experience acquired by a highly specialised production organisation; although it may be, and usually is, noted down in documents, drawings, etc., it is itself an intangible entity whose category may vary according to, and may even be determined by, its use. Like office or factory buildings, patents and trademarks, and goodwill, it may be described as a “capital asset” while it is retained by a manufacturer for his own purposes, but, unlike these, its supply to another is not a transfer of a fixed capital asset because it is not lost to the supplying manufacturer (Rolls-Royce v Jeffrey; Rolls-Royce v I.R.C. \[1962\] 1 All E.R. 801). Know-how is an intangible asset and, from a practical perspective, can be viewed as undivulged knowledge or information residing with the supplier that enables the product or process to be replicated. In a sense, know-how is that knowledge or information that cannot be gleaned by a mere examination of a product or mere knowledge of the process or technique. In the computer context know-how can perhaps best be described as information relating to computer programming techniques. Due to its nature, know-how cannot be sold outright, in the sense that the supplier loses the right to use the special knowledge that has been supplied. The supplier of know-how always remains entitled to use it (Moriarty v Evans Medical Supplies Ltd \[1957\] 3 All ER 718, 735). Further, it is important to distinguish know-how from the physical (or electronic) means by which it is transferred. While know-how may subsist in a computer program, that, of itself, does not constitute a supply. In a supply of know-how the seller is passing to the buyer the seller’s special knowledge or information that remains unknown to the public. Accordingly, if the contract between a non-resident supplier and a resident buyer does not purport to transfer the relevant know-how, however it is comprised, the transaction is not a supply of know-how simply because the software has been transferred. In addition, as the know-how is an intangible asset of the seller, who is receiving value from the buyer in exchange for its disclosure, generally know-how will be furnished under conditions which prevent unauthorised disclosure by the buyer. Any unauthorised disclosure would constitute a breach of confidence. Payments for know-how do not include payments for services. In practice, however, the distinction between know-how and services is not always easy, and much will depend on the facts of a particular case. As mentioned above, in a know-how transaction the supplier is passing on to the buyer special knowledge or information. In a provision of services, the supplier is not passing on special knowledge or information to the buyer, but is instead using knowledge or information in order to develop, enhance, or modify a computer program. In a sense, the difference between a supply of know-how and a supply of services is that know-how enables the buyer to use the know-how for his or her own benefit, whereas in a supply of services the supplier uses his or her know-how for the benefit of the buyer. 14 In summary, therefore, the provision of information with respect to a computer program will be treated as the provision of know-how only if the information is: • Information relating to computer programming techniques; • Furnished under conditions preventing unauthorised disclosure; • Specifically contracted for between the parties; and • Considered property subject to trade secret protection, (i.e., that unauthorised disclosure constitutes a breach of confidence). Tax implications The income tax treatment of royalties derived from New Zealand by non-resident suppliers of know-how is the same as that described above for the licensing of copyright rights, except that with a know-how royalty the NRWT of 15 percent represents a minimum New Zealand income tax only (see section NG 4 which sets out the categories of non-resident withholding income in which the liability to NRWT is a minimum tax). If an income tax assessment would produce a greater amount of income tax than NRWT, the amount of income tax imposed under such an annual assessment will apply – with a credit being given for any NRWT imposed. Again, the tax rate on know-how royalties is subject to the provisions of any relevant DTA, which generally reduce the rate to 10 percent on the gross payments. Additional considerations Transactional analysis approach In order to determine whether there has been a sale of copyright rights or the granting of a licence, or whether there has been the sale of a copyrighted article or merely a lease, the approach adopted in New Zealand case law is the transactional analysis approach, as set out in several leading New Zealand cases (see, for example, Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271, Finnigan v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,170). The transactional analysis approach examines the legal rights and obligations of the parties to determine whether there has been a sale, licence or lease transaction. It is paramount to determine the legal rights and obligations flowing from the transactions entered into. The legal effect of the transaction is what matters, not the form or language used to express it. Thus, in determining whether a transaction is a sale or licence of copyright rights, it is necessary to consider the particular transaction carefully to identify the legal rights and obligations of the parties flowing from the transaction – do these rights and obligations indicate that the transaction is a sale or simply a licence of the copyright rights? Equally, the same applies when determining whether there has been a sale or lease of a copyrighted article. In determining whether there has been a sale or licence of copyright rights, matters such as whether all substantial copyright rights, or merely limited rights, have been transferred will be relevant. The sale of copyright rights will ensure the permanent transfer to the transferee of all the rights under copyright law which the transferor previously exercised. In the case of a licence of copyright rights the licensee will generally only have permission to exercise those copyright rights in accordance with 15 the licence granted. Any exercise of the rights beyond the authority of the licence will be unlawful. In distinguishing a sale of copyrighted article transaction from a lease transaction, matters such as whether the transfer of the copyrighted article involves the complete alienation of the article from transferor to transferee, or merely transfer of possession of the article for a defined period, may be relevant. For the purposes of the transactional analysis approach, in the context of computer programs none of the following factors are relevant in determining the true nature of a transaction: (i) The method of delivery; (ii) The form of consideration; or (iii) The labels given to the transaction by the parties. Special characteristics of computer programs A feature of computer programs is the ease with which perfect copies can be made. Distribution arrangements are often entered into in which the recipient obtains rights to make multiple copies of the program for operation only within its own business. Such arrangements are commonly referred to as “site licences” or “network licences”. Although these arrangements permit the making of multiple copies of the program, these rights are generally limited to those copies necessary for the purpose of simply enabling the program to operate on the recipient’s computers or network. Reproduction for any other purpose is not permitted. The point here is that the right granted is a restricted right to copy the program. A consideration of the facts and circumstances indicates that the recipient has not been granted the ability to exploit the supplier’s copyright rights, but rather has been granted the right to use the program for its own personal or business use. Any consideration attributable to the copying rights, if quantifiable, is likely to be minimal in value, and it is correct that it should be disregarded in assessing the character of the transaction for income tax purposes. For example, for income tax purposes, a transaction in which the software recipient has the right to make 50 copies of a program for its employees’ use at one location (a site licence) is treated the same as a transaction in which 50 individual disks are purchased, provided no copyright rights are supplied in either case. Assuming the right to use the copy of the computer program in either case is permanent, both transactions are treated as the sale of copyrighted articles. While at first glance this may appear to be advocating a substance over form approach, it is important to appreciate that the determination is not one of substance over form, but rather whether there has been the grant of a right to commercially exploit a copyright right. In the context of determining whether the right to copy has been granted for commercial exploitation purposes, or whether it has been granted for personal or business use, the fact that the transaction is equivalent to the purchase of copyrighted articles is a relevant consideration. Special note should be made of the situation of “enterprise licences” in this context. Enterprise licences generally provide for bulk purchasing or copying for multiple sites 16 distributed throughout the multiple legal entities in an affiliated group. An “enterprise licence” is, in one sense, simply a form of multiple site licence. The software recipient is still simply given the right to make so many copies of a program for its employees’ use – the only difference being that the employees are at more than one location. In other words, rather than being given the right to copy the program the required number of times for the number of employees at one site, the recipient is given the right to copy the program the required number of times for the number of employees in the recipient’s business, regardless of location. The obvious distinction between an enterprise licence and even a multiple site licence is that, in the case of an enterprise licence, the distribution is wider as it generally extends beyond a single legal entity to cover multiple legal entities within an affiliated group. However, despite this wider distribution, the principle behind the licence is the same as with a site or network licence. Provided there is no ability to commercially exploit the program granted and the right to copy is provided only for the business use of the enterprise, the transaction is a copyrighted article transaction and not a copyright transaction. In practical terms the transaction is the equivalent to a transaction whereby the software recipient bought the required number of copies of the software from the supplier and simply distributed them within its group. Note that the fact that the software recipient chooses to recover its costs plus a margin from members of its group will not affect the character of the transaction between the software supplier and the software recipient as being treated as a copyrighted article transaction. The software supplier has not granted the software recipient the ability to commercially exploit its rights. Rather, the ability of the software recipient to collect an intra-group internal charge or mark-up arises as a result of the relationship between the software recipient and the members of its group. The same analysis applies equally to an enterprise licence as to a site or network licence. Provided the right to copy the program is limited to those copies necessary for the purpose of simply enabling the program to operate on the computers or network of the enterprise, regardless of the number of locations or entities involved, and there is no ability to commercially exploit that right to copy granted, then the transaction should be treated as the sale of copyrighted articles. Approach to mixed transactions A computer program transaction may include more than one of the transactions described in 1-6 above. In such situations it may be necessary to treat each part of the transaction as a separate transaction, with the appropriate treatment described in this Guideline being applied to each separate transaction. This Guideline is concerned with characterising transactions and is not intended to provide rules for allocating income arising from mixed transactions. Mixed transactions occur in many circumstances outside of transactions involving computer programs. Bearing this in mind, the following paragraphs provide some brief guidance on dealing with mixed transactions. In A Taxpayer v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1997) 18 NZTC 13,350, at p. 13,366, Tipping J said: 17 In New Zealand liability to tax depends ... on statutory construction applied to legal rights and obligations. This accords with longstanding New Zealand authorities such as Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 and Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd v CIR (No 2) (1976) 2 NZTC 61,066. Accordingly, as discussed above, it is necessary in analysing a transaction to identify correctly its true nature as found in the existing legal rights and obligations. If a transaction can be broken down into separate transactions, the appropriate tax treatment (as described above) should be applied to each separate transaction. The test to be applied is whether a part of the transaction is merely ancillary or incidental to another part of the transaction such that it can simply be treated in a similar manner to that other part. If this is the case, then that ancillary part of the transaction is to be treated in the same fashion as the rest of the transaction. However, this does not preclude there being a transaction which has several different parts, some or all of which are not ancillary or incidental to any other part of the transaction. In those circumstances the different parts of the transaction will be treated as separate transactions and characterised accordingly. One area where this discussion is particularly relevant is that of software development tools. For example, these products frequently include libraries of standard routines that software developers are granted the right to distribute as part of the software products they develop and sell. Typically the software developer pays a one time fee for the software development product and does not make contingent payments upon sales of its own software products. In these circumstances the right to distribute the libraries in conjunction with any programs created using the development program is an ancillary or incidental part of the overall transaction with the supplier, which is the transfer of the copyrighted product, i.e., the software development program. Therefore, the transaction will be treated solely as the supply of a copyrighted article and not the supply of a copyright right. Market intermediaries The case of market intermediaries should also be noted. These are distributors who purchase software products from manufacturers and in turn resell them to other distributors or end-users. Although the agreement between the parties will often be referred to as a “licence”, generally the distributor has not been granted the right to commercially exploit any copyright right in the program. The distributor simply purchases copyrighted articles and then on-sells these goods. The right to distribute previously existing copies of programs is not a right to commercially exploit any copyright rights for income tax purposes. Accordingly, the transaction will be a copyrighted article transaction rather than a copyright transaction and the payments made by the distributor are not royalties. 18 Ancillary services provided by the supplier Under paragraph (f) of the royalty definition, a payment derived as consideration for the supply of any assistance, furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of anything referred to in the preceding paragraphs of the definition, is also a royalty. Accordingly, payments for services connected with a licence of copyright rights or the supply of know-how are royalties subject to NRWT. However, this treatment of payments for ancillary services may be subject to DTA provisions if the supplier is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA. If the applicable DTA does not include such ancillary services in its royalties definition, the related payments may be treated as business income of the non-resident software supplier if the supplier carries on business in New Zealand. In those circumstances, the payments will generally not be taxable in New Zealand under the business profits article of the DTA, unless the supplier has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. One of the most common types of ancillary services provided is that of helpdesk services. In most cases paragraph (f) of the royalty definition will have no application as the helpdesk services will not be provided in relation to a transaction concerning copyright rights, but rather in relation to a transaction concerning a copyrighted article, i.e., the program itself. In addition, the tax implications of a transaction concerning helpdesk services would depend heavily on the facts in any particular case, e.g., are the services provided in New Zealand or from a location outside New Zealand, are the services provided by the non-resident supplier or an agent, are the services contracted out? Integrated software If a copy of a computer program embodied in any carrying medium is integrated or incorporated into any other product (for example, computer hardware or a motor vehicle), and sold together without any accompanying copyright rights, the transaction is also treated as a sale of a copyrighted article with the proceeds being business income (such software is often referred to as integrated or bundled software). Examples In the remainder of this Guideline a series of examples is given to provide guidance. As stated earlier, these examples are drawn substantially from the United States Internal Revenue Service regulations \[Treasury Regulations, §1.861-18 Classification of transactions involving computer programs\], with which this Interpretation Guideline is in substantial agreement. The examples are in two parts. First, the transaction is analysed to ascertain whether it involves the supply of copyright rights or the supply of a copyrighted article. Then, in the case of a supply of copyright rights, it considers whether the transaction is a sale or licence of rights. In the case of a supply of a copyrighted article, the question becomes whether the transaction is a sale or a lease of that article. 19 As discussed in the Guideline, the tax implications of a software transaction depend upon the particular facts of each case. For example, if Foreign Co carries on business in New Zealand the consideration received from the transaction may be treated as business income of the non-resident. However, if the supplier is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, the consideration may not be taxable in New Zealand under a relevant article in a DTA, provided that the non-resident does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Accordingly, it is important to be aware that the tax implications discussed in the different examples of computer software transactions are indicative only of the types of tax implications which may arise. There are various issues which are relevant in making the appropriate determination. Example 1: Sale of a copyrighted article Foreign Co owns the copyright in a computer program. It copies the program on to disks. The disks are placed in boxes covered with a wrapper on which is printed what is generally referred to as a “shrink-wrap licence”. The licence is stated to be perpetual. Under the licence no reverse engineering of the computer program is permitted. The transferee receives, first, the right to use the program on two of its own computers (a laptop and a desktop) provided that only one copy is in use at any one time, and, second, the right to make one copy of the program on each machine as an essential step in the utilisation of the program. The transferee is permitted by the shrink-wrap licence to sell the copy, as long as it destroys any other copies it has made and imposes the same terms and conditions of the licence on any would-be purchaser of its copy. These disks are made available for sale to the general public in New Zealand. P, a New Zealand resident, pays for one such disk. Analysis The existence of the “shrink-wrap licence” is not determinative. No copyright rights, as described in this Guideline, have been supplied in this transaction. P has received a copy of the program and is therefore treated as having acquired a copyrighted article. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, P is properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, there has been a sale of a copyrighted article, rather than the grant of a lease. Tax implications In this example, if the payment received by Foreign Co is not deemed to be derived from New Zealand under any of the source rules in section OE 4(1), then the payment will be a non-taxable receipt for Foreign Co. The most likely situation where the source rules will apply will be if Foreign Co carries on business in New Zealand. If that is the case, the consideration received from the sale will be treated as business income unless it is not taxable in New Zealand under the business profits article of a relevant DTA. It is also possible that the payment may be held to have a New Zealand source on the basis that it is income from the sale of property situated in New Zealand or that it is income derived from a contract made or performed in New Zealand. 20 Example 2: Internet sale The facts are as in Example 1, except that instead of selling disks, Foreign Co decides to make the program available, for a fee, on a World Wide Web home page on the Internet. P, the New Zealand resident, in return for payment made to Foreign Co, downloads the program (via modem) on to the hard drive of its computer. As part of the electronic communication, P signifies its assent to a licence agreement with terms identical to those in Example 1, except that in this case P may make a back-up copy of the program on to a disk. Analysis None of the copyright rights described in this Guideline have passed to P. Although P did not buy a physical copy of the disk with the program on it, the means of transferring the program is irrelevant. P has been supplied with a copyrighted article. As in Example 1, P is properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, there has been a sale of a copyrighted article rather than the grant of a lease. Tax implications As in Example 1, if the payment received by Foreign Co is not deemed to be derived from New Zealand under any of the source rules in section OE 4(1), then the payment will be a non-taxable receipt for Foreign Co. The most likely situation where the source rules will apply will be if Foreign Co carries on business in New Zealand. If that is the case, the consideration received from the sale will be treated as business income of the non-resident. If Foreign Co is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, this business income will generally not be taxable in New Zealand under the business profits article of the relevant DTA, provided Foreign Co does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Example 3: Lease transaction The facts are as in Example 1, except that P, the New Zealand resident, only pays Foreign Co to use the program for two months. At the end of that period, P must return the disk with the program on it to Foreign Co. P must also destroy any copies made of the program. If P wishes to use the program for a further period, P must enter into a new agreement to use the program for an additional charge. Analysis No copyright rights, as described in this Guideline, have been supplied in this transaction. P has received a copy of the program and is therefore treated as having acquired a copyrighted article. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, P is not properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, there has been a lease of a copyrighted article, rather than a sale. Taking into account the special characteristics of computer 21 programs, the result would be the same if P was required to destroy the disk at the end of the two month period instead of returning it, since Foreign Co can make additional copies of the program at minimal cost. Tax implications In this situation the payment may be for “the use of, or the right to use, personal property in New Zealand” and on this basis the payment will have a New Zealand source and be taxable. Under the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 a withholding tax may apply. If Foreign Co is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA and qualifies for DTA relief, Foreign Co may obtain an exemption from the withholding tax impost. This assumes that the payment is not for the use of, or the right to use, equipment, which is the case here. Example 4: Electronic Lock The facts are the same as those in Example 2, where P, the NZ resident, receives the program from Foreign Co’s home page on the Internet, except that P may only use the program for a period of two months, at the end of which an electronic lock is activated and the program can no longer be accessed. Thereafter, if P wishes to use the program it must return to the home page and pay Foreign Co to send an electronic key to reactivate the program for another period. Analysis As in Example 3, P has not received any copyright rights. P has received a copy of the program. The means of transmission is irrelevant. Therefore, P has received a copyrighted article. As in Example 3, P is not properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, there has been a lease of a copyrighted article rather than a sale. While P does retain the program on its computer at the end of the two month period, as a legal matter P no longer has the right to use the program (without further payment) and, indeed, cannot use the program without the electronic key. The effect is that, as far as P is concerned, it is as if the program is no longer on the hard drive of P’s computer. Although in Example 3, P was required to physically return the disk, taking into account the special characteristics of computer programs, the result in this Example 4 is the same as in Example 3. Tax implications The tax implications for this example will be similar to those discussed in relation to Example 3 above. Example 5: Sale of a copyright right Foreign Co transfers a disk containing a computer program to NZ Co, and grants NZ Co an exclusive licence for the remaining term of the copyright to: 22 • copy and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the program in the geographic area of New Zealand, • prepare derivative works based upon the program. The agreement states that NZ Co will pay Foreign Co a royalty of $1 million a year for three years: the anticipated period for which the program will have commercially exploitable value. Analysis Foreign Co has transferred a disk with a copy of the program on it to NZ Co. However, the transfer of the physical copy of the program is simply an ancillary or incidental part of the overall transaction, which is the transfer of the copyright rights. Therefore, the transaction is treated as a transfer of copyright rights, not of copyrighted articles. As all substantial copyright rights have been supplied in the transaction, Foreign Co will be treated as having sold copyright rights to NZ Co. NZ Co has acquired the copyright rights in the program for a geographic area, and has received the rights for the remaining life of the copyright in the program. In this situation, the fact that the agreement is stated as a licence is not necessarily determinative of the true nature of the transaction. In addition, the fact that the payment is called a royalty is also not determinative. For tax purposes a royalty is defined as “consideration derived for the use of or the right to use a copyright”. However, in this situation NZ Co has purchased all the substantial copyright rights in the program. (This conclusion would be the same if the copy of the program were transmitted electronically to NZ Co, as the means of transmission is not relevant.) Tax implications As this transaction does not give rise to a royalty, the consideration derived by the non-resident from the sale of the copyright rights will generally be a non-taxable receipt, unless the income is otherwise deemed to be derived from New Zealand under section OE 4(1). The most likely situation for this to occur is where the non- resident is carrying on a business in New Zealand which includes supplying such copyright rights. Where this is the case, the payment will be business income of the supplier unless the income is not taxable in New Zealand under the business profits article of an applicable DTA. Example 6: Licence of a copyright right Foreign Co transfers a disk containing a computer program to NZ Co. Foreign Co grants NZ Co the non-exclusive right to reproduce (either directly or by contracting with another person to do so) and distribute for sale to the public in New Zealand an unlimited number of disks, in return for a payment related to the number of disks copied and sold. The term of the agreement is two years, which is less than the remaining life of the copyright. 23 Analysis As in Example 5, the transfer of the disk containing the copy of the program is not treated as the transfer of a copyrighted article. The transfer of the physical copy of the program is simply an ancillary or incidental part of the overall transaction, which is the transfer of the copyright rights. Therefore, the transaction is treated as a transfer of copyright rights, not of copyrighted articles. In this example there has been a licensing of the program to NZ Co and the payments made by NZ Co are royalties. Unlike Example 5, there has not been a transfer of all substantial rights in the copyright in the program, because Foreign Co has the right to enter into other licences with respect to the copyright in the program, including in New Zealand (or even to sell that copyright, subject to NZ Co’s interest). NZ Co has acquired no right itself to license the copyright rights in the program. Finally, the term of the licence is for less than the remaining life of the copyright. Tax implications As the payments are royalties, non-resident withholding tax is payable at a rate of 15 percent on the gross payments. This rate may be reduced to 10 percent if Foreign Co is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA. In this situation, at the time of making each payment NZ Co is required to deduct NRWT from the amount of the royalty and to pay it to the Commissioner. Example 7: Distributor NZ Co, a distributor in NZ, enters into an agreement with Foreign Co to purchase as many copies of a computer program on disk as it may from time-to-time request. NZ Co will then sell these disks to retailers. The disks are shipped in boxes covered by shrink-wrap licences (identical to the licence described in Example 1). Analysis NZ Co has not acquired any copyright rights with respect to the program. It has acquired individual copies of the program, which it may sell to others. The use of the term licence is not dispositive. NZ Co has acquired copyrighted articles. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, NZ Co is properly treated as the owner of copyrighted articles. Therefore, there has been a sale of copyrighted articles. Tax implications In this example, if the payments received by Foreign Co are not deemed to be derived from New Zealand under any of the source rules in section OE 4(1), then the payments will be non-taxable receipts for Foreign Co. If Foreign Co carries on business in New Zealand then the payments will have a source in New Zealand and may be taxable to Foreign Co (subject to the application of an applicable DTA). It is 24 also possible that the payments may be held to have a New Zealand source on the basis that they are income from the sale of property situated in New Zealand or that they are income derived from a contract made or performed in New Zealand. Example 8: Hardware manufacturer – licence Foreign Co transfers a disk containing a computer program to NZ Co, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of personal computers in New Zealand. Foreign Co grants NZ Co the non-exclusive right to copy the program onto the hard drive of computers which it manufactures, and to distribute those copies (on the hard drive) to the public. The term of the agreement is two years, which is less than the remaining life of the copyright in the program. NZ Co pays Foreign Co an amount based on the number of copies of the program it loads on to computers. Analysis The analysis is as in Example 6. NZ Co has acquired a copyright right which it is able to exploit by copying the program on to the hard drives of the computers it manufactures and sells. The transfer of the physical copy of the program is simply an ancillary or incidental part of the overall transaction, which is the transfer of the copyright right. Therefore, the transaction is treated as a transfer of copyright rights, not of copyrighted articles. In this example, NZ Co has not acquired all substantial rights in the copyright in the program (for example, the term of the agreement is less than the remaining commercial life of the copyright). This transaction is a licensing of the copyright to NZ Co rather than a sale, and the payments made by NZ Co are royalties. The result would be the same even if NZ Co included a back-up copy of the program on a floppy disk with the computers it sells. Tax implications As the payments are royalties, non-resident withholding tax is payable at a rate of 15 percent on the gross payments. This rate may be reduced to 10 percent if Foreign Co is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA. In this situation, at the time of making each payment NZ Co is required to deduct NRWT from the amount of the royalty and to pay it to the Commissioner. Example 9: Manufacturer as intermediary – sale not licence The facts are the same as in Example 8, except that NZ Co, the NZ company, receives physical disks. The disks are shipped in boxes covered by shrink-wrap licences (identical to the licences described in Example 1). The terms of these licences do not permit NZ Co to make additional copies of the program. NZ Co uses each individual disk only once to load a single copy of the program onto each separate computer. NZ Co transfers the disk with the computer when it is sold. 25 Analysis As in Example 7 (unlike Example 8) no copyright right has been transferred. NZ Co acquires the disks without the right to exploit Foreign Co’s copyright rights, e.g., without the right to reproduce and distribute publicly further copies of the program. Therefore, this is the transfer of copyrighted articles. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, NZ Co is properly treated as the owner of copyrighted articles. Therefore, the transaction is classified as the sale of a copyrighted article. (The result would be the same if NZ Co used a single physical disk to copy the program onto each computer, and transferred an unopened box containing the program with each computer, if NZ Co was not permitted to copy the program onto more computers than the number of individual copies purchased.) Tax implications As in Example 7, if the payments received by Foreign Co are not deemed to be derived from New Zealand under any of the source rules in section OE 4(1), then the payments will be non-taxable receipts for Foreign Co. If Foreign Co carries on business in New Zealand then the payments will have a source in New Zealand and may be taxable to Foreign Co (subject to the application of an applicable DTA). It is also possible that the payments may be held to have a New Zealand source on the basis that they are income from the sale of property situated in New Zealand or that they are income derived from a contract made or performed in New Zealand. Example 10: Site, Network and Enterprise Licences Foreign Co transfers a disk containing a computer program to NZ Co, and grants NZ Co the right to load the program on to 50 individual workstations for use only by NZ Co employees at one location, in return for a once only per-user fee (generally referred to as a site licence). If additional workstations are subsequently introduced, the program may be loaded on to those machines for additional once only per-user fees. The licence which grants the rights to operate the program on 50 workstations also prohibits NZ Co from selling the disk (or any of the 50 copies) or reverse engineering the program. The term of the licence is stated to be perpetual. Analysis The grant of a restricted right to copy, unaccompanied by any ability to exploit the supplier’s copyright rights, is not a copyright right as described in this Guideline. Therefore, this transaction is treated as a transfer of copyrighted articles (50 copies of the program). As NZ Co is properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article, there has been a sale of copyrighted articles rather than the grant of a lease. Notwithstanding the restriction on sale, other factors such as, for example, the risk of loss remaining with the supplier and the right to use the copies in perpetuity outweigh, in this case, the restrictions placed on the right of alienation. 26 The result would be the same if NZ Co was granted either a network or enterprise licence, provided NZ Co was not also granted the ability to exploit Foreign Co’s copyright rights in the program. In either case, it is not the extent of the distribution which is relevant, but the question of whether NZ Co is granted any ability to commercially exploit the copyright rights of Foreign Co. Tax implications In this example, if the payment received by Foreign Co is not deemed to be derived from New Zealand under any of the source rules in section OE 4(1), then the payment will be a non-taxable receipt for Foreign Co. If Foreign Co carries on business in New Zealand then the payment will have a source in New Zealand and may be taxable to Foreign Co (subject to the application of an applicable DTA). It is also possible that the payment may be held to have a New Zealand source on the basis that it is income from the sale of property situated in New Zealand or that it is income derived from a contract made or performed in New Zealand. Example 11: Lease of program The facts are as in Example 10, except that NZ Co pays a monthly fee to Foreign Co, calculated with reference to the permitted maximum number of users (which can be changed). In return for this monthly fee, NZ Co receives the right to receive upgrades of the program as they become available. The agreement may be terminated by either party at the end of any month. When the disk containing the upgrade is received, NZ Co must return the disk containing the earlier version of the program to Foreign Co and delete (or otherwise destroy) any copies made of that earlier version. If the contract is terminated NZ Co must delete (or otherwise destroy) all copies made of the current version of the program. The agreement specifically provides that NZ Co has not been granted an option to purchase the program. Analysis NZ Co has received no copyright rights as described in this Guideline. Foreign Co has not provided any know-how or services to NZ Co. Therefore, the transaction is a supply of a copyrighted article. It is clear that NZ Co is not the owner of the copyrighted article. NZ Co does not receive the right to use the program in perpetuity, but only for as long as it continues to make payments. NZ Co does not have the right to purchase the program on advantageous (or, indeed, any) terms once a certain amount of money has been paid to Foreign Co or a certain period of time has elapsed (which might indicate a sale). NZ Co is not permitted to on-sell the software. Once the agreement is terminated, NZ Co will no longer possess any copies of the program, current or superseded. Therefore, in reality the transaction is “a lease” of a copyrighted article (as the term “lease” is described in this Guideline). 27 Note that the result would be different if NZ Co, while having to return copies of previous versions of the program when upgrades were received, was entitled to keep the latest version of the program in the event the agreement was terminated. In these circumstances there would have been a sale of a copyrighted article rather than a lease. Tax implications In this situation the payments may be for “the use of, or the right to use, personal property in New Zealand” and on this basis the payments will have a New Zealand source and be taxable. Under the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 a withholding tax may apply. If Foreign Co is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA and qualifies for DTA relief, Foreign Co may obtain an exemption from the withholding tax impost. This assumes that the payments are not for the use of, or the right to use, equipment, which is the case here. Example 12: Sale or lease NZ Co enters into a contract with Foreign Co for Foreign Co to modify its program so that it can be used at NZ Co’s facility in New Zealand. Under the contract, NZ Co is to acquire one copy of the program on a disk and the right to use the program on 5,000 workstations. The contract requires Foreign Co to rewrite elements of the program so that it will conform to NZ accounting standards and states that Foreign Co retains all copyright rights in the modified program. The agreement between Foreign Co and NZ Co is otherwise identical as to rights and payment terms as the agreement described in Example 10. Analysis As in Example 10, no copyright rights are being transferred. In addition, since no copyright rights are being transferred to NZ Co, this transaction does not involve the provision of services by Foreign Co. This transaction will be classified, therefore, as a transfer of copyrighted articles (5,000 copies of the program). Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, NZ Co is properly treated as the owner of copyrighted articles. There has therefore been a sale of copyrighted articles rather than the grant of a lease. Tax implications In this example, if the payment received by Foreign Co is not deemed to be derived from New Zealand under any of the source rules in section OE 4(1), then the payment will be a non-taxable receipt for Foreign Co. If Foreign Co carries on business in New Zealand then the payment will have a source in New Zealand and may be taxable to Foreign Co (subject to the application of an applicable DTA). It is also possible that the payment may be held to have a New Zealand source on the basis that it is income from the sale of property situated in New Zealand or that it is income derived from a contract made or performed in New Zealand. 28 Example 13: Provision of services NZ Co enters into a licence agreement with Foreign Co for a new computer program. Foreign Co and NZ Co agree that Foreign Co will write the program for NZ Co and that, when the program is completed, the copyright in the program will belong to NZ Co. NZ Co gives instructions to Foreign Co programmers on required program specifications. NZ Co agrees to pay a fixed monthly sum during the program’s development. If NZ Co is dissatisfied with the development of the program, it may cancel the contract at the end of any month. In the event of termination, Foreign Co will retain all payments made up to the date of termination. Any procedures, techniques, or copyrightable interests in the program will be the property of NZ Co. All the payments are referred to in the agreement as royalties. There is no provision in the agreement for any continuing relationship between the two companies, such as the furnishing of updates of the program, after completion of the work. Analysis In this example, Foreign Co is treated as supplying services to NZ Co. NZ Co bears all the risks of loss associated with the development of the program, and is the owner of all copyright rights in it. The fact that the agreement is labelled a licence is not determinative (nor is the fact that Foreign Co receives a sum that is labelled a royalty). Tax implications In this example, if the payments received by Foreign Co are not deemed to be derived from New Zealand under any of the source rules in section OE 4(1), then the payments will be non-taxable receipts for Foreign Co. If Foreign Co carries on business in New Zealand then the payments will have a source in New Zealand and may be taxable to Foreign Co. It is also possible that in this example the payments may be held to have a New Zealand source on the basis that they are income derived from a contract made or performed in New Zealand. Where the services are performed in New Zealand the payments received by Foreign Co may be liable to a withholding tax under the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. However, under a relevant DTA, a payment for the supply of services normally will fall under the “business profits” article – in which case, such payments will generally not be taxable in New Zealand if the supplier does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Example 14: Know-how Foreign Co and NZ Co agree that Foreign Co will provide information relating to certain programming techniques which are not generally known to computer programmers, to enable NZ Co to more efficiently create computer programs. These techniques represent the product of experience gained by Foreign Co from working on many similar computer programming projects, and are furnished to NZ Co under non-disclosure conditions. The information is considered to be subject to trade secret protection. 29 Analysis This transaction will be classified as the provision of know-how, as it entails the supply of confidential special knowledge and information relating to computer programming techniques under non-disclosure conditions. The payment will, therefore, constitute a royalty. Tax implications As the payment is a royalty, NRWT is payable at a rate of 15 percent on the gross payment. This rate may be reduced to 10 percent if Foreign Co is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA. In this situation, at the time of making payment NZ Co is required to deduct NRWT from the amount of the royalty and to pay it to the Commissioner. Example 15: Software development tools – including libraries Foreign Co transfers a disk containing a computer program to NZ Co in exchange for a single fixed payment. The program is a computer program development program, which is used to create other computer programs, consisting of several components, including libraries of reusable software components that serve as general building blocks in new software applications. No element of these libraries is a significant component of any overall new program. Since a computer program created with the use of the program will not operate unless the libraries are also present, the licence agreement between Foreign Co and NZ Co grants NZ Co the right to distribute copies of the libraries with any program developed using the program. The licence agreement is otherwise identical to the licence agreement in Example 1. Analysis NZ Co has received a copy of the program and has therefore received a copyrighted article. Taking into account the overall transaction and the surrounding facts and circumstances, the right to distribute the libraries in conjunction with any programs created using the development program is an ancillary or incidental part of the overall transaction which is the transfer of the copyrighted article. Therefore, the transaction is treated solely as a transfer of a copyrighted article and not a copyright right. Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, NZ Co is properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore, there has been the sale of a copyrighted article rather than the grant of a lease. Tax implications In this example, if the payment received by Foreign Co is not deemed to be derived from New Zealand under any of the source rules in section OE 4(1), then the payment will be a non-taxable receipt for Foreign Co. If Foreign Co carries on business in New Zealand then the payment will have a source in New Zealand and may be taxable to Foreign Co (subject to the application of an applicable DTA). It is also 30 possible that the payment may be held to have a New Zealand source on the basis that it is income from the sale of property situated in New Zealand or that it is income derived from a contract made or performed in New Zealand. Example 16: Correction software Foreign Co transfers a disk containing a computer program to NZ Co. The disk contains both the object code and the source code to the program and the licence agreement grants NZ Co the right to: • Modify the source code in order to correct minor errors and make minor adaptations to the program so that it will function on NZ Co’s computer; and • Recompile the modified source code. The licence does not grant NZ Co the right to distribute the modified program to the public. The licence is otherwise identical to the licence agreement in Example 1. Analysis NZ Co has received a copy of the program, and has therefore received a copyrighted article. Considering the facts and surrounding circumstances, the right to modify and recompile the source code in order to create new code to correct minor errors and make minor adaptations is simply an ancillary or incidental component of the overall transaction, which is the transfer of the copyrighted article. Therefore, the transaction is properly treated solely as the transfer of a copyrighted article and not a copyright right. Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, NZ Co is properly treated as the owner of a copyrighted article. Therefore there has been the sale of a copyrighted article rather than the grant of a lease. Tax implications In this example, if the payment received by Foreign Co is not deemed to be derived from New Zealand under any of the source rules in section OE 4(1), then the payment will be a non-taxable receipt for Foreign Co. If Foreign Co carries on business in New Zealand then the payment will have a source in New Zealand and may be taxable to Foreign Co (subject to the application of an applicable DTA). It is also possible that the payment may be held to have a New Zealand source on the basis that it is income from the sale of property situated in New Zealand or that it is income derived from a contract made or performed in New Zealand. 31 32 \[Note as to operational implications added by Technical Standards on 15/10/03\] Application of Interpretation Guideline on Non-Resident Software Suppliers’ Payments Derived from New Zealand—Income Tax Treatment Although the guideline is intended to apply to transactions occurring on or after the date of publication, Inland Revenue is aware that the draft guideline (IG0007) which was first circulated for consultation in December 1997 has been applied in many cases. We are also aware that in the intervening period many taxpayers chose to follow the policy set out in Public Information Bulletin 168 (published in January 1988 and subsequently withdrawn in Taxation Information Bulletin Vol.10, No. 7, July 1998). In some cases those taxpayers who applied the old policy would have paid NRWT, which would not have been payable had they followed the draft. Inland Revenue is aware that this guideline was being applied while still in its draft stage. In order to ensure that those taxpayers who continued to apply the old policy after July 1998 are treated fairly any taxpayer who applied the old policy (and therefore paid NRWT which, in terms of either the draft guideline or the guideline as published, they should not have been liable to pay) may apply for a refund of any overpaid NRWT in relation to that period and cite this guideline as authority.
\[Interpretation guideline IG0009 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in January 1999\] EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR? Background This interpretation guideline will help taxpayers to determine correctly their employment status for tax purposes. It describes the common law tests developed by the courts for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor. This interpretation guideline replaces the policy statement entitled “Employee or independent contractor?” in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, No. 7 (March 1993) at pages 2-4 which outlined the tests for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor. That policy statement was published before the Court of Appeal overruling the Employment Court decision in Cunningham v TNT Worldwide Express (NZ) Ltd \[1992\] 3 ERNZ 1030. On the whole the previous statement contained the correct factors to consider, but it did not fully reflect the approach to this question currently taken by the courts. This interpretation guideline is consistent with, and should be read in conjunction with, the policy statement in TIB Volume Five, No. 1 (July 1993) at page 5 which discusses the implications of the Court of Appeal decision in TNT Worldwide Express (NZ) Ltd v Cunningham (1993) 15 NZTC 10,234 in relation to the employment status of courier drivers. Relevance of employment status A taxpayer's tax obligations differ according to his or her employment status, so it is important to know if he or she is an employee or not. The employment status of a person has the following consequences for tax purposes: • Payments to employees from their employer are salary or wages, which must have PAYE deducted at source. • Employees cannot register for or charge GST for services they supply as employees. • Independent contractors: • may deduct certain expenses incurred in deriving assessable income; • must account to Inland Revenue for tax and ACC earner and employee premiums for themselves and any employees; and • must meet all the requirements of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 if the services they supply are in the course of a taxable activity, and they are registered (or liable to register) for GST. It is not possible for taxpayers to alter their employment status (or the resulting tax implications) merely by calling themselves independent contractors when they are essentially still employees. 1 2 Types of employment arrangement A person’s employment status depends on whether his or her employment contract is a “contract of service” or a “contract for services”. In New Zealand Educational Institute v Director-General of Education \[1981\] 1 NZLR 538, Somers J in giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal said at page 539: On many occasions over the years the Courts have had to decide whether the relationship between two persons was that of employer and employee or, as it used to be called, master and servant. The inquiry normally involved the distinction between a contract of service in which the relation was that of employer and employee and a contract for services in which the relation was that between employer and independent contractor. A decision in any particular case required an examination of the contract between the two – it might be expressed in words or it might be implicit from the circumstances. Employees have a “contract of service” with their employer. Contracts of service evolved from the earlier concept of a master-servant relationship. Such a relationship required an employee to be continuously available for service and to accept a high degree of control by the employer. A “contract for services” applies to the relationship between an independent contractor and a principal. It emphasises the nature of the services to be provided by a person rather than his or her availability to work as directed. Either form of contract may include an unwritten agreement. A written contract is not necessary in determining the existence of any particular type of employment relationship. However, if there is a detailed written contract, it will form the basis for analysing the nature of the relationship the parties intended to have. Employment contracts often change as the relationship evolves (e.g. a person takes on more duties). Changes in regulations and work practices may also cause the employment status of some workers to change. The courts will consider how the parties actually work together when they determine the type of employment relationship the parties have. Employment status and revenue law Tax law relies on the terms “contract of service” and “contract for services”, but does not define them. Therefore, their meanings depend on the contract law developed by the courts and any statutes that apply to a particular kind of work. A person will have the same employment status for tax purposes as he or she has under the general law. Sometimes it is not easy to tell if a taxpayer is an employee or an independent contractor. Inland Revenue will use the current common law tests to determine a worker's status. TNT Worldwide Express v Cunningham A leading New Zealand case on the question of whether the relationship between two parties is one of employee and employer, or independent contractor and principal is the Court of Appeal decision in TNT Worldwide Express. In that case the Court gives guidance as to the appropriate focus of inquiry in deciding this question. 3 In TNT Worldwide Express the respondent was engaged by the appellant company, TNT, as an owner-driver to conduct a courier service for the company. The owner- driver: • provided his own vehicle and was responsible for its maintenance and upkeep, • was responsible for all his own tax and ACC payments, • claimed deductions as if he were self-employed, and • had a contract with TNT that said he was an independent contractor. The company terminated the respondent’s contract, and the respondent sought to invoke the personal grievance procedure under the Employment Contracts Act 1991. The Employment Court held that an owner-driver courier for TNT was an employee and not self-employed. In reaching that conclusion, considerable emphasis was placed on the rigorous control which the company exercised over its owner-drivers. The Employment Court found that the company’s actions showed that it treated the owner-driver as its employee. In particular, the Court found it significant that the company: • imposed an obligation on the owner-driver to provide a licence, wear a uniform, and have the company’s logo painted on the vehicle, • exercised strong control over the volume, type, quality, and location of his work, • supervised him closely, • restricted him from carrying freight for anyone else, • had all ownership rights over the business and goodwill, and • could regulate his income (by controlling where and how much he worked). The Court of Appeal's decision reversed that finding, holding that the written contract entered into by the parties created a genuine independent contractor relationship. The Court accepted that an owner-driver courier was an independent contractor rather than an employee where his or her contract with TNT: • required him to provide his own vehicle, uniform, approved radio telephone, goods service licence under the Transport Act 1962, and insurance, • paid him mainly on a per trip basis, • made him responsible for employing any relief driver, • referred to the courier as an independent contractor, and • gave TNT very extensive control over his operations. The Court acknowledged the extensive control exercised by TNT over the owner- driver, but concluded that the owner-driver accepted only that degree of control and supervision necessary for the efficient and profitable conduct of the business he was running on his own account as an independent contractor. Casey J cited (at page 697) the following statement of MacKenna J in Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance \[1968\] 1 All ER 433 at page 447: A man does not cease to run a business on his own account because he agrees to run it efficiently or to accept another’s superintendence. 4 The Court of Appeal said that when the contract is wholly in writing and it is not a sham, then the nature of the relationship intended by the parties is determined from the terms of that contract in the light of all the surrounding circumstances at the time it was made. Cooke P (as he then was) noted at page 10,235 that “it is necessary to consider all the terms of the agreement”, and made the following observations at page 10,238: When the terms of a contract are fully set out in writing which is not a sham (and there is no suggestion of a sham in this case) the answer to the question of the nature of the contract must depend on an analysis of the rights and obligations so defined. ... In the end, when the contract is wholly in writing, it is the true interpretation and effect of the written terms on which the case must turn. Tests of the employment relationship In cases where the nature of the relationship is unclear the courts have developed various tests to determine the type of contract that exists. Cases may not be clear-cut and the tests may overlap. Therefore, the results of the various tests must be carefully weighed to find the predominant factors that will determine the relationship. In TNT Worldwide Express, the Court of Appeal cited (at page 10,248) a statement from page 382 of the judgment of the Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi-Keung \[1990\] 2 AC 374: What then is the standard to apply? This has proved to be a most elusive question and despite a plethora of authorities the courts have not been able to devise a single test that will conclusively point to the distinction in all cases. The Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang quoted with approval from the judgment of the English Cooke J in Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security \[1968\] 3 All ER 732, at page 185: No exhaustive list has been compiled and perhaps no exhaustive list can be compiled of considerations which are relevant in determining the question, nor can strict rules be laid down as to the relative weight which the various considerations should carry in particular cases. Although there are no single tests or exhaustive lists that are appropriate, there are 5 broad factors or tests which are useful in determining this question. These are not alternative tests but are simply relevant factors to be considered. A discussion of the tests follows. 1. The control test The control test looks at the degree of control the employer or principal exerts over the work an employee or contractor is to do and the manner in which it is to be done. The greater the extent to which the principal or employer specifies work content, hours and methods, and can supervise, regulate and/or dismiss a person, the more likely it is that the person will be an employee. This test used to be considered as the deciding factor, but this is no longer the case. The Court of Appeal in TNT Worldwide Express emphasised that control is only one of several factors relevant to the interpretation of the contract. The Court endorsed 5 the statement of Cooke J in Market Investigations (at page 185) that while control will always have to be considered, it can no longer be regarded as the sole factor in determining the relationship between the parties. The Court of Appeal in TNT Worldwide Express considered that this factor had been given too much weight by the Employment Court. 2. The independence test This is the inverse of the control test. A high level of independence on the part of an employee or contractor is inconsistent with a high level of control by an employer or principal. The following factors may indicate that a person has a high level of independence: • work for other people or clients • work from his or her own premises • supply his or her own (specialised) tools or equipment • have direct responsibility for the profits and risks of the business • hire or fire whoever he or she wishes to help do the job • advertise and invoice for the work • supply the equipment, premises, and materials used • pay or account for taxes and government and professional levies. On the other hand, when some independent contractors perform work for a principal, they may agree not to work for a competitor or give away trade secrets. This alone will not make the worker an employee (it actually emphasises that the worker is usually entitled to work for others). Also, the fact that a person is contracted to one party only does not, of itself, necessarily dictate a conclusion that their legal relationship is one of employment. 3. The organisation or integration test In Enterprise Cars Ltd v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,126, Sinclair J said that this test is really whether the person is part and parcel of the organisation and not whether the work itself is necessary for the running of the business. According to this test, a job is likely to be done by an employee if it is: • integral to the business organisation • the type of work commonly done by “employees” • continuous (not a “one-off” or accessory operation) • for the benefit of the business rather than the worker. 4. Intention of the parties This test looks at the intentions of each party to the agreement regarding the nature of the relationship. The description given to a relationship by the parties to the contract is a strong, but not conclusive indication of the type of relationship that exists. The 6 fact that a written contract states that a person is an employee or an independent contractor may indicate the intention of the parties, but is not determinative. Holland J in the High Court in Challenge Realty Limited and Ors v CIR \[1990\] 3 NZLR 42 stated at pages 55-56: Obviously the Court's function in interpreting a contract is to determine the intentions of the parties. When, however, the question for determination is the legal relationship between the parties created by the contract, the expressed intention of the parties will not be determinative of the question. It is nevertheless an important factor, and if after considering all factors the exact state of the relationship is a matter of some ambiguity, may be decisive. In the present cases before me Harcourts is the only one with a written agreement. Nevertheless I would conclude that in all cases it was the intention of the parties to create an agency relationship rather than an employer/employee relationship. The question remains as to whether that result has been achieved. (emphasis added) Thus, if the actual circumstances point to an employment relationship, then simply labelling it an independent contract will not alter the actuality. In TNT Worldwide Express, a clause in the written contract which purported to override all other aspects of the agreement stated that the courier was an independent contractor. The Employment Court found that the actual conduct of the relationship showed that TNT imposed a high level of control and supervision of its staff that was inconsistent with any independence or initiative on their part. However, the Court of Appeal in reversing this decision concluded, after weighing all the circumstances, that the TNT standard form contract created a genuine independent contractor relationship. If an employment contract treats a person as an employee, for example by paying him or her at regular intervals, at a set rate, and deducting PAYE, this may indicate that there is an employment relationship. 5. The fundamental test In Market Investigations, the English Cooke J said that the fundamental test for distinguishing an employee and an independent contractor was as follows: Is the person who has engaged himself to perform these services performing them as a person in business on his own account? If the answer to that question is “yes”, then the contract is a contract for services. If the answer is “no”, then the contract is a contract of service. ... factors which may be of importance are such matters as whether the man performing the services provides his own equipment, whether he hires his own helpers, what degree of financial risk he takes, what degree of responsibility for investment and management he has, and whether and how far he has an opportunity of profiting from sound management in the performance of his task. This test was approved by the Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang and subsequently cited by four of the five judges in the Court of Appeal in TNT Worldwide Express. The fundamental test is also sometimes described as the “business test” or the “economic reality test”. In Challenge, the Court of Appeal stated at page 65: If it is helpful to look for a test or application in this case, apart from that of control, which is a key feature of the Act, we favour that suggested by Adrian Merritt, Lecturer in Industrial Law, University of New South Wales in his article "'Control' v 'Economic Reality': Defining the Contract of Employment" in (1982) 10 Australian Business Law Review 105 at p.118: 7 The issue that must be settled in today's cases is whether the worker is genuinely in business on his own account or whether he is "part and parcel of" - or "integrated into"- the enterprise of the person or organisation for whom work is performed. The test is, therefore, one of "economic reality". This test looks at factors such as: • whether the type of business or the nature of the job justifies or requires using an independent contractor • the behaviour of the parties before and after entering into the contract • if there is a time limit for completing a specific project • whether the worker can be dismissed • who is responsible for correcting sub-standard work • who is legally liable if the job goes wrong. Usually, an independent contractor agrees to be responsible for his or her work. He or she cannot usually be "dismissed", although the contract can be terminated if it is broken. Summary It must be emphasised that the “tests” outlined above are merely factors to be considered, rather than distinct tests, and it is important in each case to consider this question by balancing all the circumstances of the relationship between the parties. Often there will be competing factors that indicate differing conclusions as to whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor. In these circumstances, each of the tests described above should be applied to the facts of the case, and the resulting factors carefully and objectively weighed to determine the true nature of the relationship.
\[Interpretation guideline issued by Adjudication & Rulings on 5 January 2005, previously released as exposure draft IG0010\] WORK OF A MINOR NATURE This item was originally issued as an exposure draft for public consultation in 2000. A revised exposure draft was issued for public consultation in November 2002, and a further revised draft was issued for public consultation in May 2004. Since the publication of the most recent exposure draft, the Income Tax Act 2004 has been enacted. Two amendments have been made: • One sentence in the discussion of boundary adjustments has been replaced in order to clarify the Commissioner’s position; and • A statement has been added to the effect that no change is required as a result of the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004. SUMMARY This Interpretation Guideline sets out the Commissioner’s interpretation of specific work undertaken as part of development or division work, in the context of section CD 1(2)(f), that constitutes “work of a minor nature” and therefore excludes the proceeds of sale from being treated as gross income of the taxpayer. The guiding principle in deciding whether work done in undertaking a subdivision is of a minor nature is that it depends on an overall assessment of the facts of each case, having regard to the time, effort and expense involved. This is to be measured both in absolute terms and relative to the nature and value of the land on which the work is done. The question of whether or not work is of a minor nature requires an overall assessment of what was done in particular circumstances, rather than the application of a checklist. There are four different overlapping factors to be taken into account: • The importance of the work in relation to the physical nature and character of the land. • The total cost of the work done in both absolute and relative terms. • The nature of the professional services required. • The nature of the physical work required for the subdivision (if any). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Interpretation Guideline was prepared with reference to the Income Tax Act 1994. It has been reviewed following the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004. In the new Act, section CD 1(2)(f) is recast as sections CB 10, CB 15(1), CB 18, and CB 21. There are no intended policy changes in the relevant legislation. While there are some changes to the words used, these changes are not considered material. It was therefore 1 concluded that the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004 does not lead to any change in the law dealt with in this Interpretation Guideline. BACKGROUND Section CD 1(2)(f) includes in the gross income of a person any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of land where the following elements exist: • An undertaking or scheme (whether or not an adventure in the nature of trade or business) involving the development or division into lots of that land. • The development or division work has been carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer, on or in relation to that land. • The work is not work of a minor nature. • The undertaking or scheme was commenced within 10 years of the date on which that land was acquired by the taxpayer. ISSUES Section CD 1(2)(f) taxes the gross income from the sale of land where development or division work has been done that is more than of a minor nature. The question considered in this statement is: what factors do the Courts take into account in determining whether a development or division of land is “work of a minor nature” in terms of section CD 1(2)(f) so that the proceeds of sale are not deemed to be gross income of the taxpayer. This is determined by considering: • The background to section CD 1(2)(f) including the policy reasons for its introduction. • The context and words of section CD 1(2)(f), including interpretative provisions specific to section CD 1. • The basic principles for approaching section CD 1(2)(f), including consideration of the meaning of certain expressions used in section CD 1(2)(f): “undertaking or scheme”, “development or division into lots”, “development or division work”, and “work of a minor nature”. • The factors that the courts have weighed in deciding whether work is of a minor nature, namely: 1. The importance of the work in relation to the physical nature and character of the land. 2. The total cost of the work done, in both absolute and relative terms. 3. The nature of the professional services required. 4. The nature of the physical work required for the subdivision (if any). 2 LEGISLATION Section CD 1 states: (1) Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land, being an amount to which this section applies, is gross income. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross income of any person includes the following amounts – .... (f) Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of land where – (i) An undertaking or scheme, whether or not an adventure in the nature of trade or business, involving the development or division into lots of that land has been carried on or carried out, and that development or division work, not being work of a minor nature, has been carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer, on or in relation to that land; and (ii) That undertaking or scheme was commenced within 10 years of the date on which that land was acquired by the taxpayer: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply in any case where the development or division work involved in any undertaking or scheme (being development or division work in relation to which, apart from this proviso, this paragraph would apply if it were development or division work of other than a minor nature) is for the purposes of the creating or effecting of a development or division or any other improvement that is for use in and for the purposes of – (iii) The carrying on by the taxpayer of any business on or from the land, not being a business that consists of that undertaking or scheme; or (iv) The residing, on the land, of the taxpayer and any member of the taxpayer’s family living with the taxpayer; or (v) The deriving by the taxpayer, from or in relation to the land, of gross income of any of the kinds referred to in section CE 1(1)(e): The element requiring that the work not be of a minor nature is an exclusion in relation to the section. If the work that has been and will be undertaken by the taxpayer is “work of a minor nature”, any gains on sale will not be gross income under section CD 1(2)(f). ANALYSIS Background to section CD 1(2)(f) The provisions of section CD 1 were originally enacted as section 88AA of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. The provisions of section 88AA were inserted by section 9(1) of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973. In the Court of Appeal decision of Lowe v C of IR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006, Cooke J said (at p.61,010) that the purpose behind the addition of section 88AA was to remove the need for a profit making intention before an amount could be seen as income arising from a scheme or undertaking. He went on to note that in the same year as the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 had been amended by the inclusion of section 88AA, the 3 Property Speculation Tax Act 1973 (imposing tax on profits derived from the buying and selling of land for speculative purposes) had also been passed. He noted that under that Act an assessable profit derived from speculative land transactions could not escape tax on the ground that it was a capital gain. He went on to say: The exception of certain dispositions of farm land for farming purposes \[in section CD 1\] throws some light on the policy of the legislature. It suggests that, by contrast, Parliament had in mind, for example, vendors who were able to make profits by schemes of development or subdivision which took advantage of the growing community’s need for urban expansion into rural land. In defined circumstances they were to contribute some share of their profits to the community. And both exceptions are consistent with an intention that a profit should not automatically escape \[section CD 1(2)(f)\] or \[section CD 1(2)(g)\] merely because it was a capital profit; for cases within the exceptions would normally be instances also of capital profits. But I do not base any conclusion on the exceptions. The crucial point is that the phrase “whether or not an adventure in the nature of trade or business” reflects the very language used in McClelland’s case to describe undertakings or schemes giving rise to income according to ordinary usages and concepts. The only reasonable inference is that for the future Parliament was ruling out that criterion in cases falling within \[section CD 1(2)(f)\] or \[section CD 1(2)(g)\]. The purpose of section CD 1(2)(f) was referred to in Parliament by the then Member for Kapiti, Mr O’Flynn, at the third reading of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973. He said: It is quite wrong to claim that a man who owns a section of half or three-quarters of an acre for, say, not quite 10 years, and who cuts it up into three lots and sells two of them, would be lumbered with what the Opposition emotionally called a capital gains tax. The paragraph uses the words “not being work of a minor nature”, and it is well known that if one merely cuts up a big section the only work involved for the subdivider is having a surveyor draw up a simple plan, and often not even a plan which requires the formal depositing arrangements under the Land Transfer Act. (NZPD, Vol 387, 1973: 4,805) Richardson J in Costello v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,253 said (at p.11,256): The focus \[of the inquiry under section CD 1(2)(f)\] is on the nature of the work involved, as is apparent from the parallel provisions of \[section CD 1(2)(g)\] and the description of work within the parentheses in \[g\]. The focus is on what was actually done not on the economic benefits from doing the work. It appears that such an interpretation (focusing on the activity undertaken rather than the taxpayer’s intention to profit) gives the best effect to the intention of Parliament. The general aim of section CD 1 is that profits from trading in property or arising from schemes of development or subdivision or from improvements to land should be taxable. However, section CD 1(2)(f) is worded so as to exclude very basic subdivisions (such as the most basic and simple domestic ones) from its operation. Context and wording of section CD 1(2)(f) A brief summary of the scope of section CD 1 is provided to place section CD 1(2)(f) in its legislative context. The wording of section CD 1(2)(f) will then be looked at more closely to give an understanding as to how the “work of a minor nature” exemption fits into the section as a whole. 4 Scope of section CD 1 Section CD 1 commences by providing in subsection (1) that certain amounts derived from the sale or other disposition of land are gross income. Subsection (2) then identifies the amounts that are deemed to be gross income. It sets out seven different tests, and satisfying any one of those tests suffices. Subsections (3) to (7) provide exceptions for certain amounts that would otherwise be gross income under one or more of the paragraphs in subsection (2). A proviso to s CD 1(2)(f) extends the exceptions in subsection (3) in terms specific to section CD 1(2)(f) and adds a further exception for section CD 1(2)(f) relating to the derivation of income from real property assessable under section CE 1(1)(e). Subsections (10) to (14) are interpretative and deeming provisions, further explaining the “land” to which section CD 1 applies, and providing for associated persons transactions, mortgagee sales, and compulsory acquisition by the Crown or any local or public authority. Subsections (5), (8) and (9) are repealed. Section CD 1(1) states: Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land, being an amount to which this section applies, is gross income. Section CD 1(2) provides that amounts derived from the sale or disposition of land will be gross income if - • The land was acquired with the purpose or intention of selling or otherwise disposing of it: section CD 1(2)(a). • When the land was acquired, the taxpayer was in the business of dealing in land and either the land was acquired for the purpose of the business of dealing in land, or the land was sold or disposed of within 10 years of acquisition: section CD 1(2)(b). • When the land was acquired, the taxpayer was in the business of developing or subdividing land (not being development or division work of a minor nature), and either the land was acquired for the purposes of the business, or the land was sold or disposed of within 10 years of acquisition: section CD 1(2)(c). • • When the land was acquired, the taxpayer was in business as a builder, and the taxpayer carried out improvements of more than a minor nature to the land, and either the land was acquired for the purposes of the business, or the improved land was sold or disposed of within 10 years of completing the improvements: section CD 1(2)(d). Within 10 years of acquisition the taxpayer disposes of the land for more than it cost, and 20 % of that excess is due to any one or more of: the rules of an operative district plan or any change in those rules after the taxpayer acquired the land; or any resource consent or Planning Tribunal decision after the taxpayer acquired the land; or the removal of any limitation on the use of the land under the Resource Management Act 1991 after the taxpayer acquired the land; or the likelihood of any of these; or any similar change or occurrence. (This provision (section CD 1(2)(e)) does not apply if any other paragraph of section CD 1(2) applies.) 5 • • An undertaking or scheme commencing within 10 years of acquisition and involving the development or subdivision of the land has been carried on or carried out and the work undertaken is not work of a minor nature: section CD 1(2)(f), discussed in more detail below. Where none of the above applies, the amount was derived from a development or subdivision undertaking or scheme involving significant expenditure on certain specified types of work: section CD 1(2)(g). Section CD 1(2)(b)-(d) include an associated persons test. This means that if, when the taxpayer acquired the land, an associated person was in the business dealt with in the relevant paragraph, the amount will be included in the gross income of the taxpayer if the land was acquired for the business, even if the taxpayer was not in the business. An associated persons test is included in these provisions because they relate to sales and dispositions that are taxable on the basis of the characteristics of the taxpayer selling or disposing of the land, rather than on the nature of the transaction itself. Because the characteristics of the taxpayer are central to the taxability of the transaction, the association of the taxpayer with a person with characteristics that section CD 1(2)(b)- (d) relates to will also make the transaction taxable. The test of whether a taxpayer and another person are associated persons is applied only at the time of the acquisition of the land. The test of association is not applied at the time of the sale or other disposition of the land (see BR Pub 03/05, TIB Vol 15, No 9, September 2003). Section CD 1(2)(b), (c), and (e) are limited in scope because they apply only if the land is sold or disposed of within 10 years of acquisition, if the land was not acquired for the purpose of the taxpayer’s business. Section CD 1(2)(d) will only apply if the land is sold or disposed of within 10 years of the date on which any improvements to the land were completed, if the land was not acquired for the purpose of the taxpayer’s business of erecting buildings. In section CD 1(2)(f), the requirement is that the undertaking or scheme of subdivision must be commenced within 10 years of the date on which the land was acquired. Section CD 1(2)(a) and section CD 1(2)(g) apply without a time limit. Exemptions A transaction that may otherwise be included in gross income under section CD 1(2)(a) to (g) will be exempt if it also comes within one of the exemptions provided for in section CD 1(3), (4), (6) and (7). These exemptions relate to land used for business premises or for residential or farming purposes. The proviso to section CD 1(2)(f) excludes from section CD 1(2)(f) development, division or other improvements for the taxpayer’s use in and for certain purposes. These purposes are: carrying on any business on or from the land; residing on the land; or deriving income of a kind referred to in section CE 1(1)(e) (that is, rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land). Interpretative provisions Section CD 1(10) makes it clear that section CD 1 will apply where the whole or part of any land is sold. 6 Section CD 1(11)-(13) contain deeming provisions relating to associated persons’ transactions and the definitions of “sale” and “disposition”. The elements of section CD 1(2)(f) In discussing the elements of section CD 1(2)(f) in general terms, McMullin J said in Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 at p.61,034: In enacting sec. \[CD 1(2)(f)\] in the form in which it did, the legislature has placed some limitations upon the taxability of profits or gains derived from the sale or other disposition of land. Profits or gains are only caught by the provision where the undertaking or scheme: (a) Involves a development or division into lots that has been carried on or out, and (b) The work of development or division is not of a minor nature, and (c) The undertaking or scheme was commenced within 10 years of the date, and (d) It is outside of the matters mentioned in \[section CD 1(6) and (7)\]. The time element is particularly important. It distinguishes the class of case caught by sec. \[CD 1(2)(f)\] from cases of subdivision or development by persons who have held and used their land as farm land for a longer period of time and have found subdivision necessary or worthwhile only because of the impact of the urban sprawl. These factors, namely the time at which the subdivision is carried out and the need for development to be of more than a minor nature, suggest to me that the legislature was creating a new and separate category of taxable gains or profits, whether they be regarded as capital or not, when it introduced sec. \[CD 1(2)(f)\]. I think that there is no warrant for placing upon the subsection a construction which would limit its application to profits or gains of a traditionally income kind and the activity engaged in by appellants falls squarely within the provision. However, proceeds from a scheme or undertaking that have the characteristics outlined by McMullin J will only be included in gross income if the exemptions in section CD 1(2)(f)(iii)-(v) do not apply. The exemptions state that section CD 1(2)(f) does not apply to any development, division, or improvement that is used in, and for, the purposes of: • any business carried on by the taxpayer on or from the land with the exception, of course, of a land subdivision or development business to which section CD 1(2)(c) would apply; • a private residence for the taxpayer and any member of his or her family living with him; • the derivation of rents or other similar revenues from the land. Basic principles for approaching section CD 1(2)(f) When discussing the question of what constitutes work of a minor nature, the Courts consistently refer to the need to assess each case on its own facts. Costello v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,253 is the leading case on the meaning of the phrase “work of a minor nature” as it is the only Court of Appeal decision on the issue. 7 Richardson J (as he then was), delivering the Court of Appeal’s judgment, noted that the phrase focuses on the nature of the work undertaken, not the economic benefits that result from the work. He emphasised the need to carry out a comparative analysis of the work undertaken in determining whether the work was minor in nature. He commented, at p.11,256, that this analysis needed to be performed on a case by case basis rather than by simply applying a pre-determined or mechanical checklist: “Minor” like “lesser” is a relative expression. It becomes a question of degree. Whether the work in question is of a minor nature is a matter of fact to be determined on all the circumstances of the particular case. Every subdivision of a larger area into lots will include some survey work, the preparation of appropriate plans, obtaining planning consents and local authority permits and associated legal work including the depositing of subdivisional plans and the issue of any separate titles. \[Section CD 1(2)(f)\] recognises that the work involved in some subdivisions may be of a minor nature. Whether or not it is so in the particular case calls for an assessment of what was done which in practical terms may require consideration of the time, effort and expense involved. The statutory yardstick is not precise. It does not specify any particular criteria. It calls for an overall judgment not a mechanical application of a checklist. His Honour’s comments are an amplification of the obiter remarks he made in Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 in which he said (at p.61,020): Whether work is of a minor nature must, it seems, depend on an overall assessment of such matters as the time, effort and expense involved, measured both in absolute terms and relative to the nature and value of the land on which the work is done. Accordingly, in general terms, whether work done in undertaking a subdivision is of a minor nature depends on an overall assessment of the facts of each case, having regard to what has been done relative to the nature and value of the land involved. A matrix of cases that have considered the work of a minor nature exemption is at the end of this guideline. Meaning of “undertaking or scheme” The words “undertaking or scheme” were considered in Vuleta v CIR \[1962\] NZLR 325. Henry J at p.329 defined scheme as: a plan, design, or programme of action, hence a plan of action devised in order to attain some end; a project, an enterprise. This definition has been approved in a number of land subdivision cases, including Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101 at p.61,103 and O’Toole v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,045 at p.5,049. In Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 and Costello v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,253, it was accepted by the taxpayers that the subdivision work they had done amounted to an undertaking or scheme. In both cases the Court commented that this was a proper concession to make. Richardson J noted in Lowe v CIR (at p.61,020): More importantly for present purposes, division as an alternative to development and the limitation of the exception to work of a minor nature suggest that not a great deal is required by way of activity to constitute a plan or programme of action an undertaking or scheme under the paragraph. The Court in O’Toole stated at p.5,050 that an undertaking or scheme existed because the taxpayers: 8 entered into a project or enterprise directed towards the subdivision of their land into lots with a view to sale of those lots at a profit. The scheme existed in the plan or purpose to sell off the lots not reserved by the objectors for their own use in order to realise the maximum available profit. Meaning of “development or division into lots” In Dobson v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,025 at p.6,029 Hardie Boys J stated that the scheme of the statute made it clear that “development” is to be interpreted in a restricted sense. It means development in the sense of the preparation of the land for an intended use. It does not include the development of buildings as this is dealt with in section CD 1(2)(d). In Dobson v CIR, “development” was found to be the demolition of existing buildings and the clearing of the sites. This implies that development work entails some form of physical work undertaken in relation to the land, although no actual subdivision has been carried out (Anzamco Ltd (in liq) v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,522), whereas division into lots involves some definite action in terms of the division of land into lots. Unlike the term “development”, no physical activity involving the land needs to occur. However, there is a degree of overlapping between “development” and “division” work (Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101 at p.61,104, confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Smith v CIR (No 2) (1989) 11 NZTC 6,018 at p.6,024). The cases also show that the term “division into lots” does not require the land to be physically divided into lots (O’Toole v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,045). However, there are certain criteria that need to be fulfilled before it can be said that a division into lots has taken place. These criteria are listed in Wellington v CIR as planning and preparation of formal plans, survey work, obtaining town planning consents and local authority permits, and legal work including the deposit of subdivision plans and the issue of separate titles if required. Therefore, the term “division into lots” requires, at a minimum, a level of activity designed to facilitate the division of land. Boundary Adjustments In respect of a boundary adjustment (relocation, rearrangement, or realignment) it is the Commissioner’s view that a voluntary boundary adjustment to surveyed boundaries between contiguous lots of Land Transfer land will amount to “division into lots” for the purposes of section CD 1(2)(f), even where there is no increase in the number of lots. A boundary adjustment requires the existing boundaries to be erased and new boundaries to be created although there is no increase in the number of lots. The work is exactly the same type of work that is carried out in a subdivision where the number of lots is increased. A boundary adjustment therefore divides the land. Whether it was previously differently divided into lots is not a relevant consideration on the straightforward language of section CD 1(2)(f)(i), and in Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 (CA, Cooke, Richardson and McMullin JJ), both Cooke J and Richardson J indicated that the natural meaning of the words was to be adopted in construing section CD 1(2)(f). It is therefore the Commissioner’s view that, if a lot of land owned by a person is altered by transferring a part of the lot to, and including it in the title for other adjoining land owned by, another person there is a division into lots of the first- mentioned lot. Furthermore, section CD 1(13) provides that section CD 1 applies where the land sold is the whole or part of any land to which section CD 1 applies or the whole or part any such land together with any other land. Therefore, if the boundaries between adjoining 9 lots of land owned by the same person are altered, there is a division into lots of the land comprised of those adjoining lots; and if any of the resulting lots is sold or otherwise disposed of any amount derived on the sale or other disposition will be gross income under section CD 1(2)(f) if the other requirements of section CD 1(2)(f) are satisfied. However in many cases a boundary adjustment will involve nothing more than minimal survey and legal work, and no physical work on the land. That is clearly work of a minor nature, so that many straightforward boundary adjustments are not within section CD 1(2)(f). In Case S1 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,001, 7,004 Barber DJ said that a boundary adjustment was deemed not to be a subdivision. In the Commissioner’s view, the context of this statement, including its place in the decision under the heading “The evidence and the facts” and the surrounding discussion of the taxpayer’s property division activities, shows that this statement is not intended as Judge Barber’s analysis of the law or as a general proposition of law. The statement merely reflects the evidence given on the reasons for the taxpayer’s decision to pursue, and later not to pursue, a boundary adjustment. It is also considered that an interpretation that such a boundary adjustment or relocation was not a “division into lots” or “division work” could potentially give rise to anomalies in the operation of the section. For example, a land owner who owns a 10 acre block and carries out a subdivision of 5 acres would be subject to the provisions of section CD 1(2)(f) as this activity would be a “division into lots” or “division work”, whereas a land owner who owns a 10 acre block with two existing titles (a 1 acre block and a 9 acre block) and amends the existing titles to comprise of two 5 acre blocks would not be subject to the provisions of section CD 1(2)(f). On the proper construction of section CD 1(2)(f), a boundary adjustment or relocation is a division into lots. The primary test in section CD 1(2)(f) turns on the work involved in the development or division scheme. A boundary adjustment involves similar work to other subdivision of land, and produces a similar outcome. It would therefore seem logical in terms of the underlying policy of the provision that section CD 1(2)(f) applies in the same way to a boundary adjustment as it does to other subdivision of land. A boundary adjustment where any physical work is carried out could also fall within the broad definition of “development work” for the purposes of section CD 1(2)(f) (see Anzamco (in liq) v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,522, Dobson v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,025 and Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101). A subdivision of land will satisfy the requirements of section CD 1(2)(f) as it will be an undertaking or scheme (being a plan of action directed toward some end) and it will also constitute division into lots as required by that section. As Richardson J noted in Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006, (at p.61,020): More importantly for present purposes, division as an alternative to development and the limitation of the exception to work of a minor nature suggest that not a great deal is required by way of activity to constitute a plan or programme of action an undertaking or scheme under the paragraph. 10 Costs to be specifically included or excluded in the phrase “development or division work” The meaning of “development or division work” includes any type of work done on or in relation to the land, such as (but not limited to) professional fees (surveyor, solicitor, valuations), fencing, demolishing buildings, clearing the site, the cost of installing power or water onto a site, and creating a driveway or entranceway. Some costs incurred by subdividers and specifically included or excluded by the Courts are outlined below. Cost of constructing any building In Dobson v CIR, Hardie Boys J held that development work in section CD 1(2)(f) does not include the construction of buildings, as income derived from this activity is assessed under section CD 1(2)(d). Therefore, the cost of constructing any building on the land being subdivided should be excluded in deciding whether or not the work done is of a minor nature. Sometimes it can be difficult to determine whether the work is preliminary development or division work (and therefore not excluded in deciding whether or not the work done is of a minor nature) or part of the construction process. In Dobson Hardie Boys J concluded (at p.6,030): ... demolition, clearing of the sites, surveys, the deposit of plans, the preparation of cross leases, the obtaining of composite titles, were all part of, and together comprised, the development and division work involved. All else was part of the construction of the new flats. Accordingly, the demolition and clearing of the sites was regarded as preliminary work that was within the phrase “development and division into lots”. Whether an item of development work is preliminary to construction work or is part of the construction process is a question of fact to be determined in each case. For example, drainage work preparatory to the construction process, and drainage which is part of the building itself. Dobson was followed in Case R7 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,035. In that case an old house was purchased, placed on the site of the subdivision, and partly renovated. The Authority held on the basis of the facts before him that the development and subdivision work carried out on the property was work of a minor nature. Barber DJ did not regard the purchase and placement of the house on the site as being development work. He excluded the necessary minor excavation work for the foundations of the house from consideration when he weighed up whether or not there had been work of a minor nature. Where a building existed on the land before the subdivision was begun, it is suggested that it should be included in the value of the land against which the cost of the subdivision work is measured. This conclusion is inferred from the facts in Wellington v CIR, which Hardie Boys J cited with approval in Dobson (although not on this point), and with the general principle that once a building is attached to the land it becomes a part of the land. In Wellington v CIR Ongley J held that work costing $9,080, in 11 relation to the land and buildings that cost $12,000, could hardly be said to be of a minor nature. Financial contributions as a condition of a resource consent A financial contribution of either money or land may be imposed as a condition on a resource consent under the Resource Management Act 1991 (the “RMA”), as a charge against land-owners who are subdividing. The financial contribution will be specified in the relevant district plan, and can be a significant proportion of the total subdivision costs. It can often end up being more than half the cost of the subdivision. The planning consent provisions of the RMA repealed those of the Local Government Act 1974. Under the RMA financial contributions in the form of money relate broadly to environmental management issues such as the management of natural and physical resources. A financial contribution may also be made in the form of an actual transfer of land to the Council. The cost of dividing off additional lots of land as a financial contribution may increase the cost of a subdivision. However, this will not be an issue in cases dealing with work of a minor nature. Land is only given in large developments, as in a small development the amount of land cut off as a financial contribution would be very small. Therefore, in small subdivisions, where the exemption for work of a minor nature will apply, a financial contribution would be required generally in the form of money only. i. Financial contributions in the context of section CD 1(2)(f) Case D24 (1979) 4 NZTC 60,597 is the only case directly considering whether a financial contribution should be taken into account in deciding whether work is “development or division work” in section CD 1(2)(f). A.J. Lloyd Martin said (at p.60,607): The amount payable to a local authority as “Reserve Contribution” cannot in my opinion be considered as amounts payable for “work” done. Such sums become payable as the result of the subdivision of land into lots but the contributions are not part of the costs involved in creating such subdivisions. He went on to hold that expenditure incurred in the preparation and deposit of the necessary land transfer plan could not be considered as “work” for the purposes of the section. Wellington v CIR overruled Case D24 on the question of whether surveying of the land and preparation of the land transfer plan constitute “development or division work” for the purposes of the “work of a minor nature” test. However, Ongley J did not comment on what A.J. Lloyd Martin had said on the question of reserve contributions, although his list of the minimum work required for a subdivision in Wellington v CIR included the category “obtaining town planning consents and local authority permits”. 12 ii. Financial contributions in the context of section CD 1(2)(g) Aubrey v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,765 (applied in Mee v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,073), a High Court case dealing with the meaning of “work involving significant expenditure” under section CD 1(2)(g)), supports the argument that Ongley J’s category of work involving “obtaining town planning consents and local authority permits” means only the professional work involved in these activities. In Aubrey, Tompkins J had said (at p.61,769): The Crown contended that a reserve fund contribution paid in cash would also be in the second category \[note: the second category to which Tompkins J was referring was the second category of work listed in the definition of ‘division or development work’ in section CD 1(2)(g). The work listed in the brackets following the words ‘division or development work’ could be divided into two categories. The first consisted of “earthworks, contouring, levelling, drainage, roading, curbing or channelling”. The second category was described as “any other work, service, or amenity customarily undertaken or provided in major projects”\], because the provision of reserves was an amenity customarily provided in major projects. It must be remembered that all the words in brackets are describing the kind of development or division work that has been carried out or carried on or in relation to the land. The division work involves the preparation and obtaining of the requisite approval of the scheme plan of the subdivision, then the lodging in the Land Registry Office of the deposited plan. The legal and survey costs involve expenditure on that work. But although a reserve fund contribution may be required to obtain the approval of the subdivision, I do not consider that it can be regarded as an expenditure on that work. Nor do I consider that it can be regarded as an expenditure on an amenity customarily provided in major projects. Given that Tompkins J considered that a reserve fund contribution could not be considered as expenditure on “division work”, it is the Commissioner’s view that A.J. Lloyd Martin’s analysis in Case D24, stating that the amount paid as a reserve contribution does not count as “work”, is still good law. Therefore, financial contributions of money and/or land as a condition of resource consent are excluded from the meaning of “development or division work”. Environmental assessments as part of resource consent Another requirement of resource consent is that the applicant must also provide “an assessment of any actual or potential effect that the activity may have on the environment, and the ways in which any adverse effects may be mitigated”: section 88(4)(b) of the RMA. The Commissioner considers that the meaning of “development or division work” includes any work involved in obtaining an environmental assessment as part of resource consent. The Commissioner considers that any subdivision will constitute an undertaking or scheme involving development or division into lots for the purposes of section CD 1(2)(f). Meaning of “work ... carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer” The Courts have not addressed the meaning of the words “work ... carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer” in the context of section CD 1(2)(f)(i) or its predecessor legislation. However in Mee v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,073 (HC), Hardie Boys J considered the words: 13 ... development or division work ... has been carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer on or in relation to that land. in section 88AA(1)(e) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (now section CD 1(2)(g)). One matter in dispute was whether a payment (as a condition of the subdivision consent) of an agreed sum to the territorial authority for roading, water and sewage was within this description. Hardie Boys J found that it was not, saying (among other things): ... Execution of this scheme did not involve the taxpayer in this particular work. All that was required of him was the payment of money to enable the Council to do it at a later date. When the Council did eventually do it, it did not do it on Mr Mee’s behalf. It was not acting as his agent, or in any other representative capacity, but independently, in the fulfilment of its own duties. ... It is inferred from this that work performed by a local authority in fulfilment of its own statutory functions is not “work ... carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer” in terms of section CD 1(2)(g). Because section CD 1(2)(f) was originally enacted at the same time as, and as part of the same legislative scheme as section CD 1(2)(g), and because the two paragraphs deal with development or division work involved in the development or division into lots of land, it is presumed that a court would adopt the same view if the question arose in relation to section CD 1(2)(f). Resource consent application fees A taxpayer subdividing land may require consent under the Resource Management Act 1991 to do so (a “resource consent”). The Resource Management Act 1991 provides for territorial authorities to accept and consider applications for resource consents. The territorial authority receives, processes and grants or declines the resource consent application in fulfilment of its function of controlling the actual or potential effects of the use, development, or protection of land, of the subdivision of land, of the emission of noise, and of the actual or potential effects of activities in relation to the surface of rivers and lakes (Resource Management Act 1991, section 31). Territorial authorities charge the applicant for this work. The work may benefit the taxpayer (if the resource consent is granted), but it also benefits neighbours of the land in question by ensuring that the proposed use of the land accords with the local district plan and by providing them with an opportunity to influence the matters for which the resource consent is sought. Because the territorial authority receives, processes and grants or declines the resource consent application in fulfilment of its own statutory function, that work is not “work ... carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer” in terms of section CD 1(2)(f)(i). Consequentially, resource consent application fees should not be included in the costs taken into account when considering whether the development or division work is work of a minor nature. “Work of a minor nature” In Costello v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,253, Richardson J stated (at 11,256): Every subdivision of a larger area into lots will include some survey work, the preparation of appropriate plans, obtaining planning consents and local authority permits and associated legal work including the depositing of subdivisional plans and the issue of any separate titles. \[Section 14 CD 1(2)(f)\] recognises that the work involved in some subdivisions may be of a minor nature. \[Emphasis added\] On this basis, therefore, it can be inferred that the elementary level of survey, legal and planning work necessary to complete a basic subdivision would of itself be considered to be work of a minor nature. Any other conclusion would mean that the work of a minor nature exemption to paragraph (f) would not serve any purpose. This is also consistent with what Mr O’Flynn, the then Member for Kapiti, at the third reading of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973, stated when he said: It is quite wrong to claim that a man who owns a section of half or three-quarters of an acre for, say, not quite 10 years, and who cuts it up into three lots and sells two of them, would be lumbered with what the Opposition emotionally called a capital gains tax. This indicates that the purpose of the work of a minor nature exception to section CD 1(2)(f) is to make sure the basic subdivision requiring only minimal work would not be taxable. It is important to bear this in mind when approaching the work of a minor nature exemption. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that some subdivision schemes or undertakings must be able to comprise work of a minor nature. Factors the courts have taken into account when deciding whether the development or division work is work of a minor nature are discussed below. FACTORS THE COURTS HAVE WEIGHED IN DECIDING WHETHER WORK IS OF A MINOR NATURE While the courts have said that whether or not work is of a minor nature is a relative expression requiring assessment of what was done in particular circumstances, rather than the application of a checklist, they have also referred to a number of factors to be taken into account in determining the issue. The remainder of this guideline will focus on how each of these overlapping factors has been interpreted and applied. They are: • The importance of the work in relation to the physical nature and character of the land. • The total cost of the work done, in both absolute and relative terms. • The nature of the professional services required. • The nature of the physical work required for the subdivision (if any). 1. The importance of the work in relation to the physical nature and character of the land The importance of the work in relation to the physical nature and character of the land is a relevant factor in deciding whether work is of a minor nature. However, it should be noted that physical change to the land is not necessary for the work to be of more than a minor nature. This factor was discussed in Dobson v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,025. In this case the taxpayer had demolished the dwellings on three properties and replaced the dwellings 15 with a number of new flats. The subdivision work involved demolition, clearing of the sites, surveys, plan deposits, preparation of cross-leases and obtaining composite titles. Considered all together, this work could not be considered “minor”. Hardie Boys J found that the most significant feature of the development was the demolition of buildings on the properties, and commented (at p.6,030): This was development work, and it was not minor, whatever its cost may have been, for it altered the whole character of each property, allowing for its complete redevelopment, which would not otherwise have been possible. Hardie Boys J said that the land to be considered, when looking at the importance of the work to the nature and character of the land, was the original land and not the newly created lot. While it is arguable that the creation of an additional lot is more than a minor adjustment to the land, the courts have not ordinarily found the creation of a new lot per se to be a major change to the nature and character of the land. Generally, something more has been needed. In Dobson it was thought that the mere bisection of a lot was of itself work of a minor nature. Hardie Boys J said (at p.6,030): I doubt that the subdivision at Lyttleton/Edinburgh Streets, which involved simply the bisection of a virtually rectangular lot, was of itself more than work of a minor nature, and possibly the same might be said of that at MacKenzie Avenue, although there the access strip to the street meant that two boundary lines, connected by an arc, were required. In Case E90 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,471 Bathgate DJ said (at p.59,476): ...I consider that the nature and effect of the work in the way of development or division into lots must be a significant factor in ascertaining whether or not that work is of a minor nature in relation to that land....In this case one single piece of land in one title has been subdivided, there has been a division of the building into three major units, and two smaller units, with the definition of a further piece of land as common property.... I consider all this is not “work of a minor nature” for that particular piece of land. Nor has O satisfied me on the balance of probabilities that the division work alone is of a minor nature. It has been suggested by some commentators that this appears to confuse the effect of the subdivision work with the extent of that work. It is the Commissioner’s view that: • Section CD 1(2)(f) requires consideration of whether the work is not work of a minor nature – that is, it addresses the work itself and not the effects of the work; and • In considering whether physical work is not work of a minor nature, the effect of that physical work is a relevant consideration, though it is only a consideration and it is not determinative. This may be contrasted with the consideration of legal and professional work. It is explained later in this interpretation guideline that in considering whether legal or professional work is not work of a minor nature, one must consider the amount and complexity of the work (regardless of the costs incurred for it). 16 2. The total cost of the work done, in both absolute and relative terms Richardson J in Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 stated that whether work is of a minor nature must depend on an overall assessment of the work involved, including the cost, as measured both in absolute (or total) and relative terms. (i) Total cost of the work to be done in absolute terms The court can take into account the total cost of the work to be done in absolute terms. The following table lists cases in chronological order (as to when the work was carried out), the total cost of the work with which the court was concerned, and the result in each case. Wellington v CIR (1972) $9,000 Not minor O’Toole v CIR (1974) $7,000 Not minor Case E41 (1982) $4,500 Not minor Case P61 (1985) $6,334 Minor in nature Costello v CIR (1991) $1,700 Not minor Not all cases make reference to the absolute amount expended in subdividing. In Dobson v CIR, Case N59 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,457, K v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,216, Case R7 and Case E90 the Court did not refer to the total amount incurred by the taxpayer in the development or division. It should be noted that the findings reached in these cases were not solely determined according to the value of the work incurred. Other factors were also considered. For example, in O’Toole although the costs were largely limited to the surveying fees, the amount of time involved was reflected in the account for almost $8,000 and this amount could not be considered a minor amount for surveying fees. (The difference between this figure and the figure in the table is explained by the fact that the original account tendered by the surveyor was $8,000, but the taxpayer negotiated a reduction.) Tompkins J stated in K v CIR that cost is one, but not the only, factor to be taken into account in deciding whether or not work is of a minor nature. In that particular case no legal costs were incurred because Mr K, being a solicitor, was able to and did carry out the work without charging himself or his wife a fee. In analysing cost on an absolute basis there is no figure that will determine the issue definitively. It is a matter of degree. For example, in Costello it did not assist the taxpayer that the professional fees for the whole subdivision were a modest $1,700. The Court of Appeal, when reviewing the work required to complete the subdivision, as opposed to cost of the work, was of the view that it was of more than a minor nature. On the other hand, in Case P61 the subdivisional survey costs were $6,334 in 1984 dollars. Barber DJ did not find that this expenditure jeopardised a decision that the work was minor in nature. Although the work is to be measured in both absolute and relative terms, the Commissioner considers that there will always be a point where the absolute value of the sum expended is so high this factor alone will indicate that the work is more than minor. Conversely, the amount may be so low that as an absolute figure the amount 17 could in no circumstances be seen to be more than minor. However, this would only occur in extreme circumstances. As discussed below, although the amount of money spent is not enough to make the work of more than a minor nature on an absolute basis, the amount spent may indicate that there is more than work of a minor nature in relative terms. (ii) Cost of the work done in relative terms In his judgment in the Court of Appeal in Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 (CA, Cooke, Richardson and McMullin JJ), 61,028, Richardson J said: Whether the work is of a minor nature must, it seems, depend on an overall assessment of such matters as the time, effort and expense involved, measured both in absolute terms and relative to the nature and value of the land on which the work is done. Thirteen years later, giving judgment for the Court of Appeal in Costello v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,253 (CA, Richardson, Casey and Ellis JJ), Richardson J made reference to the total professional charges being “very small relative to land values”, not in relation to the cost of the land. In K & Anor v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,216 (HC, Tompkins J), Tompkins J says “Whether the work is of a minor nature is a matter of fact to be determined depending on all the circumstances of the particular case. Cost is one, but not the only factor.” Tompkins J goes on to find that the work involved in that case was not work of a minor nature. He considers the cost of the work, but finds that it is not a relevant consideration because some of the work was performed by one of the taxpayers at no cost. However in Case E41 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,255 (TRA, Barber DCJ), Barber DCJ considers the relative amount of certain development and division costs, including fencing work carried out by the taxpayer, and finds that it was not work of a minor nature. It is unexceptionable that the cost of the work performed by the taxpayer himself is ignored in such a case, for recognition of further costs could only have increased the relative significance of the development and division work. In the High Court and the Taxation Review Authority, the cost of the work has been compared with, or it has been suggested that the cost should be compared with, – • The cost of the land (Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101 (HC, Ongley J)); or • The “ultimate value achieved” (Dobson v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,025 (HC, Hardie Boys J)); or • The sale price of the land or some of it (Case E41 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,255 (TRA, Barber DCJ); Case P61 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,416 (TRA, Barber DJ)). There are no other High Court judgments or TRA decisions dealing with the question (in O’Toole v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,045 (HC, Davison CJ) the comparison was made by a witness, not by Davison CJ). 18 In the Commissioner’s view, whether the development and division work is work of a minor nature is a matter of fact to be determined depending on all the circumstances of the particular case, and relative cost is one, but not the only, factor to be considered. When considering relative cost, the cost of the work should be compared with the land in its state and value at the commencement of the work. That is because the cost of the work is to be compared with “the value of the land on which the work is done” (see the reference to Lowe, above), and drawing the comparison with the value of the land at any other time risks distortion due to alterations to the land and movement in land values. If the value of the land at that time is not available, it may be appropriate to compare the cost of the development or division work with the cost or the sale price of the land if the purchase or sale was relatively close in time to the commencement of the work. However, even if the purchase or sale was relatively close in time to the commencement of the work, intervening events might give reason to expect significant price movements so that the comparison might be misleading, and in such circumstances the alternative comparisons would not be appropriate. And if the work is performed at no cost, the work itself remains the important consideration. It is necessary to keep in mind the statutory test. The cases considered above were not decided on the cost of the development or division work alone. The statutory test is whether the work is work of a minor nature. The comparison of the cost of the work with the value of the land uses monetary value as a basis for comparison between subjects (the work and the thing on or in relation to which it is done) that might otherwise be incommensurable. In any particular case a cost comparison may not be determinative. And if a cost comparison is significant, other bases of comparison may be also be appropriate or more appropriate. As noted earlier, the findings reached in these cases were not solely determined according to the cost of the work done. The other factors that go towards determining whether the subdivision work is work of a minor nature are now considered. 3. The nature of the professional services required The cases establish that the more the professional services utilised in undertaking a subdivision, the less the likelihood that it will be work of a minor nature. For example, there may be the need to employ an engineer or a valuer in order to undertake the subdivision. Alternatively, it may only be necessary to employ a solicitor and a surveyor in order to undertake the subdivision, but the work undertaken might be of a high degree of complexity and/or require a large number of hours to complete. In Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101 at p.61,103, Ongley J referred to the minimum work needed to complete a subdivision where no physical work is carried out: Where no physical work of division is undertaken the work involved in division of a larger area into lots nevertheless must include at least the following: (i) planning and preparation of formal plans, (ii) survey work, (iii) obtaining town planning consents and local authority permits, and 19 (iv) legal work including deposit of subdivisional plans and issue of separate titles if required. The fulfilment of these requirements will require the services of a surveyor and a solicitor. The need for professional services may go beyond these minimum requirements. For example, in Costello v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,285 (HC); (1994) 16 NZTC 11,253 (CA) the taxpayers needed the services of three different professional disciplines in order to complete their subdivision. How complex is the professional work? The courts have been willing to accept that the work is minor in nature only when the actual work involved is simple in nature: Case P61, Case R7. When additional work, beyond minimal surveying and conveyancing, is required for completion of the scheme, and that work is a fundamental and integral component of the subdivision, it seems that such work would be considered work of more than a minor nature. If any conclusion can be drawn, it is that a basic subdivision necessitating only the barest professional services will be work of a minor nature. The introduction of an additional activity that is an integral part of the undertaking may be enough to make the work more than of a minor nature: K v CIR, Costello v CIR, O’Toole v CIR, Case N59. In Costello Speight J noted in the High Court that substantive work was required from the surveyor but those fees only amounted to a modest $1,104. His services were required for: • the receipt of instructions • searching the title and ascertaining survey information • measuring the flats and calculating the areas • dividing the appropriate plans into individual holdings and delineating common areas • obtaining consents from the chief surveyor in accordance with the Unit Titles Act 1972 • depositing the plan in the Land Transfer Office. The surveyor’s evidence was that it was a very straightforward job as the building was single-storeyed, thus no cross section of overlapping entitlements was required, and the angles in the building were all right-angles and parallel with land boundaries. However, inspection of the plan produced showed that there were more than 30 separate areas delineated, with their respective entitlements. Work was also done by a valuer in accordance with the requirements of the Unit Titles Act 1972, so that an appropriate valuation could be made for each unit. Speight J held that while the fees charged by the professionals were modest, a complicated series of steps was undertaken by the three separate disciplines of law, surveying, and valuation. The scheme could not have been finalised and unit titles made available for issue unless each of the steps was accurately completed. The number of the lots and the complicated nature of the plan as presented, and the fact that the unit title procedure was more complicated than the earlier 20 crossleasing procedure, led Speight J to the conclusion that it was not work of a minor nature. The taxpayers appealed to the Court of Appeal: (1994) 16 NZTC 11,253. The taxpayers argued, among other things, that Speight J: • appeared to be influenced by his conclusion that the unit title procedure involved was a complicated one requiring a considerable variety of professional services and in doing so placed undue weight on those factors. Counsel for the taxpayers submitted that there was no evidence before the High Court supporting the view that subdivision by way of a unit title was inherently more complicated than cross- leasing; • had placed undue weight on the number of lots resulting from the unit title procedure and the plan of division; • had placed unjustified weight on the distinction between historical cross-leasing procedures and the procedures contained in the Unit Titles Act. Counsel for the taxpayers emphasised that non-physical subdivisional work will always involve some survey work, the preparation of formal plans, obtaining town planning consent and local authority permits, and some legal work. This would always include depositing subdivision plans and the issuing of separate titles. The Court of Appeal held that although the surveyor’s fee was modest and the total professional charges were very small relative to the land values, the job took the surveyor 36 hours in order to achieve the object of the subdivision into 9 lots. (The fees charged by the solicitor and surveyor were only $560 plus $13 disbursements and $1,012 plus $92 respectively. The valuer whose job it was to allocate percentages of the total value to each of the respective 9 units did not charge a fee and received a small gift.) The Court held that Speight J neither erred in his overall approach to the question nor in his conclusion. Therefore, it was not work of a minor nature. K v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,216 involved complex legal work in the subdivision of two properties. Tompkins J said (at 8,221): There would also have been considerable legal work in the deposit of each of the subdivisional plans and the issue of the separate titles that were going to be required in order to carry out the scheme involving, as it did, the sale of the home units. In this particular case no legal costs were incurred because Mr K, being a solicitor, was able and did carry out the work without charging himself or his wife a fee. Similarly in Case N59 the subdivision work was held not to be work of a minor nature due to the considerable legal work involved. In Case P61 two lots of land were amalgamated and then subdivided. The taxpayer’s subdivision expenditure comprised only survey and legal work. It was submitted by the taxpayer that the only cost that was incurred in the subdivisional work was $6,334 relating to the survey work. 21 The subdivision involved the creation of a number of easements to give access and to convey power and water. Barber DJ ascertained that these easements were effected by way of the standard Memorandum of Easements procedure in reliance on the Land Transfer Act and were quite straightforward from a legal point of view, needing little time, and was not more than work of a minor nature. The amount of the legal costs was not known because the costs had been incorporated into the taxpayer’s legal fees for each sale. Barber DJ stated that he understood that the legal fees relating to the subdivisional work were modest. The Judge noted that the subdivision work in this case comprised much of the type of work listed by Ongley J in Wellington. However, he said that the degree of such work that had been needed was relatively much less in relation to this particular subdivision, and therefore the work was of a minor nature. Case R7 also concerned an amalgamation. The Judge referred to the comments of Speight J in Costello v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,285 that whether work is of a minor nature is a matter of fact to be determined on all the circumstances of the particular case. In Case R7 the judge held that the development and subdivision work was of a minor nature because it involved uncomplicated and quite minor survey work and legal work. In other cases more complex professional work, coupled with additional physical work, has lead the courts to conclude that the work was not of a minor nature. This will be dealt with in the next section. 4. The nature of the physical work required for the subdivision (if any) If physical work (in addition to professional work) is required to carry out the subdivision, the work required to complete the subdivision will be more than that of the most basic subdivision. However, the mere presence of physical work in a subdivisional scheme will not necessarily mean that it is more than work of a minor nature. The physical work undertaken should simply be weighed along with the other factors to be taken into account in deciding whether or not the work is of a minor nature, bearing in mind the fact that physical work will indicate that something more than the most basic subdivision is being undertaken. In Wellington v C of IR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101, Ongley J indicated that division work in relation to land includes: • Physical work such as fencing, planting, and other work directly related to land; and • Non-physical types of work, e.g. survey and legal work. Other physical work involved in a subdivision could include the connection of water, sewerage, telephone, and electricity. Access in the form of roading or driveways may also need to be created. In Case E41 the taxpayer carried on a farming business on a 279-acre property, and in 1972 decided to create a subdivision of six lots out of a block of 177 acres. To carry out the subdivision he organised a survey and the issue of titles, and did some fencing 22 work, which was the only physical work required. The survey and legal costs to the taxpayer were $1,160 and $39 respectively. In relation to the fencing, the taxpayer cleared and burnt off gorse and put in 190 chains of fencing at a cost of $3,303. Three of the lots were sold after the predecessor to section CD 1(2)(f) came into effect. The taxpayer submitted that the subdivision involved development or division work of a minor nature. He contended the fencing work should not be taken into consideration, because it related to the renewal of existing boundaries and was not part of the subdivision work. On the facts of this case, although the division work was not that extensive by comparison with other subdivisions, the combination of the survey, legal and fencing work was something more than of a minor nature. It was held that the fencing work was a necessary part of the subdivision and was not effected as part of the consideration for the sale price. Of the 190 chains of fencing erected, about 62 chains were for the replacement of existing fences, as many of these were not stock-proof and over 50 years old. Only 120 chains were new fencing. Of these, 63 chains of the new fencing bounded the farm retained. The fencing work cost $3,303, of which $2,408 was for materials and $895 for a fencing contractor. The taxpayer had done much of the work himself, including removing the gorse on the boundaries with a tractor and rear mounted blade. This took about two or three days of non-continuous work. The gorse was then burnt. Barber DJ said that the fencing work done was more than of a minor nature even after allowing for the renewal in common boundary aspects. The physical work involved in the division was the fencing work, the cost of which has already been referred to, and the survey work the fees of which were approximately 1% of the sale of the three lots. It was not correct to say that the fencing work was part of the sale rather than the subdivision, because the sale would not have been completed unless the fencing condition had been fulfilled. However, a lack of physical work does not necessarily mean that the work will be of a minor nature. For example, in O’Toole v CIR no physical work was done and yet the work was held to be of more than a minor nature. Any physical work done on the property to be subdivided must be division or development work before it can be taken into account in deciding whether or not the work is of a minor nature. In Case P61 some previous orchard development work had been done involving felling trees, drainage, and irrigation. These costs had been written off in the orchard accounts some years before the subdivision. Water pipes and power were laid for a house erected by the taxpayer after acquiring the property for use mainly as an orchard enterprise. Barber DJ said that the previous work done did not form part of the undertaking or scheme of the subdivision. It was done for a different purpose and the subdivision was entitled to the benefit of it. 23 CONCLUSIONS The meaning of “development or division work” includes any type of work done on or in relation to the land, such as (but not limited to) professional fees (surveyor, solicitor, valuations), fencing, demolishing buildings, clearing the site, the cost of installing power or water onto a site, and creating a driveway or entranceway. Work performed by a local authority in fulfilment of its own statutory functions and for the benefit of others as well as the taxpayer is not “work ... carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer” in terms of section CD 1(2)(f)(i). Costs to be specifically included or excluded in the development or division work: • Where a building exists on the land before the subdivision commences, it should be included in the value of the original land against which the cost of the subdivision is measured: Wellington. • The cost of constructing any building on the land being subdivided should be excluded from the total cost of the development or division work: Dobson. • Financial contributions of money and/or land as a condition of resource consent are excluded from the total cost of the development or division work. • The meaning of “development or division work” includes any work involved in obtaining an environmental assessment (section 88(4)(b) of the RMA) as part of resource consent. • The work undertaken by a local authority in considering a resource consent application is not “work ... carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer”. Resource consent application fees payable to a territorial authority for the development or division into lots of land are therefore excluded from the total cost of the work. The general guiding principle in deciding whether work done in undertaking a subdivision is of a minor nature is that it depends on an overall assessment of the facts of each case, having regard to the time, effort and expense involved, measured in both absolute and relative terms: Lowe v CIR, Costello v CIR. The courts have said that the question of whether or not work is of a minor nature is a relative expression requiring assessment of what was done in particular circumstances, rather than the application of a checklist. However, the courts have referred to four different overlapping factors to be taken into account in determining this question: 1. The importance of the work in relation to the physical nature and character of the land. • Physical change to the land is not necessary for the work to be of more than a minor nature. • Where the actual work carried out on the property is substantial this will indicate that the work is more than minor in nature. 24 • While substantial change to the physical character of the land will probably indicate that the work is more than minor in nature, the lack of any change to the physical character of the land may also be a factor that the courts take into account in deciding whether work is of a minor nature: Case P61. • The land to be considered is the original land and not the newly created lot: Dobson. • It is not necessary to look at the effect of the work on the legal status of the property, only the impact or effect of such work on the physical nature and character of the property. 2. The total cost of the work done, in both absolute and relative terms. • Where a comparison of the cost of the work and the value of the land is relevant to the question whether work is work of a minor nature, the comparison should be between development or division costs incurred and arms’ length prices and values for the land about the same time, or over a period of time when price movements (whether generally, locally, or specific to the site) are not material to the comparison. However there may be circumstances where a court would find a comparison between the cost of the work and the cost or the sale price of the land to be relevant (for example where the comparison is quite clear and the time between the purchase or sale and incurring the expenditure on the work is not so long as to suggest that the two are not comparable). • Cost is only one factor to be taken into account in deciding whether or not work is of a minor nature: K v CIR. • In analysing cost on an absolute basis, there is no figure that will determine the issue definitively. It is a matter of degree. • In exceptional circumstances, the absolute value of the sum expended may be so high that this factor alone will indicate that the work is more than minor. Conversely, the amount may be so low that as an absolute figure the amount could in no circumstances be seen to be more than minor. • The amount of money spent in undertaking a subdivision may be enough to indicate that there is work of more than a minor nature in relative terms, even if it is not enough to indicate that it is work of more than a minor nature on an absolute basis. 3. The nature of the professional services required. • The cases establish that the more professional services are utilised in undertaking a subdivision, the less likely that it will be work of a minor nature. • The minimum work involved to complete a subdivision where no physical work is needed will require the services of a surveyor and a solicitor: Wellington. However, the need for professional services may go beyond these minimum requirements: Costello. 25 • Work that is simple in nature is more likely to be minor in nature: Case P61, Case R7. • When additional work, beyond minimal surveying and conveyancing, is required for completion of the scheme, and that work is a fundamental and integral component of the subdivision, it seems that such work would be considered work of more than a minor nature. • The introduction of an additional activity that is an integral part of the undertaking, may be enough to make the work more than of a minor nature: K v CIR, Costello v CIR, O’Toole v CIR, Case N59. 4. The nature of the physical work required for the subdivision (if any). • If physical work (in addition to professional work) is required to carry out the subdivision, the work required to complete the subdivision will be more than that of the most basic subdivision. However, the mere presence of physical work in a subdivisional scheme will not necessarily mean that it is more than work of a minor nature. The physical work undertaken should simply be weighed along with the other factors to be taken into account in deciding whether or not the work is of a minor nature, bearing in mind the fact that physical work will indicate that something more than the most basic subdivision is being undertaken: Case E41, O’Toole v CIR. • Any physical work done on the property to be subdivided must be division or development work before it can be taken into account in deciding whether or not the work was of a minor nature: Case P61. • Previous physical work done for a different purpose will not form part of the undertaking or scheme of the subdivision, and therefore the subdivision will be entitled to the benefit of it without it counting as development or division work: Case P61. EXAMPLES Note: While each fact situation must be considered individually, the following examples may be of assistance by way of illustration. These examples consider only the work of a minor nature requirement and do not consider other requirements of section CD 1(2)(f) or any other matter that may determine the taxpayer’s liability. Example 1 A taxpayer owns a 75-acre farm. In addition to the house she lives in, there is an old farmhouse situated at one end of the property. She wishes to subdivide off the old farmhouse and 3 acres of surrounding land. The expected sale price of the house and surrounding land is estimated to be $130,000. The cost of the subdivision has been estimated at $3,300. The survey costs are estimated to be $2,700 and the legal costs $600, including GST. The subdivision expenses are approximately 2.5% of the projected sale price. No fencing work is required as the house and surrounding land 26 have existing creek and hedge boundaries. The property already has water, and a septic tank for sewage. No easements are required. All the work involved is minimal and straightforward. The professional services required are minimal and simple, and no physical work is required. The cost of the work is small compared to the estimated value of the land. Therefore, the proposed subdivision work that the taxpayer intends to carry out is work of a minor nature. Example 2 A taxpayer purchased 10 acres, containing a house, garage, and barn for $220,000. The land value portion was $120,000. Council approval was obtained for a subdivision of 7 acres which was carried out, and the land subsequently sold for $200,000. Costs involved in the subdivision amounted to $33,000. The professional services of a surveyor, solicitor, and valuer were used. The taxpayer also organised fencing, felling and planting work, and the excavation of a driveway. Work involved in the subdivision included the removal of pine trees, a bush regeneration programme, stock-proof fencing, a site survey, the excavation of a driveway, and the planting of trees. The buildings and 1 acre of the remaining 3 acres are used for the taxpayer’s car restoration business and residence. It is considered that this subdivision involves work of more than a minor nature. While the survey and legal services could be classed as straightforward, additional services, i.e. fencing, planting and felling of trees, the excavation of a driveway and a valuation, were required to effect the scheme. This additional work means that the work is more than minor in nature. Furthermore, the costs involved could not be seen as minor either on an absolute basis or when compared with the value of the land and the sale price of the subdivision. Therefore, the work is of more than a minor nature, and the $200,000 received from the sale of the land will be included as gross income if the other requirements of section CD 1(2)(f) are met and the exceptions elsewhere in section CD 1(2) do not apply. Example 3 Purchaser acquired a 50-hectare farm property at a cost of $400,000. Two months later, she was offered $50,000 for a 0.5 hectare parcel of the land, and accepted. The condition imposed by the Council for subdivision consent is: • Construction of an entranceway to the subdivided lot ($550). Satisfactory arrangements for telephone service to the subdivided lot already existed. Constructing an entrance way to the lot cost $550 and was very straightforward. In addition, a power supply to the subdivided lot already existed. Within one month of Purchaser’s acquisition of the property, the power was connected for farm development purposes at a cost of $2,800 paid to the power company. The creation of the entranceway is development work. 27 The farm had three existing titles, so it was a relatively simple exercise to adjust the boundaries to provide a small residential block for sale. The boundary adjustment is division work. The costs involved in the subdivision were: Surveying (including:) $ Scheme plan preparation and submissions 1,500 Field Work and LT plan preparation 2,000 Entrance way 550 Legal fees 1,000 Total 5,050 The professional services of a surveyor and a lawyer were required to subdivide the land. The legal work involved was minimal in both cost and complexity. The survey work was standard as it entailed only a simple boundary adjustment. The work undertaken by the Purchaser is the type of work typical of a basic subdivision, and the professional services were relatively simple. The legal and surveying work required appears to be quite straightforward. One additional item of physical work is to be carried out: the construction of the entranceway. However, it is considered that this is sufficiently minor still to be work of a minor nature. The power was connected within one month of Purchaser’s acquisition of the property at a cost of $2,800. The erection of the transformer structure was an expensive procedure, was work of a physical nature and, in conjunction with the construction of the entranceway, might be considered to be too complex to be “work of a minor nature”. However, it did not form part of the undertaking or scheme of subdivision. It was done for a different purpose, of farm development. On this basis the additional costs associated with the supply of electricity to the section would not form part of the subdivision. It should be noted that although the Commissioner considers that this example does not involve work of more than a minor nature, it is considered to be borderline. If the Purchaser had, in addition to the above fact scenario incurred significant expenditure in dividing the 0.5 hectare parcel of the land into three portions, as well as fencing the relevant sections off (including the removal of gorse bushes, creating new fences and replacing old ones), the Commissioner considers that this example would most likely not be work of a minor nature. In that circumstance, the proceeds of the sale of the land would be included as gross income if the other requirements of section CD 1(2)(f) were met and the exceptions elsewhere in section CD 1(2) did not apply. Example 4 In the course of preparing to sell his quarter-acre residential property, A discovers that he and his neighbour B have been mistaken for some time as to the location of the boundary between them. As a result, A’s spa pool and surround extends a little over the boundary near the rear corners of their properties. He raises the question with B, and it is agreed that they will remedy the matter by a boundary adjustment to add a small corner from the rear of her property to his (see diagram). The only work involved is straightforward survey and legal work and is completed without any difficulty. 28 A B New boundary Old boundary The work involved is work of a minor nature and is therefore not within section CD 1(2)(f)(i). 29 Matrix of Cases Considering the Work of a Minor Nature Exemption Note: The approximate date of expenditure or receipt is indicated for each case.

This interpretation guideline will help taxpayers to determine their employment status for tax purposes. 2. The guideline updates the 1999 interpretation guideline “Employee or independent contractor?”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 2 (February 1999). The 1999 interpretation guideline outlined the tests for determining whether a person is an employee or independent contractor. This interpretation guideline does not signal a change of approach. 3. The tax obligations of a taxpayer with respect to amounts earned from work done by the taxpayer depend on his or her employment status (ie, whether the taxpayer is an employee or an independent contractor). 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 defines the term “employee”. Parts of this definition require it to be determined that the taxpayer is employed under a contract of service. Under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, supplies of goods and services under a “contract of service” are not taxable. These provisions do not specify how it is to be determined whether there is a contract of service in any particular case. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the common law to determine whether there is a contract of service. 5. The common law distinguishes between contracts of service and contracts for services. A contract of service means there is an employer–employee relationship; a contract for services means there is a principal–independent contractor relationship. At common law, the courts have developed various tests to determine whether there is a contract of service or a contract for services. The case law shows that the main tests are the intention, control, independence, fundamental and integration tests. These tests can be summarised as follows:  Intention test – looks at the intentions of each party to the agreement as to the nature of the relationship.  Control test – examines the degree of control the person engaged to perform the services exerts over the manner in which the work is done. A high level of control supports the conclusion that the person engaged to perform the services is an employee. 2  Independence test – examines the level of independence the person engaged to perform the services exerts over their work. A high level of independence supports the conclusion that the person engaged to perform the services is an independent contractor.  Fundamental test – considers whether the person engaged to perform the services is doing so as a person in business on his or her own account. If the answer is “yes”, then this supports the conclusion that the person is an independent contractor; if the answer is “no” this supports the conclusion that the person is an employee.  Integration test – looks at whether the person engaged to perform the services is integrated into the business that hired him or her. If the person is integrated into the business, this supports the conclusion that he or she is an employee. By contrast, if the person is not integrated into the business, but rather an accessory to it, this supports the conclusion that he or she is an independent contractor. 6. This interpretation guideline considers decisions on employment status that were delivered after the 1999 guideline was published, most notably the Supreme Court decision in Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd. In Bryson the Supreme Court considered whether a person was an “employee” under the Employment Relations Act 2000, The decision is still relevant because the Supreme Court considered the common law tests. Bryson is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s decision in TNT Worldwide Express Ltd v Cunningham. The 1999 guideline identified TNT as the leading New Zealand authority on determining employment status. However, in Bryson the Supreme Court held that industry practice is a factor that may be considered in the context of the intention test, because it may assist in determining the parties’ intention as to the nature of their relationship. The relevance of industry practice was not considered in TNT. Analysis 7. This interpretation guideline is divided into the following parts:  Types of employment relationship: discusses the difference between “contracts of service” (which employees have) and “contracts for services” (which independent contractors have).  Employment status and tax law: outlines the significance to taxpayers of their employment status. It also explains how the common law on determining employment status can be relevant when determining taxpayers’ employment status under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Income Tax Act 2007.  Relevance of Employment Relations Act 2000 case law: considers s 6 of the Employment Relations Act 2000. Section 6 defines the term “employee” for the purposes of that Act. This part concludes that s 6 decisions are relevant when determining employment status for tax purposes to the extent that those decisions concern the common law on the employee/independent contractor distinction.  Common law on determining employment status – leading New Zealand authorities: discusses the leading New Zealand authorities on determining employment status – Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd \[2005\] NZSC 34, \[2005\] 3 NZLR 721 (SCNZ) and TNT Worldwide Express Ltd v Cunningham \[1993\] 3 NZLR 681 (CA).  Common law tests: summarises the main tests for deciding employment status – the intention of the parties, control, independence, fundamental and integration tests.  Recent decisions: summarises three recent cases so as to illustrate how the courts have applied the common law tests; and lists other decisions on 3 employment status from the Employment Court, Employment Relations Authority and Taxation Review Authority since Bryson. Types of employment relationship 8. Legal rights and obligations can depend on the employment relationship between two persons. The law distinguishes between two types of employment relationship: employer – employee and principal – independent contractor. Which type of employment relationship exists in any particular case depends on whether there is a “contract of service” or a “contract for services” between the persons concerned. In New Zealand Educational Institute v Director-General of Education \[1981\] 1 NZLR 538, the Court of Appeal stated (at 539): On many occasions over the years the Courts have had to decide whether the relationship between two persons was that of employer and employee or, as it used to be called, master and servant. The inquiry normally involved the distinction between a contract of service in which the relation was that of employer and employee and a contract for services in which the relation was that between employer and independent contractor. A decision in any particular case required an examination of the contract between the two - it might be expressed in words or it might be implicit from the circumstances . 9. Employees have a “contract of service” with their employer. Contracts of service evolved from the earlier concept of a master–servant relationship. Such a relationship required an employee to be continuously available for service and to accept a high degree of control by the employer. A “contract for services” applies to the relationship between an independent contractor and a principal. It emphasises the nature of the services to be provided by a person rather than his or her availability to work as directed. 10. At common law, the courts have developed several tests to determine whether there is a contract of service or a contract for services. The case law shows that the main tests are the intention, control, independence, fundamental and integration tests. These tests are discussed in paragraphs 46 – 73 below. Employment status and tax law Consequences of employment status for tax purposes 11. The tax obligations of a taxpayer with respect to payments received for work done by the taxpayer depend on his or her employment status (ie, whether the taxpayer is an employee or an independent contractor). Employment status has the following consequences for tax purposes:  Payments to employees from their employer must have PAYE deducted at source.  Employees cannot register for GST or charge GST for services they supply as employees.  Independent contractors may deduct certain expenses incurred in deriving assessable income.  Independent contractors must account to Inland Revenue for tax and accident compensation earner and employee premiums for themselves and any employees.  Independent contractors must meet all the requirements of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 if the services they supply are in the course of a taxable activity and they are registered (or liable to register) for GST. 12. Taxpayers cannot change their employment status (or the resulting tax implications of that status) merely by calling themselves independent contractors when they are essentially still employees. 4 Relevance of common law tests under tax law 13. Both the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 distinguish between payments made under contracts of service and payments made under contracts for services. They do not however specify how it is to be determined whether there is a contract of service or a contract for services in any particular case. It is therefore necessary to rely on the common law tests for determining employment status. Income Tax Act 2007 14. The Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) defines the term “employee” in s YA 1 as follows: employee— (a) means a person who receives or is entitled to receive a PAYE income payment: (b) in sections CW 17, CW 17B, CW 17C, and CW 18 (which relate to expenditure, reimbursement, and allowances of employees) includes a person to whom section RD 3(2) to (4) (PAYE income payments) applies: (c) in the FBT rules, and in the definition of shareholder-employee (paragraph (b)), does not include a person if the only PAYE income payment received or receivable is— (i) a payment referred to in section RD 5(1)(b)(iii), (3), (6)(b) and (c) and (7) (Salary or wages): (ii) a schedular payment referred to in schedule 4, parts A and I (Rates of tax for schedular payments) for which the person is liable for income tax under section BB 1 (Imposition of income tax): (d) is defined in section DC 15 (Some definitions) for the purposes of sections DC 12 to DC 14 (which relate to share purchase schemes): (db) does not include an owner of a look-through company or a person who has a look- through interest for a look-through company, unless the owner or person is a working owner: (e) for an employer, means an employee of the employer Paragraph (a) defines “employee” for the purposes of the PAYE rules. It uses the term “PAYE income payment”, which is defined in s RD 3(1) as follows: (1) The PAYE rules apply to a PAYE income payment which— (a) means— (i) a payment of salary or wages, see section RD 5; or (ii) extra pay, see section RD 7; or (iii) a schedular payment, see section RD 8: 15. Parts of the s YA 1 definition of “employee” require it to be determined that the taxpayer to whom the payment was made was employed under a contract of service. These parts are:  “salary or wages” (s RD 5(1)(a)): (1) Salary or wages— (a) means a payment of salary, wages, or allowances made to a person in connection with their employment ... .  “an extra pay” (s RD 7(1)(a)(i)): (1) An extra pay— (a) means a payment that— (i) is made to a person in connection with their employment ... .  “employee” (s DC 15): employee— (a) means a person employed by a company ... . (This definition of “employee” is for the purposes of ss DC 12 to DC 14, which concern share purchase schemes between employers and employees.) 5 16. That the above provisions apply where there is a contract of service is shown by the use of the words “employment” and “employed”. This interpretation is supported by Challenge Realty Ltd v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,212. In this decision, the Court of Appeal considered the definition of “salary or wages” in s 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. This definition provided: \`Salary or wages', in relation to any person, means salary, wages, or allowances (whether in cash or otherwise), including all sums received or receivable by way of overtime pay, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, commission, or remuneration of any kind, in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person ... . Delivering the judgment of the Court, Bisson J stated (at 7,224): In the context of sec 2, the word “employment”, in our view, relates to a contract of service ... . It is that word which governs the definition: the definition being intended to include all forms of remuneration received under a contract of employment ... . Consequently, the definition of “salary or wages” did not include amounts received as remuneration under a contract for services. 17. The ITA does not specify how it is to be determined whether the taxpayer concerned is employed under a contract of service. It is therefore necessary to rely on the common law on determining employment status. As a general principle of statutory interpretation, where legislation makes use of terms with established meanings at common law, it is presumed that Parliament intended those terms to be given their common law meanings (subject to any contrary legislative intention): Bank of England v Vagliano Bros \[1891\] AC 107; R v Kerr \[1988\] 1 NZLR 270 (CA). As mentioned earlier, the common law distinguishes between contracts of service and contracts for services, and the courts have developed tests to establish whether there is a contract of service or a contract for services. 18. However, it is important to highlight that other parts of the definition of “employee” in the ITA do not rely on the common law. The ITA identifies particular classes of persons and payments that are included or excluded from the term “employee”. For example:  Section RD 3(1)(b) provides that the term “PAYE income payment” does not include: (i) an amount attributed under section GB 29 (Attribution rule: calculation): (ii) an amount paid to a shareholder-employee in the circumstances set out in subsection (2): (iii) an amount paid or benefit provided, by a person (the claimant) who receives a personal service rehabilitation payment from which an amount of tax has been withheld at the rate specified in schedule 4, part I (Rates of tax for schedular payments) or under section RD 18 (Schedular payments without notification), to another person for providing a key aspect of social rehabilitation referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of personal service rehabilitation payment in section YA 1 (Definitions).  Section YA 1 defines the term “employment” (for the purposes of the definition “salary or wages” (s RD 5) and “an extra pay” (s RD 7)) to include: the activities performed by a member of Parliament or a judicial officer that gives rise to an entitlement to receive a PAYE income payment for the activities. Similarly, s RD 5(5) provides that the term “salary or wages” includes salary and allowances made to the Governor-General, members of Parliament and judicial officers.  Section DC 15 excludes from the definition of “employee” for the purposes of ss DC 12 to DC 14: (i) a director of the company; or 6 (ii) a person who, with any associated person, holds 10% or more of the issued capital of the company; or (iii) a company, a local authority, a public authority, or an unincorporated body of persons ... . 19. It is noted that the term “PAYE income payment” includes “a schedular payment” as defined in s RD 8 and schedule 4 of the ITA. Schedule 4 sets out payments to a wide variety of workers including, for example, insurance agents and shearers. A worker who receives “a schedular payment” will typically be an independent contractor at common law. If an independent contractor receives “a schedular payment”, then tax must be deducted at source. However, the other consequences of being an independent contractor set out in paragraph 11 remain. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 20. Under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA), employees are not liable for GST on supplies of goods and services they make to their employers. This is the result of s 6(3)(b) excluding from the definition of “taxable activity” supplies made by a person pursuant to “any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service or as a director of a company” \[emphasis added\]. The GSTA does not specify how it is to be determined whether there is a “contract of service”. For the reason explained in paragraph 17 above, it is therefore necessary to rely on the common law tests for determining whether there is a contract of service or contract for services. Relevance of Employment Relations Act 2000 case law 21. The common law tests for determining whether there is a contract of service or a contract for services have been developed by the courts over numerous decisions. In a few of these decisions the courts were determining employment status for tax purposes. However, in most decisions the courts were determining employment status under the employment legislation. The employment legislation currently in force is the Employment Relations Act 2000 (ERA). Section 6(1), (2) and (3) of the ERA defines the term “employee” as follows: (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, employee— (a) means any person of any age employed by an employer to do any work for hire or reward under a contract of service; and (b) includes— (i) a homeworker; or (ii) a person intending to work; but (c) excludes a volunteer who— (i) does not expect to be rewarded for work to be performed as a volunteer; and (ii) receives no reward for work performed as a volunteer; and (d) excludes, in relation to a film production, any of the following persons: (i) a person engaged in film production work as an actor, voice-over actor, stand-in, body double, stunt performer, extra, singer, musician, dancer, or entertainer: (ii) a person engaged in film production work in any other capacity. (1A) However, subsection (1)(d) does not apply if the person is a party to, or covered by, a written employment agreement that provides that the person is an employee. (2) In deciding for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) whether a person is employed by another person under a contract of service, the court or the Authority (as the case may be) must determine the real nature of the relationship between them. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the court or the Authority— (a) must consider all relevant matters, including any matters that indicate the intention of the persons; and 7 (b) is not to treat as a determining matter any statement by the persons that describes the nature of their relationship. 22. As made clear by the words “\[i\]n this Act” in s 6(1)(a), s 6 defines “employee” for the purposes of only the ERA. Consequently the definition does not affect the interpretation of the term “employee” in the ITA or “contract of service” in the GSTA. However, s 6 case law can be relevant when determining employment status for tax purposes. In Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd the Supreme Court held (at \[32\] \[33\]) that the definition of “employee” in s 6(1)(a) – “any person of any age employed by an employer to do any work for hire or reward under a contract of service” – reflected the common law. It also held that the common law tests for determining employment status were relevant when determining the “real nature of the relationship” between the parties under s 6(2) and (3). Therefore, s 6 decisions can be relevant when determining employment status for tax purposes to the extent that those decision concern the common law tests. Common law on determining employment status – leading New Zealand authorities 23. This part of the guideline discusses the leading New Zealand authorities on determining employment status. These authorities are the Supreme Court decision in Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd and the Court of Appeal decision in TNT Worldwide Express Ltd v Cunningham. Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd Facts and decision 24. In Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd the Supreme Court considered whether a person was an “employee” under s 6 of the ERA. 25. In this decision, the appellant, Mr Bryson, was a model maker for Weta Workshop. Weta Workshop had a close working relationship with Three Foot Six Ltd, which was the company that administered the production of The Lord of the Rings. Mr Bryson was seconded from Weta Workshop to Three Foot Six Ltd and soon took a permanent position there. Mr Bryson was not given a written employment contract when he started, but some months later Three Foot Six Ltd supplied a written contract to all staff (the “crew deal memo”). The crew deal memo set out the conditions of employment and, in particular, it referred throughout to “contractor” and “independent contractor”. Mr Bryson was required to sign the crew deal memo every week to secure payment for work done. A year later Mr Bryson was made redundant and he alleged unjustifiable dismissal. He could bring an unjustified dismissal claim only if he were found to have been an employee. 26. At first instance, the Employment Relations Authority held that Mr Bryson was not an “employee” under the ERA. On appeal, Judge Shaw in the Employment Court reversed this decision: Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd \[2003\] 1 ERNZ 581. Her Honour held that Mr Bryson was an “employee” despite references to “independent contractor” in the crew deal memo. A majority of the Court of Appeal overturned the Employment Court’s decision: Three Foot Six Ltd v Bryson \[2004\] 2 ERNZ 526. However, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal’s decision and upheld that Employment Court’s decision: Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd \[2005\] NZSC 34, \[2005\] 3 NZLR 721. 27. The Supreme Court (at \[5\]) quoted Judge Shaw from the Employment Court as follows: Judge Shaw said that s 6 changed the tests for determining what constituted a contract of service. She summarised the principles she considered to have been established by Employment Court cases on that section \[Koia v Carlyon Holdings Ltd \[2001\] ERNZ 585 and Curlew v Harvey Norman Stores (NZ) Pty Ltd \[2002\] 1 ERNZ 114 at \[19\]\] as follows:  The Court must determine the real nature of the relationship. 8  The intention of the parties is still relevant but no longer decisive.  Statements by the parties, including contractual statements, are not decisive of the nature of the relationship.  The real nature of the relationship can be ascertained by analysing the tests that have been historically applied such as control, integration, and the “fundamental” test.  The fundamental test examines whether a person performing the services is doing so on their own account.  Another matter which may assist in the determination of the issue is industry practice although this is far from determinative of the primary question. 28. The Supreme Court said (at \[32\]) that Judge Shaw had accurately stated what s 6 requires the courts to do, and had listed the relevant matters to be considered under it. The Supreme Court said that “all relevant matters” certainly include the written and oral terms of the contract between the parties and that the terms will usually contain indications of the parties’ common intention concerning the status of their relationship. The Supreme Court said it was clear from Judge Shaw’s judgment that “she was very much alive to the need to begin by looking at the written terms and conditions which had been agreed to by Mr Bryson and Three Foot Six Ltd”. 29. The Supreme Court made it clear that the common law tests for determining employment status were relevant under s 6 when it stated (at \[32\]) that “ ‘\[a\]ll relevant matters’ equally clearly requires the Court or Authority to have regard to features of control and integration and to ... the fundamental test”. It also said (at \[33\]) that Judge Shaw was correct in saying that the real nature of the relationship could be ascertained by analysing the tests that historically have been applied, such as the control, integration and fundamental tests. The Supreme Court said that Judge Shaw: obviously was not suggesting that these three customary indicia were to be applied exclusively. She correctly used them, in conjunction with the other relevant matters to which she referred, in an endeavour to determine the real nature of the relationship, as directed by s 6(2). 30. In the Employment Court, Judge Shaw had concluded that the fact Mr Bryson required six weeks training for the position with Three Foot Six Ltd indicated that he could not be said to have been contracting his skills because he did not have the relevant experience. The company closely controlled the work Mr Bryson did, including requirements about attendance at meetings and specific work hours, which included time when his services were not required. If he had been an independent contractor he would not have been paid for the down time and would have been free to get on with his own private business. Judge Shaw emphasised that her decision was based solely on the individual circumstances of Mr Bryson’s employment and was not to be regarded as affecting the status of any other employee in the film industry. Industry practice 31. The concept of industry practice was given prominence in Bryson because the outcome was thought to be critical to the New Zealand film industry. In Bryson Three Foot Six Ltd submitted (at \[36\]) that Mr Bryson was an independent contractor “because that was the invariable practice at Three Foot Six \[and\] across the film industry.” Judge Shaw in the Employment Court recognised that industry practice was relevant under s 6, but not determinative (at \[19\]): Another matter which may assist in the determination of the issue \[of the “real nature of the relationship”\] is industry practice although this is far from determinative of the primary question. 32. Judge Shaw held (at \[21\]) that industry practice was also relevant under the common law. In support of this, her Honour cited Muollo v Rotaru \[1995\] 2 ERNZ 414, which she held (at \[22\]) was authority for the proposition that: 9 ... the Court may consider industry practice when assessing the nature of an employment contract especially where a custom or practice is sufficiently well established. In such a case, the Chief Judge held that such practice could go to establishing the intention of the parties. 33. However, on the facts of the case, Judge Shaw held (at \[36\]) that the industry practice was of little use in establishing the intention of both parties. Later in the judgment (at \[57\] – \[76\]), her Honour reviewed the evidence given by expert witnesses as to industry practice and stated (at \[68\]): It is clear from the evidence that the defendant and the film and television industry in general has a real and genuine concern that any changes to the present employment arrangements which have been in place for many years will cause significant disruptions in the film industry with potentially adverse outcomes both in economic terms and in terms of attracting overseas film companies to bring the productions to New Zealand. Mr Binnie submitted that a decision in Mr Bryson’s favour \[ie, that he was an employee\] would “automatically ‘unwind’” every existing crew deal memo and any future crew contracts for movie productions. Judge Shaw held that this evidence did not support finding that Mr Bryson was an employee. Her Honour stated that “\[w\]hilst these concerns are acknowledged ... in the context of this case, they are overstated.” Her Honour therefore gave little weight to industry practice on the facts. 34. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the Employment Court had not given sufficient weight to the evidence of industry practice. It held that industry practice compelled the conclusion that Mr Bryson was not an employee (at \[111\], \[113\] and \[117\]). The Supreme Court disagreed. It held that the Employment Court had not erred in its treatment of industry practice (at \[35\]): The question for this Court is whether the Court of Appeal majority was correct in holding that what the Judge said in relation to industry practice amounted to legal error. We do not believe that it was. She did not overlook or ignore the evidence of industry practice. In rejecting a submission from counsel for Mr Bryson, she in fact said that it could not be completely disregarded, referring with evident approval to a case under the Employment Contracts Act where the Chief Judge had held that industry practice could go to establish the intention of the parties. In the case before her, however, the Judge found that industry practice was not helpful in relation to establishing the common intention of Mr Bryson and Three Foot Six for the reasons given by her and mentioned in para \[9\] above. Later in her judgment she summarised the evidence on industry practice. It was, as she said, given in general terms. She found that it did not apply to Mr Bryson's situation. He had not been working on projects for several producers. He had not operated like a sole trader. Summary 35. In summary, the following points can be taken from the Supreme Court’s decision in Bryson. 36. When determining whether a person is an “employee” as defined in s 6 of the ERA, the common law tests for determining employment status are still relevant. Consequently, s 6 case law is relevant when determining employment status for tax purposes to the extent that it considers and applies the common law tests. 37. Consistent with the common law, s 6 requires the court not to treat as determinative any statement by the parties that describes the nature of their relationship. 38. Also consistent with the common law, s 6 requires the court to consider:  Matters indicating the intention of the parties, in particular the terms of the contract agreed to (whether in writing or orally) by the parties, and industry practice.  Any divergences from, or supplementations of, those terms and conditions that are apparent in the way in which the relationship has operated in practice.  Features of control and integration and whether the contracted person has been effectively working on his or her own account (the fundamental test). 10 \[Following the Supreme Court’s decision, Parliament amended s 6 of the ERA to insert provisions concerning film workers. Section 6 (1)(d) excludes from the definition of “employee” persons involved in “film production work”. The term “film production work” is defined in s 6(7). However, s 6(2) provides that this exclusion “does not apply if the person is a party to, or covered by, a written employment agreement that provides that the person is an employee.” As already discussed, s 6 of ERA defines the term “employee” only for the purposes of the ERA.\] TNT Worldwide Express Ltd v Cunningham 39. The other leading New Zealand authority on employment status is the Court of Appeal decision in TNT Worldwide Express Ltd v Cunningham. In this decision, the Court of Appeal discussed in detail the intention, control and fundamental tests developed at common law. The Supreme Court in Bryson cited TNT with approval. 40. In TNT, the appellant company, TNT, engaged the respondent as an owner–driver to conduct a courier service for the company. The owner–driver:  provided his own vehicle and was responsible for the vehicle’s maintenance and upkeep;  was responsible for his own tax and accident compensation payments;  claimed deductions as if he were self-employed; and  had a contract with TNT that said he was an independent contractor. 41. The company terminated the respondent’s contract, and the respondent sought to invoke the personal grievance procedure under the Employment Contracts Act 1991. 42. The Employment Court held that an owner–driver courier for TNT was an employee and not self-employed. In reaching that conclusion, the Court placed considerable emphasis on the rigorous control the company exercised over its owner–drivers. The Employment Court found the company’s actions showed that it treated the owner–driver as its employee. 43. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the written contract entered into by the parties created a genuine independent contractor relationship. It accepted that an owner–driver courier was an independent contractor rather than an employee where the owner–driver’s contract with TNT:  required the owner–driver to provide his own vehicle, uniform, approved radio telephone, goods service licence under the Transport Act 1962, and insurance;  paid the owner–driver mainly on a per trip basis;  made the owner–driver responsible for employing any relief driver;  referred to the owner–driver as an independent contractor; and  gave TNT very extensive control over the owner–driver’s operations. 44. The Court of Appeal acknowledged the extensive control TNT exercised over the owner–driver, but concluded that the owner–driver accepted only that degree of control and supervision necessary for the efficient and profitable conduct of the business he was running on his own account as an independent contractor. Casey J cited (at 697) the following statement of MacKenna J in Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance \[1968\] 1 All ER 433, 447: A man does not cease to run a business on his own account because he agrees to run it efficiently or to accept another's superintendence. 11 45. The Court of Appeal said that when the contract is wholly in writing and it is not a sham, then the nature of the relationship intended by the parties is determined from the terms of that contract in the light of all the surrounding circumstances at the time the contract was made. Cooke P noted (at 683) that “it is necessary to consider all the terms of the agreement”, and made the following observations (at 686 and 687): When the terms of a contract are fully set out in writing which is not a sham (and there is no suggestion of a sham in this case) the answer to the question of the nature of the contract must depend on an analysis of the rights and obligations so defined. ... In the end, when the contract is wholly in writing, it is the true interpretation and effect of the written terms on which the case must turn. Common law tests of employment relationship 46. In considering how the distinction between contracts for services and contracts of service is to be made, the Court of Appeal in TNT noted (at 697) the following observation of the Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi-Keung \[1990\] 2 AC 374, 382 (PC): What then is the standard to apply? This has proved to be a most elusive question and despite a plethora of authorities the courts have not been able to devise a single test that will conclusively point to the distinction in all cases. 47. The Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang quoted with approval from the judgment of Cooke J in Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security \[1969\] 2 QB 173, 184–185, where it was said that: No exhaustive list has been compiled and perhaps no exhaustive list can be compiled of considerations which are relevant in determining the question, nor can strict rules be laid down as to the relative weight which the various considerations should carry in particular cases. 48. Although there is no exhaustive list of considerations, the tests discussed below (established by the case law) provide useful guidance as to the factors that are to be considered in determining whether someone is engaged as an employee or contractor. These are relevant tests to be considered, but, as the cases demonstrate, they may not all be relevant to any one particular enquiry. 49. It is important in each case to determine employment status by balancing all the circumstances of the relationship between the parties. Often there will be competing factors that support differing conclusions as to whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor. Applying the tests described below to the facts of a case requires an objective weighing of the various relevant factors to determine the true nature of the relationship. 50. Often the terms of the relationship between two persons will be recorded in a written agreement; though this is not necessarily the case. If there is a written agreement, the first step is to analyse its terms and conditions. However, it is important to note that the nature of the relationship may change over time (eg, a person takes on more duties), and this may not be reflected in the written agreement. Changes in regulations and work practices may also cause the employment status of some workers to change. Or, it could simply be that the written agreement does not accurately reflect how the relationship works in practice. It is necessary to consider how the parties actually work together when determining the type of employment relationship between them. As the Supreme Court in Bryson stated (at \[32\]): It is not until the Court or Authority has examined the terms and conditions of the contract and the way in which it actually operated in practice, that it will usually be possible to examine the relationship in light of the control, integration and fundamental tests. Hence the importance, stressed in TNT, of analysing the contractual rights and obligations. 51. In Bryson and TNT the main common law tests for determining employment status – the intention, control, fundamental and integration tests – were 12 discussed. In the following paragraphs, these tests (along with the independence test) are examined in greater detail. 52. It is important to keep in mind that the application of the common law tests is a weighing up process. Sometimes the facts of a particular case may suggest different characterisations of the relationship, and there may be either overlap or tensions between the tests. 53. Also, as the characterisation of the relationship is dependent on the particular facts at hand, it is crucial that the facts are well understood, including any changes to the relationship that have occurred over time. Intention of the parties test 54. The intention of the parties test looks at the intentions of each party to the agreement regarding the nature of the relationship. The description given to a relationship by the parties to the contract is a strong, but not conclusive indication of the type of relationship that exists. The fact a written contract states that a person is an employee or an independent contractor may indicate the intention of the parties, but it is not determinative: Bryson, at \[32\] (SCNZ). Holland J in the High Court in Challenge Realty Ltd v CIR \[1990\] 12 NZTC 7,012, at 7,032 said: Obviously the Court’s function in interpreting a contract is to determine the intentions of the parties. When, however, the question for determination is the legal relationship between the parties created by the contract, the expressed intention of the parties will not be determinative of the question. It is nevertheless an important factor, and if after considering all factors the exact state of the relationship is a matter of some ambiguity, may be decisive. In the present cases before me Harcourts is the only one with a written agreement. Nevertheless I would conclude that in all cases it was the intention of the parties to create an agency relationship rather than an employer/employee relationship. The question remains as to whether that result has been achieved. 55. If the actual circumstances point to an employment relationship, then simply labelling it an independent contract relationship will not alter the true position. 56. In TNT, a clause in the written contract that purported to override all other aspects of the agreement stated that the courier was an independent contractor. The Employment Court found that the actual conduct of the relationship showed that TNT imposed a high level of control and supervision of its staff that was inconsistent with any independence or initiative on the part of its staff. However, the Court of Appeal in reversing this decision concluded, after weighing all the circumstances, that the TNT standard form contract created a genuine independent contractor relationship. 57. The taxation arrangements between the parties may be relevant when establishing their intentions. In Bryson the Employment Court stated (at \[55\]) that “tax status can be an indicator of what a person intends his contractual relationship to be”. For example, if the person engaged to perform the services is paid at a set-rate at regular intervals and PAYE is deducted, this may support the view that the parties intended a contract of service. However, in some cases, taxation arrangements between the parties may not be given much weight. In Bryson, Mr Bryson completed IR3 forms, which referred to the taxpayer as being self-employed in business or trade, and had claimed deductions for work related expenses. The Employment Court stated (at \[55\]) that this was not conclusive evidence that Mr Bryson was an independent contractor, because he had not registered for GST, and payslips received from Three Foot Six Ltd referred to PAYE deductions having being made. In these circumstances, it could not be said that Mr Bryson had acquiesced to independent contractor status. 58. In some circumstances industry practice may be relevant when determining the intention of the parties. As already discussed, in Bryson the Supreme Court agreed with the Employment Court’s statement that industry practice could be 13 relevant when considering the parties’ intention, but that it was not determinative. 59. In Bryson Three Foot Six Ltd submitted that Mr Bryson should be regarded as an independent contractor, because the invariable industry practice was that production workers were hired as independent contractors. Expert witnesses explained that the reason for this practice was the project-based, intermittent nature of screen productions and that production workers normally worked with several different producers during the course of the year. The Employment Court held that the evidence of industry practice was of little use on the facts of this case, because it was “necessarily general” and not consistent with the particular circumstances of Mr Bryson’s case. Mr Bryson worked continuously for Three Foot Six Ltd alone and, unlike other workers in the industry, did not own any plant or equipment and did not operate as a sole trader (at \[59\] – \[60\]). Mr Bryson’s working conditions were therefore not typical of the industry. 60. By contrast, in Muollo v Rotaru industry practice was given considerable weight. In Bryson the Employment Court cited Muollo as authority for the proposition that industry practice was relevant at common law when considering the parties’ intention as to their employment relationship. In Muollo the Employment Court considered whether Mr Rotaru, who worked as a crew member aboard a fishing vessel, was an employee for the purposes of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 (repealed). There was no written employment agreement. The Employment Court concluded that Mr Rotaru was an independent contractor, and considered this conclusion was supported by the “custom and usage in the commercial fishing industry”. It stated that the evidence of industry practice (at 425 – 426, footnotes omitted): ... presents a picture of an industry in which the co-operative venture is not only prevalent and a typical mode of conducting business but a commercial norm. All parties under such arrangements share in the proceeds. The commercial reasons for it suggested by Mr Gartrell were five in number, as follows: "1. It conduces to business viability; "2. ensures proper work attitudes; "3. takes cognisance of the fact that work is intermittent, and its duration uncertain; "4. acknowledges the seasonal nature of the work; and "5. means that there is not a pool of people waiting round in off-times with no work but still having to be paid." Mr Gartrell urged upon me the good sense of the industry's considerations moving it to adopt this custom, mentioning the sporadic nature of the enterprise and the use of a percentage basis of determining the rewards and sharing productivity and risk. Along much the same lines Mr Gartrell stressed a total of six factors that were particularly important to both appellants: "1. work was intermittent; "2. duration of work was uncertain; "3. no liability for sick and holiday pay; "4. the business did not want the liability of an employee when work was not available; "5. proper work attitudes; "6. business/work cohesion." 61. An expert witness also stated (at 426) that he was not aware of any fishing vessels where a crew member was on a wage or salary. In the expert’s opinion, the normal arrangement was for crew members to be paid according to their share of the catch; for withholding tax to be deducted at source; and for crew members to pay their own ACC levies. The Employment Court stated (at 426) that this evidence was consistent with the circumstances in which Mr Rotaru provided his services. It concluded (at 428) that the evidence of industry practice showed that the parties’ intention was to enter into a contract for services. 14 62. In summary, industry practice may be relevant when establishing the parties’ intention, especially where the custom or practice is sufficiently well established. Industry practice is not determinative, and it may be given less weight where it is inconsistent with the facts of the particular relationship considered. Control test 63. The control test looks at the degree of control the employer or principal exerts over the work an employee or contractor is to do and the manner in which it is to be done. The greater the extent to which the principal or employer specifies work content, hours and methods and can supervise and regulate a person, the more likely it is the person is an employee. 64. The control test used to be considered the deciding test, but this is no longer the case. The Court of Appeal in TNT emphasised that control is only one of several factors relevant to the interpretation of the contract. The Court endorsed the statement of Cooke J in Market Investigations Ltd (at 185) that while control will always have to be considered, it can no longer be regarded as the sole factor in determining the relationship between the parties. The Court of Appeal in TNT considered the Employment Court had given this factor too much weight. Independence test 65. The independence test was not mentioned in Bryson or TNT, but has been discussed in several Taxation Review Authority cases that determined employment status: Case U9 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,077; Case X17 (2006) 22 NZTC 12,224; and Case Z10 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,113. The independence test is simply the inverse of the control test. A high level of independence on the part of an employee or a contractor is inconsistent with a high level of control by an employer or a principal. 66. A person generally has a high level of independence if they:  work for multiple people or clients (but the fact the person works for only one person or client does not necessarily mean the person is an employee);  work from their own premises;  supply their own (specialised) tools or equipment;  have direct responsibility for the profits and risks of the business;  hire or fire whomever they wish to help them do the job;  advertise and invoice for the work;  supply the equipment, premises and materials used;  pay or account for taxes and government and professional levies. 67. On the other hand, when some independent contractors perform work for a principal, they may agree not to work for a competitor or give away trade secrets. This alone will not make the worker an employee (it actually emphasises that the worker is usually entitled to work for others). Fundamental test 68. In the Employment Court decision in Bryson, Judge Shaw applied Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security \[1969\] 2 QB 173, in which Cooke J said that the fundamental test for distinguishing an employee and an independent contractor was as follows (at 184–185): Is the person who has engaged himself to perform these services performing them as a person in business on his own account? If the answer to that question is 'yes', then the contract is a contract for services. If the answer is 'no', then the contract is a contract of service. ... factors which may be of importance are such matters as whether the man performing the services provides his own equipment, whether he hires his own helpers, what degree of financial risk he 15 takes, what degree of responsibility for investment and management he has, and whether and how far he has an opportunity of profiting from sound management in the performance of his task. 69. The Privy Council approved the fundamental test in Lee Ting Sang. This Privy Council decision was subsequently cited by four of the five judges in the Court of Appeal in TNT. 70. The fundamental test is also sometimes described as the “business test” or the “economic reality test”. In Challenge, the Court of Appeal stated (at 65): If it is helpful to look for a test or application in this case, apart from that of control, which is a key feature of the Act, we favour that suggested by Adrian Merritt, Lecturer in Industrial Law, University of New South Wales in his article ‘“Control” v “Economic Reality”: Defining the Contract of Employment' in (1982) 10 Australian Business Law Review 105 at p 118: The issue that must be settled in today's cases is whether the worker is genuinely in business on his own account or whether he is “part and parcel of” - or “integrated into” - the enterprise of the person or organisation for whom work is performed. The test is, therefore, one of “economic reality”. 71. The fundamental test looks at factors such as:  whether the type of business or the nature of the job justifies or requires using an independent contractor;  the behaviour of the parties before and after entering into the contract;  whether there is a time limit for completing a specific project;  whether the worker can be dismissed;  who is responsible for correcting sub-standard work;  who is legally liable if the job goes wrong. 72. Usually, an independent contractor agrees to be responsible for their work. An independent contractor cannot usually be “dismissed”, although the contract can be terminated if it is broken. Integration test 73. In Enterprise Cars Ltd v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,126, Sinclair J said that the integration test is really whether the person is part and parcel of the organisation and not whether the work is necessary for the running of the business. 74. According to the integration test, a job is likely to be done by an employee if it is:  integral to the business organisation;  the type of work commonly done by “employees”;  continuous (not a “one-off” or accessory operation);  for the benefit of the business rather than for the benefit of the worker. 75. In Bryson Judge Shaw in the Employment Court quoted Lord Denning’s “classic description of this test” from his judgment in Stevenson Jordan & Harrison Ltd v MacDonalds \[1952\] TLR 101, 111 (CA): Under a contract of service, a man is employed as part of the business, and his work is done as an integral part of the business; whereas, under a contract for services, his work, although done for the business, is not integrated into it but is only accessory to it. Recent cases Three case summaries 76. This part of the guideline discusses three cases heard in the Employment Court since the Supreme Court’s decision in Bryson:  Tse v Cieffe (NZ) Ltd \[2009\] ERNZ 20; 16  Kiwikiwi v Maori Television Service (2007) 5 NZELR 6;  Tsoupakis v Fendalton Construction Ltd (EMC Wellington WC 16/09, 18 June 2009). These decisions concern employment status under s 6 of the ERA. As already discussed, s 6 decisions can be relevant when determining employment status for tax purposes to the extent that the decisions concern the common law tests. 77. The intention of this discussion is to provide an understanding of how the courts approach the question of employment status following Bryson. When considering such decisions, it is important to keep in mind that each case turns on its own facts. As Judge Shaw noted in Tse v Cieffe (NZ) Ltd “previous case law is only useful in reiterating the relevant principles” (at \[6\]). Tse v Cieffe (NZ) Ltd Facts 78. In Tse v Cieffe (NZ) Ltd the issue was the plaintiff’s employment status. Ms Tse worked for Cieffe (NZ) Ltd from 2005 to 2008. 79. At the beginning of the relationship between the parties there was no written contract between the parties. An oral agreement was reached about the terms of the relationship between the parties. The terms included that Ms Tse would:  work for 20 hours a week and would be paid at an agreed hourly rate;  work on the company’s internal system but also have some reception duties and general office administration duties;  invoice Cieffe as a contractor rather than be paid as an employee. 80. In 2007, Cieffe provided Ms Tse with a written consultancy agreement. The agreement provided that Ms Tse’s work would be performed under the general supervision and direction of a Cieffe representative, but that Ms Tse was not an employee of Cieffe. Ms Tse signed the agreement. 81. Ms Tse performed the duties that were agreed between the parties at the outset of the relationship, as well as sharing a variety of other office tasks such as tidying and cleaning with other employees. When the work Ms Tse had originally been engaged for was nearing completion she was asked to provide further ongoing services that were related to the original work. Ms Tse’s work was closely supervised. 82. By her own choice, Ms Tse worked regular hours. She was not instructed to attend the office at any specific time. Over time her hours increased to 40 hours a week with some overtime. When Ms Tse would not be at work she would advise Cieffe that she would not be present; she would not request leave. 83. Ms Tse invoiced Cieffe for the hours that she worked. Initially, Ms Tse invoiced Cieffe through a company that Ms Tse had set up with her partner. After several months Ms Tse began invoicing Cieffe in her own name. For the first year of the relationship Ms Tse added GST to the invoices but she stopped doing this when she discovered that she was not required to be registered for GST. 84. Cieffe provided Ms Tse with branded clothing at work, a credit card (which was used on a business trip), and a business card. The business card had Cieffe’s logo and described Ms Tse as “Office Manager” and later as “Client Relationship Assistant Manager”. 85. At several times throughout the period that Ms Tse worked for Cieffe she referred to herself as a contractor. 17 Application of law 86. Intention of the parties: Judge Shaw found that “at the commencement of the relationship both parties deliberately entered into an independent contracting arrangement”. The arrangement was evidenced by the method of invoicing and Ms Tse’s references to herself as a contractor. Judge Shaw found that the consultancy agreement “confirms the nature of the relationship which had existed from the outset”. 87. Control: Ms Tse’s counsel argued that several factors pointed towards Ms Tse being under the control of Cieffe. One factor was that some of the tasks Ms Tse performed were not sufficiently specialised. Another factor was that Ms Tse’s work was supervised by a Cieffe representative. Judge Shaw noted that the non- specific tasks (such as tidying and cleaning) would not generally be performed by a contractor. However, other factors pointed towards a lower level of control by Cieffe than would be expected in an employment relationship. In particular, it was up to Ms Tse when she would undertake the work and she worked a variety of hours each month. 88. Integration: The integration test indicated that Ms Tse was an employee of Cieffe. Judge Shaw stated (at \[47\]): In some aspects the evidence points to a degree of integration of Ms Tse into the business. These are the business cards and the Cieffe branded clothing. She used Cieffe equipment and had access to the building. Calling her an office manager or client relationship assistant manager certainly presents an image of her to the outside observer as somebody who was part of the management team rather than running a separate business on their own. Such integration would not normally be expected of a consultant. 89. Fundamental test: Judge Shaw found that Ms Tse’s supply of invoices to Cieffe evidenced a business relationship. Ms Tse’s references to herself as a contractor also supported the view that she was in business on her own account. Conclusion 90. Judge Shaw concluded (at \[50\]): While there were some elements in the conduct of \[Tse’s\] employment which, viewed in isolation, would not support a finding that she was self-employed, taken in the round I find that the real nature of the relationship between Ms Tse and Cieffe was, as intended, a contract for services. Kiwikiwi v Maori Television Service Facts 91. In Kiwikiwi v Maori Television Service the issue was whether Mr Kiwikiwi was an employee or an independent contractor of Maori Television Service (MTS). Mr Kiwikiwi worked as a teleprompter for MTS. 92. When Mr Kiwikiwi started working for MTS he was filling an urgent vacancy and had no experience as a teleprompter. There was no written agreement at the beginning of the relationship between the parties. Mr Kiwikiwi understood that he was on a one-month trial period with the prospect of a full-time job at the end of the trial period if he was suitable. He was told he would have at least 30 hours work a week with more at times. (As the volume of work for teleprompters fluctuates seasonally, hours were flexible.) 93. It was agreed between the parties that Mr Kiwikiwi would be operating on a roster that was prepared a month in advance. He would be paid an hourly rate and would present invoices to be paid. 94. Mr Kiwikiwi undertook teleprompting work but also did various ancillary duties such as photocopying and banking. After he expressed concern at the additional tasks he was asked to perform he was given a role profile description. Mr Kiwikiwi worked between 30 and 40 hours a week. 18 95. After seven and a half months of work, Mr Kiwikiwi was concerned that he still did not have an employment contract. He contacted MTS’s operation manager requesting an employment contract. Following this his rostered hours were reduced. The operation manager began to have issues with Mr Kiwikiwi’s performance and it was decided that Mr Kiwikiwi had to do some re-training before he could be re-rostered. 96. MTS argued that it was typical working practice in the television industry for teleprompters to be freelancers. Only one teleprompter had been an employee of MTS, with all other teleprompters being freelancers. However, the Court heard evidence that TVNZ uses a combination of employees and freelancers as teleprompters. Application of law 97. Intention of the parties: Judge Shaw found that there was no evidence of any common intention by the parties. The parties discussed some “incidents of employment” such as the hourly rate and rostered hours but did not discuss Kiwikiwi’s employment status. 98. Control: MTS argued that as Mr Kiwikiwi was free to do his work as he saw fit and was not subject to the control of MTS. Judge Shaw found that Mr Kiwikiwi was controlled by MTS’s systems. Mr Kiwikiwi was required to comply with the set rosters, had no flexibility within the role and had to perform additional tasks to teleprompting. The role profile description he was given was prescriptive. When standards slipped Mr Kiwikiwi had to undergo re-training. 99. Fundamental test: Judge Shaw found that Mr Kiwikiwi was not in business on his own account as an independent contractor. The factors that lead to this conclusion included:  Mr Kiwikiwi was not registered for GST;  Mr Kiwikiwi did not work for any other employer apart from some shearing work over summer when little work was available from MTS;  Mr Kiwikiwi had no separate accounts and did not operate under a business entity (such as a company);  Mr Kiwikiwi did not bring any experience or skill to the position;  Mr Kiwikiwi took no financial risk with his own capital and could not alter his profits by changing his work habits. 100. Judge Shaw stated that the invoices that Mr Kiwikiwi rendered each fortnight were inconclusive as he only rendered them in order to get paid. 101. Integration: Judge Shaw found that Mr Kiwikiwi’s position was an integral part of the production process; it was “not an adjunct which the television station could do without” (at \[42\]). 102. Industry practice: Judge Shaw stated that industry practice can be relevant to both the intention of the parties and to the nature of the continuing relationship. However, the industry practice was not black and white, with MTS having employed a teleprompter as an employee in the past, and with TVNZ using a combination of employees and independent contractors. Therefore, industry practice did not assist in determining Mr Kiwikiwi’s employment status. Conclusion 103. Judge Shaw concluded that the real nature of the relationship between Mr Kiwikiwi and MTS was one of employer/employee. 19 Tsoupakis v Fendalton Construction Ltd Facts 104. The issue in Tsoupakis v Fendalton Construction Ltd was whether Mr Tsoupakis was an employee or an independent contractor. Mr Tsoupakis worked as a painter for Fendalton Construction for six months in 2005 and 2006 and then again for a year from 2007 to 2008. It was agreed by the parties that Mr Tsoupakis was an independent contractor during the 2005/2006 period. The issue before the Employment Court was whether Mr Tsoupakis was an employee or an independent contractor for the 2007/2008 period. 105. Fendalton Construction hired both employees and independent contractors to undertake painting work. Contractors were generally paid a higher hourly rate. Fendalton Construction provided both types of staff with mobile phones to keep in touch during jobs. 106. Mr Tsoupakis was not given an employment agreement, despite repeatedly asking for a copy of his contract. 107. Mr Tsoupakis filled out a daily work record, including the hours worked and the address of the jobs worked on. He could reclaim costs of travel to jobs in some circumstances. Mr Tsoupakis submitted weekly invoices to Fendalton Construction for payment. 108. Mr Tsoupakis had his own business card that described him as a director of his own trading entity. There was no evidence that he used the card to solicit business for himself while working for Fendalton Construction. Mr Tsoupakis also had sign writing on his motor vehicle advertising his trading name and personal mobile number. Neither the car sign-writing nor the business card referred to Mr Tsoupakis’s association with Fendalton Construction. 109. While on jobs, Mr Tsoupakis was not supervised constantly by Fendalton Construction but on most jobs Mr Tsoupakis’s work was inspected by Fendalton Construction. 110. Fendalton Construction provided some of the tools required to do the jobs (although usually not paint brushes) and all of the consumables required (such as paint and rags). Mr Tsoupakis purchased materials as required for jobs using Fendalton Construction’s trade accounts. 111. Mr Tsoupakis was given work on a daily basis with detailed work directions. He could be redirected to jobs when Fendalton Construction required. Mr Tsoupakis was expected to meet set criteria such as the time to be taken and the volume of paint to be used. He was required to check in with Fendalton Construction when he finished a job. Mr Tsoupakis could not delegate his work to others to complete, and he was expected not to undertake other work. Application of law 112. Intention of the parties: Chief Judge Colgan found that there was no discernable mutual intention of the parties as there had been no express discussion about the nature of their relationship. 113. Control: Chief Judge Colgan found that Fendalton Construction exercised a high degree of control over Mr Tsoupakis’s work – both what was done and also how and when it was to be done. Mr Tsoupakis had to account in detail for his hours of work and had no ability to delegate or organise as he chose. In reality he was constrained from working for anyone else or for himself. 114. Integration: The facts pointed towards Mr Tsoupakis having some elements of independence from Fendalton Construction – in particular his business cards, the sign-writing on his vehicle, and that he was invited to the contractors’ Christmas 20 party (as opposed to the employees’ party). Chief Judge Colgan found that despite these elements Tsoupakis was an integral part of Fendalton’s business in the same way as would be expected of an employee. Factors pointing towards Mr Tsoupakis’s integration were that he was held out as a member of Fendalton Construction’s staff and that he was paid for the time that he worked rather than a set fee for each job. 115. Fundamental test: Chief Judge Colgan found that Mr Tsoupakis was not in business on his own account. Mr Tsoupakis provided his own paint brushes but other equipment was provided by Fendalton Construction. The fact Mr Tsoupakis was not trained by Fendalton Construction was a neutral factor as Mr Tsoupakis was engaged as an experienced tradesperson. 116. Industry practice: Only limited evidence was presented to the Court on industry practice in the painting industry. Chief Judge Colgan found that the evidence of industry practice was neutral as it established that companies (including Fendalton Construction) engaged both independent contractors and employees as painters. Conclusion 117. Chief Judge Colgan concluded that Mr Tsoupakis was an employee of Fendalton Construction for the 2007/2008 period. List of other recent cases 118.

Interpretation guidelines discuss the Commissioner's approach to the interpretation of a general area of law where there are also taxation implications. They are intended to clarify general points of interpretation that may cause difficulty for practitioners, taxpayers and Inland Revenue. 2. This interpretation guideline reviews the New Zealand, Australian and English case law on sham. In doing so, it clarifies the Commissioner’s understanding of:  the meaning of sham;  when sham can be alleged;  how the courts determine whether there is a sham; and  the consequences of a finding of sham. To illustrate the practical application of the sham doctrine, the guideline summarises two significant sham cases and discusses two factual examples. 3. The conclusions reached in this interpretation guideline are set out in paragraphs 5 – 13 below. The main conclusions can be summarised as follows:  An allegation of sham is serious – it is akin to an allegation of fraud. The courts have stated that an allegation of sham should not be made lightly, and that a high standard of evidence is required to prove it.  A sham exists where the parties to the transaction documents did not intend to create the legal rights and obligations created by those documents, and intended to mislead third parties into considering they had created those legal rights and obligations. The parties intended either to create different rights and obligations to those recorded in the documents, or to create no legal rights or obligations at all.  In considering whether the transaction documents are shams, the courts are concerned with the parties’ subjective intentions, and not 2 with the economic substance or commercial reality of the transaction.  A sham can exist at the time the documents are created. Documents that were bona fide when created can later become shams. This will occur when the parties agree to change the terms of their transaction, but leave the original documents standing so as to give the impression that those documents continue to accurately record the terms of their transaction.  If the court is satisfied that the allegation of sham is proven, the documents are disregarded to the extent they are shams. A document may be a sham in part and, in such cases, only that part of the document will be disregarded. The true arrangement between the parties (ie, the legal rights and obligations (if any) they created) is then given effect and the parties taxed accordingly. By contrast, if the court is satisfied that the documents are not shams, the parties are taxed in accordance with the legal rights and obligations created in those documents (except where s BG 1 or another anti-avoidance provision applies). 4. This interpretation guideline replaces the earlier interpretation guideline “Sham – meaning of the term”, Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 9, No 11 (November 1997). This guideline does not signal a change of approach by the Commissioner towards sham. The main differences between this guideline and the earlier guideline can be summarised as follows:  The earlier guideline has been reorganised and revised so as to improve its readability.  The earlier guideline’s analysis has been updated to take account of subsequent court decisions, in particular the Supreme Court’s decision in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289.  New discussion has been inserted on the onus and standard of proof where sham is alleged in the tax law context. Analysis Summary 5. As a general rule, the tax treatment of transactions between taxpayers depends on the legal rights and obligations created by the transaction documents. However, if satisfied that the documents are “shams”, the courts disregard them to the extent they are shams. The court then gives effect to the true legal arrangement between the parties and the parties are taxed accordingly. 6. The essential characteristic of a sham is pretence. A sham exists where the parties intend the transaction documents to mislead third parties as to the true nature of the relationship between the parties. The parties intend either to create different rights and obligations to those recorded in the documents, or to create no legal rights or obligations at all. 7. The leading New Zealand authority on sham is Ben Nevis. In this decision, the Supreme Court reiterated the requirements for sham as set out in Diplock LJ’s judgment in Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd \[1967\] 2 QB 786 (CA). It also described the effect of a sham in the tax law context (at \[33\]): 3 A sham in the taxation context is designed to lead the taxation authorities to view the documentation as representing what the parties have agreed when it does not record their true agreement. The purpose is to obtain a more favourable taxation outcome than that which would have eventuated if documents reflecting the true nature of the parties’ transaction had been submitted to the Revenue authorities . 8. To establish sham, it must be shown that the parties did not intend to create the legal rights and obligations recorded in the transaction documents; and that they intended that third parties would be misled by those documents into considering that the parties had created those legal rights and obligations. In considering whether there is a sham, the courts are concerned with the parties’ subjective intentions and not with the economic substance and commercial reality of the transaction. 9. A sham can exist from the time when a document is created. A document that was bona fide when created can later become a sham. This will happen where the parties agree to change the terms of their transaction, but leave the original transaction documents standing so as to give the impression that those documents continue to accurately record the terms of their transaction. 10. The courts’ approach to determining whether there is a sham can be outlined in three stages. 11. First, the courts determine the legal rights and obligations recorded in the documents. The courts interpret the documents objectively to arrive at the meaning a reasonable person would give them. They may consider evidence of surrounding circumstances at the time the documents were created to ascertain the meaning of the words used, but this evidence cannot be used to contradict or vary the terms of the documents. Evidence of the parties’ subjective intentions is not considered at this stage. 12. Second, the courts then consider whether there is evidence that the documents are shams. The courts are concerned with the parties’ subjective intentions at this stage. To show there is a sham, the courts must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that:  the parties did not intend to create the legal rights or obligations recorded in the documents, and  it was intended that third parties would be misled by those documents into thinking the parties had created those rights and obligations. An allegation of sham is serious – it is akin to an allegation of fraud. Consequently, the courts have made clear that an allegation of sham is not to be made lightly and that a high standard of evidence is required to prove it. 13. Third, if the court is satisfied the documents are shams, the documents are disregarded to the extent they are shams. A document may be a sham in part and, in such cases, only that part of the document will be disregarded. The true arrangement between the parties (ie, the legal rights and obligations (if any) they created) is then given effect and the parties taxed accordingly. By contrast, if the court is satisfied that the documents are not shams, the parties are taxed in accordance with the legal rights and obligations created in those documents (except where s BG 1 or another anti-avoidance provision applies). 4 Meaning of sham 14. The doctrine of sham is a long-standing doctrine developed by the courts. In his article “Sham, trusts and mutual intention” \[2008\] NZLJ 227, Matthew Conaglen observes: For well over two hundred years, the courts have refused to permit sham transactions – transactions which were created as “a mere cloak or screen for another transaction” (Yorkshire Railway Wagon Co v Maclure (1882) 21 ChD 309 at 318) – to conceal the truth. They have asserted a jurisdiction to “see through” (ibid) such transactions to get at “the real truth of the matter” (Re Watson (1890) 25 QBD 27 at 33). ... The jurisdiction to ignore sham transactions is a jurisdiction of general application. English case law 15. The classic definition of sham is contained in Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd. In this English Court of Appeal decision, Diplock LJ stated (at 802): I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the 'sham' which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the Court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. But one thing, I think, is clear in legal principle, morality and the authorities ... that for acts or documents to be a 'sham,' with whatever legal consequences follow from this, all the parties thereto must have a common intention that the acts or documents are not to create the legal rights and obligations which they give the appearance of creating. 16. Diplock LJ’s definition was discussed in Hitch v Stone \[2001\] EWCA Civ 63, \[2001\] BTC 78. In this English Court of Appeal decision, Arden LJ stated (at \[63\], \[66\] and \[69\]): 63. The particular type of sham transaction with which we are concerned is that described by Diplock LJ in Snook, above. It is of the essence of this type of sham transaction that the parties to a transaction intend to create one set of rights and obligations but do acts or enter into documents which they intend should give third parties, in this case the Revenue, or the court, the appearance of creating different rights and obligations. The passage from Diplock LJ’s judgment set out above has been applied in many subsequent decisions and treated as encapsulating the legal concept of this type of sham. ... 66. Second, as the passage from Snook makes clear, the test of intention is subjective. The parties must have intended to create different rights and obligations from those appearing from (say) the relevant document, and in addition they must have intended to give a false impression of those rights and obligations to third parties. ... 69. Fifth, the intention must be a common intention: see Snook’s case, above. 17. Diplock LJ’s judgment in Snook is authority for the proposition that a sham will exist where:  the parties intended that the transaction documents (or the acts they have done) would not create the legal rights or obligations they appear to create; and  it was intended that the documents (or acts) would mislead a third party into believing the parties had created those rights and obligations. 5 New Zealand case law 18. New Zealand courts have defined sham consistently with Diplock LJ’s judgment in Snook. As defined by the New Zealand courts, a sham exists where the parties execute documents, or do acts, so as to mislead third parties as to the true nature of the legal arrangement between the parties. The parties either intended to create different rights and obligations to those recorded in the documents, or to create no legal rights or obligations at all. 19. For example, in Bateman Television Ltd v Coleridge Finance Co Ltd \[1969\] NZLR 794 (CA), Turner J held (at 813): I think that the occasions on which Courts have set aside the form of a transaction as a "sham" are confined to cases in which, really doing one thing, the parties have resorted to a form which does not fit the facts in order to deceive some third person, often the revenue authorities, into the belief that they were doing something else. Thus where in a lease both parties prescribe a rent in excess of what is really to be paid, so as to deceive those who collect taxes as to the quantum of a deduction to be allowed, this is a sham ... . To similar effect, in the same decision McCarthy J reiterated Diplock LJ’s judgment in Snook by stating (at 821): ... whatever else is accepted as being involved in the concept of a sham, one thing is clear in legal principle, morality and authority, namely that for acts or documents to be a sham all the parties thereto must have a common intention that the acts or documents are not to create legal rights and obligations which they give the appearance of creating. 20. By contrast, there is no sham if the parties intended the document to be legally effective. In Paintin and Nottingham Ltd v Miller Gale and Winter \[1971\] NZLR 164 (CA), Turner J held (at 175): The word "sham" is well on the way to becoming a legal shibboleth; on its mere utterance it seems to be expected that contracts will wither like one who encounters the gaze of a basilisk. But by a "sham" is meant, in my opinion, no more and no less than an appearance lent by documents or other evidentiary material, concealing the true nature of a transaction, and making it seem something other than what it really is. The word "sham" has no applicability to transactions which are intended to take effect, and do take effect, between the parties thereto according to their tenor ... . 21. In Marac Finance Ltd v Virtue \[1981\] 1 NZLR 586 (CA), Richardson J stated (at 588) that a sham could exist at the outset when the documents are created. Alternatively, the documents might be bona fide when created but could later become shams. This would happen when the parties agree to change the terms and conditions of their transaction, but decide to leave the original documents unchanged so as to mislead third parties: Where the essential genuineness of the documentation is challenged a document may be brushed aside if and to the extent that it is a sham. There are two such situations: (1) where the document does not reflect the true agreement between the parties in which case the cloak is removed and recognition given to their common intentions; and (2) where the document was bona fide in inception but the parties have departed from their initial agreement and yet have allowed its shadow to mask their new arrangement. See similar statements in Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA), at 160. 22. In the trust law context, the Court of Appeal in Official Assignee v Wilson \[2007\] NZCA 122, \[2008\] 3 NZLR 45 clarified that whether there is a sham depends on the subjective intention of the parties. Robertson and O’Regan JJ held (at \[50\]): An important prior question is whether common intention must be ascertained objectively, as is usual in the construction of commercial documents, or subjectively, in the departure from orthodox norms of construction. Where a sham is alleged, should a Court look behind the objective trust appearance of an alleged sham so as to ascertain 6 the true nature of the transaction? The answer must be “Yes”. Otherwise, the most insidious kinds of shams are those most able to work their mischief. To answer “No” would be to give exaggerated weight to the objective appearance of a transaction. While the objective appearance is the default determinant of a transaction’s effect and substance, sham transactions are by definition transactional aberrations, and therefore require departure from the default principles of analysis. Glazebrook J concurred with Robertson and O’Regan JJ (at \[108\]): In my view, where a sham is alleged, the search is for subjective intent that the transaction is a sham. After all, the whole point of a sham is that it is intended to have an effect other than the effect it would have if looked at objectively. See Conaglen at p 186, Hitch v Stone \[2001\] STC 214 at para \[56\] per Arden LJ (for the Court) and Sharrment v Official Trustee (1988) 18 FCR 449 at p 456, where Lockhart J said: It is not clear from Diplock LJ’s formulation \[in Snook \] whether it is the subjective intention of the parties that is determinative, although logically this seems to be the correct result. In Coppleston’s case Hunt J (at 98; 4022) took the view that the authorities established that it is the intention of the parties to the transaction which determines the question whether the act or document was never intended to be operative according to its tenor at all but rather was meant to cloak another and different transaction. 23. In Official Assignee v Wilson the Court of Appeal accepted that the sham doctrine can apply to express trusts. Some overseas courts have also accepted that express trusts can be shams: Midland Bank Plc v Wyatt \[1995\] 1 FLR 697 (Ch); Shalson v Russo \[2003\] EWHC 1637 (Ch), \[2005\] Ch 281; Sharrment Pty Ltd v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1988) 18 FCR 449 (FCAFC). The law is not entirely settled as there are some issues concerning how the sham doctrine applies to trusts, for example, as to whether a validly created trust can subsequently become a sham trust and vice-versa. 24. The New Zealand and English case law on sham was summarised by the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis. This decision is the latest and leading authority on sham in New Zealand. In Ben Nevis the Supreme Court stated (at \[33\], footnote omitted): There is no need for us to engage in any extended discussion of what constitutes a sham for present purposes. In essence, a sham is a pretence. It is possible to derive the following propositions from the leading authorities. A document will be a sham when it does not evidence the true common intention of the parties. They either intend to create different rights and obligations from those evidenced by the document or they do not intend to create any rights or obligations, whether of the kind evidenced by the document or at all. A document which originally records the true common intention of the parties may become a sham if the parties later agree to change their arrangement but leave the original document standing and continue to represent it as an accurate reflection of their arrangement. The “leading authorities” referred to by the Supreme Court were (at footnote 34) Snook v London & West Riding Investments Ltd; Paintin and Nottingham Ltd v Miller Gale and Winter; and NZI Bank Ltd v Euro- National Corporation Ltd \[1992\] 3 NZLR 528 (CA). 25. The English and New Zealand decisions refer to the need to show the parties to the alleged sham had a “common intention”. The courts have not provided much guidance on this common intention requirement. It is clear it must be shown that the parties did not intend to create the legal rights and obligations recorded in the transaction documents. It is also clear it must be shown that it was intended that the documents would mislead third parties into thinking that those legal rights and obligations had been created. What is less clear is whether both parties must share in this intention to mislead. 26. Some United Kingdom decisions have suggested that a sham may exist where only one party intends to deceive, and the other party “merely went 7 along with the ‘shammer’ not either knowing or caring about what he or she was signing”: Midland Bank Plc v Wyatt \[1995\] 1 FLR 697, at 699 – 700; Minwalla v Minwalla \[2004\] EWHC 2823 (Fam), \[2005\] 1 FLR 771. Other United Kingdom decisions have rejected this approach: Shalson v Russo; Al-Sabah & Abacus Ltd v Grupo Torras SA \[2004\] WTLR 1 (Royal Court (Jersey)). 27. It is unclear which approach will be taken in New Zealand. In Official Assignee v Wilson, Robertson and O’Regan JJ noted (at \[36\] – \[39\]) that Wyatt could be seen to support the proposition that it is sufficient that one party intends to mislead, while the other party is “reckless or ignorant” about what he or she was signing and goes along with the “shammer”. However, their Honours stopped short of endorsing this approach, and instead noted that an “alternative view” was that Wyatt did not support this proposition. In her separate concurring judgment, Glazebrook J noted (at \[114\]) that the “weight of overseas authority suggests ... complicity or at least ... ignorance and recklessness” by one party might be sufficient. Her Honour also stopped short of endorsing this approach. Australian case law 28. Australian courts have defined sham consistently with Snook and the New Zealand case law: Cranstoun v FCT 84 ATC 4,876 (QSC); Faucilles Pty Ltd v FCT 90 ATC 4,003 (FCAFC); Case W48 89 ATC 460; and Sonenco (No. 87) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1992) 111 ALR 131 (FCAFC). 29. For example, in Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd \[2004\] HCA 55, 211 ALR 101, the High Court of Australia held (at \[46\]): “Sham” is an expression which has a well-understood legal meaning. It refers to steps which take the form of a legally effective transaction but which the parties intend should not have the apparent, or any, legal consequences. The High Court of Australia cited the Full Federal Court of Australia’s decision in Sharrment v Official Trustee. In this decision, the Full Federal Court cited Diplock LJ’s judgment in Snook and held (at 454): A “sham” is therefore, for the purposes of Australia law, something that is intended to be mistaken for something else or that is not really what it purports to be. It is a spurious imitation, a counterfeit, a disguise or a false front. It is not genuine or true, but something made in imitation of something else or made to appear to be something which it is not. It is something which is false or deceptive. 30. Again, in the Full Federal Court of Australia decision in Richard Walter Pty Ltd v FCT 96 ATC 4,550, Hill J defined (at 4,562): ... a transaction as being a sham transaction where it involves: A common intention between the parties to the apparent transaction that it be a disguise for some other and real transaction or for no transaction at all. In so doing I give effect to the words emphasised in the passage from Diplock LJ \[in Snook\]. For example, parties might bring into existence a document described as a mortgage which records an advance by a lender to a borrower of a sum of money and the obligation of the borrower to repay it. The document may be a disguise in the sense that while on its face it appears to be a mortgage securing an obligation to repay, there is no real transaction at all behind it for which the document will be a disguise. Such would commonly be the case where the so called mortgage is brought into existence as part of a "money-laundering" exercise to enable a fraudulent explanation to be given as to how certain funds came into the hands of the person described as the mortgagor. However, in a case such as the present where there have been real payments made by bills of exchange in the form of cheques cleared through the banking accounts of the parties and recorded as loans in relevant books of account, the transactions involving the bills of exchange can clearly not be a disguise for something which is not a transaction at all. Rather, for there to be a sham there will need, in such a case, to be a 8 common intention of both the apparent lender and the apparent borrower, that the transaction which they have purported to have entered into disguises some real transaction. In his separate concurring judgment, Lockhart J also defined (at 4,552) sham consistently with Snook. 31. These Australian cases may therefore assist in understanding and applying the sham doctrine in New Zealand. However, the High Court of Australia’s decision in Raftland Pty Ltd v FCT 2008 ATC ¶20-029 (HCA) suggests a broader approach to sham might be taken by the Australian courts in the future. 32. In Raftland, the majority of the High Court (Gleeson CJ, and Gummow and Crennan JJ) suggested transaction documents can be shams even if there was no evidence that the parties intended to mislead third parties. Their Honours stated (at \[35\] – \[36\]) that the term “sham” could be used in a “less pejorative” sense to cover cases where there is an “apparent discrepancy between the entitlements appearing on the face of the documents and the way in which the funds were applied ... \[that could give\] rise to a question whether the documents were to be taken at face value”. 33. In their separate judgments, Kirby J (at \[145\] – \[146\]) and Heydon J (at \[173\]) defined sham consistently with Diplock LJ’s judgment in Snook. Kirby J stated that traditionally Australian courts had adopted this narrow approach to sham. His Honour outlined the requirements of sham as follows (at \[145\] – \[146\] and \[148\], footnotes omitted): \[145\] The key to a finding of sham is the demonstration, by evidence or available inference, of a disparity between the transaction evidenced in the documentation (and related conduct of the parties) and the reality disclosed elsewhere in the evidence. Where, for example, the evidence shows a discordance between the parties' legal rights or obligations as described in the documents and the actual intentions which those parties are shown to have had as to their legal rights and obligations, a conclusion of sham will be warranted. \[146\] The test as to the parties' intentions is subjective. In essence, the parties must have intended to create rights and obligations different from those described in their documents. Such documents must have been intended to mislead third parties in respect of such rights and obligations. ... \[148\] To justify a conclusion that documents constitute a sham, the requisite intention to mislead must be a common intention of the parties. An exception may exist where the acts and documents reflect a transaction divisible into separate parts, such that a transaction is a sham as to part only of the transaction. 34. However, Kirby J left open the possibility that Australian courts might adopt a broader approach to sham (at \[159\]): There is an orthodox approach to sham, accepted and expressed in Australian legal doctrine, as in the law of other, similar jurisdictions. There have also been suggestions of the emergence of a broader approach to the notion of sham, particularly in revenue cases. I accept that the "narrower" approach to sham, explained by this Court in Equuscorp, is applicable to this case. It was correctly applied by the primary judge. However, in my view, the idea of sham could be broadened somewhat. Doing so would not cut across the language and purpose of the explicit tax avoidance provisions enacted as Pt IVA of the Act. On the contrary, such an approach would be compatible with that contained in Pt IVA and the purposes that led to the enactment of that Part. It would demonstrate, once again, that in the present age, the doctrines of the common law evolve in the orbit of statute. 35. The majority of the High Court, and Kirby J, did not discuss the boundaries of any broader conception of sham. Kirby J reviewed (at \[105\] – \[136\]) Commonwealth case law, and noted that in Canadian and some English cases “the judges have indicated some degree of willingness to consider 9 the development of a broader and more robust approach to the identification of a sham” (at \[113\]). In doing so, the Canadian and English courts had sought to “ameliorate the strictness” of Diplock LJ’s definition of sham in Snook by considering the economic substance and commercial reality of the transactions concerned. 36. In Raftland, Kirby J observed that in New Zealand, by contrast, the courts had adhered to a “narrow operation of the sham doctrine” that is consistent with Snook (at \[128\]). This is the Commissioner’s view as well. New Zealand case law is clear that, when considering allegations of sham, the courts are concerned only with the parties’ common intention (ie, whether the parties intended to mislead third parties as to the true nature of their relationship.) The courts are not concerned with the economic substance or commercial reality of the transaction. In Ben Nevis, the Supreme Court reiterated (at \[33\]) that a sham will exist when the transaction documentation “does not evidence the true common intention of the parties”. It also stated (at \[39\]): Those engaging in a sham are in reality seeking to deceive others as to the true nature of what they have agreed and are intending to achieve. 37. In R v Connolly (2004) 21 NZTC 18,884 (HC), the High Court rejected a broader approach to sham. In this decision, the Crown submitted that the term “sham” should be given a broader meaning “when examining schemes pursuing tax advantage”. Under this broader meaning, circular transactions involving no real money were shams as they were “fictional” (at \[72\] and \[74\]). Fogarty J rejected this submission. His Honour held (at \[99\] – \[100\]) that the New Zealand courts had adhered to the “classic definition of sham in Snook”. Consequently, there was no authority for “a broader meaning of sham, broader than the narrow definition in Snook”. Summary 38. A sham exists where the transaction documents created by the parties are intended to mislead third parties. The parties intend either to create different rights and obligations to those recorded in the documents, or to create no legal rights or obligations at all. 39. To establish sham it must be shown that the parties did not intend to create the legal rights and obligations recorded in the documents; and that they intended that third parties would be misled by the documents into considering that the parties had created those legal rights and obligations. In considering whether transaction documents are shams, the courts are concerned with the parties’ subjective intentions and not with the economic substance and commercial reality of the transaction. 40. A sham can exist at the time the documents are created. A document that was bona fide when created can later become a sham. This will happen where the parties agree to change the terms of their transaction, but leave the original documents standing so as to give the impression that those documents continue to accurately record the terms of their transaction. When sham can be alleged Sham cannot be alleged by a party to the transaction 41. Parties are bound by the legal documents they execute. They cannot argue that they are not bound by them (except where they were induced to execute the documents by fraud, mistake or misrepresentation). Consequently, the parties to a transaction cannot allege that the 10 documents they have executed are shams. In Official Assignee v Wilson, Glazebrook J stated (at \[109\]): This does not mean that a settlor is entitled to give later oral evidence of his or her subjective intentions, particularly where this is with a view of depriving the beneficiaries of their rights under the trust or ... defrauding a third party ... . \[I\]n Snook, Diplock LJ made it clear at p 802 ... that no unexpressed intentions of a “shammer” should affect the rights of a party whom he or she deceived. No halfway house between sham and a genuine arrangement 42. The courts have stated that there is no “halfway house” between a sham and a legally effective transaction. In Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 694 (CA), Richardson J said (at 706): ... at common law there is no halfway house between sham and characterisation of the transaction according to the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out. His Honour explained this position more fully in Mills v Dowdall, at 159: The only exceptions to the principle that the legal consequences of a transaction turn on the terms of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out are (i) where the essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged and sham is established; and (ii) where there is a statutory provision, such as s 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976, mandating a broader or different approach which applies in the circumstances of the particular case. A document may be brushed aside if and to the extent that it is a sham in two situations: (a) where the document does not reflect the true agreement between the parties, in which case the cloak is removed and recognition given to their common intentions ...; and (b) where the document was bona fide in inception but the parties have departed from their initial agreement while leaving the original documentation to stand unaltered. 43. No legal principle allows the courts to disregard documents that correctly record the parties’ intentions on the basis that the substance of the transaction could be interpreted in such a way that it would produce some different legal result. Consequently, the courts cannot disregard the legal arrangements that are in place and consider the economic substance when determining the tax treatment of an transaction: Re Securitibank Ltd (No 2) \[1978\] 2 NZLR 136 (CA), at 168; NZI Bank Ltd v Euro-National Corporation Ltd, at 539; Australia and New Zealand Savings Bank Ltd v FCT \[1993\] 25 ATR 369 (FCAFC). Onus and standard of proof 44. This section discusses the onus and standard of proof where sham is alleged in the tax law context. 45. When the Commissioner considers that the transaction documents are shams, the Commissioner will disregard the documents (to the extent they are shams) for the purposes of calculating the taxpayer’s tax liability. The Commissioner may then assess or reassess the taxpayer according to what the Commissioner considers is the true legal arrangement between the parties disguised by the documents. \[The consequences of a finding of a sham are discussed further in paragraphs 76 – 81 below.\] 46. For the Commissioner’s assessment to be valid, it cannot be made “arbitrarily in disregard of the law or facts as known to him” the Commissioner or be based on “an arbitrary conjecture or \[be\] demonstrably unfair”: Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 (CA), at 61,015 and 61,026. The Commissioner must make an honest judgement as to the tax liability on the information in the Commissioner’s possession: CIR v Canterbury Frozen Meat Company Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,150 (CA), at 11,160. This obligation cannot be elevated into a requirement that the 11 Commissioner not assess unless and until fully informed of the taxpayer's affairs: CIR v NZ Wool Board (1999) 19 NZTC 15,476 (CA), at 15,489. Nor is it a requirement for a valid assessment that the Commissioner must believe the assessment “will ultimately prove to be correct”: Canterbury Frozen Meat, at 11,160. The courts have noted that the taxpayer is likely to be in the best position to provide the evidence required to determine the allegation: Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA), at 61,283; Case N39 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,333. 47. Therefore, the Commissioner when making an assessment must act in good faith. The assessment must be based on the available facts and so represent the Commissioner’s honest opinion. This means that, before disregarding a document on the basis of sham, the Commissioner must honestly consider that the available information supports the document being a sham. The Commissioner is not required to be completely confident that a court would uphold the sham allegation. 48. However, the Commissioner must give due regard to the fact that an allegation of sham is akin to an allegation of fraud. As the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis stated (at \[39\]): An allegation of sham, being akin to an allegation of fraud, should not be lightly made. Those engaging in a sham are in reality seeking to deceive others as to the true nature of what they have agreed and are intending to achieve. Similarly, in Case U6 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,038 the Taxation Review Authority stated that the allegation of sham is “a very serious allegation” and that (at \[86\]): The facts must be measured against the gravity of the allegation and such a serious charge must always be responsibly made. 49. If the taxpayer disagrees with the Commissioner’s view that the document is a sham, the taxpayer may challenge the assessment through the disputes process. If this occurs, the Commissioner has the “evidentiary onus” of pointing to evidence supporting the sham allegation. The standard of proof on the Commissioner is commensurate with the gravity of the allegation of sham: Case X10 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,155, at \[121\]. 50. Under s 149A(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the onus of proof is on the taxpayer to show why the assessment is wrong and by how far it is wrong: Buckley & Young; Beckham v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 22,066 (CA). The standard of proof required is the balance of probabilities: Yew v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,710 (CA). This means that the taxpayer must establish on the balance of probabilities that the evidence or inferences pointed to by the Commissioner do not support the allegation of sham: Case X10, at \[123\]. Courts’ approach to determining sham 51. This section discusses the New Zealand courts’ approach to determining whether there is a sham. Courts’ general approach to analysing transaction documents 52. Before considering whether there is evidence supporting an allegation of sham, the courts determine what legal rights and obligations are created by the transaction documents. 53. The following principles were set out by Richardson J in Re Securitibank (No. 2) and Marac Finance Ltd v Virtue: 12  The true nature of the transaction must first be determined in a careful, systematic and objective way.  The legal character of the transaction is decisive of its true nature and not the overall economic consequences to the party.  The legal character of the transaction cannot be determined conclusively by the nomenclature or labelling that is used by the parties. It is the inevitable effect of the terms of the contract that matters, not simply the form or language in which the parties chose to express it.  In order to determine the true nature of the legal relationship the whole of the contract must be considered.  Where the transaction is embodied in several interrelated documents, all the documents must be considered together and one may be read to explain the others.  The documents are interpreted objectively so as to arrive at the meaning they would reasonably convey to a reasonable person.  When interpreting the transaction documents, the courts are not concerned with ascertaining the parties’ subjective intentions. The courts may consider the circumstances surrounding the entering into the transaction, and oral evidence may be admitted for the purposes of ascertaining the surrounding circumstances. Such evidence allows the courts to understand the setting in which the documents were executed. It cannot be given for the purposes of varying or contradicting the documents. 54. More recently, the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis v CIR at \[48\] emphasised that the character of the transaction is determined by the “true meaning of all provisions” of the documents, not the labels adopted in those documents: ... it is the true meaning of all provisions in a contract that will determine the character of a transaction rather than the label given to it. The label “licence premium” is accordingly not what is important in the present case, but rather the true contractual nature of the legal rights for which payment is to be made and the effect of applying the tax legislation to a payment of that character. 55. For further discussion on the interpretation of contractual documents, see: Vector Gas Ltd v Bay of Plenty Energy Ltd \[2010\] NZSC 5, \[2010\] 2 NZLR 444,; Yoshimoto v Canterbury Golf International Ltd \[2001\] 1 NZLR 523 (CA); Boat Park Ltd v Hutchinson \[1999\] 2 NZLR 74 (CA). Matters the courts examine when determining if there is a sham 56. After ascertaining the legal rights and obligations recorded in the transaction documents, the courts consider whether any evidence shows that:  the parties intended to create different legal rights and obligations to those created by the transaction documents; and  it was intended that third parties would be misled by the documents into considering that they had created the legal rights and obligations created by the documents. 57. When considering an allegation of sham, the courts are concerned to ascertain the parties’ subjective intentions: Official Assignee v Wilson, at \[50\] and \[108\]. As a result, the courts consider evidence that would normally be excluded when determining the objective meaning of the 13 documents: Buckley & Young, at 61,277. In Hitch v Stone, the English Court of Appeal stated (at \[65\]): First, in the case of a document, the court is not restricted to examining the four corners of the document. It may examine external evidence. This will include the parties’ explanations and circumstantial evidence, such as evidence of the subsequent conduct of the parties. In Raftland Kirby J stated (at \[147\] footnote excluded): Where a court is considering a suggestion of sham that has a reasonably arguable evidential foundation, the court will not be confined to examining the propounded documentation alone. It may examine (and draw inferences from) other evidence, including the parties' explanations (if any) as to their dealings, and evidence describing their subsequent conduct. 58. The courts are reluctant to find sham and require clear evidence to justifying doing so. Mere circumstances of suspicion do not by themselves establish a transaction as a sham; it must be shown that the outward and visible form does not coincide with the inward and substantial truth: Miles v Bull \[1969\] 1 QB 258, at 264. An allegation of sham may be proven even in the absence of direct evidence, and on the basis of inferences drawn from the surrounding circumstances: Sharrment v Official Trustee, at 539. However, where there is no direct evidence, the courts require “compelling material”. A finding of sham cannot be made if another inference is at least equally open on the facts: Official Assignee v Wilson, at \[93\]; Sharrment v Official Trustee, at 544. 59. The courts’ reluctance to find sham is attributable to them recognising the need for “commercial certainty”. In Official Assignee v Wilson, the Court of Appeal stated (at \[52\] and \[111\]): \[52\] ... that courts will not wantonly interfere in ostensibly valid commercial transactions. ... A Court will only look behind a transaction’s ostensible validity if there is good reason to do so, and “good reason” is a high threshold, since a premium is placed on commercial certainty. ... \[111\] ... The party asserting the existence of the sham bears the onus of proving this on the balance of probabilities. Further, the ordinary approach to proof in civil cases should apply, where the more serious the allegation, the less likely it is that the event occurred and, therefore the stronger the evidence must be before the allegation will be established on the balance of probabilities ... . In Raftland Kirby J stated to similar effect (at \[144\]): Although, therefore, courts will ordinarily give legal effect to documents according to their language, sham analysis is an exception to that conventional approach. That is why it requires exceptional circumstances to enliven a conclusion that documents and acts amount to a sham, with the legal results that such a conclusion justifies. Tax avoidance 60. Sham is not the same as tax avoidance. In Ben Nevis the Supreme Court emphasised (at \[34\]) that sham and tax avoidance are different: It is important to keep firmly in mind the difference between sham and avoidance. A sham exists when documents do not reflect the true nature of what the parties have agreed. Avoidance occurs, even though the documents may accurately reflect the transaction which the parties intend to implement, when, for reasons to be discussed more fully below, the arrangement entered into gives a tax advantage which Parliament regards as unacceptable. The Supreme Court held (at \[38\]) that the fact the transactions concerned involved or facilitated tax avoidance did not mean they were shams. Similarly in Accent Management Ltd v CIR \[2007\] NZCA 230, (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323, the Court of Appeal held (at \[59\]) that the concepts of sham and tax avoidance are not correlatives. 14 61. Consequently, a transaction can be a “tax avoidance arrangement” under s BG 1 without being a sham. Similarly, a transaction can be a sham without being a “tax avoidance arrangement”. If a transaction involves tax avoidance, but the documents reflect the true nature of what the parties have agreed, the Commissioner can only challenge it under s BG 1 (or any other anti-avoidance provision). 62. That sham and tax avoidance are different does not preclude the Commissioner from alleging that a transaction is a sham and, in the alternative, a tax avoidance arrangement. Legally discouraged or prohibited arrangements 63. A transaction is not a sham only because it is discouraged or prohibited by legislation: Sharrment Pty Ltd v Official Trustee, at 455. Transaction documents that take effect between the parties as they are intended cannot be shams even if, for example, they are deliberately planned so as to fraudulently prefer one creditor over others. Other statutes and rules of law may “thwart the intentions” of those who enter into particular transactions, but the fact that the law does so does not mean such transactions are shams: Paintin and Nottingham Ltd v Miller Gale and Winter, at 175. Ulterior purpose or motive 64. A transaction is not a sham merely because the parties entered it with an ulterior purpose or motive. “If what is done is genuinely done, it does not remain undone merely because there was an ulterior purpose in doing it”: Miles v Bull (No 1), at 264. For example, in Official Assignee v Wilson, at \[123\] the settlor created a trust for the ostensible purpose of providing for his children. The evidence showed that the settlor had set up the trust for the ulterior purpose of keeping his assets secure from creditors. The Court of Appeal held that this evidence did not show that the trust was a sham. However, this does not mean that evidence of an ulterior purpose is irrelevant. The existence of an ulterior purpose by one or both parties, together with other factors, may be considered relevant evidence of the parties’ real intentions: Re La Rosa; Ex p Norgard v Rocom Pty Ltd (1990) 93 ALR 571 (FCA), at 581. Parties’ subsequent conduct 65. When considering allegations of sham, the courts are not restricted to considering the parties’ conduct before or at the time the transaction documents were created. The courts are entitled to consider the parties’ subsequent conduct: AG Securities Ltd v Vaughan \[1990\] 1 AC 417 (HL), at 475. 66. The case law shows that the courts have been frequently asked to find sham on the basis of that the parties acted inconsistently with the terms of the transaction documents. The courts have held that such evidence does not necessarily show the parties did not intend the documents to be effective and binding. In Hitch v Stone the English Court of Appeal stated (at \[68\]): ... the fact that parties subsequently depart from an agreement does not necessarily mean that they never intended the agreement to be effective and binding. The proper conclusion to draw may be that they agreed to vary their agreement and that they have become bound by the agreement as varied ... . 15 Similarly, in Sonenco (No 87) Pty Ltd, the Full Federal Court of Australia stated (at \[82\]): As was pointed out in Snook ... one must first determine what were the genuine common intentions of the parties. If the acts and documents in question reflect those intentions, there will be no “sham”. Haphazard conduct or departures from the provisions of the documentation may, or may not, indicate that the documents do not truly reflect what was intended. What is crucial ... is the ascertainment of the parties’ real intentions. For similar comments, see Australian Guarantee Corporation (NZ Ltd) v Broadlands Finance Ltd; General Motors Acceptance Corporation (NZ) Ltd v Australian Guarantee Corporation (NZ) Ltd and Broadlands Finance Ltd (HC Auckland, A 256/80, 11 October 1983), at 22. 67. It is noted that part performance of the terms of the document does not preclude a finding of sham. In Hitch v Stone the English Court of Appeal stated (at \[76\]): However I would not agree with the judge that performance of the 1984 agreement in part was sufficient to remove the possibility of its being a sham. Part performance of the 1984 agreement does not in my judgment mean that it cannot be a sham. The terms actually performed may be terms of the true arrangement between the parties and they may accordingly have somewhat different consequences from the same terms appearing in the sham transaction. The correspondence of the terms in this respect is then coincidental and partial. Mislabelled or carelessly prepared documents 68. On occasions, parties may use incorrect terms in their transaction documents. For example, the parties may use the term “lease” in the documents when the legal effect of the documents is that they have created a licence; or one party may be described as an “independent contractor” when the legal effect of the documents is that this party is an “employee”. Mislabelling does not, by itself, mean the documents are shams. In Accent Management Ltd, the Court of Appeal stated (at \[54\]): At trial the argument against the taxpayers other than those associated with Dr Muir and Mr Bradbury was that the arrangements were shams because they were not true insurance arrangements. The conclusion does not follow logically from the asserted premise. A contract can be mislabelled without being ineffective. If the relevant arrangements were mislabelled as "insurance" but were nonetheless intended to create real legal obligations which were to be honoured, they would necessarily not be shams. As the Court of Appeal held, a mislabelled transaction document cannot be disregarded if the parties intended the legal rights and obligations created by the document to be legally effective. 69. Similarly, carelessness, or haste, in the preparation of the documents does not, by itself, provide evidence of sham: Bateman Television v Coleridge Finance Co Ltd; Coppleson v Commissioner of Taxation (1981) 52 FLR 95 NSWSC), at 104. Lack of commerciality or artificiality 70. “Artificiality and lack of a commercial point ... are not indicia of sham”: Accent Management Ltd v CIR (CA), at \[59\]. An artificial arrangement is not a sham if the transaction document "had the effect that it purported to have", and did not purport "to do something different from what the parties had agreed to do": IRC v Littlewoods Mail Order Stores Ltd \[1963\] AC 135 (HL), at 155; Sharrment Pty Ltd v Official Trustee, at 454-455; Sonenco (No 87) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation, at \[82\] – \[84\]. In Hitch v Stone, the English Court of Appeal stated (at \[67\]): ... the fact that the act or document is uncommercial, or even artificial, does not mean that it is a sham. A distinction is to be drawn between the situation where parties make 16 an agreement which is unfavourable to one of them, or artificial, and a situation where they intend some other arrangement to bind them. In the former situation, they intend the agreement to take effect according to its tenor. In the latter situation, the agreement is not to bind their relationship. 71. That the transaction between the parties is circular will not, by itself, show it is a sham. In Re Barnett (Deceased) Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Barnett (1969) 2 NSWR 720 (NSWSC), at 730-731, the Supreme Court of New South Wales held that a transaction was not a sham only because it involved a “round robin of cheques” (ie, the cheques exchanged by the parties were not cashed and instead cancelled each other out). Similarly, in Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd, the High Court of Australia rejected (at \[46\] – \[48\]) the submission that the transactions were shams as no “real money” was lent or brought into the venture. The evidence showed that the parties intended the transactions to be legally effective – debts were created and satisfied by the debiting and crediting of the parties’ accounts. 72. This does not mean that artificiality or lack of commerciality is irrelevant when deciding whether there is a sham: Case X10, at \[116\]. The courts have taken into account (along with other factors) elements of artificiality and lack of commerciality when deciding whether the documents reflect the legal rights and obligations the parties intended to create: Erris Promotions Ltd v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,330 (HC), at \[106\]; Raftland Pty Ltd, at \[149\]; Hitch v Stone, at \[75\] – \[80\]. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Jones \[2001\] 1 BCLC 98 (Ch), the English High Court (Chancery Division) stated (at 109): Accordingly, while the palpable, and freely admitted artificiality of the agreements in the present case cannot be doubted, it certainly does not follow that, as a result, the agreements must be shams. However, in my judgment, the fact that a particular transaction is palpably artificial is a factor which can properly be taken into account when deciding whether it is a sham. Indeed, it would seem to me to require very unsual circumstances before the court held that a transaction which was not artificial was in fact a sham. 73. The courts have emphasised that the complexity of a transaction does not, by itself, establish that the arrangement is a sham: Sharrment Pty Ltd v Official Trustee, at 455. In Coppleson v Commissioner of Taxation the Supreme Court of New South Wales stated (at 100): The fact that, in order to obtain those advantages, the transaction became complex and elaborate rather than simple and straightforward does not seem to me to affect its true nature if in legal form it is a gift and if the parties thereto intended it to be operative according to its tenor ... . Parties adopt one legal form over another 74. A transaction is not a sham just because the parties could have structured it in another way. In Bateman Television v Coleridge Finance Co Ltd, the appellants entered into arrangements for the hire-purchase of television sets. The respondent submitted that the arrangements were “shams” in that the “reality” was that the arrangements were “moneylending transactions requiring the formalities prescribed by the Moneylenders Act \[1908\]”. Under the Moneylenders Act, moneylending arrangements were illegal and void if they did not conform to the formalities prescribed in the legislation. The Court of Appeal rejected this submission. Turner J stated (at 813): I think that the occasions on which Courts have set aside the form of a transaction as a “sham” are confined to cases in which, really doing one thing, the parties have resorted to a form which does not fit the facts in order to deceive some third person, ... into the belief that they were doing something else ... but I cannot agree that the term is applicable to the form of a transaction into which the parties are legally at liberty to 17 enter, and into which they do in fact enter, if what they do is simply to prefer this form of transaction to some other into which they might have entered, but did not. Part shams 75. In some cases the parties intended to create some, but not all, the legal rights and obligations recorded in the transaction documents. For example the parties may genuinely intend to create a sale and purchase agreement, yet also intend to deceive third parties by falsifying the pricing or payment terms in the agreement. In Hitch v Stone the English Court of Appeal held that a finding of sham is not excluded by the fact that parts of the document are genuine. Arden LJ stated (at \[85\]): ... the effect of Mr Price’s submission is that the court will be precluded from finding that a document is a sham because it includes an additional provision which is intended to be effective. This might deprive the doctrine of sham of any operation in a situation which is logically indistinguishable from the situation where the doctrine of sham already applies. In my judgment, the law does not require that in every situation every party to the act or document should be a party to the sham. I accordingly reject Mr Price’s submission save that I accept that the case where a document is properly held to be only in part a sham will be the exception rather than the rule, and will occur only where the document reflects a transaction divisible into separate parts. \[emphasis added\] Similarly in Raftland stated (at \[148\]) Kirby J stated: \[148\] To justify a conclusion that documents constitute a sham, the requisite intention to mislead must be a common intention of the parties. An exception may exist where the acts and documents reflect a transaction divisible into separate parts, such that a transaction is a sham as to part only of the transaction. Consequences of a finding of sham Transaction documents void and unenforceable “to the extent” that they are shams 76. When the courts find that the transaction documents are shams, the documents are disregarded “to the extent” they are shams: Buckley & Young, at 61,276. In Henwood v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271 (CA), Richardson J stated (at 12,276) that “\[d\]ocuments and clauses in documents may be brushed aside if they are sham.” Where the entire document is a sham, the document is “void and unenforceable” and “wholly invalid and of no effect”: Midland Bank plc v Wyatt; Minwalla v Minwalla. By contrast where part of the document is a sham and this part is severable, the document is void and unenforceable only in respect of that part: Raftland, at \[148\]; Case W48 89 ATC 460, at \[26\]. 77. It is noted that an innocent third party might be able to enforce rights arising under a sham arrangement: Hitch v Stone, at \[87\]; Official Assignee v Wilson, at \[120\] – \[122\], per Glazebrook J. 78. By contrast, if the court is satisfied that the documents are not shams, the documents contain the legal rights and obligations the parties intended to create. The Commissioner therefore cannot disregard the documents (unless there is statutory authorisation to do so, for example, under ss BG 1 and GA 1). Consequently, the parties are taxed in accordance with the legal rights and obligations created by the documents (except where s BG 1 or another anti-avoidance provision applies). True legal arrangement given effect 79. When the courts brush aside a sham document, they then ascertain the true legal arrangement between the parties. This does not involve 18 considering the economic substance of the arrangement. Instead the courts determine the legal rights and obligations (if any) that the parties intended to create. In Buckley & Young Richardson J stated (at 495): As a cloak or façade to conceal the true nature of the payment, the qualifying reference to the $6,000 per year must be brushed aside as not reflecting the true intentions of the parties. That step does not leave a vacuum. It becomes necessary to determine for what the payments were to be made. Just as oral evidence is always admissible in support of an argument that a transaction is in whole or in part a sham, so, too, that evidence may at the same time assist in determining what was the positive common intention of the parties in that regard. 80. In the tax context, this means that the parties to the sham are taxed on the basis of the true legal arrangement between them. As already discussed (see paragraphs 44 – 48 above), when the Commissioner considers the transaction document is a sham, the Commissioner will disregard that document (to the extent it is a sham) for the purposes of calculating the taxpayer’s tax liability. The Commissioner may then amend the taxpayers’ assessments to reflect the true legal arrangement between the parties. 81. The current approach of ascertaining the true arrangement between the parties can be contrasted with the approach taken in some earlier decisions concerning transactions involving the refinancing of existing liabilities. This earlier approach was explained in by Thorp J in Australian Guarantee Corporation (NZ Ltd) v Broadlands Finance Ltd, at 22 – 23: The significance of a finding of sham has changed. In the earlier cases, certainly when the transaction was in the nature of the refinancing of existing liability rather than the creation of a new obligation for the purpose of acquiring a new asset, a finding of sham almost inevitably led the court to infer that the true nature of the transaction was one of loan. That apparent dichotomy has been disavowed in a series of cases. His Honour identified (inter alia) Paintin and Re Securitibank Ltd (No 2) as decisions where the courts had “disavowed” this earlier approach, and stated (at 24): From these decisions it now follows, as I read the authorities, that a mere finding of sham, that is to say that the documentation amounts to a facade, will not aid the party who proves that fact unless, in addition, he can point to positive evidence that the underlying intention was one of loan. Case summaries 82. In New Zealand few reported tax cases have upheld a finding of sham. This is largely due to the courts’ reluctance to entertain sham allegations. The following tax law cases on sham will now be summarised:  Erris Promotions Ltd v CIR – where the High Court held that three software purchases were shams.  Accent Management Ltd and Ben Nevis – where the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court held that an insurance arrangement was not a sham. When reading these summaries, and also other decisions considering sham, it is important to keep in mind that a finding of sham in a particular case is inherently fact-dependent. Erris Promotions Ltd 83. In Erris Promotions Ltd, the High Court considered whether three software purchases were shams. Ronald Young J cited Diplock LJ’s definition of sham in Snook as “conveniently set\[ting\] out what constitutes a sham” (at 19 \[91\]). Applying Lord Diplock LJ’s definition, his Honour held that the three software purchases were shams. 84. With respect to the first software purchase, the parties had purported to buy and sell software. However, the facts showed that nothing was transferred “other than \[an\] idea which is in itself not depreciable”. There were no specifications, no source code and no software. Ronald Young J inferred from the lack of due diligence that the parties knew there was no software being bought and sold (at \[106\]): Any credible sale of software for $144m would require as a minimum extensive due diligence involving technical analysis of the software and what it could do, an in-depth analysis of the market, due diligence of legal issues which would include ensuring that the vendor owned the software. Enquiries would be made as to the cost of replicating this software and whether there were any other similar products available overseas. There was none of this because both parties knew the purchase was a sham. ... I find the agreement ... was a sham and that both parties knew there was nothing beyond an idea unable to be protected in a property sense, bought or sold. 85. Ronald Young J held that these facts showed the first purchase was a sham. His Honour did not consider it relevant that the $144 million price was “self-evidently an absurd purchase price” but observed, as an aside, that “\[t\]he purchase of an idea, not especially original, for $144m says it all” (at \[106\]). 86. With respect to the second software purchase, Ronald Young J held that the purported purchase was a sham because the vendor did not own the software. His Honour was satisfied that both parties knew the vendor did not own what he purported to sell (at \[119\]). The third software purchase was also a sham because the vendor did not own the software he purported to sell and, in addition, part of that software did not exist at the time of sale. Ronald Young J was satisfied that both parties knew that the vendor did not own the software and that it was not fully developed (at \[128\]). Accent Management Ltd and Ben Nevis 87. In Accent Management Ltd and Ben Nevis the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court considered whether insurance arrangements were shams. Under the insurance arrangements, the insured parties were insured for a “loss of surplus” expected to be derived from a forestry venture. In return, the insured parties were required to pay an initial premium of $1,307 per hectare each and, on or before 31 December 2047, another premium of $32,791 per hectare (with respect to one party) and $410,104 per hectare (with respect to the other party). The documentation provided that the last figure was to be adjusted so that the total amount required to be paid would not exceed the amount of the cover the insurer was obliged to provide. 88. The evidence showed the insurer was not expected to accumulate the premium income and had not entered into any reinsurance arrangements. On the structure of the insurance arrangements, there was no need for accumulations of premiums or reinsurance. This was because the net effect of the arrangements was that either one of the insured parties would default in its obligations (thereby releasing the insurer from its liability to make payment), or the 2047–2048 wash up would occur in a way that was self-funding for the insurer. In addition, the parent company of the insured parties gave the insurer a letter of comfort, and this created an additional element of circularity to the insurance arrangements. Under the letter of comfort, the parent company undertook to provide funds to the insurer to meet any claim under the 20 policy, provided the insurer had exhausted its resources and its ability to call on “contributors and/or insurers or reinsurers” in meeting claims. 89. The Court of Appeal examined the correspondence between the parties concerning the setting up of the insurance arrangements. One letter showed the parties considered that there was “no real risk in the whole thing”. Another letter showed the parties considered that the entering of the insurance arrangement was a necessary condition to obtain tax relief, and that the actual outcome of the arrangement in 2047–2048 was “not considered material”. 90. The Court of Appeal examined how the initial premium of $1,307 per plantable hectare paid to the insurer was used. The initial premium was first applied to cover the costs of establishing the insurer and to provide a US $200,000 bond required by the inspector of insurance in the British Virgin Islands. A substantial part of the remainder of the premium was paid as a “finder’s fee” to another entity, and was then made available to the family trusts of the arrangement’s architects. The net result was that the insurer retained only $157 per plantable hectare for possible accumulation, and the family trusts of the architects of the arrangement had the benefit of the “vast bulk” of the initial premiums. 91. The Court of Appeal held that the insurance arrangements by a “narrow margin” were not shams. 92. With respect to the requirement to pay the initial premium, the Court of Appeal stated that the arrangements were clearly “highly artificial and indeed contrived” (at \[58\]). However, artificiality and lack of commercial point (other than tax avoidance) are not indicia of sham, and the concepts of sham and tax avoidance were not correlatives. While there were “elements of pretence (and certainly concealment)” associated with the insurer’s arrangements with respect to the initial premiums it was paid, these were explicable on bases other than sham, in particular the possibility of disallowance by the Commissioner for tax avoidance (at \[59\]). Accordingly, the Court of Appeal declined to find that the insurance arrangement provisions as to the payment of the initial premiums were shams. 93. The Court of Appeal then considered whether the contractual provisions governing the 2047-2048 wash up were shams. It held that the evidence showed that the parties did not have any settled intention that the 2047 premiums would be paid. At the time of entering the arrangements, the parties regarded what would happen in 2047 as immaterial and to be addressed at that time. Their state of mind was “perhaps best categorised as involving indifference” as to whether the wash-up transactions occurred. This was presumably because, given the circular nature of insurance arrangements, the parties thought they could avoid the possibility of suffering any appreciable adverse consequences associated with the 2047 obligations (at \[62\]). 94. However, these factors did not persuade the Court of Appeal that the provisions for the 2047 wash-up were shams. It held (at \[63\]): By a narrow margin, however, we have reached the view that we cannot classify the transactions as shams. An obligation can be genuinely entered into even though subject to legal or practical defeasance or entered into on the basis that it might be replaced by another amended obligation. In a strange way, the very circularity which is involved in the transactions might be thought to be consistent with a desire that they be at least capable of achievement (or legally agreed variation) during or prior to the wash up. Whether these transactions are shams depends primarily on the states of mind of Dr Muir and Mr Bradbury as to their genuineness. Given that it is not to their advantage 21 that the transactions be shams, it might be thought a little perverse to attribute to them states of mind which are inconsistent with their best interests. 95. On appeal, the Court of Appeal’s conclusion on sham was upheld in Ben Nevis. However, the Supreme Court appeared to more firmly hold that the insurance arrangements were not shams: \[38\] The Courts below correctly applied the law and arrived at concurrent findings with which we agree. In short, we consider it has not been shown that the parties to the relevant documents were intending to deceive the Commissioner as to the nature of their arrangement in respect of insurance or as to their intention to implement the insurance arrangements according to their tenor. The fact that the insurance arrangements were constructed in a way that, as will later be demonstrated, materially contributed to the whole Trinity scheme being characterised as a tax avoidance arrangement does not, according to proper principles of law, mean that the insurance aspect of the whole scheme was a sham. The fact that the insurance arrangements were put in place with the purpose or effect of obtaining a tax advantage does not mean they were a sham. \[39\] The shifting nature of the Commissioner’s allegations of sham as this litigation proceeded, and the contradiction which derives from the Commissioner’s acceptance that the initial premium was prima facie deductible, makes it difficult for the Commissioner to sustain the proposition that the insurance arrangement was a sham. An allegation of sham, being akin to an allegation of fraud, should not be lightly made. Those engaging in a sham are in reality seeking to deceive others as to the true nature of what they have agreed and are intending to achieve. That is not shown here. 96. The Court of Appeal and Supreme Court’s decisions emphasise that an allegation of sham should not be lightly made as it is akin the fraud, and that clear evidence is required to support such an allegation. The decisions also emphasise that sham and tax avoidance are different. In this respect, it is observed that the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court held that the arrangements were not shams, even though they also held that s BG 1 applied to the same arrangements. Examples 97. These two examples illustrate how the sham doctrine might operate in practice. Example 1 98. C owns a shop that sells building materials. D owns and operates a house building company that is registered for GST purposes. D is currently building his own house using labour and materials provided by himself (and not his company). D wants to purchase building materials from C in order to complete his house. D visits C’s shop and purchases the materials using his own money. D informs C that he is purchasing the materials for his company, and asks C to prepare an agreement for sale and purchase of the materials that identifies D’s company as the purchaser. C and D sign the sale and purchase agreement. D then uses the building materials in the construction of his house. D claims input tax deductions for the GST paid on the building materials and, in support of his claims, produces the agreement for sale and purchase. 99. On the facts of this example, the agreement for sale and purchase is not a sham. In order to establish that the agreement is a sham, both parties must be shown to have the common intention not to create the legal rights and obligations contained in the agreement, and that it was intended that a third party (ie, Inland Revenue) would be misled into believing they had created these rights and obligations. 22 100. The common intention requirement is not satisfied on the facts. D did not intend that his company would take ownership of the building materials. Instead, D intended that he himself would take ownership of the materials, thereby enabling him to use them for building his house. D also intended to mislead Inland Revenue into believing that his company had purchased the materials, as shown by him presenting the agreement in support of his input tax deduction claims. However, the evidence does not suggest that C shared D’s intention. C was unaware of D’s intention to use the materials personally and, from his perspective, considered that he was contracting to sell the building materials to D’s company. 101. While the requirements of sham are not satisfied, it may be necessary to consider (as a separate matter) whether D’s claims amount to evasion or avoidance. Example 2 102. M works for P and is paid fortnightly wages that are subject to PAYE. M and P consider that they could both attain a tax advantage by opting out of their PAYE obligations, because P could stop deducting PAYE and M could take deductions not available to employees. Accordingly, M and P enter into a new contract that expressly states that the nature of the employment relationship is one “for service” rather than “of service”. The contract states that M is a self-employed independent contractor of P. Under the contract’s terms, P is not responsible for holiday pay or sick leave and M is responsible for supplying to P all the equipment, plant, and so on for the contract work. 103. After the new contract is signed, the only noticeable difference in the employment relationship is the contract. All other facets of the relationship between M and P remain the same. M and P do not implement the terms of the new contract and have no intention of doing so. The “employment relationship” maintains the same entitlements and obligations as before. Although the new contract stipulates that M is not entitled to holiday pay or sick leave, M continues to take paid holidays and sick leave. P continues to provide all the assets and make all the decisions regarding how the business and M’s services are to be managed. In reality, M and P are continuing to operate in a “master–servant” relationship. However, for tax purposes, P ceases to deduct PAYE from M’s fortnightly “contractual payments”. When queried about this lack of deduction, P produces the new contract for services as evidence of the new relationship. 104. The new employment relationship is clearly a sham. M and P intend to deceive the Commissioner by holding out that an independent contractual arrangement exists when clearly there is no change in the employment relationship. Once a sham is established, the new arrangement is ignored and legal effect is given to the real employment status. Also, it is likely that M’s failure to deduct PAYE from the “wages” mean M is subject to shortfall penalties. However, if M and P genuinely began to operate in accordance with the express terms in the new agreement for services then no sham would exist. Alternatively, if M and P entered into the new contract, did not implement its terms in practice, but continued to meet their legal and taxation obligations on the basis that an employment relationship still existed, there would not be a sham. For a sham to exist, the parties’ common intention must be to mislead someone else (such as the Commissioner) in respect of the true legal or factual position. 23 References Related rulings/statements Interpretation guideline, “Sham – meaning of the term”, Tax information Bulletin, Vol 9, No 11 (November 1997) Subject references Sham Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, s BG 1 Tax Administration Act 1994, s 113 and s 149A Case references Accent Management Ltd v CIR \[2007\] NZCA 230, (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323 AG Securities Ltd v Vaughan \[1990\] 1 AC 417 (HL) Al-Sabah & Abacus Ltd v Grupo Torras SA \[2004\] WTLR 1 (Royal Court (Jersey)) Australia and New Zealand Savings Bank Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation \[1993\] 25 ATR 369 (FCAFC) Australian Guarantee Corporation (NZ Ltd) v Broadlands Finance Ltd; General Motors Acceptance Corporation (NZ) Ltd v Australian Guarantee Corporation (NZ) Ltd and Broadlands Finance Ltd (HC Auckland, A 256/80, 11 October 1983) Bateman Television Ltd v Coleridge Finance Co Ltd \[1969\] NZLR 794 (CA) Beckham v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 22,066 (CA) Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 Boat Park Ltd v Hutchinson \[1999\] 2 NZLR 74 (CA) Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA) Case N39 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,333 Case U6 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,038 Case W48 89 ATC 460 Case X10 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,155 CIR v Canterbury Frozen Meat Company Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,150 (CA) CIR v New Zealand Wool Board (1999) 19 NZTC 15,476 (CA) Coppleson v Commissioner of Taxation (1981) 52 FLR 95 (NSWSC) Cranstoun v FCT 84 ATC 4,876 (QSC) Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd \[2004\] HCA 55 Erris Promotions Ltd v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,330 (HC) Faucilles Pty Ltd v FCT 90 ATC 4,003 (FCAFC) Henwood v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271 (CA) Hitch v Stone \[2001\] EWCA Civ 63, \[2001\] BTC 78 IRC v Littlewoods Mail Order Stores Ltd \[1963\] AC 135 (HL) Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,026 (CA) Marac Finance Ltd v Virtue \[1981\] 1 NZLR 586 (CA) Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR \[ 1986\] 1 NZLR 694 (CA) Midland Bank Plc v Wyatt \[1995\] 1 FLR 697 (Ch) Miles v Bull (No 1) \[1969\] 1 QB 258 Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA) Minwalla v Minwalla \[2004\] EWHC 2823 (Fam), \[2005\] 1 FLR 771 National Westminster Bank Plc v Jones \[2001\] 1 BCLC 98 (Ch) NZI Bank Ltd v Euro-National Corporation Ltd \[1992\] 3 NZLR 528 (CA) Official Assignee v Wilson \[2008\] NZCA 122, \[2008\] 3 NZLR 45 Paintin and Nottingham Ltd v Miller Gale and Winter \[1971\] NZLR 164 (CA) R v Connolly (2004) 21 NZTC 18,884 (HC) Raftland Pty Ltd v FCT 2008 ATC ¶ 20-029 (HCA) Re Barnett (Deceased) Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Barnett (1969) 2 NSWR 720 (NSWSC) Re La Rosa; Ex p Norgard v Rocom Pty Ltd (1990) 93 ALR 571 (FCA) Re Securitibank Ltd (No 2) \[1978\] 2 NZLR 136 (CA) Richard Walter Pty Ltd v FCT 96 ATC 4,550 (FCAFC) Shalson v Russo \[2003\] EWHC 1637 (Ch), \[2005\] Ch 281 Sharrment v Official Trustee (1988) 18 FCR 449 (FCAFC) Snook v London and West Riding Investment Ltd \[1967\] 2 QB 786 (CA) Sonenco (No. 87) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1992) 111 ALR 131 (FCAFC) Vector Gas Ltd v Bay of Plenty Energy Ltd \[2010\] NZSC 5, \[2010\] 2 NZLR 444 Yew v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,710 (CA) Yoshimoto v Canterbury Golf International Ltd \[2001\] 1 NZLR 523 (CA)

This Interpretation Guideline will help taxpayers determine their employment status for tax purposes. 2. This Interpretation Guideline updates and replaces Interpretation Guideline IG 11/01, “Income tax; Goods and services tax - Determining employment status for tax purposes (employee or independent contractor)”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 5 (June 2012): 3. IG 11/01 outlined the tests for determining whether a person is an employee or independent contractor. This Interpretation Guideline corrects an error regarding the control test in \[5\] of IG 11/01 (the test is stated correctly in the body of the item). This Interpretation Guideline also updates legislative references and case law and has been revised in places for clarity. The Commissioner’s approach to determining employment status for tax purposes remains unchanged. 3. A taxpayer’s tax obligations for amounts earned from work done depends on their employment status (ie, whether the taxpayer is an employee or an independent contractor). 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) defines “employee” to include a person who receives or is entitled to receive a “PAYE income payment”. A “PAYE income payment” is defined to include a payment of “salary or wages” or “extra pay”. Both of these terms are defined as being “... made to a person in connection with their employment”. Case law has determined that the use of the word “employment” in these definitions relates to “a contract of service”. Under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA), supplies of goods and services under a 2 “contract of service” are not taxable. These provisions do not explain how to determine whether there is a contract of service in any particular case. Therefore, we must rely on the common law to determine whether there is a contract of service. 5. The common law distinguishes between contracts of service and contracts for services. A contract of service means there is an employer–employee relationship; a contract for services means there is a principal–independent contractor relationship. At common law, the courts have developed various tests to determine whether there is a contract of service or a contract for services. The case law shows that the main tests are the intention, control, independence, fundamental and integration tests. These tests can be summarised as follows:  Intention of the parties test – looks at the intentions of each party to the agreement as to the nature of the relationship.  Control test – examines the degree of control the employer or principal exerts over the manner in which the work is done. A high level of control supports the conclusion that the person engaged to perform the services is an employee.  Independence test – examines the level of independence the person engaged to perform the services exerts over their work. A high level of independence supports the conclusion that the person engaged to perform the services is an independent contractor.  Fundamental test – considers whether the person engaged to perform the services is doing so as a person in business on their own account. If the answer is “yes”, this supports the conclusion that the person is an independent contractor; if the answer is “no”, this supports the conclusion that the person is an employee.  Integration test – looks at whether the person engaged to perform the services is integrated into the business. If the person is integrated into the business, this supports the conclusion that they are an employee. By contrast, if the person is not integrated into the business, but rather is an accessory to it, this supports the conclusion that they are an independent contractor. 6. The leading case on employment status is the Supreme Court decision in Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd \[2005\] NZSC 34, \[2005\] 3 NZLR 721. In Bryson, the Supreme Court considered whether a person was an “employee” under the Employment Relations Act 2000. Bryson is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s decision in TNT Worldwide Express Ltd v Cunningham \[1993\] 3 NZLR 681 (CA). Analysis 7. The analysis in this Interpretation Guideline is divided into the following sections:  Types of employment relationship: discusses the difference between “contracts of service” (which employees have) and “contracts for services” (which independent contractors have).  Employment status and tax law: outlines the significance to taxpayers of their employment status. It also explains how the common law on determining employment status can be relevant when determining a taxpayer’s employment status under the GSTA and the ITA.  Relevance of Employment Relations Act 2000 case law: considers s 6 of the Employment Relations Act 2000. Section 6 defines “employee” for that Act. This part concludes that, when determining employment status for tax purposes, s 6 decisions are relevant to the extent that those decisions concern the common law on the employee/independent contractor distinction. 3  Determining employment status – leading New Zealand authorities: discusses the leading New Zealand authorities on determining employment status – Bryson and TNT.  Common law tests of employment status: summarises the main tests for deciding employment status – the intention of the parties, control, independence, fundamental and integration tests.  Relevant decisions: summarises three cases that illustrate how the courts have applied the common law tests, and lists other decisions since Bryson on how to determine employment status. Types of employment relationship 8. The law distinguishes between two types of employment relationship: the employer–employee relationship and the principal–independent contractor relationship. Each relationship has different legal rights and obligations. The type of employment relationship in any particular case depends on whether there is a “contract of service” or a “contract for services” between the persons concerned. In New Zealand Educational Institute v Director-General of Education \[1981\] 1 NZLR 538 (CA), the Court of Appeal stated at 539: On many occasions over the years the Courts have had to decide whether the relationship between two persons was that of employer and employee or, as it used to be called, master and servant. The inquiry normally involved the distinction between a contract of service in which the relation was that of employer and employee and a contract for services in which the relation was that between employer and independent contractor. A decision in any particular case required an examination of the contract between the two - it might be expressed in words or it might be implicit from the circumstances. 9. Employees have a “contract of service” with their employer. Contracts of service evolved from the earlier concept of a master–servant relationship. This type of relationship required an employee to be continuously available for service and to accept a high degree of control by the employer. A “contract for services” applies to the relationship between an independent contractor and a principal. It emphasises the nature of the services to be provided by a person rather than their availability to work as directed. 10. At common law, the courts have developed several tests to determine whether there is a contract of service or a contract for services. The case law shows that the main tests are the intention, control, independence, fundamental and integration tests. These tests are discussed below at \[51\] – \[ 80\]. Employment status and tax law Consequences of employment status for tax purposes 11. A taxpayer’s tax obligations for amounts earned from work done depends on their employment status (ie, whether the taxpayer is an employee or an independent contractor). Employment status has the following consequences for tax purposes:  Payments to employees from their employer must have PAYE deducted at source.  Employees cannot register for GST or charge GST for services they supply as employees.  Independent contractors may deduct certain expenses incurred in deriving assessable income.  Independent contractors must account to Inland Revenue for tax and accident compensation earner and employee premiums for themselves and any employees. 4  Independent contractors must meet all the requirements of the GSTA if the services they supply are in the course of a taxable activity and they are registered (or liable to register) for GST. 12. Taxpayers cannot change their employment status (or the resulting tax implications of that status) merely by calling themselves independent contractors when they are essentially still employees. Relevance of common law tests under tax law 13. Neither the ITA nor the GSTA explains how to determine whether there is a contract of service or a contract for services in any particular case. We must therefore rely on the common law tests for determining employment status. Income Tax Act 2007 14. The ITA defines “employee” in s YA 1 as follows: employee— (a) means a person who receives or is entitled to receive a PAYE income payment: (ab) for the purposes of the FBT rules, includes a shareholder-employee who has chosen under section RD 3(3) to treat amounts paid to them in the income year in their capacity as employee as income other than from a PAYE income payment: (ac) despite paragraph (a), in sections CE 1, CE 1B, and CW 16B to CW 16F (which relate to accommodation provided in connection with employment), includes an employee provided with accommodation or an accommodation payment as described in section CE 1(3)(a) (Amounts derived in connection with employment): (b) in sections CW 17, and CW 17B to CW 18B (which relate to expenditure, reimbursement, and allowances of employees) includes a person to whom section RD 3(2) to (4) (PAYE income payments) applies: (c) in the FBT rules, and in the definition of shareholder-employee (paragraph (b)), does not include a person if the only PAYE income payment received or receivable is— (i) a payment referred to in section RD 5(1)(b)(iii), (3), (3B), (6)(b) and (c) and (7) (Salary or wages): (ii) a schedular payment referred to in schedule 4, parts A and I (Rates of tax for schedular payments) for which the person is liable for income tax under section BB 1 (Imposition of income tax): (d) is defined in section DC 15 (Some definitions) for the purposes of sections DC 12 to DC 14 (which relate to share purchase schemes): (db) does not include an owner of a look-through company or a person who has a look- through interest for a look-through company, unless the owner or person is a working owner: (e) for an employer, means an employee of the employer 15. Paragraph (a) defines “employee” as a person who receives or is entitled to receive a “PAYE income payment”. The latter term is defined in s RD 3(1) as follows: (1) The PAYE rules apply to a PAYE income payment which— (a) means— (i) a payment of salary or wages, see section RD 5; or (ii) extra pay, see section RD 7; or (iii) a schedular payment, see section RD 8: 16. Other relevant definitions include:  “salary or wages” (s RD 5(1)(a)): (1) Salary or wages— (a) means a payment of salary, wages, or allowances made to a person in connection with their employment; ... .  “an extra pay” (s RD 7(1)(a)(i)): (1) An extra pay— 5 (a) means a payment that— (i) is made to a person in connection with their employment; ... .  “employment” (s YA 1) employment has a meaning corresponding to the meaning of employee, and— (a) includes the activities performed by the Governor-General, a member of Parliament, or a judicial officer that give rise to an entitlement to receive a PAYE income payment for the activities: ... 17. The use of the word “employment” suggests that the above provisions apply where there is a contract of service. This interpretation is supported by Challenge Realty Ltd v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,212 (CA). In this decision, the Court of Appeal considered the definition of “salary or wages” in s 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. This definition provided: ‘Salary or wages’, in relation to any person, means salary, wages, or allowances (whether in cash or otherwise), including all sums received or receivable by way of overtime pay, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, commission, or remuneration of any kind, in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person; ... . 18. Delivering the judgment of the court, Bisson J stated at 7,224: In the context of “salary and wages” in sec 2, the word “employment”, in our view, relates to a contract of service ... . It is that word which governs the definition: the definition being intended to include all forms of remuneration received under a contract of employment ... . 19. Consequently, the definition of “salary or wages” did not include amounts received as remuneration under a contract for services. 20. The ITA does not explain how to determine whether a taxpayer is employed under a contract of service. Therefore we must rely on the common law to determine employment status. As a general principle of statutory interpretation, where legislation makes use of terms with established meanings at common law, it is presumed that Parliament intended those terms to be given their common law meanings (subject to any contrary legislative intention): Bank of England v Vagliano Bros \[1891\] AC 107 (HL); R v Kerr \[1988\] 1 NZLR 270 (CA). As mentioned earlier, the common law distinguishes between contracts of service and contracts for services, and the courts have developed tests to establish whether there is a contract of service or a contract for services. 21. However, it is important to highlight that some parts of the relevant definitions in the ITA (see \[15\] and \[16\] above) do not rely on the common law. The ITA identifies particular classes of persons and payments that are specifically included or excluded from the definitions. For example:  Section RD 3(1)(b) provides that “PAYE income payment” does not include: (i) an amount attributed under section GB 29 (Attribution rule: calculation): (ii) an amount paid to a shareholder-employee in the circumstances set out in subsection (2): (iii) an amount paid or benefit provided, by a person (the claimant) who receives a personal service rehabilitation payment from which an amount of tax has been withheld at the rate specified in schedule 4, part I (Rates of tax for schedular payments) or under section RD 18 (Schedular payments without notification), to another person for providing a key aspect of social rehabilitation referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of personal service rehabilitation payment in section YA 1 (Definitions).  Section YA 1 defines “employment” to include: ... the activities performed by the Governor-General, a member of Parliament, or a judicial officer that give rise to an entitlement to receive a PAYE income payment for the activities; ...  Similarly, s RD 5(5) provides that “salary or wages” includes salary and allowances made to the Governor-General, members of Parliament and judicial officers. 6 22. A “PAYE income payment” includes “a schedular payment”. A “schedular payment” is defined in s RD 8 to mean a payment of a class set out in sch 4 of the ITA. Schedule 4 lists payments made to a wide variety of workers, including, for example, insurance agents and shearers. A worker who receives “a schedular payment” will typically be an independent contractor at common law. If an independent contractor receives “a schedular payment”, then tax must be deducted at source. However, the other consequences of being an independent contractor (set out at \[ 11\] above) remain. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 23. Under the GSTA, employees are not liable for GST on supplies of goods and services they make to their employers. This is because s 6(3)(b) excludes from the definition of “taxable activity”, “any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service or as a director of a company, subject to subsection (4)” \[emphasis added\]. The GSTA does not explain how to determine whether there is a “contract of service”. For the reason explained in \[20\] above, the common law tests must be used to determine whether there is a contract of service or contract for services. Relevance of Employment Relations Act 2000 case law 24. The common law tests for determining whether there is a contract of service or a contract for services have been developed by the courts over the course of many decisions. In some of these decisions the courts were determining employment status for tax purposes. However, in most decisions the courts were determining employment status under employment legislation. The employment legislation currently in force is the Employment Relations Act 2000 (ER Act). Sections 6(1), (1A), (2) and (3) of the ER Act define “employee” as follows: (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, employee— (a) means any person of any age employed by an employer to do any work for hire or reward under a contract of service; and (b) includes— (i) a homeworker; or (ii) a person intending to work; but (c) excludes a volunteer who— (i) does not expect to be rewarded for work to be performed as a volunteer; and (ii) receives no reward for work performed as a volunteer; and (d) excludes, in relation to a film production, any of the following persons: (i) a person engaged in film production work as an actor, voice-over actor, stand-in, body double, stunt performer, extra, singer, musician, dancer, or entertainer: (ii) a person engaged in film production work in any other capacity. (1A) However, subsection (1)(d) does not apply if the person is a party to, or covered by, a written employment agreement that provides that the person is an employee. (2) In deciding for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) whether a person is employed by another person under a contract of service, the court or the Authority (as the case may be) must determine the real nature of the relationship between them. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the court or the Authority— (a) must consider all relevant matters, including any matters that indicate the intention of the persons; and (b) is not to treat as a determining matter any statement by the persons that describes the nature of their relationship. 25. The definition of “employee” in s 6 is only for the purposes of the ER Act. The definition does not affect the interpretation of “employee” in the ITA or “contract of service” in the GSTA. However, the case law on s 6 can be relevant when 7 determining employment status for tax purposes. In Bryson, the Supreme Court held at \[32\] – \[33\] that the definition of “employee” in s 6(1)(a) – “any person of any age employed by an employer to do any work for hire or reward under a contract of service” – reflected the common law. It also held that the common law tests for determining employment status were relevant when determining the “real nature of the relationship” between the parties under ss 6(2) and (3). Therefore, when determining employment status for tax purposes, s 6 case law can be relevant to the extent that those decisions concern the common law tests. Determining employment status – leading New Zealand authorities 26. This part of the guideline discusses the leading New Zealand authorities on determining employment status. These authorities are the Supreme Court decision in Bryson and the Court of Appeal decision in TNT. Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd Facts and decision 27. In Bryson, the Supreme Court considered whether a person was an “employee” under s 6 of the ER Act. 28. In this decision, the appellant, Mr Bryson, was a model maker for Weta Workshop. Weta Workshop had a close working relationship with Three Foot Six Ltd, which was the company that administered the production of The Lord of the Rings. Mr Bryson was seconded from Weta Workshop to Three Foot Six Ltd and soon took a permanent position there. Mr Bryson was not given a written employment contract when he started, but some months later Three Foot Six Ltd supplied a written contract to all staff (the “crew deal memo”). The crew deal memo set out the conditions of employment and, in particular, it referred throughout to “contractor” and “independent contractor”. Mr Bryson was required to sign the crew deal memo every week to secure payment for work done. A year later Mr Bryson was made redundant and he alleged unjustifiable dismissal. He could bring an unjustified dismissal claim only if he were found to have been an employee. 29. The Employment Relations Authority held that Mr Bryson was not an “employee” under the ER Act. On appeal, Judge Shaw in the Employment Court reversed this decision: Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd \[2003\] 1 ERNZ 581. Her Honour held that Mr Bryson was an “employee” despite references to “independent contractor” in the crew deal memo. A majority of the Court of Appeal overturned the Employment Court’s decision: Three Foot Six Ltd v Bryson \[2004\] 2 ERNZ 526. However, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal’s decision and upheld the Employment Court’s decision: Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd \[2005\] NZSC 34, \[2005\] 3 NZLR 721. 30. The Supreme Court quoted Judge Shaw from the Employment Court as follows at \[5\]: Judge Shaw said that s 6 changed the tests for determining what constituted a contract of service. She summarised the principles she considered to have been established by Employment Court cases on that section as follows: “• The Court must determine the real nature of the relationship.  The intention of the parties is still relevant but no longer decisive.  Statements by the parties, including contractual statements, are not decisive of the nature of the relationship.  The real nature of the relationship can be ascertained by analysing the tests that have been historically applied such as control, integration, and the ‘fundamental’ test.  The fundamental test examines whether a person performing the services is doing so on their own account. 8  Another matter which may assist in the determination of the issue is industry practice although this is far from determinative of the primary question.” \[Footnotes omitted\] 31. The Supreme Court said at \[32\] that Judge Shaw had accurately stated what s 6 requires the courts to do, and had listed the relevant matters to be considered under that section. The Supreme Court said that “all relevant matters” certainly include the written and oral terms of the contract between the parties and that the terms will usually contain indications of the parties’ common intention concerning the status of their relationship. The Supreme Court said it was clear from Judge Shaw’s judgment that “she was very much alive to the need to begin by looking at the written terms and conditions which had been agreed to by Mr Bryson and Three Foot Six Ltd”. 32. The Supreme Court made it clear that the common law tests for determining employment status were relevant under s 6 when the court stated at \[32\] that “‘\[a\]ll relevant matters’ equally clearly requires the Court or the authority to have regard to features of control and integration and to ... the fundamental test”. The court also said at \[33\] that Judge Shaw was correct in saying that the real nature of the relationship could be ascertained by analysing the tests that historically have been applied, such as the control, integration and fundamental tests: ...The Judge \[Judge Shaw\] obviously was not suggesting that these three customary indicia were to be applied exclusively. She correctly used them, in conjunction with the other relevant matters to which she referred, in an endeavour to determine the real nature of the relationship, as directed by s 6(2). ... 33. In the Employment Court, Judge Shaw had concluded that the fact Mr Bryson required six weeks training for the position with Three Foot Six Ltd indicated that he could not be said to have been contracting his skills because he did not have the relevant experience. The company closely controlled the work Mr Bryson did, including requirements about attendance at meetings and specific work hours, which included time when his services were not required. If he had been an independent contractor, he would not have been paid for the down time and would have been free to get on with his own private business. Judge Shaw emphasised that her decision was based solely on the individual circumstances of Mr Bryson’s employment and was not to be regarded as affecting the status of any other employee in the film industry. Industry practice 34. The concept of industry practice was given prominence in Bryson because the outcome was thought to be critical to the New Zealand film industry. In Bryson, Judge Shaw stated that Three Foot Six Ltd did not contemplate that Mr Bryson was anything other than an independent contractor “because that was the invariable practice at Three Foot Six \[and\] across the film industry” (at \[36\] of the Employment Court decision). Judge Shaw in the Employment Court recognised that industry practice was relevant under s 6, but not determinative, as noted by the Supreme Court at \[30\] above. 35. At \[21\], Judge Shaw held that industry practice was also relevant under the common law. In support of this, at \[22\] her Honour cited Muollo v Rotaru \[1995\] 2 ERNZ 414 (EC) as a case where the Chief Judge held that: the Court may consider industry practice when assessing the nature of an employment contract especially where a custom or practice is sufficiently well established. In such a case, the Chief Judge held that such practice could go to establishing the intention of the parties. 36. However, Judge Shaw held at \[36\] that, on the facts of the case, the industry practice was of little use in establishing the intention of both parties. At \[57\] – \[76\], her Honour reviewed the evidence given by expert witnesses as to industry practice and stated at \[68\]: It is clear from the evidence that the defendant and the film and television industry in general has a real and genuine concern that any changes to the present employment arrangements 9 which have been in place for many years will cause significant disruptions in the film industry with potentially adverse outcomes both in economic terms and in terms of attracting overseas film companies to bring the productions to New Zealand. Mr Binnie submitted that a decision in Mr Bryson’s favour \[ie, that he was an employee\] would “automatically ‘unwind’” every existing crew deal memo and any future crew contracts for movie productions. 37. Judge Shaw held that this evidence did not support finding that Mr Bryson was an employee. Her Honour stated at \[68\] that “\[w\]hilst these concerns are acknowledged ... in the context of this case, they are overstated.” Her Honour therefore gave little weight to industry practice on the facts. 38. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the Employment Court had not given sufficient weight to the evidence of industry practice. It held that industry practice compelled the conclusion that Mr Bryson was not an employee (at \[111\], \[113\] and \[117\]). The Supreme Court disagreed. It held that the Employment Court had not erred in its treatment of industry practice. At \[35\]: The question for this Court is whether the Court of Appeal majority was correct in holding that what the Judge said in relation to industry practice amounted to legal error. We do not believe that it was. She did not overlook or ignore the evidence of industry practice. In rejecting a submission from counsel for Mr Bryson, she in fact said that it could not be completely disregarded, referring with evident approval to a case under the Employment Contracts Act where the Chief Judge had held that industry practice could go to establish the intention of the parties. In the case before her, however, the Judge found that industry practice was not helpful in relation to establishing the common intention of Mr Bryson and Three Foot Six for the reasons given by her and mentioned at para \[9\] above. Later in her judgment she summarised the evidence on industry practice. It was, as she said, given in general terms. She found that it did not apply to Mr Bryson's situation. He had not been working on projects for several producers. He had not operated like a sole trader. Summary 39. In summary, the following points can be taken from the Supreme Court’s decision in Bryson. 40. When determining whether a person is an “employee” as defined in s 6 of the ER A ct, the common law tests for determining employment status are still relevant. Consequently, when determining employment status for tax purposes, s 6 case law is relevant to the extent that it considers and applies the common law tests. 41. Consistent with the common law, s 6 requires the court not to treat as determinative any statement by the parties that describes the nature of their relationship. 42. Also consistent with the common law, s 6 requires the court to consider:  matters indicating the intention of the parties, in particular the terms of the contract agreed to (whether in writing or orally) by the parties, and industry practice;  any divergences from, or supplementations of, those terms and conditions that are apparent in the way in which the relationship has operated in practice;  features of control and integration and whether the contracted person has been effectively working on his or her own account (the fundamental test). 43. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, Parliament amended s 6 of the ER A ct to insert provisions concerning film workers. Section 6(1)(d) excludes from the definition of “employee” persons engaged in “film production work”. “Film production work” is defined in s 6(7). However, s 6(1A) provides that this exclusion “does not apply if the person is a party to, or covered by, a written employment agreement that provides that the person is an employee.” As already discussed, s 6 of ER Act defines “employee” only for that Act. 10 TNT Worldwide Express Ltd v Cunningham 44. The other leading New Zealand authority on employment status is the Court of Appeal decision in TNT. In this decision, the Court of Appeal discussed in detail the intention, control and fundamental tests developed at common law. The Supreme Court in Bryson cited TNT with approval. 45. In TNT, the appellant company, TNT, engaged the respondent as an owner–driver to conduct a courier service for the company. The owner–driver:  provided his own vehicle and was responsible for the vehicle’s maintenance and upkeep;  was responsible for his own tax and accident compensation payments;  claimed deductions as if he were self-employed; and  had a contract with TNT that said he was an independent contractor. 46. The company terminated the respondent’s contract, and the respondent sought to invoke the personal grievance procedure under the Employment Contracts Act 1991 (now repealed). 47. The Employment Court (\[1992\] 3 ERNZ 1,030) held that an owner–driver courier for TNT was an employee and not self-employed. In reaching that conclusion, the court placed considerable emphasis on the rigorous control the company exercised over its owner–drivers. The Employment Court considered that the company’s actions showed that it treated the owner–driver as its employee. 48. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the written contract entered into by the parties created a genuine independent contractor relationship. It accepted that an owner–driver courier was an independent contractor where the owner–driver’s contract with TNT:  required the owner–driver to provide his own vehicle, uniform, approved radio telephone, goods service licence under the Transport Act 1962 and insurance;  paid the owner–driver mainly on a per trip basis;  made the owner–driver responsible for employing any relief driver;  referred to the owner–driver as an independent contractor; and  gave TNT very extensive control over the owner–driver’s operations. 49. The Court of Appeal acknowledged the extensive control TNT exercised over the owner–driver, but concluded that the owner–driver accepted only that degree of control and supervision necessary for the efficient and profitable conduct of the business he was running on his own account as an independent contractor. At 667, Casey J cited the following statement of MacKenna J in Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance \[1968\] 1 All ER 433 (QBD) at 447: A man does not cease to run a business on his own account because he agrees to run it efficiently or to accept another's superintendence. 50. The Court of Appeal said that when the contract is wholly in writing and it is not a sham, then the nature of the relationship intended by the parties is determined from the terms of that contract in the light of all the surrounding circumstances at the time the contract was made. Cooke P noted at 683 that “it is necessary to consider all the terms of the agreement”. He also made the following observations at 686 and 687: When the terms of a contract are fully set out in writing which is not a sham (and there is no suggestion of a sham in this case) the answer to the question of the nature of the contract must depend on an analysis of the rights and obligations so defined. ... 11 In the end, when the contract is wholly in writing, it is the true interpretation and effect of the written terms on which the case must turn. Common law tests of employment status 51. In considering how the distinction between contracts for services and contracts of service is to be made, the Court of Appeal in TNT noted at 697 the following observation of the Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi-Keung \[1990\] 2 AC 374, 382: What then is the standard to apply? This has proved to be a most elusive question and despite a plethora of authorities the courts have not been able to devise a single test that will conclusively point to the distinction in all cases. 52. The Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang quoted with approval from the judgment of Cooke J in Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security \[1969\] 2 QB 173, 184–185, where it was said: No exhaustive list has been compiled and perhaps no exhaustive list can be compiled of the considerations which are relevant in determining that question, nor can strict rules be laid down as to the relative weight which the various considerations should carry in particular cases. 53. Although there is no exhaustive list of considerations, the tests discussed below (established by the case law) provide useful guidance on the factors to be considered in determining whether someone is engaged as an employee or contractor. The relevance of the tests will depend on the particular facts in each case. 54. It is important when determining employment status to balance all the circumstances of the relationship between the parties. Often there will be competing factors that support differing conclusions on whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor. Applying the tests to the facts of a case requires an objective weighing of the various relevant factors to determine the true nature of the relationship. 55. Often the terms of the relationship between two persons will be recorded in a written agreement; though this is not always the case. If there is a written agreement, the first step is to analyse its terms and conditions. However, it is important to note that the nature of the relationship may change over time (eg, a person takes on more duties), and this may not be reflected in the written agreement. Changes in regulations and work practices may also cause the employment status of some workers to change. Alternatively, it could simply be that the written agreement does not accurately reflect how the relationship works in practice. How the parties actually work together must be considered when determining the type of employment relationship between them. As the Supreme Court in Bryson stated at \[32\]: It is not until the Court or authority has examined the terms and conditions of the contract, and the way in which it actually operated in practice, that it will usually be possible to examine the relationship in light of the control, integration and fundamental tests. Hence the importance, stressed in TNT, of analysing the contractual rights and obligations. 56. Bryson and TNT both discussed the main common law tests for determining employment status – the intention, control, fundamental and integration tests. In the following paragraphs, these tests (along with the independence test) are examined in greater detail. 57. It is important to remember that the application of the common law tests is a weighing-up process. Sometimes the facts of a particular case may suggest different characterisations of the relationship, and there may be either overlap or tensions between the tests. 58. Also, as the characterisation of the relationship is dependent on the particular facts at hand, it is crucial that the facts are well understood, including any changes to the relationship that have occurred over time. 12 Intention of the parties test 59. The intention of the parties test looks at the intentions of each party to the agreement regarding the nature of the relationship. The description given to a relationship by the parties to the contract is a strong, but not conclusive, indication of the type of relationship that exists. The fact a written contract states a person is an employee or an independent contractor may indicate the intention of the parties, but it is not determinative: Bryson at \[32\] (SCNZ). Holland J in the High Court in Challenge Realty Ltd v CIR \[1990\] 12 NZTC 7,022 said at 7,032: Obviously the Court’s function in interpreting a contract is to determine the intentions of the parties. When, however, the question for determination is the legal relationship between the parties created by the contract, the expressed intention of the parties will not be determinative of the question. It is nevertheless an important factor, and if after considering all factors the exact state of the relationship is a matter of some ambiguity, may be decisive. In the present cases before me Harcourts is the only one with a written agreement. Nevertheless I would conclude that in all cases it was the intention of the parties to create an agency relationship rather than an employer/employee relationship. The question remains as to whether that result has been achieved. 60. If the actual circumstances point to an employment relationship, then simply labelling it an independent contract relationship will not alter the true position. 61. In TNT, a clause in the written contract that purported to override all other aspects of the agreement stated that the courier was an independent contractor. The Employment Court found that the actual conduct of the relationship showed that TNT imposed a high level of control and supervision of its staff that was inconsistent with any independence or initiative on the part of its staff. However, in reversing this decision, the Court of Appeal concluded, after weighing all the circumstances, that the TNT standard form contract created a genuine independent contractor relationship. 62. The taxation arrangements between the parties may be relevant when establishing their intentions. In Bryson, the Employment Court acknowledged at \[55\] that tax status can be an indicator of what a person intends his contractual relationship to be. For example, if the person engaged to perform the services is paid at a set rate at regular intervals and PAYE is deducted, this may support the view that the parties intended a contract of service. However, in some cases taxation arrangements between the parties may not be given much weight. In Bryson, Mr Bryson completed IR3 forms, which referred to the taxpayer as being self-employed in business or trade, and had claimed deductions for work-related expenses. The Employment Court stated at \[55\] that this was not conclusive evidence that Mr Bryson was an independent contractor. This was because he had not registered for GST and payslips received from Three Foot Six Ltd referred to PAYE deductions having being made. In these circumstances, it could not be said that Mr Bryson had acquiesced to independent contractor status. 63. In some circumstances industry practice may be relevant when determining the intention of the parties. As already discussed, in Bryson the Supreme Court agreed with the Employment Court’s statement that industry practice could be relevant when considering the parties’ intention, but that it was not determinative. 64. In Bryson, Three Foot Six Ltd considered Mr Bryson should be regarded as an independent contractor because the invariable industry practice was that production workers were hired as independent contractors. Expert witnesses explained that the reason for this practice was the project-based, intermittent nature of screen productions and the fact that production workers normally worked with several different producers during the course of the year. The Employment Court held at \[59\] – \[60\] that the evidence of industry practice was of little use on the facts of that case, because it was “necessarily general” and not consistent with the particular circumstances of Mr Bryson’s case. Mr Bryson worked continuously for Three Foot Six Ltd alone and, unlike other workers in the 13 industry, did not own any plant or equipment and did not operate as a sole trader. Mr Bryson’s working conditions were therefore not typical of the industry. 65. By contrast, in Muollo v Rotaru, industry practice was given considerable weight. In Bryson, the Employment Court cited Muollo as authority for the proposition that industry practice was relevant at common law when considering the parties’ intention as to their employment relationship. In Muollo, the Employment Court considered whether Mr Rotaru, who worked as a crew member aboard a fishing vessel, was an employee for the purposes of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 (now repealed). There was no written employment agreement. The Employment Court concluded that Mr Rotaru was an independent contractor and considered this conclusion was supported by the “custom and usage in the commercial fishing industry”. It stated at 425-426 that the evidence of industry practice: ... presents a picture of an industry in which the co-operative venture is not only prevalent and a typical mode of conducting business but a commercial norm. All parties under such arrangements share in the proceeds. The commercial reasons for it suggested by Mr Gartrell were five in number, as follows: 1. It conduces to business viability; 2. ensures proper work attitudes; 3. takes cognisance of the fact that work is intermittent, and its duration uncertain; 4. acknowledges the seasonal nature of the work; and 5. means that there is not a pool of people waiting round in off-times with no work but still having to be paid. Mr Gartrell urged upon me the good sense of the industry's considerations moving it to adopt this custom, mentioning the sporadic nature of the enterprise and the use of a percentage basis of determining the rewards and sharing productivity and risk. Along much the same lines Mr Gartrell stressed a total of six factors that were particularly important to both appellants: 1. work was intermittent; 2. duration of work was uncertain; 3. no liability for sick and holiday pay; 4. the business did not want the liability of an employee when work was not available; 5. proper work attitudes; 6. business/work cohesion. 66. An expert witness also stated that he was not aware of any fishing vessels where a crew member was on a wage or salary. In the expert’s opinion, the normal arrangement was for crew members to be paid according to their share of the catch, for withholding tax to be deducted at source, and for crew members to pay their own ACC levies. The Employment Court stated that this evidence was consistent with the circumstances in which Mr Rotaru provided his services. It concluded that the evidence of industry practice showed that the parties’ intention was to enter into a contract for services. 67. In summary, industry practice may be relevant when establishing the parties’ intention, especially where the custom or practice is sufficiently well established. Industry practice is not determinative, and it may be given less weight where it is inconsistent with the facts of the particular relationship considered. Control test 68. The control test looks at the degree of control the employer or principal exerts over the work an employee or contractor is to do and the manner in which it is to be done. The greater the extent to which the principal or employer specifies work content, hours and methods and can supervise and regulate a person, the more likely it is the person is an employee. 14 69. The control test used to be considered the deciding test, but this is no longer the case. The Court of Appeal in TNT emphasised that control is only one of several relevant factors. The court endorsed the statement of Cooke J in Market Investigations Ltd (at 185) that while control will always have to be considered, it can no longer be regarded as the sole factor in determining the relationship between the parties. The Court of Appeal in TNT considered the Employment Court had given this factor too much weight. Independence test 70. The independence test was not mentioned in Bryson or TNT, but has been discussed in several Taxation Review Authority cases that determined employment status: Case U9 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,077; Case X17 (2006) 22 NZTC 12,224; and Case Z10 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,113. The independence test is simply the inverse of the control test. A high level of independence on the part of an employee or a contractor is inconsistent with a high level of control by an employer or a principal. 71. A person generally has a high level of independence if they:  work for multiple people or clients (but the fact the person works for only one person or client does not necessarily mean the person is an employee);  work from their own premises;  supply their own (specialised) tools or equipment;  have direct responsibility for the profits and risks of the business;  hire or fire whomever they wish to help them do the job;  advertise and invoice for the work;  supply the equipment, premises and materials used;  pay or account for taxes and government and professional levies. 72. On the other hand, when some independent contractors perform work for a principal, they may agree not to work for a competitor or give away trade secrets. This alone will not make the worker an employee (it actually emphasises that the worker is usually entitled to work for others). Fundamental test 73. The Employment Court decision in Bryson applied Market Investigations Ltd. In that decision, Cooke J said that the fundamental test for distinguishing an employee and an independent contractor was as follows, at 184–185: “Is the person who has engaged himself to perform these services performing them as a person in business on his own account?” If the answer to that question is “yes”, then the contract is a contract for services. If the answer is “no”, then the contract is a contract of service. ... factors which may be of importance are such matters as whether the man performing the services provides his own equipment, whether he hires his own helpers, what degree of financial risk he takes, what degree of responsibility for investment and management he has, and whether and how far he has an opportunity of profiting from sound management in the performance of his task. 74. The Privy Council approved the fundamental test in Lee Ting Sang. This Privy Council decision was subsequently cited by four of the five judges in the Court of Appeal in TNT. 75. The fundamental test is also sometimes described as the “business test” or the “economic reality test”. In Challenge Realty, the Court of Appeal stated at 7,219: If it is helpful to look for a test for application in this case, apart from that of control, which is a key feature of the Act, we favour that suggested by Adrian Merritt, Lecturer in Industrial Law, University of New South Wales in his article “’Control’ v ‘Economic Reality’: Defining the Contract of Employment” (1982) Australian Business Law Review 105 at p 118, 15 “The issue that must be settled in today's cases is whether the worker is genuinely in business on his own account or whether he is ‘part-and-parcel of’ - or ‘integrated into’ - the enterprise of the person or organisation for whom work is performed. The test is, therefore, one of ‘economic reality’.” 76. The fundamental test looks at factors such as:  whether the type of business or the nature of the job justifies or requires using an independent contractor;  the behaviour of the parties before and after entering into the contract;  whether there is a time limit for completing a specific project;  whether the worker can be dismissed;  who is responsible for correcting sub-standard work;  who is legally liable if the job goes wrong. 77. Usually, an independent contractor agrees to be responsible for their work. An independent contractor cannot usually be dismissed, although the contract can be terminated if it is broken. Integration test 78. In Enterprise Cars Ltd v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,126 (HC), Sinclair J said that the integration test is whether the person is part and parcel of the organisation and not whether the work is necessary for the running of the business. 79. Under the integration test, a job is likely to be done by an employee if it is:  integral to the business organisation;  the type of work commonly done by “employees”;  continuous (not a “one-off” or accessory operation);  for the benefit of the business rather than for the benefit of the worker. 80. In the Employment Court decision in Bryson, at \[50\] Judge Shaw quoted Lord Denning’s “classic description of this test” from his judgment in Stevenson Jordan & Harrison Ltd v MacDonalds \[1952\] 1 TLR 101, 111 (CA): ... under a contract of service, a man is employed as part of the business, and his work is done as an integral part of the business; whereas, under a contract for services, his work, although done for the business, is not integrated into it but is only accessory to it. Relevant decisions 81. This part of the Interpretation Guideline discusses three cases heard in the Employment Court since the Supreme Court’s decision in Bryson:  Tse v Cieffe (NZ) Ltd \[2009\] ERNZ 20;  Kiwikiwi v Maori Television Service (2007) 5 NZELR 6;  Tsoupakis v Fendalton Construction Ltd (EC Wellington WC 16/09, 18 June 2009). 82. These decisions concern employment status under s 6 of the ER Act. As already discussed, s 6 decisions can be relevant when determining employment status for tax purposes to the extent that the decisions concern the common law tests. 83. The intention of this discussion is to illustrate how the courts approach the question of employment status following Bryson. When considering such decisions, it is important to remember that each case turns on its own facts. As Judge Shaw noted in Tse v Cieffe (NZ) Ltd, “previous case law is only useful in reiterating the relevant principles”. 16 Tse v Cieffe (NZ) Ltd Facts 84. The issue in Tse v Cieffe (NZ) Ltd was the plaintiff’s employment status. Ms Tse worked for Cieffe from 2005 to 2008. 85. At the beginning of the relationship between the parties there was no written contract between the parties. An oral agreement was reached about the terms of the relationship between the parties. The terms included that Ms Tse would:  work for 20 hours a week and would be paid at an agreed hourly rate;  work on the company’s internal system but also have some reception duties and general office administration duties;  invoice Cieffe as a contractor rather than be paid as an employee. 86. In 2007, Cieffe provided Ms Tse with a written consultancy agreement. The agreement provided that Ms Tse’s work would be performed under the general supervision and direction of a Cieffe representative, but that Ms Tse was not an employee of Cieffe. Ms Tse signed the agreement. 87. Ms Tse performed the duties that were agreed between the parties at the outset of the relationship, as well as sharing a variety of other office tasks, such as tidying and cleaning, with other employees. When the work Ms Tse had originally been engaged for was nearing completion she was asked to provide further ongoing services that were related to the original work. Ms Tse’s work was closely supervised. 88. By her own choice, Ms Tse worked regular hours. She was not instructed to attend the office at any specific time. Over time, her hours increased to 40 hours a week with some overtime. When Ms Tse would not be at work she would advise Cieffe that she would not be present; she would not request leave. 89. Ms Tse invoiced Cieffe for the hours that she worked. Initially, Ms Tse invoiced Cieffe through a company that Ms Tse had set up with her partner. After several months, Ms Tse began invoicing Cieffe in her own name. For the first year of the relationship Ms Tse added GST to the invoices, but she stopped doing this when she discovered that she was not required to be registered for GST. 90. Cieffe provided Ms Tse with branded clothing at work, a credit card (which was used on a business trip) and a business card. The business card had Cieffe’s logo and described Ms Tse as “Office Manager” and later as “Client Relationship Assistant Manager”. 91. Several times throughout the period that Ms Tse worked for Cieffe, she referred to herself as a contractor. Application of law 92. Intention of the parties: Judge Shaw found that “at the commencement of the relationship both parties deliberately entered into an independent contracting arrangement” (at \[40\]). The arrangement was evidenced by the method of invoicing and Ms Tse’s references to herself as a contractor. Judge Shaw found that the consultancy agreement “confirms the nature of the relationship which had existed from the outset: a contract for services” (at \[42\]). 93. Control: Ms Tse’s counsel argued that several factors pointed towards Ms Tse being under the control of Cieffe. One factor was that some of the tasks Ms Tse performed were not sufficiently specialised. Another factor was that Ms Tse’s work was supervised by a Cieffe representative. Judge Shaw noted that the non- specific tasks (such as tidying and cleaning) would not generally be performed by a contractor. However, other factors pointed towards a lower level of control by 17 Cieffe than would be expected in an employment relationship. In particular, it was up to Ms Tse when she would undertake the work and she worked a variety of hours each month. 94. Integration: The integration test indicated that Ms Tse was an employee of Cieffe. Judge Shaw stated at \[47\]: In some respects the evidence points to a degree of integration of Ms Tse into the business. These are the business cards and the Cieffe-branded clothing. She used Cieffe equipment and had access to the building. Calling her an office manager or client relationship assistant manager certainly presents an image of her to the outside observer as somebody who was part of the management team rather than running a separate business on their own. Such integration would not normally be expected of a consultant. 95. Fundamental test: Judge Shaw found that Ms Tse’s supply of invoices to Cieffe evidenced a business relationship. Ms Tse’s references to herself as a contractor also supported the view that she was in business on her own account. Conclusion 96. Judge Shaw concluded at \[50\]: While there were some elements in the conduct of her employment which, viewed in isolation, would not support a finding that she was self-employed, taken in the round I find that the real nature of the relationship between Ms Tse and Cieffe was, as intended, a contract for services. Kiwikiwi v Maori Television Service Facts 97. In Kiwikiwi v Maori Television Service, the issue was whether Mr Kiwikiwi was an employee or an independent contractor of Maori Television Service (MTS). Mr Kiwikiwi worked as a teleprompter for MTS. 98. When Mr Kiwikiwi started working for MTS, he was filling an urgent vacancy and had no experience as a teleprompter. There was no written agreement at the beginning of the relationship between the parties. Mr Kiwikiwi understood that he was on a one-month trial period with the prospect of a full-time job at the end of the trial period if he was suitable. He was told he would have at least 30 hours of work a week, with more at times. (As the volume of work for teleprompters fluctuates seasonally, hours were flexible.) 99. It was agreed between the parties that Mr Kiwikiwi would be operating on a roster that was prepared a month in advance. He would be paid an hourly rate and would present invoices to be paid. 100. Mr Kiwikiwi undertook teleprompting work but also did various ancillary duties, such as photocopying and banking. After he expressed concern at the additional tasks he was asked to perform, he was given a role profile description. Mr Kiwikiwi worked between 30 and 40 hours a week. 101. After seven and a half months of work, Mr Kiwikiwi was concerned that he still did not have an employment contract. He contacted MTS’s operation manager to request an employment contract. Following this, his rostered hours were reduced. The operation manager began to have issues with Mr Kiwikiwi’s performance and it was decided that Mr Kiwikiwi had to do some retraining before he could be re-rostered. 102. MTS argued that it was typical working practice in the television industry for teleprompters to be freelancers. Only one teleprompter had been an employee of MTS, with all other teleprompters being freelancers. However, the court heard evidence that TVNZ uses a combination of employees and freelancers as teleprompters. 18 Application of law 103. Intention of the parties: Judge Shaw found that there was no evidence of any common intention by the parties. The parties discussed some “incidents of employment”, such as the hourly rate and rostered hours, but did not discuss Mr Kiwikiwi’s employment status. 104. Control: MTS argued that Mr Kiwikiwi was free to do his work as he saw fit and was not subject to the control of MTS. Judge Shaw found that Mr Kiwikiwi was controlled by MTS’s systems. Mr Kiwikiwi was required to comply with the set rosters, had no flexibility within the role and had to perform tasks in addition to teleprompting. The role profile description he was given was prescriptive. When standards slipped, Mr Kiwikiwi had to undergo retraining. 105. Fundamental test: Judge Shaw found that Mr Kiwikiwi was not in business on his own account as an independent contractor. The factors that led to this conclusion included:  Mr Kiwikiwi was not registered for GST;  Mr Kiwikiwi did not work for any other employer (apart from some shearing work over summer when little work was available from MTS);  Mr Kiwikiwi had no separate accounts and did not operate under a business entity (such as a company);  Mr Kiwikiwi did not bring any experience or skill to the position;  Mr Kiwikiwi took no financial risk with his own capital and could not alter his profits by changing his work habits. 106. Judge Shaw stated that the invoices that Mr Kiwikiwi rendered each fortnight were inconclusive as he only rendered them to get paid. 107. Integration: Judge Shaw found that Mr Kiwikiwi’s position was an integral part of the production process; it was “not an adjunct which the television station could do without” (at \[42\]). 108. Industry practice: Judge Shaw stated that industry practice can be relevant to both the intention of the parties and the nature of the continuing relationship. However, the industry practice was not black and white. MTS had employed a teleprompter as an employee in the past, and TVNZ used a combination of employees and independent contractors. Therefore, industry practice did not assist in determining Mr Kiwikiwi’s employment status. Conclusion 109. Judge Shaw concluded that the real nature of the relationship between Mr Kiwikiwi and MTS was one of employer/employee. Tsoupakis v Fendalton Construction Ltd Facts 110. The issue in Tsoupakis v Fendalton Construction Ltd was whether Mr Tsoupakis was an employee or an independent contractor. Mr Tsoupakis worked as a painter for Fendalton Construction for six months in 2005 and 2006 and then again for a year from 2007 to 2008. It was agreed by the parties that Mr Tsoupakis was an independent contractor during the 2005/2006 period. The issue before the Employment Court was whether Mr Tsoupakis was an employee or an independent contractor for the 2007/2008 period. 111. Fendalton Construction hired both employees and independent contractors to undertake painting work. Contractors were generally paid a higher hourly rate. 19 Fendalton Construction provided both types of staff with mobile phones to keep in touch during jobs. 112. Mr Tsoupakis was not given an employment agreement, despite repeatedly asking for a copy of his contract. 113. Mr Tsoupakis filled out a daily work record, including the hours worked and the address of the jobs worked on. He could reclaim costs of travel to jobs in some circumstances. Mr Tsoupakis submitted weekly invoices to Fendalton Construction for payment. 114. Mr Tsoupakis had his own business card that described him as a director of his own trading entity. There was no evidence that he used the card to solicit business for himself while working for Fendalton Construction. Mr Tsoupakis also had signwriting on his motor vehicle advertising his trading name and personal mobile number. Neither the car signwriting, nor the business card, referred to Mr Tsoupakis’s association with Fendalton Construction. 115. While on jobs, Mr Tsoupakis was not supervised constantly by Fendalton Construction, but on most jobs Mr Tsoupakis’s work was inspected by Fendalton Construction. 116. Fendalton Construction provided some of the tools required to do the jobs (although usually not paint brushes) and all of the consumables required (such as paint and rags). Mr Tsoupakis purchased materials as required for jobs using Fendalton Construction’s trade accounts. 117. Mr Tsoupakis was given work on a daily basis with detailed work directions. He could be redirected to jobs when Fendalton Construction required. Mr Tsoupakis was expected to meet set criteria, such as the time to be taken and the volume of paint to be used. He was required to check in with Fendalton Construction when he finished a job. Mr Tsoupakis could not delegate his work to others to complete, and he was expected not to undertake other work. Application of law 118. Intention of the parties: Chief Judge Colgan found that there was no discernible mutual intention of the parties as there had been no express discussion about the nature of their relationship. 119. Control: Chief Judge Colgan found that Fendalton Construction exercised a high degree of control over Mr Tsoupakis’s work – both what was done and also how and when it was to be done. Mr Tsoupakis had to account in detail for his hours of work and had no ability to delegate or organise as he chose. In reality, he was constrained from working for anyone else or for himself. 120. Integration: The facts pointed towards Mr Tsoupakis having some elements of independence from Fendalton Construction – in particular, his business cards, the signwriting on his vehicle and that he was invited to the contractors’ Christmas party (as opposed to the employees’ party). Chief Judge Colgan found that, despite these elements, Tsoupakis was an integral part of Fendalton’s business in the same way as would be expected of an employee. Factors pointing towards Mr Tsoupakis’s integration were that he was held out as a member of Fendalton Construction’s staff and that he was paid for the time that he worked rather than a set fee for each job. 121. Fundamental test: Chief Judge Colgan found that Mr Tsoupakis was not in business on his own account. Mr Tsoupakis provided his own paint brushes but other equipment was provided by Fendalton Construction. The fact Mr Tsoupakis was not trained by Fendalton Construction was a neutral factor, as Mr Tsoupakis was engaged as an experienced tradesperson. 20 122. Industry practice: Only limited evidence was presented to the court on industry practice in the painting industry. Chief Judge Colgan found that the evidence of industry practice was neutral, as it established that companies (including Fendalton Construction) engaged both independent contractors and employees as painters. Conclusion 123. Chief Judge Colgan concluded that Mr Tsoupakis was an employee of Fendalton Construction for the 2007/2008 period. List of other relevant decisions 124.

Protected payments (2) The fact that a schedular payment may be protected against assignment or charge does not override a person’s obligation to withhold the amount of tax for the payment. Determination of expenditure incurred (3) The Commissioner may determine from time to time the amount or proportion of expenditure that a person incurs in deriving a particular schedular payment or class of schedular payments.

The following are the key points it discusses: The income tax treatment of SaaS configuration and customisation costs (C& C c osts) is complex due to the many variations in contractual arrangements and t he na ture of the services provided. As the tax outcomes under the specific provisions depend on the facts in each individual situation, the approach set out in this interpretation guideline is necessarily general in nature. In the case of an existing business, it is highly likely that the required nexus between the C&C costs and a taxpayer’s derivation of income exists, meaning that the costs satisfy the general permission in s DA 1. However, taxpayers w ill need to carefully consider whether they are denied a deduction for the C&C costs under s DA 1 due to the capital limitation (s DA 2(1)). The configuration or customisation activities may be in-house “development” as defined in s DB 35, depending on their specific nature. If they are “development” activities, some IFRS reporting taxpayers may be able to claim an immediate deduction for C&C costs under s DB 34. Section DB 34 overrides the capital limitation where the costs meet its criteria. It allows a taxpayer to make a deduction for “internally generated” research or development costs. Section DB 34 applies to costs recognised as an expense for financial reporting purposes under paragraph 68(a) of New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38 Intangible Assets (NZ IAS 38) 1 applying, for the purposes of that paragraph, paragraphs 54 to 67. Applying s DB 34 is optional and a taxpayer may decide to return their income on the basis that s DB 34 does not apply to the expenditure. The right to use software under a SaaS arrangement is depreciable intangibl e pr operty. If the taxpayer is unable to claim a deduction for the SaaS C&C costs under the general permission or s DB 34, it is likely they will be able to include the C&C costs as part of the cost base of their rights to use the software. A depr eciation loss can be claimed on depreciable intangible property that is used or available for use in deriving income. 1 New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38 Intangible Assets (New Zealand Accounting Standards Board of the External Reporting Board, issued November 2004 and incorporating amendments to 31 January 2022). IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 4 of 56 In some situations, depending upon the terms of the particular SaaS arrangement, the right to use software may be fixed life intangible property (FLIP) and the C&C costs will be part of the cost base of the FLIP. Flow charts summarising the approach taken in this guideline are included at the end of the Item. Introduction | Whakataki 2.This guideline clarifies the Commissioner’s approach to the income tax treatment of SaaS C&C costs. “IS 17/04 I ncome Tax – computer software acquired for use in a taxpayer’s business” 2 discusses the income tax treatment of software for taxpayers who purchase, lease or license software for use in their business. Where the discussion at \[19 7\] to \[200\] below differs from IS 17/04, the information in this guideline applies. 3.SaaS is a commonly used type of cloud service and provides high-level functionality and generally requires less user technical expertise but offers less user control 3 . The use of SaaS and other cloud computing technologies has increased significantly as bus inesses undertake digital transformation projects and move away from traditiona l on-pr emises software. 4.This guideline addresses issues raised after the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) issued decisions on the accounting treatment of SaaS arrangements. The first IFRIC Agenda Decision 4 considered whether a customer receives a software asset at the start of the arrangement or a service over the term of the arrangement. The first IFRIC Agenda Decision clarified that a customer receives a s oftware asset if either (a) the contract contains a software lease or (b) the customer otherwise obtains control of software. The second IFRIC Agenda Decision 5 c onsidered whether a customer, applying IAS 38, should recognise an intangible asset in relatio n to SaaS C&C activities and if an intangible asset is not recognised, how the customer should account for the SaaS C&C costs. I n many cases the second IFRIC Agenda Decision has resulted in SaaS C&C costs not being recognised as an intangible asset under NZ IAS 38 and being expensed. 5.It is important that taxpayers carefully consider their own accounting treatment given t he complexity of SaaS arrangements. Taxpayers should confirm their accounting 2 Interpretation Statement IS 17/04: “ Income Tax – computer software acquired for use in a taxpayer’s business” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29 No 5 (June 2017): 173. 3 CJ Millard (ed), Cloud Computing Law (2 nd ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2021) at 4. 4 International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee, Customer’s Right to Receive Access to the Supplier’s Software Hosted on the Cloud (IFRIC Agenda Decision IAS 38 Intangible Assets , March 2019). 5 International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee, Configuration or Customisation Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (IFRIC Agenda Decision IAS 38 Intangible Assets, April 2021). IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 5 of 56 treatment with their financial accountant and/or independent auditor. (The purpose of this interpretation guideline is not to provide guidance on the correct accounting treatment for any taxpayer.) 6.The IFRIC Agenda Decisions highlighted that a level of uncertainty exists about the i ncome tax treatment of SaaS C&C costs. That is, questions remain over whether t he c osts are: deductible under the general permission (s DA 1); deductible research or development expenditure (s DB 34); for depreciable intangible property (s EE 62); for fixed life intangible property (s EE 33); or non-deductible expenditure. 7.This guideline sets out how the Commissioner will approach issues relating to the deductibility of SaaS C&C costs. See Figure | Hoahoa 1 at the end of item for an overview of the approach. 8.The guideline does not apply to SaaS C&C costs incurred by a non-resident related pa rty where a portion is allocated and on-charged to a New Zealand entity. Further, i t d oes not consider any potential withholding tax obligations that a taxpayer may have – for example, for payments to a non-resident software supplier, or for services provided by a non-resident contractor. However, the principles set out in this item are likely to be relevant to allocations of SaaS C&C costs made by a non-resident company to its New Zealand branch. Analysis | Tātari What is SaaS? 9.SaaS is a cloud-based software licensing and delivery model. The use of cloud technologies and services is growing as businesses look for innovative solutions in t he d igital space. At a basic level: ... cloud computing is a way of delivering computing resources as a utility service via a network, typically the Internet, scalable up and down according to user requirements. 6 10.Cloud computing services have different service models, including SaaS. This guideline f ocuses on SaaS user-o riented applications: 6 Cloud Computing Law at 14. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 6 of 56 SaaS provides more high-level (i.e. more application/user-oriented) functionality, generally by way of pre-built (though often configurable) applications, and thereby generally requires far less technical expertise to use, but offers less customer control. 7 11.Generally, in SaaS arrangements, the customer enters an arrangement with the SaaS provider. The arrangement gives the customer a right to access the provider’s software th at runs on the provider’s cloud infrastructure. I n contrast, with a pure servic e a rrangement the customer transfers data to the cloud service provider and receives back the result of the provider’s processing of the data. A pure service arrangement is outside the scope of this guidance. 12.The customer accesses the software on an as-required basis over the internet or a dedicated line. They do not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure. 13.The SaaS provider will incorporate regular updates into the SaaS application that are available to the customer. 14.A SaaS arrangement differs from a traditional on-premises software model in which the customer purchases hardware and a software licence. In traditional situations, the pr ovider worked on the customer’s premises (ie behind the customer’s firewall). I n a SaaS arrangement, however, the provider hosts the application in the cloud and t he o nly rights the customer receives are to access and use the application software. 15.SaaS applications cover a wide range of uses. These include office and messaging software, payroll processing, customer relationship management (CRM), enterpris e r esource planning (ERP), human resources management, content management and database management systems. 16.The contractual terms of SaaS arrangements can vary significantly. Some SaaS arrangements provide a periodic subscription, whereas others may be for an agreed initial fixed term with rights of renewal. 17.A customer may undertake many types of activities to implement a SaaS application, including: conducting a needs assessment; developing a business case; running a proposal process and selecting the provider; developing bridging modules or application programming interfaces (APIs) to existing on-premises systems; converting data; training; 7 Cloud Computing Law at 16. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 7 of 56 testing and undertaking ongoing maintenance; and configuring and customising the application. 18.Among these many areas of activity, most questions for the Commissioner have been about the deductibility of C&C costs. The following section describes t he C ommissioner’s approach to determining the deductibility of C&C costs. What are configuration and customisation costs? 19.A customer may need help to integrate the SaaS application with their existing systems or may require additional features or functionalities that are not included in the “off- the-shelf” SaaS application. These additional integration activities are commonly referred to as “configuration” and “customisation”. 20.The second IFRIC Agenda Decision describes the two terms as follows: i.configuration involves the setting of various ‘flags’ or ‘switches’ within the application software, or defining values or parameters, to set up the software’s existing code to function in a specified way. ii.customisation involves modifying the software code in the application or writing additional code. Customisation generally changes, or creates additional, functionalities within the software. 21.The above descriptions of “configuration” and “customisation” have been used as a reference when considering the issues in this guideline. However, the descriptions ar e n ot exhaustive. It is important for taxpayers to carefully consider the nature of t he w ork being undertaken in determining whether the approach described in this guideline applies to the expenditure they are considering. 22.Generally, in these cases the customer can only access the added functionality through the SaaS licence and has no rights to the enhancements. The C&C activities differ from situations where activities (including customisation) are performed on the customer’s on-premises system. 23.C&C activities may typically occur as part of a business undertaking a digital transformation project. As part of such a project, a taxpayer may incur significant costs in undertaking C&C activities. Further, a complex project may have a series of stages that continue over an extended period. SaaS providers usually charge fees for C&C activities based on completing delivery milestones. 24.Generally, where the C&C activities are part of a significant digital transformation project, the taxpayer will enter a SaaS arrangement for a fixed term of 3–5 years, or a shorter fixed term coupled with rights of renewal. Alternatively, before incurring substantial C&C costs, the taxpayer will undertake commercial due diligence of t he IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 8 of 56 SaaS provider to be reassured that they are able to access the SaaS arrangement in the future. 25.The customer may undertake the C&C activities in-house, or the SaaS provider or a third-party contractor may do so. Alternatively, potentially some combination of all three may undertake the C&C activities. 26.To the extent that the SaaS provider (either directly or via a subcontractor) has agreed to help the customer with the implementation, the parties may enter into a master agreement that covers both the SaaS subscription arrangement and t he i mplementation services. 27.Alternatively, the customer may opt to contract a third party directly to help with implementation or may undertake the implementation activities in-house. General principles of deductibility 28.Generally, the SaaS C&C costs will not be deductible under s DA 1 because the capital limitation applies. 29.However, the courts have recognised that decisions as to whether expenditure is capital or revenue are complex and, as they have often emphasised, depend on t he p articular facts. The taxpayer’s factual situation will determine how the capital tests apply to SaaS C&C costs. There may be cases where the SaaS C&C costs are r evenue c osts. 30.Where the C&C costs incurred are capital in nature, the taxpayer will be unable to claim a deduction for the costs under s DA 1. The next step will be to consider whether any specific deductibility provisions apply. General permission 31.It is highly likely that the SaaS C&C costs will satisfy the general permission contained in s DA 1. 32.Section DA 1(1)(a) provides for the deductibility of expenditure that a taxpayer incurs in deriving assessable income (or excluded income, or a combination of the two). Section DA 1(1)(b) provides for the deductibility of expenditure they incur in the cours e o f carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income (or excluded income, or a combination of the two). The first limb requires a nexus with the deriving of assessable income, and the second a nexus with the carrying on of a business. 33.It is a matter of degree, and so a question of fact, to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and the deriving of income, or t he c arrying on of a business for the purpose of deriving income. In the context of start- up IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 9 of 56 entities, SaaS C&C costs may be undertaken preparatory to the commencement of a business and the general permission will not be satisfied. 34.Based on our understanding of a typical SaaS arrangement in a business context, the taxpayer receives access to software that they use as part of their ordinary business operations. SaaS applications are available for a number of c ommon business tools. For examples of types of SaaS applications, see \[15\]. 35.In the typical situation, the taxpayer incurs the C&C costs so that they can access the SaaS application using their existing systems or gain enhanced functionality. As such, it is very likely that a taxpayer will have the required nexus between the C&C costs and the deriving of income from an existing business to satisfy the s DA 1 criteria. Capital limitation 36.Usually, the capital limitation will override the general permission and disallow a deduction under s DA 1 for C&C costs. This will occur where the taxpayer incurs the C &C costs to transform or enhance the taxpayer’s business structure and, by incurring the C&C costs, the taxpayer has received an enduring benefit. However, each situatio n i s determined on its own facts and there may be situations where the SaaS C&C costs are revenue in nature and deductible under s DA 1. 37.The capital limitation (s DA 2(1)) denies deductions for capital expenditure or losses. As the Act does not define the term “capital”, case law helps in interpreting the scope o f the capital limitation. 38.The general principles form the basis for the distinction between capital and revenue ex penditure. Dixon J formulated these principles in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT 8 at 647: ... the contrast between the two forms of expenditure corresponds to the distinction between the acquisition of the means of production and the use of them; between establishing or extending a business organisation and carrying on the business; between the implements employed in work and the regular performance of the work in which they are employed; between an enterprise itself and the sustained effort of those engaged in it. 39.In BP Australia Ltd v FCT, 9 the Privy Council set out several indicia to help determine whether expenditure is revenue or capital under the general principles. In summary, those factors are: the need or occasion that calls for the expenditure; whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature; 8 (1946) 72 CLR 634 (HCA). 9 \[1965\] 3 All ER 209. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 10 of 56 whether the expenditure is on the business structure or whether it is part of the in come-earning process; whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset or produces an advantage of enduring benefit; whether the source of the expenditure is fixed or circulating capital; and how the expenditure is treated under ordinary principles of commercial accounting. 40.Two Court of Appeal cases decided in 2018 confirmed that the New Zealand case law and approach on the capital limitation are settled. The Court of Appeal noted in NRS Media Holdings Ltd v C of IR 10 that: \[72\]The courts have also identified a number of relevant, but not determinative, indicators. These include the “enduring benefit test” \[footnote 40: Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Trustpower Ltd \[2015\] NZCA 253, \[2015\] 3 NZ LR 658 at \[62\]\], the “fixed or circulating capital test” \[footnote 41 : C ommissioner of Inland Revenue v Inglis \[1993\] 2 NZLR 29 (CA)\], and whether the expenditure was recurrent. Ultimately, however, the focus must be o n w hat the expenditure was calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view. 41.In Easy Park Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, 11 the Court of Appeal set out the following general principles: \[21\]The governing approach in New Zealand is summarised by the observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v Cmr of Taxation (Cth), adopted by this Court in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australasia) Ltd: The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in borderline cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and degree. That answer: 10 (2018) 28 NZTC 23,079. 11 (2018) 28 NZTC 23,066. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 11 of 56 “depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process”: per Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT. As each new case comes to be argued felicitous phrases from earlier judgments are used in argument by one side and the other. But those phrases are not the deciding factor, nor are they of unlimited application. They merely crystallise particular factors which may incline the scale in a particular case after a balance of all the considerations has been taken. \[22\]The enquiry into whether a receipt is revenue or capital is intensely fact- specific. Therefore in approaching the authorities we acknowledge the oft- cited caution of Richardson J in Commissioner of Inland v McKenzies (NZ) Ltd: ... the capital income field is an intellectual minefield in which the principles are elusive and analogies are treacherous. 42.In considering how the capital tests apply to SaaS C&C costs, the first step is to gain a c lear understanding of the terms of the arrangements, the activities undertaken an d t he fee structure. As the courts have recognised, decisions as to whether expenditur e i s capital or revenue are complex and, as they have often emphasised, depend on t he p articular fact s. 43.The contractual terms of SaaS arrangements can vary significantly. Some SaaS subscription contracts are a periodic arrangement that either party may terminate by providing notice. In contrast, other SaaS arrangements are for a fixed-term period. 44.A taxpayer incurs the C&C costs to gain the use of the SaaS application in a way that ef fectively works with the taxpayer’s existing system (configuration) and to secur e a dditional bespoke improvements (customisation). 45.C&C activities may occur as part of a larger integration project. In addition to C&C costs a taxpayer may incur other types of expenditure such as for data migration, testing, training and support. In such cases, it will be necessary t o determine t he na ture of each activity and whether the costs are capital. 46.Further, the taxpayer will also need to determine if the activities are part of one overall capital project. The courts have suggested that costs incurred as part of one overall ca pital project will likely take their nature from that project. In such cases, it is no t a ppropriate to separate out the different costs of the project for tax purposes wher e t hat project is capital in nature. This principle applies regardless of whether that project concerns work done on a single asset or on a group of assets. 12 Again, taxpayers will need to consider the type of expenditure they have incurred and asse ss 12 Colonial Motor Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,361. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 12 of 56 whether it is stand alone or part of a wider capital project. If the costs are capital, they will form part of the cost base of the DIP or FLIP. 47.There may be situations where SaaS C&C activities are abandoned. See "IS 17/01 Income Tax – Deductibility of Feasibility Expenditure” 13 and sections DB 66 and DB 67 for further guidance on how to treat SaaS C&C costs in these circumstances . N eed or occasion for the expenditure 48.The need or occasion factor focuses on the principal reasons why the taxpayer incurred the expenditure. In this context, the way to identify the object of the expenditure is to look at the reason or need for making the expenditure rather than what it actually achieved. 49.Generally, a taxpayer incurs C&C costs to ensure that the “off-the-shelf” SaaS application works efficiently and effectively for them, and that the taxpayer receives the benef it of bespoke improvements that enhance their digital processes and system s. T he wider benefits of implementing a SaaS application typically include cost-efficiency, greater scalability, data security, enhanced collaboration, automatic software updates and improved data analytics. Whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature 50.If the expenditure is recurrent and a taxpayer incurs it to meet a continuous demand, this suggests the payment is part of the cost of ordinary business operations and will be a revenue outlay. In contrast, when a taxpayer makes capital expenditure, that is once and for all. 51.However, the courts have cautioned about assuming that: if there are multiple payments, the amount is revenue; and if there is only one payment, the amount is capital in nature. 14 52.Where the taxpayer buys in SaaS work, usually they pay SaaS C&C costs in a series of lump sum amounts as the project work proceeds. The payments may differ in both t he a mount involved and interval between payments. 53.To the extent that the C&C activities occur continuously during the term of the SaaS arrangement, and the taxpayer incurs regular costs (even if the amounts differ), this might suggest that the payments are recurrent and are revenue in nature. This contrasts with situations where the taxpayer makes a payment for initial C&C work an d t hen later makes another for further improvements. This may suggest these are 13 Interpretation Statement IS 17/01: “Income Tax – Deductibility of Feasibility Expenditure” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29 No 3 (April 2017): 15. 14 Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick (Inspector of Taxes) \[1966\] AC 295 at 317. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 13 of 56 multiple lump sum payments that are capital in nature. However, as noted the facts of any particular case must be considered closely and the timing and quantum of payments is not determinative. Whether the expenditure relates to the income-earning process or business structure 54.The courts have commented that the distinction between capital and revenue expenditure corresponds with the distinction between the business structure and the pr ocess by which a taxpayer earns their income. 55.The taxpayer incurs C&C costs in making their core business systems and purposes more efficient, allowing them to operate competitively in their market. The expenditure is designed to enhance the business structure of the taxpayer’s business i n q uestion, rather than being part of the process by which income is earned. 56.The expenditure is arguably not an ordinary operating expense but instead goes towards the structure of the business. The C&C costs enhance the functionality of t he S aaS application and so link to the structure of the business. This kind of expenditur e is c omparable to SaaS application subscription or access costs that more naturally relate to the day-to-day operational running of the business. Whether the expenditure is for an identifiable asset or an advantage of enduring benefit 57.This test involves the two aspects of whether the expenditure is for: an identifiable asset; or an advantage of enduring benefit. It is important to note that the absence of any identifiable asset for the taxpayer does not rule out the possibility that the a rrangement provides an advantage of enduring benefit. 58.In this context, the C&C work does not create an identifiable asset for the taxpayer (in terms of ownership in any classic sense). It follows that the focus is on whether the ta xpayer receives an advantage that has an enduring benefit. 59.The enduring benefit test looks to whether the expenditure gives rise to an advantage. If it does, it also asks whether the advantage provides an enduring benefit. 60.Case law supports the position that a taxpayer may gain an advantage from expenditure even if the expenditure is on an asset that someone else owns. 15 61.In relation to the requirement that the asset or benefit is “enduring”, in Anglo Persian Oil Co Ltd v Dale (IT), 16 Rowlatt J explained that “an asset or an advantage for the 15 Ounsworth (Surveyor of Taxes) v Vickers Limited \[1915\] 3 KB 267; Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd (1994) 94 ATC 5031. 16 (1931) TC 253. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 14 of 56 enduring benefit of a trade” means a benefit that endures in the way that fixed capital endures. This contrasts with a benefit that endures for a long period. Rowlett J stated: 17 But the fallacy is in the word “enduring”. What Lord Cave is quite clearly speaking of is a benefit which endures in the way that fixed capital endures; not a benefit that endures in the sense that for a good number of years it relieves you of a revenue payment. It means a thing which endures in the way that fixed capital endures. It is not always an actual asset, but it endures in the way that getting rid of a lease or getting rid of onerous capital assets ... endures. 62.Whether an effect or benefit is deemed to be enduring in character depends on the pa rticular facts of each case. The legal terms of an arrangement can be a useful guid e i n determining whether the advantage provides an enduring benefit. However, t he l egal terms of the arrangement are just one aspect of the enduring benefit test. T he f ocus is on what is the effect of the expenditure from a practical sense and whether t he ex penditure creates conditions that are likely to benefit the taxpayer in the long term. 63.Entering a SaaS arrangement has advantages over an on-premises software solution. SaaS providers are continually making updates to the SaaS application to take advantage of technical advancements. Due to the SaaS arrangement, the taxpayer receives the immediate benefit of any updates without needing to acquire a new on- premises software system when the previous system has become obsolete. Being able to take an “off-the-shelf” product that has all the advantages of ongoing upgrades and, through C&C, fully integrate it into their existing system increases the appeal of the SaaS application to the taxpayer. If they were unable to customise standard SaaS applications, a taxpayer could end up with a fragmented system consisting of many isolated components that are poorly integrated. Given the pace of digital and technological advancements, being able to access periodic upgrades without losing any advantages from a customised application may provide an enduring benefit. 64.If the SaaS arrangement provides access for a periodic term (eg either party can terminate it by providing a month’s notice), arguably the taxpayer does not receive a n end uring benefit when incurring the C&C costs. In these situations, the C&C costs – in some cases, reasonably substantial amounts – are incurred with no legal certainty tha t t he SaaS provider will continue to supply access to the SaaS application. However, t he d ecision in Anglo Persian clarifies that an “enduring benefit” is not limited to a benefit that endures for a long period but includes a benefit that endures in the way that fixed capital endures. Generally, the reason why the taxpayer has chosen to incur the C& C c osts is to achieve efficient / improved integration between its current IT systems and the SaaS application for a future period. Under this arrangement, the taxpayer does not anticipate that they will only have access to the SaaS application for a short month- 17 Anglo Persian at 262. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 15 of 56 by-month period. In these circumstances, while it may appear that having the SaaS arrangement for an indefinite periodic term has no enduring benefit, that is not necessarily the case. The wider factual circumstances also need to be considered. Whether the source of the expenditure is fixed or circulating capital 65.This factor focuses on whether the source of the expenditure was from fixed or circulating capital. However, the New Zealand courts 18 have suggested that this factor is of limited assistance and any decision on tax treatment should focus on the purpose of the expenditure more than on its source. How the expenditure is treated under ordinary principles of commercial accounting 66.The treatment of the expenditure under ordinary principles of accounting may help somewhat in determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue for tax purposes. However, the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Trustpower Limited 19 suggested that this factor is unlikely to be particularly significant or conclusive. 67.Following the second IFRIC Agenda Decision, taxpayers who apply NZ IAS 38 for financial reporting purposes will commonly be recognising the C&C costs as a n ex pense. 20 This might suggest that the C&C costs are also revenue in nature for tax purposes. 68.The accounting tests are different from the considerations of whether there is a capital ex pense for tax purposes. In the context of C&C costs relating to a SaaS servic e c ontract, t he accounting test contained in NZ IAS 38 for an asset will not be satisfied if: the C&C work does not create a separate resource that the customer controls; and the customer does not control the software being configured or customised. 69.The test of control when applying NZ IAS 38 has two broad aspects: the power to derive future economic benefits for more than a year; and the right to restrict the access of others to those benefits. 18 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Fullers Bay of Islands Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,834 (HC). 19 \[ 2015\] NZCA 253. 20 The exception is where the SaaS provider (or a subcontractor of the SaaS provider) undertakes the C&C activities, and the services are not distinct because those services are not separately identifiable from the customer’s right to receive access to the supplier’s application software. In this situation, for accounting purposes an expense is recognised over the contract term of the SaaS arrangement. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 16 of 56 70.Tax and accounting have different aims, and the treatment for one may differ from the t reatment for the other. It follows that while the treatment of the expenditure under ordinary principles of accounting may provide guidance it is not determinative of whether an expense is capital or revenue in nature for tax purposes. Timing of deduction 71.To the extent that the C&C costs are deductible under s DA 1, the taxpayer will need to confirm the timing of the deduction. If the C&C costs are deductible under s DA 1, the taxpayer will need to consider whether s EA 3 applies. 72.Section BD 4 provides that a deduction for an amount of expenditure is allocated to the income year in which the taxpayer incurred the expenditure unless a provision i n pa rts D to I provides for allocation on another basis. To the extent that the taxpayer pays the C&C costs to a third party and those costs relate to multiple income years, s EA 3 should be considered. 73.Section EA 3 applies where the Act allows a taxpayer a deduction for expenditure and some or all of the expenditure is unexpired at the end of the taxpayer’s income year. The effect of applying s EA 3 is that the unexpired portion of the taxpayer’s expenditure at the end of an income year is added back as income for the income year and the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for that amount in the following income year. Non-deductible under general principles of deductibility 74.As noted at \[28\], C&C costs will usually be non-deductible under general principles of deductibility due to the capital limitation. In most cases, by incurring the C&C costs the taxpayer has secured an advantage of an enduring benefit – that is, having acce ss to a technologically advanced SaaS application that works with their existing systems and has been customised to meet their business needs. This enduring benefit is linked to the business structure and is not part of the day-to-day operations. The remaining sections of this guideline will consider the income tax treatment of C&C costs that ar e no t deductible under s DA 1 as they are capital expenditure. Research or development expenditure 75.If the SaaS C&C costs are for “research” or “development” and the taxpayer applies the I FRS accounting treatment for internally generated intangible items that s DB 34(2) prescribes, s DB 34 will override the capital limitation and the SaaS C&C costs will be deductible in the year the taxpayer incurs them or as determined under s DB 34(7). 76.A taxpayer that applies NZ IAS 38 for financial reporting purposes will be able to claim a deduction for SaaS C&C costs if the costs are for research or development and t he IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 17 of 56 costs are recognised as an expense under paragraph 68(a) of NZ IAS 38 applying, for the purposes of that paragraph, paragraphs 54 to 67. Figure | Hoahoa 2 sets out the steps that need to be considered when applying s DB 34(2). What is the main rule? 77.Section DB 34 sets out the main rule of the research or development expenditure p rovision: DB 34 Research or development Deduction (1)A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure they incur on research or development. This subsection applies only to a person described in any of subsections (2) to (5) and does not apply to the expenditure described in subsection (6). Person recognising expenditure as expense (2)Subsection (1) applies to a person who recognises the expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes- (a)Under paragraph 5.1 or 5.2 of the old reporting standard or because paragraph 5.4 of that standard applies; or (b)Under paragraph 68(a) of the new reporting standard applying, for the purposes of that paragraph, paragraphs 54 to 67 of that standard. ... Link with subpart DA (10)This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. 78.The main rule is that a deduction is allowed for research or development expenditure if the taxpayer has recognised the expenditure as an expense under paragraph 68(a) o f N Z IAS 38 applying, for the purposes of that paragraph, paragraphs 54 to 67 of NZ IAS 38. 21 79.Following the main rule is optional. The taxpayer may choose to return their income o n the basis that s DB 34 does not apply to the expenditure. For example, a taxpayer may choose to apply the depreciation rules and opt not to use s DB 34 to reduc e c ompliance costs. 80.Under s DB 34(6), t he main rule does not apply to expenditure that the taxpayer incurs o n property they use in carrying out research or development, that is not created by the research or development and is one of the following: property for which the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for an amount o f d epreciation loss; 21 Our discussion is focused on the new reporting standard, NZ IAS 38, on the basis that the old reporting standard, FRS 13, has been repealed. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 18 of 56 property for which the cost is allowed as a deduction by way of amortisation under a provision of the Act outside subpart EE; land; intangible property, other than depreciable intangible property; or property that its owner chooses, under s EE 8, to treat as not depreciable. 81.In our discussion of how s DB 34 applies to C&C costs, it is assumed that the exclusion contained in s DB 34(6) does not apply. 82.The aspects of the main rule discussed below are: who is able to claim a deduction under s DB 34 (from \[99\]); the meaning of “research” and “development” (from \[101\]) ; and the meaning of “under paragraph 68(a) of the new reporting standard applying, for the purposes of that paragraph, paragraphs 54 to 67 of that standard” (from \[122\]) . The purpose of the main rule 83.The research and development provision was introduced following a Government initiative in 2000 to encourage more spending on research and development. In his Budget speech, the Minister of Finance, the Hon Dr Michael Cullen, stated: This Government is committed to assisting the transformation of the economy from our current over-reliance on commodity production to the knowledge intensive industries of the future. The knowledge economy encompasses e-commerce but is bigger than that. It is about additional intelligence, creativity and technological sophistication to our production and export base. To make this new economy a reality, we need to invest much more in research, science, and technology. 84.In responding to the announcement, taxpayers and tax practitioners noted that the tax treatment of research and development expenditure was uncertain. At the time, research and development expenditure was deductible under general principles; a s pecific provision in s DJ 9 of the Income Tax Act 1994 that allowed a deduction for expenditure a taxpayer incurred in connection with scientific research (s DB 33 of t he I ncome Tax Act 2007); or the depreciation rules. 85.When the Minister was making his announcement, “ research and development” (R&D) generally meant original and innovative activities aimed at creating new knowledge or technology. At the time the most relevant TRA cases that considered research and IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 19 of 56 development revenue or capital issues involved a prototype four-wheel drive farm vehicle 22 and modifying safety helmets. 23 86.The Government issued a discussion paper, Research & Development Expenditure – Accounting Treatment for Tax Purposes, 24 to address the uncertainty in the current tax treatment: 5.Practitioners we have spoken to have noted that the main area of uncertainty relates to distinguishing between capital and revenue R&D expenditure. The tax treatment depends on whether costs are classified as revenue or capital. In broad terms, expenditure is capital if it gives rise to an enduring benefit to the taxpayer. Otherwise, it is revenue expenditure. 6.Broadly, expenditure on revenue account is immediately deductible for tax if the required link with income is shown. Expenditure on capital account is not immediately deductible (unless it relates to “scientific research”, which is treated more favourably than other capital expenditure). Instead, expenditure on capital account is either deductible over the life of an asset or, on occasion, may not be deductible at all. There is little case law in New Zealand on R&D expenditure to assist taxpayers in determining whether R&D costs are on capital or revenue account. It is, therefore, not clear in tax law when R&D expenditure will be immediately deductible and when it will not be. 7.We understand that, although the tax treatment of R&D expenditure is uncertai n, t axpayers are immediately deducting almost all of their R&D costs. However, this carries the risk of potential disputes with Inland Revenue, and penalties and use o f m oney interest that apply when tax is underpaid. \[Emphasis in original\] 87.The discussion paper contained a proposal to minimise the reliance on the general deductibility principles. The measure was to permit taxpayers to follow their accounting treatment to the extent that when they wrote off research or development expenditure for accounting purposes, it would be immediately deductible for tax. 88.The Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 introduced s DJ 9 A (the predecessor to s DB 34) into the Income Tax Act 1994 to help remedy t he i ssue. The commentary to the Bill summarised the proposed amendment as: Taxpayers will be able to deduct for tax purposes the R&D expenditure that is recognised as an expense under Financial Reporting Standard 13, Accounting for Research and 22 Case N55 13 NZTC 3,434. 23 Case P3 14 NZTC 4,017. 24 Research & Development Expenditure – Accounting Treatment for Tax Purposes: Discussion Paper (Inland Revenue, Wellington, November 2000). IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 20 of 56 Development Activities (FRS 13). 25 FRS 13 requires all “research” costs to be expensed. “Development” costs must be expensed until five criteria are all met. These criteria are designed to approximate the point at which the R&D expenditure gives rise to a valuable asset. 89.As part of introducing s DJ 9A, the definitions of “research” and “development” contained in FRS 13 were incorporated into the tax legislation. Section DJ 9A(6) provided that “research” and “development” had the meanings set out in paragraph s 4. 1 and 4.2 of FRS 13, as interpreted by paragraphs 4.3 to 4.7 of FRS 13. 90.In p aragraphs 4.3 to 4.7, FRS 13 expanded on the meaning of the definitions and provided examples of research activities, development activities and activities that w ould not satisfy the definitions. For example, paragraph 4.4 referred to the concept of innovation: Research and development activity is distinguished from non-research based activity by the presence or absence of an appreciable element of innovation. If the activity departs from routine and breaks new ground it is normally to be included; if it follows an established pattern it is normally to be excluded. 91.Officials 26 stated clearly that the purpose in applying accounting tests was to remove t he complexities in applying the capital/revenue boundary: The purpose of the new R&D rules was not to mirror the accounting rules. The purpose was instead to clarify the R&D capital/revenue boundary by using the tests that accountants employ to establish whether an asset with sufficiently certain future economic benefits has been created. There are a number of aspects of FRS 13 that are not useful to ascertaining this boundary. For example, paragraph 2.3 of FRS 13 (which allows non-material R&D to be automatically expensed) is not concerned with this issue. 92.Section DB 34 currently applies to taxpayers who use NZ IAS 38 for financial reporting. NZ IAS 38 replaced FRS 13 (and internationally IAS 38 replaced IAS 9) as part of t he w ider introduction of IFRS in the mid-2000s. However, FRS 13 remained available for reporting periods beginning on or before 30 November 2012. A key differenc e bet ween the two standards is that FRS 13 dealt only with accounting for research and development activities, whereas the objective of NZ IAS 38 is broader in scope and prescribes the accounting treatment for intangible items. 25 Financial Reporting Standard No. 13 1995 Accounting for Research and Development Activities (Financial Reporting Standards Board, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, February 1995). 26 Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill ( Inland Revenue, Wellington, 13 August 2001) at 21. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 21 of 56 93.The Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill 20 07 proposed changes to align references in the Income Tax Act 2004 to the new IFRS standards. The commentary to the Bill notes: Under IFRS, the treatment of research and development expenditure is dealt with under the general accounting standards on intangibles (NZ IAS 38). The core standards for capitalisation of development costs under NZ IAS 38 are substantially the same as the old accounting standards and should continue to be appropriate for taxation purposes. However, some provisions in the old standards (such as paragraphs 2.3 and 5.4 of FRS- 13) a re no longer applicable and have been amended accordingly. 94.The definitions of “research” and “development” in FRS 13 were similar to those c ontained in NZ IAS 38. However, NZ IAS 38 does not contain some of th e i nterpretative guidance contained in paragraphs 4.4 to 4.7 of FRS 13. For example, NZ IAS 38 does not contain anything like the paragraph 4.4 reference to the presenc e o f “an appreciable element of innovation”. The definitions of “research” an d “ development” are considered further at \[101\]. 95.The purpose in incorporating the accounting standard into the tax legislation was to make the deductibility of research and development expenditure less complex. I n r educing the uncertainty and complexity in the income tax treatment, the intention was to help incentivise businesses to undertake research or development activities. Other situations beyond the main rule 96.In addition to the main rule, a taxpayer is allowed a deduction for research or development expenditure in any of the following situations, where they: incur expenditure on the development of an intangible asset that is not depreciable intangible property and derecognise or write off the intangible asset under either NZ IAS 38 or FRS 13 (s DB 34(3)); recognise the expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes because it is an amount written off as an immaterial amount but, had it be en m aterial, would have been required to recognise it as an expense under paragraph 68(a) of NZ IAS 38 applying, for the purposes of that paragraph, to paragraphs 54 to 67 of that standard (s DB 34(4)); or incur expenditure of $10,000 or less, in total, on research or development in a n i ncome year, have recognised the amount as an expense for financial reporting purposes and have written the amount off as immaterial (s DB 34(5)). 97.This guideline focuses on how the main rule contained in s DB 34(2) applies to C&C costs. However, the comments will provide guidance in applying s DB 34(3) to s DB 34(5) to C&C costs. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 22 of 56 98.Along with s DB 34, s DB 33 provides a deduction for expenditure incurred in c onnection with “scientific research”. Section DB 33 is unlikely to apply to SaaS C&C activities due to the absence of innovation. Taxpayers who can claim a deduction under s DB 34 99.Section DB 34 applies to taxpayers that apply NZ IAS 38 for financial reporting purposes. 100.If a taxpayer does not use NZ IFRS for financial reporting purposes but opts to apply NZ IAS 38 in its entirety (ie in relation to all items within the scope of NZ IAS 38), they may be able to claim a deduction under s DB 34. They cannot claim a deduction under s DB 34 if they do not apply NZ IAS 38 for financial reporting purposes. The meaning of “research” and “development” 101.Section DB 35 defines “research” and “development”: DB 35 Some definitions Definitions (1)In this section, and in section DB 34,- development is defined in paragraph 8 of the new reporting standard new reporting standard means the New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38, in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place old reporting standard means Financial Reporting Standard No 13 1995 (Accounting for Research and Development Activities) being the standard approved under the Financial Reporting Act 1993, or an equivalent standard issued in its place, that applies in the tax year in which the expenditure is incurred research is defined in paragraph 8 of the new reporting standard. Meaning of research or development: modification by Order in Council The Governor-General may make an Order in Council specifying- (a)a kind of expenditure that is not expenditure on research or development for the purposes of section DB 34: (b)an activity that is neither research nor development for the purposes of section DB 34: (c)the date from which the expenditure or the activity is excluded from being research or development. Secondary legislation An Order in Council under subsection (2) is secondary legislation (see Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019 for publication requirements). 102.Section DB 35 specifically incorporates the definitions of “research” and “development” contained in NZ IAS 38 into s DB 34. The definitions differ from the s LY 2 definitions that apply for the research and development tax credits regime. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 23 of 56 103.As s DB 34(2) allows a deduction for research or development, the meaning of these w ords and how they apply to C&C work are considered separately. T he following comments are offered as guiding principles on whether C&C activities are research or development. Taxpayers will need to consider each situation in light of the actual activities they undertake. 104.It is necessary to understand the level of complexity and specialist skills involved in performing the C&C work when determining whether the costs relate to research or development in the way the Act defines them. The meaning of “research” 105.NZ IAS 38 defines “research” as follows: Research is original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. 106.Further, paragraph 56 of NZ IAS 38 lists examples of research activities: 56 Examples of research activities are: (a)activities aimed at obtaining new knowledge; (b)the search for, evaluation and final selection of, applications of research findings or other knowledge; (c)the search for alternatives for materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services; and (d)the formulation, design, evaluation and final selection of possible alternatives for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services. 107.The definition of “research” and list of examples focus on original investigation an d a ctivities that contribute knowledge and understanding. 108.Of relevance to this discussion, the Oxford English Dictionary (online edition, accessed 28 June 2022) defines the word “original” as: 1.a. That is the origin or source of something; from which something springs, pr oceeds, or is derived; primary. 2.a. Belonging to the beginning or earliest stage of something; existing at or from the first; earliest, first in time. 5.a. Created, composed, or done by a person directly; produced first-hand; not imitated or copied from another. 6.a. Having the quality of that which proceeds directly from oneself; such as has not been done or produced before; novel or fresh in character or style. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 24 of 56 109.From this definition, it is evident that the ordinary meaning of “original” refers to something being created and novel, not imitated or copied. This suggests a level of innovation or creativity and is consistent with the list of examples of research activities in paragraph 56 of NZ IAS 38. Configuration and customisation activities unlikely to be “research” 110.It is unlikely that SaaS C&C activities will be research as defined in s DB 35. 111.Generally, SaaS C&C activities will not involve devising new and original coding o r producing some other new knowledge or understanding. Configuration activities tend t o apply existing processes and know-how to set up a SaaS application to function wit h t he taxpayer’s existing systems in a particular way. 112.Similarly, while customisation may create a new functionality for the taxpayer, it usually involves applying existing techniques and knowledge. Work the SaaS provider or a third-party contractor undertakes to customise a SaaS application may be a copy of o r v ery similar to other customisation work they carry out for other customers. Thes e s ituations lack originality as an existing capability is merely being adopted. What is the meaning of “development”? 113.NZ IAS 38 defines “development” as follows: Development is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before the start of commercial production or use. 114.Paragraph 59 of NZ IAS 38 contains a list of examples of development activities: 59 Examples of development activities are: (a)the design, construction and testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models; (b)the design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies involving new technology; (c)the design, construction and operation of a pilot plant that is not of a scale economically feasible for commercial production; and (d)the design, construction and testing of a chosen alternative for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services. 115.Essential to the definition of “development” is the concept of applying research findings or other knowledge with the aim of producing new or improved products, processes or system s. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 25 of 56 116.The phrase “or other knowledge” widens the scope of development to include other activities that produce something new or improved. That is, development includes activities that draw on existing knowledge gained from either research or experience. However, development does not consist of ordinary or routine activities based on well- established competence or understanding. The examples of development activities i n N Z IAS 38 paragraph 59 that refer to “prototypes”, “pilot plant” and “new technology” suggest that development activities produce something new or improved for t he ta xpayer, in contrast to business-as-usual activities. Configuration activities may be “development” 117.Decisions about w hether or not SaaS configuration activities qualify as development will need to consider the context of the taxpayer’s specific arrangement and the nature o f the activities undertaken. 118.Generally, configuration type activities involve taking existing code and “turning a switch” to enable the customer to use the SaaS offering. The configuration activities apply existing processes and know-how to modify a SaaS application to function in a particular way. While configuration activities may be more routine in nature in some situations the configuration activities may require the application of techniques that are complex and new to the taxpayer. Customisation activities may be “development” 119.SaaS customisation activities may qualify as development depending on the nature of the customisation work undertaken. 120.Customisation work involves modifying code or creating new code to provide the ta xpayer with improvements or enhancements to the “off-the-shelf” SaaS offering. T he cu stomisation work will involve applying knowledge to a design of a new or improved system or process for the taxpayer. The customisation work is more likely to be “development” where it is not routine in nature or part of the taxpayer’s business-as- usual activities. 121.The second IFRIC Agenda Decision does not comment on whether the C&C costs are r esearch or development as defined in NZ IAS 38 because this distinction is not t he f ocus for accounting purposes in terms of the decision to expense or not. For tax purposes, a taxpayer will need to carefully consider the nature of the activities undertaken and the outputs achieved to determine whether the configuration or customisation activities are “development” as defined in paragraph 8 of NZ IAS 38. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 26 of 56 The meaning of “under paragraph 68(a) of the new reporting standard applying, for the purposes of that paragraph, paragraphs 54 to 67 of that standard” 122.If the SaaS C&C costs are research or development, s DB 34 will allow a deduction if the taxpayer recognises the SaaS C&C costs as an expense for financial reporting purposes under paragraph 68(a) of NZ IAS 38 applying, for the purposes of that paragraph, paragraphs 54 to 67 of that standard. In view of this, the taxpayer w ill need to consider whether : t he SaaS C&C costs are within the scope of NZ IAS 38; the SaaS C&C costs will be recognised as an expense under paragraph 68(a); and in considering paragraphs 54 to 67 the SaaS C&C costs will be expensed under paragraph 68(a). Are the SaaS C&C costs within the scope of NZ IAS 38? 123.As the taxpayer incurs SaaS C&C costs on intangible items, if the SaaS arrangement does not contain a lease under NZ IFRS 16 27 , the costs will be within the scope of NZ IAS 38. 124.NZ IAS 38 prescribes the accounting treatment for intangible assets that no other NZ IFRS standard deals with specifically. The scope of NZ IAS 38 includes research or development activities for internally generated intangible assets (paragraph 5 of NZ IAS 38). 125.Further, paragraphs 9 and 10 of NZ IAS 38 clarify that, to the extent costs on intangible it ems do not meet the definition of an intangible asset, they are still within the sco pe o f NZ IAS 38: 9 Entities frequently expend resources, or incur liabilities, on the acquisition, development, maintenance or enhancement of intangible resources such as scientific or technical knowledge, design and implementation of new processes or systems, licences, intellectual property, market knowledge and trademarks (including brand names and publishing titles). Common examples of items encompassed by these broad headings are computer software, patents, copyrights, motion picture films, customer lists, mortgage servicing rights, fishing licences, import quotas, franchises, customer or supplier relationships, customer loyalty, market share and marketing rights. 27 New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard 16 Leases (NZ IFRS 16) (New Zealand Accounting Standards Board of the External Reporting Board, issued February 2016 and incorporates amendments to 23 April 2021) IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 27 of 56 10 Not all the items described in paragraph 9 meet the definition of an intangible asset, ie identifiability, control over a resource and existence of future economic benefits. If an item within the scope of this Standard does not meet the definition of an intangible asset, expenditure to acquire it or generate it internally is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. However, if the item is acquired in a business combination, it forms part of the goodwill recognised at the acquisition date (see paragraph 68). 126.Costs on intangible items where the definition of “intangible asset” is not satisfied or the entity will not recognise an intangible asset are within the scope of NZ IAS 38. 127.In the context of SaaS C&C costs, the IFRIC Agenda Decision specifically refers to the treatment of SaaS C&C costs under IAS 38: If the customer does not recognise an intangible asset in relation to configuration or customisation of the application software, it applies paragraphs 68–70 of IAS 38 to account for those costs. 128.IFRIC’s comments support the view that the SaaS C&C costs are potentially within the scope of NZ IAS 38. Will the SaaS C&C costs be recognised as an expense under paragraph 68(a)? 129.Paragraph 68(a) applies to costs a taxpayer incurs on intangible items, including the SaaS C&C costs, that do not satisfy the intangible asset recognition criteria. 130.Paragraph 68 provides: 68 Expenditure on an intangible item shall be recognised as an expense when it is incurred unless: (a)it forms part of the cost of an intangible asset that meets the recognition criteria (see paragraphs 18–67); 131.Paragraph 68(a) applies to all costs a taxpayer incurs on an intangible item and is not limited to research or development expenditure. As a result, not all costs expensed under paragraph 68(a) are within the scope of s DB 34. 132.If costs on an intangible item are not required to be recognised as an intangible asset for accounting purposes, the costs will be expensed. Paragraph 18 of NZ IAS 38 sets o ut the general requirements for recognising an intangible asset: 18 The recognition of an item as an intangible asset requires an entity to demonstrate that the item meets: (a)the definition of an intangible asset (see paragraphs 8-17); and (b)the recognition criteria (see paragraphs 21-23). IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 28 of 56 133.Further, specific paragraphs cover how the recognition criteria are applied for certain t ypes of intangible items. Paragraphs 51–67 deal with the initial recognition and measurement of internally generated intangible assets. 28 134.To the extent that expenditure on an intangible item does not meet the definition of intangible asset, the expenditure is recognised as an expense under paragraph 68(a). Further, if the expenditure meets the intangible asset definition, but not the recognition criteria, the expenditure will also be expensed under paragraph 68(a). 135.In its Agenda Decision on Configuration or Customisation Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (IAS 38), IFRIC concluded: Applying paragraph 18 of IAS 38, an entity recognises an item as an intangible asset when the entity demonstrates that the item meets both the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria in paragraphs 21–23 of IAS 38. IAS 38 defines an intangible asset as ‘an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance’. IAS 38 notes that an asset is a resource controlled by an entity and paragraph 13 specifies that an entity controls an asset if it has ‘the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource and to restrict the access of others to those benefits’. In the fact pattern described in the request, the supplier controls the application software to which the customer has access. The assessment of whether configuration or customisation of that software results in an intangible asset for the customer depends on the nature and output of the configuration or customisation performed. The Committee observed that, in the SaaS arrangement described in the request, the customer often would not recognise an intangible asset because it does not control the software being configured or customised and those configuration or customisation activities do not create a resource controlled by the customer that is separate from the software. In some circumstances, however, the arrangement may result in, for example, additional code from which the customer has the power to obtain the future economic benefits and to restrict others’ access to those benefits. In that case, in determining whether to recognise the additional code as an intangible asset, the customer assesses whether the additional code is identifiable and meets the recognition criteria in IAS 38. 136.Based on IFRIC’s comments, where the taxpayer does not recognise the SaaS C&C costs as an intangible asset because the taxpayer does not have the required control of the resource, 29 the taxpayer will apply paragraphs 68–70 of NZ IAS 38 to account for the costs. 28 Refer to paragraph 19 in NZ IAS 38. 29 IFRIC noted that in some situations where the customer has control of the software code, the customer may be able to recognise an intangible asset under IAS 38. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 29 of 56 137.Taxpayers should confirm their accounting treatment with their financial accountant and/or independent auditor. The facts and circumstances of each arrangement will determine the accounting outcomes. How does a taxpayer apply paragraphs 54 to 67 in determining whether SaaS C&C costs are expensed under paragraph 68(a)? 138.As s DB 34 refers to costs that are expensed under paragraph 68(a) “applying, for the purposes of that paragraph, paragraphs 54 to 67”, it is necessary to understand the m eaning of this phrase. 139.Paragraphs 54 to 67 of NZ IAS 38 deal with the initial recognition and measurement of internally generated intangible assets. As s DB 34 specifically refers to applying paragraphs 54 to 67, s DB 34 applies only to costs relating to internally generated items . 140.Paragraphs 54 to 56 consider the research phase 30 of an internal project. Then pa ragraphs 57 to 64 consider the development phase of an internal project. Finally, paragraphs 65 to 67 determine the cost of an internally generated intangible asset. Research phase 141.Generally, in the research phase of an internal project, a taxpayer will be unable to demonstrate that an intangible asset exists. Paragraph 54 provides: 54 No intangible asset arising from research (or from the research phase of an internal project) shall be recognised. Expenditure on research (or on the research phase of an internal project) shall be recognised as an expense when it is incurred. 142.If a taxpayer incurs research expenditure within the scope of NZ IAS 38, pursuant to paragraphs 54 to 56, it will be expensed under paragraph 68(a). Development phase 143.The key provision is paragraph 57. It provides: 57 An intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) shall be recognised if, and only if, an entity can demonstrate all of the following: (a)the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale. 30 P aragraph 52 states that although the terms ‘research’ and ‘development’ are defined, the terms “research phase” and “development phase” have a broader meaning for the purpose of NZ IAS 38. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 30 of 56 (b)its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it. (c)its ability to use or sell the intangible asset. (d)how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset. (e)the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset. (f)its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 144.What is essential to recognising an intangible asset during the development phase is that all six criteria must be demonstrated. If all these criteria can be demonstrated, t he ex penditure will not be recognised as an expense under paragraph 68(a). 145.The accounting treatment for expenditure the taxpayer incurs in the development phase is different from the treatment in the research phase because the development phase of a project is further advanced. In addition, in some instances, a taxpayer can: 31 i dentify an intangible asset; and demonstrate that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Intangible asset definition 146.Paragraph \[ 132\] sets out the general requirements for recognising an intangible asset. Generally, for accounting purposes, costs on intangible items (including development costs) are expensed under NZ IAS 38 paragraph 68(a) until the time that the asset recognition criteria are satisfied. In these situations, if the costs are for research o r d evelopment and are expensed by applying paragraphs 54 to 67, s DB 34 would allow a deduction for the costs. However, this treatment assumes that the definition of intangible asset in NZ IAS 38 has been satisfied. 147.An issue arises where, as in the case of SaaS C&C costs, the entity has no prospect of recognising an intangible asset because the customer has no control over the created resource, and the definition of intangible asset will not be met. 148.One suggestion might be that if an intangible asset as defined in paragraph 8 of NZ IAS 38 does not exist, then the costs are expensed under paragraph 68(a) without needing to apply the recognition criteria in paragraphs 54 to 67. For SaaS C&C costs , th is would mean that because the taxpayer lacks control of the intangible item and so does not have an intangible asset, s DB 34(2) does not apply as the taxpayer need not apply paragraphs 54 to 67. However, on balance the Commissioner is satisfied that the reference to “applying paragraphs 54 to 67” in s DB 34(2) operates to narrow the scope 31 Refer to paragraph 58 of NZ IAS 38. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 31 of 56 of the provision to internally generated research or development but is not more restrictive. 149.The reference should not be interpreted to limit s DB 34 to instances where an intangible item meets the definition of “intangible asset”, b ut the costs are expensed as the item does not meet the recognition criteria. In the case of research costs, NZ IAS 38 specifically provides that they will not result in an intangible asset, but researc h c osts are within the scope of s DB 34(2). Further, the original proposal for s DB 34(2) a s o utlined in the Government’s discussion paper contains support for aligning tax and accounting treatment: 8.... Broadly, the proposal is to clarify the capital / revenue boundary by permitting taxpayers to follow accounting treatment to the extent that when R&D expenditure is immediately written off for accounting purposes, it will be immediately deductible for tax purposes. ... 69.The proposal is likely to reduce the amount of any R&D expenditure that is black hole. R&D costs that do not lead to an asset will be expensed for accounting. They will, therefore, be immediately deductible for tax. 150.Section DB 34(2) applies to costs that are capital in nature for tax purposes but are not recognised as an intangible asset for accounting purposes. The reason for the disparity in treatment is that the tests and definitions differ between tax and accounting. As noted in the discussion paper, the G overnment’s intention was to allow a tax deduction for research or development expenditure that was expensed for accounting. It appears to be inconsistent with this intention to interpret s DB 34 as requiring expenditure to meet the intangible asset definition in NZ IAS 38. This would create a class of research and development costs where the accounting expense is not deductible for tax. In t he c ontext of C&C costs, the IFRIC Agenda Decision provides that an entity should expense them under paragraph 68 of IAS 38 if the entity is unable to recognise a n i ntangible asset. Summary of the application of s DB 34 to C&C costs 151.In some situations, s DB 34(2) may operate to allow a deduction for C&C costs. 152.A deduction under s DB 34 requires that the costs are: either “research” or “development” as defined in paragraph 8 of NZ IAS 38; internally generated and within the scope of paragraphs 54 to 67; and expensed under paragraph 68(a). IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 32 of 56 153.Section DB 34(2) only applies to “research” or “development” as defined in paragraph 8 of NZ IAS 38. The IFRIC Agenda Decision does not refer to SaaS C&C costs as either “research” or “development” as defined in paragraph 8. For this reason, it will be necessary for a taxpayer to clearly demonstrate that the SaaS C&C costs are either “research” or “development” as defined by paragraph 8 and not merely expensed under paragraph 68(a). 154.The reference to “applying paragraphs 54 to 67” in s DB 34 narrows the scope to internally generated research or development and excludes costs incurred o n s eparately acquired intangible items. 155.If the taxpayer carries out the SaaS C&C activities in-house, the costs likely relate to an internally generated intangible item. In situations where an intangible asset does not exist, it will not be possible to demonstrate the recognition criteria in paragraphs 54 to 67 and the amount will be expensed under paragraph 68(a). If an intangible asset does exist, the entity will need to determine whether they can demonstrate all six criteria in paragraph 57 and if not, the amount will be expensed under paragraph 68(a). 156.Where C&C work is undertaken by the SaaS provider or a third party, the taxpayer will need to consider whether the costs relate to an internally generated intangible item and whether paragraphs 54 to 67 guide the decision as to whether an intangible asset should be recognised. If the C&C costs are not within the scope of paragraphs 54 to 67, they are outside the scope of s DB 34(2) and the taxpayer should consider whether the C&C costs relate to an item of depreciable intangible property. Timing of deduction 157.A taxpayer can claim a deduction under s DB 34 when they incur the expenditure. Alternatively, the taxpayer may choose to allocate the deduction in accordance with s DB 34(7). 158.Applying the allocation mechanism under s DB 34(7) is the taxpayer’s choice. To the e xtent that a taxpayer does not allocate the deduction in accordance with s DB 34(7), they may be subject to s EA 3 (unexpired expenditure) for any third-party costs. Refer to the discussion from \[71\]. 159.Section DB 34(7) provides: IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 33 of 56 Choice for allocation of deduction (7)A person who is allowed a deduction under this section for expenditure that is not interest and is described in subsection (2), (4) or (5) may choose to allocate all or part of the deduction- (a)to an income year after the income year in which the person incurs the expenditure; and (b)in the way required by section EJ 23 (Allocation of deductions for research, development, and resulting market development). 160.The allocation mechanism in s EJ 23 allows a better match of timing between the r ecognition of income from research and development (if able to be determined) an d t he deduction for the expenditure. Depreciable intangible property 161.The depreciation rules may apply to the extent that the taxpayer cannot deduct the C &C costs under either s DA 1 or s DB 34. Figure | Hoahoa 3 shows the steps that need to be considered when determining if a depreciation loss can be claimed. 162.Generally, under a SaaS arrangement, the taxpayer receives the right to use or access the SaaS software. The right to use software is depreciable intangible property. The ta xpayer will need to review the terms of their SaaS arrangement to determine whether they should depreciate the right to use software under either the depreciabl e i ntangible property or FLIP rules. The capital SaaS C&C costs will be part of the cos t ba se of either the depreciable intangible property or FLIP. What is “depreciable intangible property”? 163.Depreciable property is property that “in normal circumstances, might reasonably be ex pected to decline in value” while being used or available for use in an incom e ea rning activity (s EE 6(1)). 164.Depreciable property includes intangible property if it: meets the definition of “depreciable intangible property” in s EE 62; in normal circumstances might reasonably be expected to decline in value w hen i n use or available for use in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income; and is not excluded under s EE 7. 165.FLIP is depreciable intangible property with a “legal life” that is the same length as the pr operty’s “estimated useful life”. It is important to consider the FLIP rules where t he SaaS arrangement has a fixed term as some arrangements may be FLIP. If the SaaS arrangement does not have a fixed term, it cannot be FLIP. In this case, the IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 34 of 56 depreciable intangible property rules will apply, and the property can only be depreciated at the economic rates. Definition of “depreciable intangible property” 166.Section EE 62 sets out the meaning of “depreciable intangible property”: EE 62 Meaning of depreciable intangible property Meaning (1)Depreciable intangible property means the property listed in schedule 14 (Depreciable intangible property). Criteria for listing in schedule 14 (2)For property to be listed in schedule 14, the criteria are as follows: (a)It must be intangible; and (b)It must have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its acquisition. Schedule 14 prevails (3)Property that is listed in schedule 14 is depreciable intangible property even if the criteria are not met. 167.Depreciable intangible property, as defined in s EE 62, means property listed in sch 14. To remove all doubt, s EE 62(3) provides that if something is listed in the schedule, it is treated as depreciable intangible property even if it does not meet the criteria. As s EE 62(2) provides, these criteria are that the property is intangible and has a finit e us eful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty. 168.Of relevance to this discussion, sch 14 includes: (7)the copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, or the right to use software 169.In most cases, the reason why the taxpayer has the right to access the SaaS provider’s cloud infrastructure is to facilitate their right to use the software provided under t he SaaS ar rangement. I n contrast, in a pure service arrangement the taxpayer does no t r eceive any rights to use any piece of software but transfers data to the cloud provider and then receives the results of the SaaS provider’s processing of the data. As \[11\] explains, this type of pure service arrangement is outside the scope of this guidance (and in practice is unlikely to involve configuration or customisation expenditure). 170.Under a SaaS arrangement, the taxpayer does not receive the “copyright in the s oftware” or the “right to use the copyright in the software”. The depreciabl e i ntangible property is not the software itself but the taxpayer’s rights under the SaaS arrangement to use the software. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 35 of 56 Decline in value when used or available for use 171.Intangible property will be depreciable property if, in normal circumstances, it might reasonably be expected to decline in value when used or available for use. The key consideration is whether the right to use the software granted under the SaaS arrangement declines in value when used or available for use. 172.Intangible assets with a fixed term are usually considered to have a useful life determined by their legal life and to decline in value as the remaining legal and useful life reduces over time. A right to use software under a SaaS arrangement with a fixed t erm will decline in value over the term of the arrangement. 173.A question arises as to whether a SaaS arrangement with no fixed term declines in value when used or available for use. 174.There is case law to support the view that property with no fixed term does not decline in value. In Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Trustpower Limited, the Court of Appeal held: \[25\]In the case of intangible property, this provision will apply if the three requirements of s EE 6(3) are met. As the cl 9 resource consents ar e “ depreciable intangible property”, the first requirement is met. The land use consents of unlimited duration are not within the definition of “depreciable intangible property” because without a fixed term they cannot be expected to decline in value” over time. 175.Further, in Trustees in the CB Simkin Trust and the Trustees in the NC Simkin Trust v CIR, 32 the Privy Council considered whether a trademark as opposed to a right to use a trademark would decline in value: 8.Their Lordships draw attention to what is not to be found in sch 17. C opyright, other than copyright in software or in a sound recording, is not depreciable intangible property. Nor is a trademark. What distinguishes these types of intangible property from those that are included is the longevity of the useful life of the omitted types. A trademark does not have a “finite useful life”. Its useful life can continue indefinitely. The right to use a trademark, on the other hand, will last only for as long as the trademark owner has granted that right. 176.The above cases suggest that if the intangible property d oes not have a fixed term, then it does not decline in value. However, the cases do not consider software or the r ight to use software. 177.The New Zealand Parliament enacted the rules permitting the depreciation of intangible assets largely based on the recommendations of the Valabh Committee i n 32 (2005) 22 NZTC 19,001. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 36 of 56 1991. 33 The Committee recommended, among other things, expanding depreciable assets to include all depreciating intangible assets: 8.5.3 The Exclusion of Intangible Assets A notable exclusion from the class of depreciable property are intangible assets. Depreciation is not a phenomenon that is unique to tangible assets. Certain types of intangible assets can also be expected to decline in value over time. Although intangible assets cannot, by definition, depreciate in value due to wear and tear, they may decline in value over time due to obsolescence brought about by the effluxion of time, changes in technology and changes in the tastes of consumers. \[Emphasis added\] 178.The Valabh Committee also stated: 8.6.3 Rate-Setting Criteria ... The market value of an asset may decline in value as a result of: (a)a reduced quantity of the services to be provided by the asset. This may occur as a r esult of physical wear and tear in the case of tangible assets or the effluxion of time in the case of intangible assets. The amount of physical wear and tear is likely to be a function of the environment in which a particular asset is used (such as where assets are used in a corrosive environment, or where they are used for extraordinary hours during the day and will therefore decline in value at a greater rate than similar assets used in “normal” environments); and (b)a reduced secondary market price of the asset. This can result from obsolescence brought about by technological change (such as the introduction of new assets providing better quality services) and changes in consumer tastes. \[Emphasis added\] 179.The Committee considered a decline in value of some assets while they were used or available for use will be due to: reduced functionality of the asset (as determined in the case of intangible assets by the “effluxion” – or passing – of time); and obsolescence due to technological change or changes in consumer tastes. 180.In this way, some intangible assets may decline in value even though they have no fixed legal life because the effects of technological changes or changes in consumer tastes give them a finite useful life. As software is likely to decline in value due to 33 Valabh Committee Tax Accounting Issues (Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital, Wellington, February 1991). IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 37 of 56 obsolescence, it follows that a right to use software would also decline in value no matter whether the right has a fixed term or not. 181.More recently, the Court of Appeal in Queenstown Airport Corp Ltd v CIR 34 considered that the threshold for determining whether an asset might reasonably be expected to decline in value is quite low: \[81\]We make a number of points about the interpretation of the relevant part of s EE 6(1). First, the reference to normal circumstances refers to circumstances that might ordinarily be expected to affect the value of the relevant asset over time. Abnormal circumstances, of which an earthquake might be one, are excluded from consideration. Second, the assessment is ordinarily made at the time the relevant deduction is sought. Necessarily, this will involve a prediction of future events. Third, the test is objective in the sense that it would not be sufficient for a taxpayer to believe that the asset might deteriorate over time and therefore decline in value. There must be a reasonable basis for that expectation. Fourth, the expression “might reasonably be expected to decline in value” sets a relatively low threshold. So long as there is a reasonable prospect that the asset might decline in value in the future, that is sufficient. Fifth, it is not necessary that the asset is actually used, only that it is available for use. Finally, we agree with Mr Goddard that the test does not require that the asset in question would require complete replacement at the end of its useful life. Nevertheless, the extent, nature and cost of any work required to reinstate the relevant asset may have a material bearing on the assessment of whether a decline in value might reasonably be expected. \[Emphasis added\] 182.In a SaaS arrangement, the taxpayer receives the right to use software but not the software itself (ie the underlying asset). The Commissioner considers that to the extent the software declines in value, a right to use that software also declines in value. 183.The high likelihood that software, such as a SaaS application, will decline in value due t o obsolescence supports the view that a right to use software declines in val ue r egardless of whether the right has a fixed term. 34 \[2017\] NZCA 20. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 38 of 56 Section EE 7 exclusions 184.Section EE 7 contains a list of items that are deemed not to be depreciable property. Of relevance is that t he list of items includes financial arrangements. The finance lease and financial arrangement rules are discussed from \[223\]. 35 185.If the SaaS arrangement has a fixed term, a taxpayer should consider whether the d epreciable intangible property is FLIP (refer to \[206\] below). Calculating the depreciation loss 186.A taxpayer has the option of using either the diminishing value (DV) method or straight-line (SL) method to calculate their depreciation loss on depreciable intangibl e pr operty (the rights to use software). The cost base of depreciable intangible property will include the SaaS C&C costs. To the extent that the taxpayer incurs any subsequent C&C costs, these costs are added to the cost base under s EE 37. What is the cost base of depreciable intangible property? 187.The depreciation methods applied to depreciable property are calculated with reference to the “cost” of the item of depreciable property. Although the Act does not define “cost”, its meaning is generally accepted as: 36 ... \[t\]hat which must be given to acquire something 188.Depreciation losses are available on assets that are used or available for use. As such, the asset must be capable of use and all costs to bring the asset to a condition and location to enable its use are generally accepted as forming part of the cost of a n a sset. The cost of the depreciable intangible property includes all amounts of capital expenditure that a taxpayer incurs for that item of property up until it is in a conditio n f or first use or availability for use . 189.For a SaaS arrangement, the cost of the depreciable property may include: C&C costs; and regular subscription payments. 35 Our discussion on “Calculating the depreciation loss” is based on the position that the right to use software under a SaaS arrangement is depreciable property and not excluded under s EE 7. 36 Tasman Forestry Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,147 (CA) at 15,156. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 39 of 56 SaaS C&C costs 190.C&C costs are costs for making specific alterations and improvements to the SaaS application from which a customer-specific version or iteration of the software is created. 191.To conclude that a SaaS arrangement can give rise to an item of depreciable intangible pr operty (or FLIP), it is necessary to show that the C&C costs are capital in nature. I t f ollows that these costs are part of the “cost” that the taxpayer incurs for the relevant intangible asset being the right to use software. 192.As this interpretation guideline has outlined, the taxpayer may incur the C&C costs in- house, with the SaaS provider or with a third party. 193.Where the taxpayer incurs the C&C costs with the SaaS provider, those costs are part of the cost of the rights they obtain under the SaaS arrangement. The costs are “for” the acquisition of the relevant intangible asset and so are part of the “cost” of t he pr operty. 194.Where the taxpayer incurs the C&C costs in-house or in paying a third party ( no matter who engages the third party), the costs are likely to be part of the cost of t he i ntangible asset, as long as the SaaS arrangement contemplates the C&C costs t he ta xpayer incurs. In these circumstances, the taxpayer would incur the costs in order to get the intangible asset for which they are acquiring the rights to use into a conditio n f or their use. 195.If the taxpayer cannot use the SaaS application before the C&C activities are completed, the SaaS C&C costs they incur will be part of the initial cost of t he d epreciable property. 196.A SaaS C&C project may be carried out in a series of stages or phases. Depending on the facts, a later stage or phase may be a continuation of the original project or a separate stand-alone project. Any SaaS C&C costs the taxpayer incurs in later stages of the same project after they can use the SaaS application may constitute a n im provement to their right to use the SaaS application. Under s EE 37, the taxpayer has the option to treat the improvement as: part of the item of depreciable property that was improved (ie part of their righ t t o use the SaaS application); or a separate item of depreciable property. Alternatively, SaaS C&C costs incurred after the taxpayer can use the SaaS application may be revenue in nature depending upon the taxpayer’s factual circumstances. See IS 17/04 paragraphs \[24\] to \[27\] for further guidance. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 40 of 56 Regular subscription payments 197.Regular subscription payments are not generally part of the cost of the depreciable i ntangible property unless the taxpayer incurs them before the depreciable intangibl e pr operty is available for use. 198.To answer the question of whether the regular subscription payments are part of the cost base, it is necessary to consider what the payments are “for” and whether they ar e r evenue in nature. 199.A taxpayer makes subscription payments at regular intervals throughout the life of the arrangement. Generally, these regular subscriptions payments are for the taxpayer’s ongoing use of the version of the SaaS application created from the SaaS C&C cost s t hey incurred, rather than for the cost of acquiring or creating the asset itself (ie they generally incur the subscriptions after the software is in a condition for first use o r a vailability for use). For this reason, the payments for the use of and access to the SaaS application are deductible under general principles. 200.An exception to the revenue treatment of the subscription payments arises for regular subscription amounts the taxpayer pays during the period when the SaaS application is being configured or customised and is not yet available for use. Subscriptio n pa yments they incur during this period are part of the overall project to improve t he SaaS ap plication from its off-the-shelf state. In these situations, the subscriptio n pa yments are a necessary part of the taxpayer obtaining the right to use the softwar e a nd will be included in the cost base of the right to use the software asset. 201.To the extent the discussion above differs from IS 17/04, then this guideline applies. When can the taxpayer start claiming a depreciation loss? 202.The taxpayer will be able to depreciate the right to use software, provided they use it, or it is available for use to derive assessable income or carry on their business activities. The date from which the taxpayer will be able to calculate and claim depreciation losses will depend on their individual circumstances. 203.If the taxpayer cannot use the SaaS application before the C&C activities are completed, they cannot claim a depreciation loss until the date when they are able to use the SaaS application. This is because, in such circumstances where essentially t he ta xpayer’s particular SaaS application is “under construction”, the asset would not decline in value until it is completed. Where the SaaS arrangement has no fixed term, no item of depreciable intangible property exists until completion. Where the SaaS arrangement has a fixed term but cannot be treated as a FLIP, an item of depreciabl e i ntangible property likely exists from the date of the SaaS arrangement. However, practically, there will be no cost base on which the right to depreciate can b e c alculated until the C&C expenses are incurred and the SaaS application is able to be IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 41 of 56 used. As a result, there could be a significant lead time between the date of the contract(s) creating the SaaS arrangement and the date the SaaS application i s fully implemented and available for use. 204.Alternatively, it may be that the SaaS application is available for the taxpayer to use even t hough it has not yet been fully customised or configured. In thes e c ircumstances, the taxpayer may claim a depreciation loss from the time that they started using the SaaS application. 205.Unless the depreciable intangible property meets the additional criteria to qualify as FLIP, the taxpayer’s depreciation loss is calculated at an economic rate. The current economic rate for depreciating software is 50% DV or 40% SL . 37 Fixed life intangible property 206.FLIP is depreciable intangible property with a “legal life” that is the same length as the pr operty’s “estimated useful life”. A SaaS arrangement with a fixed term may be FLIP . I n such cases, the taxpayer will need to calculate their depreciation loss under t he F LIP rules. What is “fixed life intangible property”? 207.FLIP is defined in s EE 67 as follows: EE 67 Other definitions In this Act,- ... fixed life intangible property means property that- (a)is depreciable intangible property; and (b)has a legal life that could reasonably be expected, on the date of the property’s acquisition, to be the same length as the property’s remaining estimated useful life 208.The first key requirement in the definition of FLIP is that it involves an item of depreciable intangible property. As discussed from \[161\], the right to use software under a SaaS arrangement is depreciable intangible property. 209.The second requirement is that the legal life of the depreciable intangible property is expected to be the same as the estimated useful life of the depreciable intangibl e pr operty. T o establish whether property meets this requirement, it is necessary to consider the terms “legal life” and “estimated useful life”. 37 Depreciation rate finder and calculator ( I nland Revenue, Wellington, 2023). IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 42 of 56 Meaning of “legal life” 210.Section EE 67 defines “l egal life” as follows: legal life,- (a)for an item to which paragraphs (b) to (d) do not apply, means the number of years, months, and days for which an owner’s interest in an item of intangible property exists under the contract or statute that creates the owner’s interest, assuming that the owner exercises any rights of renewal or extension that are either essentially unconditional or conditional on the payment of predetermined fees: (b)for an item that is a patent application, a design registration application, a patent, or a design registration, means the legal life under paragraph (a) that a patent or design registration would have if granted when the relevant application is first lodged: (bb) for an item that is industrial artistic copyright, means the number of years, months, and days for which protection against copyright infringement is available as a result of section 75(1)(c) to (e) of the Copyright Act 1994: (c)for an item that is plant variety rights, means the total of- (i)the legal life that the rights would have under paragraph (a); and (ii)the number of whole calendar months during which the person owns the plant variety rights application in relation to which the rights are granted: (d)for a person and a right (a land right) that is a leasehold estate, or a licence to use land, means the number of years, months, and days for which the person or an associated person has an owner’s interest in the land right, or in a consecutive or successive land right, under the contract or statute that creates the owner’s interest, determined- (i)when the person acquires the owner’s interest; and (ii)assuming that the person or associated person exercises rights of renewal, extension, or further grant that are either essentially unconditional or conditional on the payment of predetermined fees. 211.Subsections (b) to (d) in the definition of legal life are not relevant in the context of SaaS arrangements as they apply to specific types of depreciable intangible property that do not include a right to use software. 212.The start of the legal life for the SaaS arrangement is the date that the taxpayer’s interest in the intangible property – that is, the right to use software – is created under contract. 213.The definition of “legal life” set out at \[210\] shows that the legal life is measured assuming the taxpayer exercises any rights of renewal or extension that are unc onditional, or conditional only on the payment of a predetermined fee. Taxpayers will need to determine whether they must include any renewal or extension rights in calculating the legal life of the SaaS arrangement. This will be important becaus e in cluding renewal rights may extend the legal life of the SaaS arrangement beyond its estimated useful life, which rules out any treatment of it as FLIP. Meaning of “estimated useful life” 214.Section EE 63(1) defines “e stimated useful life” as follows: IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 43 of 56 EE 63 Meaning of estimated useful life Meaning for item of depreciable property, except for copyright in sound recording Estimated useful life, for an item of depreciable property, other than a copyright in a sound recording, means the period over which the item might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, taking into account- (a)the passage of time, likely wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence; and (b)an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance. 215.An asset’s estimated useful life is the period over which the asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving income or carrying on a business. 216.The taxpayer’s item of depreciable property is their contractual rights under a SaaS arrangement (ie a chose in action). In these situations, the depreciable property, which her e is the right to use software, “might reasonably be expected to be useful” i n d eriving income from the contract date. It is from this date that the taxpayer has secured the right to access the SaaS application and can configure or customise t he SaaS ap plication. 217.If the legal life and the estimated useful life of the right to use the software are the same, the SaaS arrangement will be FLIP. However, in situations where the estimated useful life is shorter than the legal life, FLIP treatment will not be available. Generally, the latter situations will occur if the legal life of the SaaS arrangement is longer tha n t he estimated useful life. 218.The Commissioner considers the right to use software has an estimated useful life of 4 years. 38 Accordingly, where the legal life of the SaaS arrangement is longer than 4 years, the SaaS arrangement will not be FLIP and the taxpayer must calculate their depreciation loss under the general provisions on depreciable intangible property that is discussed at \[186\]. However, where the legal life of the SaaS arrangement is shorte r t han 4 years, the estimated useful life of the right to use software will align with t he le gal life. It follows that in these situations the SaaS arrangement will be FLIP. 219.Accordingly, determining the legal life of a SaaS arrangement is vital in determining if FLIP treatment is available. This requires considering the terms of the arrangement, whether there is a fixed term, whether there is only a minimum term, whether there ar e r enewal rights and what conditions, if any, attach to any renewal rights (see previous discussion of the definition of “legal life”). It may be that an arrangement does not have a measurable legal life. For example, an arrangement may have an indefinit e le gal life if it runs at the will of the parties cancellable at any time with appropriat e no tice. 38 Inland Revenue Department NZ General Depreciation Rates I R 265 (October 2022). IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 44 of 56 Calculating the depreciation loss 220.Section EE 12(2)(b) requires the straight-line method to be used for FLIP. Section EE 33(2) sets out the formula to use as follows: 1 ÷ legal life 221.As it is unlikely that a taxpayer will incur any C&C costs as at the contract date, it is necessary to consider the ability to add costs to the cost base of FLIP. Section EE 19 provides: EE 19 Cost: fixed life intangible property When this section applies (1)This section applies when— (a)a person owns an item of fixed life intangible property; and (b)the person incurs additional costs in an income year for the item; and (c)the person is denied a deduction for the additional costs other than a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss. When this section does not apply (1B) This section does not apply for additional costs incurred before 7 November 2013 for— (a)a design registration: (b)a design registration application: (c)industrial artistic copyright. Additional costs for fixed life intangible property (2)For the purposes of the formula in section EE 16, the item’s cost at the start of the income year is treated as being the total of— (a)the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year; and (b)the additional costs the person incurs. 222.For s EE 19 to apply, the additional costs must be “for the item”. That is, it must be an e xisting item of FLIP the taxpayer owns and for which they are denied a deduction. Where the taxpayer incurs the C&C costs and those costs are not deductible, t he a dditional costs can be capitalised to the carrying value of the FLIP under s EE 19. Finance lease rules 223.The Commissioner is satisfied that the rights arising under a typical SaaS agreement will be “rights to use software”. At law, these rights are also likely to amount to a licence to use software. 39 A “licence” is merely a power or authority to do some act that could not be lawfully done without that authority. In Russel v Ministry of Commerce for Northern Ireland, 40 the High Court of Northern Ireland stated: 39 Exceptions may apply in the case of pure service agreements – see \[ 169\]. 40 Russel v Ministry of Commerce for Northern Ireland \[1945\] NI 184 (NIHC) at 188. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 45 of 56 The word licence has a well recognised signification in English law. According to our law a licence properly so called is merely a permission granted to a person to do some act which but for such permission it would be unlawful for them to do so. Additionally, in Heap v Hartley, 41 Cotton LJ stated: \[W\]here there is only a license which does not entitle the licensee to take anything away, or to acquire any property, then the license simply remains a license, this is, an authority from the person who grants it to the person who receives it, enabling him to do lawfully that which without the license he could not do; ... 224.Given this, an issue arises about the potential application of the finance lease rules to some SaaS arrangements with a term. 42 This is because since 2004, the finance lease rules have extended the definition of “lease” to include “licence(s) to use intangible pr operty”. 43 This express inclusion means that such a licence need not conform with the usual characteristics of a lease. 225.If a SaaS arrangement is a “ lease”, it can potentially be a “finance lease” under subs (b) of the definition of that term in s YA 1: finance lease means a lease of a personal property lease asset entered into by a person on or after 20 May 1999 that— ... (b)when the person enters the lease or from a later time, involves a term of the lease that is more than 75% of the asset’s estimated useful life as defined in section EE 63 (Meaning of estimated useful life): 226.If a SaaS arrangement is subject to the finance lease rules, the effect would be to deem the underlying software the SaaS provider owns as having been sold to the taxpayer. This is because the finance lease rules look through to the underlying asset (here t he so ftware, not the rights to the software) 44 and recharacterise the transaction. 227.On first glance, this outcome seems highly unusual given that no underlying sale occurs in economic terms and, as a result of applying the rules, the taxpayer is treate d a s the outright “owner” of the software (including the copyright in it) when they simply have non-exclusive rights to use it. This outcome prompts consideration of t he ba ckground to the introduction of the extension to the finance lease rules. 41 (1889) 42 Ch D 461 (EWCA) at 468. 42 These are arrangements with a term of over 75% of the estimated useful life of software. 43 D efinition of a “lease” under s YA 1 (d)(iii). 44 Sale and Leaseback of Intangibles, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005) at 49. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 46 of 56 Background to introduction of licences to use intangible property to the finance lease rules 228.In 2004, s 261(13)(b) of the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 inserted subpara (iii) of the definition of “lease” into the Act. It amended the definition of “lease” under s OB 1 (d)(iib) of the Income Tax Act 2004. The Commentary on the Bill explains: 45 SALE AND LEASEBACK OF INTANGIBLES (Clauses 19 and 65) ... Background The government announced in May 2003 that it was concerned about a scheme involving the sale and leaseback of intangibles under which tax deductions are claimed for what are, in substance, repayments of principal under a loan. The government said that it would propose remedial legislation to ensure that such deductions could not be taken. ... Described below are the simplified features of a transaction that may allow deductions for what are, in substance, loan principal repayments. A Co, B Co and C Co are associated. A Co sells its trademarks or brand names to a non- resident bank for, say, $20 million (which is non-taxable as any profit is a capital gain). The bank immediately grants to B Co an exclusive licence to use the trademarks for a fixed term in return for annual royalty payments totalling, say, $12 million that are deductible to B Co. B Co grants a sublicence to A Co on the same terms. The bank grants to C Co an option to purchase the trade marks, subject to the bank retaining the right to receive the licence payments from B Co. The exercise price under the option is, say, $11 million, the reduction in value of the trademarks from $20 million reflecting the bank’s right to continue to receive the royalty income from B Co during the licence period. The option is exercised on the date that the bank buys the trademarks and the licence begins, so that the bank pays A Co $20 million for the trademarks and immediately sells them to C Co for $11 million. The bank’s net outgoing is $9 million, which it pays in return for future payments of $12 million. In substance, the transaction is a loan of $9 million from the bank to the group and the bank treats the transaction for tax, regulatory and accounting purposes accordingly. By structuring the loan as a licence, a deduction may be available to B Co for what are, in substance, repayments of the $9 million principal, instead of only the $3 million interest 45 Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill Commentary on the Bill (Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue, March 2004) at 11–13. IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 47 of 56 that would be allowed if the transaction were in the form of a loan. This outcome is contrary to the policy intent underlying the tax treatment of debt transactions (and it may be that the tax avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 apply to it). 229.When the Bill was reported back at the Select Committee stage, the following comments were made 46 : The bill amends the finance lease rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 in response to certain situations in response to a person selling an intangible asset, such as a trademark, and then leasing back the same asset. In such cases, lease payments may, in substance, be partly repayments of loan principal, and it is necessary to amend the law on finance leases to ensure people in such arrangements are not able to claim a deduction for these repayments. 230.It is clear that the focus of these amendments was on arrangements very different from the SaaS arrangements that this guideline is considering. Under the Bill, the payments made by the SaaS customer are not “in substance” repayments of loan principal. In t he C ommissioner’s view, imposing the finance lease rules on a SaaS arrangement does not mean the tax treatment that results then accords with the economic substance of the transaction, in the way that it does with the targeted sale and leaseback arrangements. Instead, i t imposes an economic reality that is different to the legal and economic reality of SaaS arrangements that are the focus of this guidance. 231.This raises an interpretive question as to whether to depart, in this instance, from the ordinary meaning of “licence” for the purposes of the lease definition that applies to the finance leases rules? The meaning of legislation is “ascertained from its text and in l ight of its purpose and its context”. 47 The meaning of a provision is the most natural and ordinary meaning of the words in their context and taking into account the pur pose of the provision. 48 However, in Frucor Beverages Ltd v Rio Beverages Ltd, 49 the Court of Appeal departed from the ordinary meaning of the words in s 34 of the Evidence Amendment Act (No 2) 1980, a provision that conferred legal privilege o n pa tent attorneys and their clients. It did so on the basis that the ordinary meaning would give rise to a practical absurdity, and that it was not in accordance with t he i ntention of those that framed the legislation. 232.The court stated: 46 Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill Commentary as reported from the Finance and Expenditure Committee (Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue, September 2004) at 14 47 Legislation Act 2019, s 10(1). 48 JF Burrow and RI Carter, Statute Law in New Zealand (6 th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2021) at 288. 49 Frucor Beverages Ltd v Rio Beverages Ltd \[2001\] 2 NZLR 604 (CA). IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 48 of 56 \[28\]Once satisfied that Parliament intended to confer privilege on both patent attorneys and their clients in respect of the defined protected communications, the Court should strive to arrive at a meaning which gives effect to that intention. The principles of interpretation which assist the Courts in that exercise are well established. They reflect commonsens e p ropositions and should, therefore, be applied sensibly. Thus, it would be less than sensible to presume that Parliament intended to legislate in a manner which is absurd. Indeed, it would be uncharitable, if not presumptuous, for the Courts to approach the task of interpreting Parliament's legislation on any other basis. Thus, the Courts have come to give the concept of “absurdity” a wide meaning, using it to include virtually any result which is unworkable or impracticable, inconvenient, anomalous or illogical, futile or pointless, artificial, or productive of a disproportionate counter-mischief. See Bennio n, S tatutory Interpretation 3rd ed at p 751; see also Laws NZ, Statutes para 181, at p 177. \[29\]The literal interpretation of s 34 fits many of these descriptions. ... In suc h ci rcumstances, and where the main legislative purpose of the statute is clear, the provision should not be reduced to a nullity by a literal adherence to the language, unless the language is “intractable”. This principle recognises the reality that the defect may be due to the “want of skill or knowledge” on the part of the draftsperson (Laws NZ, Statutes para 182, at p 178). The Court w ill strive for an interpretation which will make the Act work in the manner that the Court presumes Parliament must have intended. See Commerc e C ommission v Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd \[1994\] 2 NZLR 421, per Cooke P at pp 424 – 425; Capital Coast Health Ltd v New Zealand Medical Laboratory Workers Union Inc \[1996\] 1 NZLR 7, per Hardie Boys J at p 18; and McDonald v Australian Guarantee Corporation (NZ) Ltd \[1990\] 1 NZLR 227 at p 237. \[30\]Allied to this tenet is the principle that the Courts will endeavour to avoid an interpretation of a section where that interpretation would lead to unworkable or inconvenient consequences. This case illustrates th e und esirable consequences which would follow from a literal interpretation. ... Although in the best of all worlds the problem might be managed, the scope for confusion is limitless. Parliament cannot readily be thought to hav e in tended these impractical consequences. 233.As the response above shows, the Court of Appeal considered that it was possible to depart from the ordinary meaning of a provision if it avoided any result that is unworkable or impracticable, inconvenient, anomalous or illogical, futile or pointless, o r a rtificial or if it produces a disproportionate counter-mischief. 234.In this case, as noted from \[224\], the context and purpose of the reforms that led to the inclusion of the phrase “licence to use intangible property” in the “lease” definitio n s trongly suggest the phrase is limited to exclusive licences where the economic substance of the arrangements in question are those of a sale and leaseback (t he IG 23/01 | 13 September 2023 Page 49 of 56 intended mischief). Support for this interpretative approach comes from the added consideration that unworkable outcomes follow from treating a SaaS arrangement as a finance lease. In particular, such unworkable outcomes relate to the spreading rules and the base price adjustment (BPA) aspects of the financial arrangements rules that follow from treating a SaaS arrangement as a finance lease. 235.Given all of the above, the Commissioner considers that were a court to consider the application of the finance lease rules to a SaaS arrangement, it would conclude that the rules do not apply. On this basis, the Commissioner is satisfied that the rules have no application to the SaaS arrangements that this guideline has considered.

Impact of bankruptcy on ability to bring challenge proceedings
==============================================================

2016 case note – appeal dismissed as the disputant bankrupt, and the CIR correct to assess the appellant as agent for the purposes of the Income Tax and GST Acts.

Case

David Ian Henderson v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1987

Legislative References

Insolvency Act 2006, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985,Ç?¶ÿIncome Tax Act 2007

### Summary

The High Court dismissed an appeal from a Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") decision, upholding the TRA's decision to dismiss a challenge proceeding on the basis that:

1.  The disputant, as a bankrupt, had no standing to bring the proceeding; and
2.  Even if the standing issue was not correct, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") was correct to assess the appellant as agent for the purposes of s HD 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA") and s 61 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act").

### Impact

The decision ultimately turns on the issue of standing however the case also provides some High Court commentary on s 61 of the GST Act and s HD 15 of the ITA in its current form.

### Facts

The appellant was the manager of Property Ventures Limited ("PVL"), which acted as the representative member for a number of companies that were part of a GST group of companies ("the GST Group"). FM1, FM3 and PVIL were included in the GST Group. The appellant was a director of each of FM1, FM3 and PVIL.

By April 2008 PVL and a number of its subsidiaries had substantial outstanding liabilities to creditors (including the Commissioner). PVL was also owed significant amounts by some of its subsidiaries, including FM1, FM3 and PVIL. The directors of PVL decided to sell off properties owned by FM1, FM3 and PVIL to generate funds to pay PVL's debts. To this end the appellant negotiated agreements for sale of the properties to the Christchurch City Council ("the Sale").

Back in July 2006 PVL had provided a financial guarantee to a finance company in relation to the indebtedness of the largest subsidiary in the GST Group. In July 2008 the finance company placed the subsidiary into receivership. 

The directors of PVL were concerned that if the subsidiary's receiver became aware of the sale of the properties to the Council, it would take action to ensure it received the net sale proceeds and appoint receivers to all of PVL's assets.

It was decided to incorporate ILR Holdings Limited ("ILR") and for that company to acquire shares in certain subsidiaries of PVL (including FM1, FM3 and PVIL) and for ILR to acquire, by way of assignment, the intercompany debts owed by those subsidiaries to PVL.

ILR was incorporated on 1 August 2008 with the appellant as its sole director. On the same date, the Council signed sale and purchase agreements with FM1, FM3 and PVIL.

On 4 August 2008 PVL assigned intercompany debts totalling $14,932,498 to ILR. On the same day PVL transferred a number of its shares in FM1, FM3 and PVIL to ILR for nominal consideration. Also on that date, the Commissioner received separate applications from PVL (dated 31 July 2008) seeking to exclude 8 companies from the GST group, including FM1, FM3 and PVIL.

On 6 August 2008 the solicitors acting for FM1, FM3 and PVIL issued GST invoices for the sale of the properties to the Council. The sales settled on 8 August 2008. The proceeds were used to discharge registered mortgages in relation to the properties and pay costs of sale. The net proceeds were then paid to ILR.

The companies were left with no remaining funds or assets left in FM1, FM3 or PVIL to pay the GST liabilities due on 28 September 2008. When FM1, FM3 and PVIL were placed into liquidation in June 2010, their GST liabilities totalled $1,779,568. PVL was placed in liquidation the following month.

On 25 August 2009 the appellant was assessed as agent for the companies' GST liabilities incurred in relation to the Sales. The appellant was adjudicated bankrupt in 2010 and the Commissioner filed a proof of debt in the bankruptcy. The Official Assignee ("OA") never admitted, rejected or quantified any of the claims on the basis that there were no funds available to meet any provable debts.

The appellant then brought a challenge proceeding in the TRA disputing the correctness of the GST assessments made against him personally under s 61 of the GST Act.

The TRA found against the appellant on the basis that as a bankrupt he had no standing to bring the challenge proceeding. In the event that she was wrong on that point, the TRA found the requirements of s 61 of the GST Act were met and the assessment made against the appellant as agent for the companies was therefore correct.

The appellant appealed to the High Court.

### Decision

While the appellant addressed only a few of the grounds raised in the Notice of Appeal at the hearing, the Court in its decision addressed all points raised by the appellant in his Notice of Appeal and at the hearing.

_Application of s 76 of the Insolvency Act 2006 (_"_IA_"_)_

The appellant argued that s 76 of the IA prevented the Commissioner from contesting the challenge as he contended that the challenge was in reality directed specifically to "recover a debt".

Gendall J dismissed this argument and noted that the challenge had in fact been brought by the appellant himself. A separate debt recovery proceeding would be required to enforce payment. 

_A debt owing but payable in the future is not a contingent debt_

The Notice of Appeal raised the issue as to whether the debts were only contingent at the time the appellant was adjudicated bankrupt. The Judge upheld the TRA's finding that a debt which is subject to a challenge is not a contingent debt. His Honour found that the debt was an actual debt presently owing albeit not presently payable due to the challenge being on foot.

This finding was supported by the policy underpinning s 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") and the fact that s 138I(2)B of the TAA provides that the Commissioner may require a disputant to pay all tax in dispute that is subject to a challenge in certain circumstances.

_Challenge proceeding constitutes "property" under s 101 of the IA_

A further ground raised in the Notice of Appeal but which the Judge considered had not been furthered in written or oral submission was an argument that challenge proceedings are not "property" under s 101 of the IA and so does not vest in the OA on adjudication.

Gendall J supported the TRA's reasoning that the term property is defined widely and tended to the view that the TRA did not err in finding that the challenge right was property which vested in the OA. His Honour did not however find it necessary to make a final decision on that aspect given his conclusions on the other grounds of appeal. 

_Right to bring challenge not assigned by the OA to the appellant_

The appellant also chose not to further in his submissions the listed ground of appeal on the issue of whether the OA had assigned the right to issue challenge proceedings to the appellant, or otherwise had consented to the appellant doing so.

His Honour found there was little in this ground and found the TRA was correct in concluding the appellant had no standing to commence the challenge proceedings.

_The existence of an "arrangement"_

Gendall J noted the appellant appeared to argue there was no arrangement either because the transfer of assets satisfied pre-existing debts or because the appellant unilaterally chose to pay ILR.

His Honour found the TRA was correct to determine there was an arrangement entered into and to reject the appellant's arguments. The Court had no doubt the steps were taken as part of an overall plan to strip the companies of funds with the effect of rendering them unable to meet their tax liabilities.

_The effect of the arrangement - companies unable to meet their tax liabilities_

Gendall J was left in no doubt that the inability of the companies to meet their GST debts was the end result of the arrangement and an effect irrespective of any other motives which may have existed in relation to the arrangement. The Court found the TRA was correct to find this requirement under s 61 of the GST Act was satisfied.

_Reasonable conclusion that a purpose of the arrangement was to render the companies unable to meet their tax liabilities_

Gendall J noted this required an objective examination. His Honour found the TRA was correct to find objectively that it was a purpose of the arrangements put in place that each company transacted so the effect would be the company in question could not meet its GST liability.

_Reasonable conclusion that a director making reasonable enquiries could have anticipated the GST liabilities would, or would likely, be required to be met_

Gendall J noted that again the test here is an objective one. The appellant admitted in an Agreed Statement of Facts that he was aware at the time the sale and purchase agreements were entered into that 12.5% GST was required to be added to the agreed purchase prices. The Court found that admission led to little doubt that at the time of the arrangement the appellant had presumably made reasonable enquiries and anticipated that GST liabilities arising at the time of supply of the properties under the sales to the Council would need to be met.

_Conclusion_

The Court found the appellant was unable to establish that the TRA erred in its decision and therefore dismissed the appeal, awarding the Commissioner costs on a 2B basis.

6 March 2019 - The impact of the Tax Working Group recommendations on farmers
=============================================================================

Press releases

Issue date: 6 March 2019

Sir Michael Cullen, Chair of the Tax Working Group (TWG) has responded to a request to comment on recent claims about the effect on farmers of the Group’s recommendations regarding environmental taxes and extending the taxation of capital gains.

“The TWG’s Final Report provides a framework for using environmental taxes, and identifies scope for further development of tax instruments as a tool for addressing some of our most significant environmental challenges. It does not, however, recommend immediate adoption of specific environmental tax instruments. Nor does it make recommendations about specific levels for any environmental taxes, other than to note that the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has under-priced the cost of greenhouse gas emissions.

“In several areas, we highlight issues that would need to be addressed before introducing environmental tax instruments – for example, addressing Maori rights and interests in water abstraction and water pollution. On the taxation of fertiliser specifically, we recommended that it only be introduced if significant progress is not made in the near term on implementing output-based tax instruments or other regulatory measures.

“The TWG also recommends some or all of environmental tax revenue should be used to help fund a transition to a more sustainable economy – for example, by helping farms transition to lower-impact operations. Analysis of the net impact of any environmental tax changes should take this revenue recycling into account.

“Concerning capital gains, the TWG has recommended extending the taxation of capital gains to cover a broader set of assets, including rural property, with tax generally being paid when an asset is sold or transferred. However, it’s important to note that this would only apply to capital gains made after the implementation date which the Government has indicated would be after the next election. Capital gains made before the implementation date would not be taxed.

“The TWG has also recommended that tax would not have to be paid when an asset is transferred or sold in some circumstances, and would instead be deferred until a later sale. These circumstances include death, relationship separation, and reinvestment for businesses with turnover of less than $5 million. For example, if a farmer dies and the property is passed down through inheritance, no tax would be payable at that time.

“The TWG did not recommend a 33 per cent rate for taxing income from capital gains. Instead it recommended that the gains be taxed at a person’s marginal tax rate, like other income. This means that the tax rate a person pays will depend on how much income they earn and their amount of capital gains.

“The TWG also recommended that if a retiring business owner, such as a farmer, sells their business, the first $500,000 of capital gains be taxed at their KiwiSaver tax rate. The top KiwiSaver tax rate is currently 28 per cent.

“Take, for example, a dairy farm purchased for $1.5 million 20 years ago, and worth $3 million at the time the new tax on capital gains comes into effect (excluding the family home). Suppose the farmer sells it 10 years later when they’re retiring, and the value of the farm has increased by around 3% each year so that the farm is sold for $4 million. Suppose also that the farmer made $70,000 of other income in the year of sale. The farmer will have made a $1 million capital gain from the time the new tax comes into effect, which would be taxable. $500,000 of this gain would be taxed at 28% (assuming this was the farmer’s KiwiSaver tax rate in each of the previous two years), while the rest of the capital gains would be taxed at 33% This would leave the farmer with a tax bill of $305,000 from selling their farm for $4 million.

“Of course, the family home will be exempt. Further, if the farm was passed on through inheritance, the tax would be deferred until it was sold.

“It’s great to see people engaging in the debate. These are important matters, so it’s important that people have the full picture” Sir Michael said.

Implementing Government priorities
==================================

The benefits of having policy and administration together in one department were evident this year in how we worked at pace and with key public sector and private sector partners to deliver the new Government’s priorities.

This year, IR took part in a Performance Improvement Review pilot run by the Public Service Commission Te Kawa Mataaho, which you can read about on the page below. One of the capabilities assessed by reviewers was how we respond to Government priorities. Reviewers rated IR as leading and noted “It is an advantage for New Zealand to have the policy function inside the administrator as the dual function can be used to improve policy and delivery”.

[What our stakeholders say](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2024/our-year/immediate-priorities-and-longterm-stewardship/what-our-stakeholders-say)

Mini-Budget 2023
----------------

In December 2023, the Government announced 2 proposals as part of its mini-Budget:

*   Returning the bright-line test to a 2-year period from 1 July 2024. For properties sold on or after 1 July 2024, the bright-line test will only apply if the property is sold within 2 years of purchasing it, and the customer does not meet the exclusions.
*   Removing depreciation deductions for commercial and industrial buildings from 1 April 2024.

A team of people from across IR worked with the Treasury Te Tai Ōhanga to design the policy proposals to ensure they could be administered effectively and efficiently, delivered in the timeframes required and minimised effort for customers. These changes were included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill enacted in March 2024.

The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the changes announced in the mini-Budget, other Government priorities included in this Bill were restoring the ability from 1 April 2024 to claim interest deductions for residential investment properties and introducing a new gaming duty of 12% on online casino gambling from 1 July 2024.

The Bill also included a number of remedial items. We regularly provide advice on updates to legislation, including integrity issues that are identified and where rules do not reflect the policy intent. Ensuring that the rules that govern the tax and social policy programmes we administer are maintained and fit for purpose is part of our product and regulatory stewardship work.

Budget 2024
-----------

IR is delivering a number of changes announced as part of Budget 2024 and have worked at pace and across the public sector to ensure they are implemented on time and as smoothly as possible.

A significant amount of work took place to ensure we were well prepared. Many people from across IR were involved in making sure our systems are ready to support these changes, we’re ready to respond to customers and customers have the information they need.

From 1 July 2024, FamilyBoost was introduced to support households with the cost of early childhood education, with parents able to start claiming support in October. You can read about FamilyBoost here:

From 31 July 2024, thresholds for the bottom 3 personal income tax rates increased, the Independent Earner Tax Credit was extended and thresholds increased for 2 of the 4 types of Working for Families payments—Minimum Family Tax Credit and In Work Family Tax Credit.

From 1 April 2025, other changes will take effect, including an increase in the interest rate charged on overseas-based borrowers’ student loans for late repayments.

Implementing the fair dividend rate and certain equity capital gains exclusions in life insurance
=================================================================================================

2007 legislation covering life insurance and implementing the fair dividend rate and certain equity capital gains exclusions.

**_Sections CX 55, EY 43, EY 43B, EY 43C, HL 2, HL 3, HL 5B, HL 11, HL 14 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_**

Under current life insurance tax rules, a life insurer pays tax on what is commonly referred to as the life office base (which taxes all income from the business of life insurance) and policyholder income (which taxes net investment income accruing to policyholders). Tax paid on the life office base generates imputation credits which can be used to meet the policyholder income tax liability. The amendments discussed below integrate fair dividend rate (FDR) and certain portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules into the life insurance rules.

The FDR treatment of portfolio share interests in non-resident companies other than Australian-listed companies has been extended to a life insurer's policyholder income calculation. The change is intended to correct an anomaly arising from implementing FDR for life insurers.

Life insurers can also elect to have New Zealand and Australian-listed equity gains from investment-linked insurance products excluded from tax. The change allows policyholders with investment-linked life insurance products to access some of the benefits of the new PIE rules.

#### Background

Under recent changes to the taxation of offshore portfolio equity, all portfolio shares with interests of less than 10 percent in non-resident companies other than Australian-listed companies are taxed on a deemed FDR of 5 percent instead of actual returns (dividends, plus realised gains for revenue account holders). The FDR is effective from the beginning of the first income year beginning after 31March 2007. However, entities electing to become PIEs have the option of making the FDR apply from 1October 2007, regardless of their income year.

The FDR is applied to the relevant non-Australian listed foreign equities when calculating tax on the life office base as this is done using standard tax rules. However, tax on policyholder income is calculated on actual returns (through movements in reserves) of those equities rather than by the FDR method. The policyholder income tax calculation therefore required a change so that the FDR applies to both calculations.

While life insurers are allowed to invest through PIEs, a life insurance fund cannot be a PIE itself. If a life insurer invests through a PIE, then realised New Zealand and Australian-listed equity gains are excluded from the life office base calculation by the operation of section CX 55. Some life insurers offer products known as investment-linked funds. These products are similar to managed funds, and should be able to benefit from the Australasian equity gain exclusion. The amendments extend this exclusion to the life office base and policyholder income calculations of these products.

#### Key features

**Life office base**

Section CX 55 extends the exclusion of realised New Zealand and listed Australian equity gains to a life insurer, for the part of the business that is a "portfolio investment-linked life fund".

A "portfolio investment-linked life fund" is defined in section YA 1 to mean a fund where investments are held, subject to a life policy under which benefits are directly linked to the value of investments held in the fund. The portfolio investment-linked life fund must also be eligible to be, and elect to be, and has not ceased the election to be, a portfolio investment entity. New sections HL 3(7), (8), (9), (10) and (11) prescribe the eligibility requirements for life insurers to be a portfolio investment entity. New section HL 5B (1)(c) defines an investor in a portfolio investor entity which is a portfolio investment-linked life fund (not held through a portfolio investor proxy), as "a person whose benefits under the relevant life insurance policy are directly linked to the value of investments held in the portfolio investment-linked life fund".

Life insurers who elect into the new rules will have a deemed disposal of the excluded shares with any tax to pay spread over a period of three years, pursuant to section HL 14 (2).

**Policyholder income**

The policyholder income formula in section EY 43 (1) has been amended by amounts referred to in subsection (5B) as the "FDR adjustment" and in subsection (5C) as the "PILF adjustment". The amount of these adjustments are determined by whether the relevant equities are held on behalf of policyholders in portfolio investment-linked life funds, or in other life insurance products.

For the FDR adjustment, FDR income attributed from portfolio investment entity investments other than by portfolio investment-linked life funds are excluded from policyholder income. For the PILF adjustment, FDR income and New Zealand and Australian-listed equity gains derived by portfolio investment-linked life funds are also excluded.

**FDR adjustment**

New section EY 43B describes the "FDR adjustment" for life insurance savings products other than for those in portfolio investment-linked life funds with an attributing interest in a FIF, or a "portfolio tax rate entity" that the life insurer has directly or indirectly invested in, and for which the FDR is used. These include traditional participating life insurance savings products such as whole of life and endowment policies, and also investment-linked products which the life insurer has not elected to be portfolio investment-linked life funds.

The definition of a "portfolio tax rate entity" in section YA 1 has been amended to not include a portfolio investment-linked life fund. For the purposes of section EY 43B (1), subsection (2) provides that a life insurer is treated as indirectly investing in a portfolio tax rate entity (PTRE A) when a portfolio tax rate entity has invested in PTRE A and the investments may be traced back through an unbroken chain of investments in portfolio tax rate entities to a direct investment by the life insurer in a portfolio tax rate entity.

The life insurer may calculate the FDR adjustment either under the formula contained in subsection (5), or based on adjustments of actual amounts credited. The formula in subsection (5) is:

0.6 x (FIF result - FDR income)

"FIF result" is defined in subsection (7) as the life insurer's gains and losses for the income year, for the property, calculated using accepted accounting practice.

"FDR income", which is defined in subsection (8), refers to the amount of FDR income on that property, calculated using any reasonable method for the information available to the life insurer. It will be the same amount that was calculated in the life insurer's life office base income calculation.

The "0.6 factor" is a typical amount of the income included from these products in the annual policyholder base calculation and is used to minimise compliance costs.

As the intention of the provision is to ensure that the correct amount of policyholder income is taxed, as an alternative the life insurer can, using any reasonable method for the information available to the life insurer, use actual amounts credited to actuarial reserves of the relevant income after allowing for the FDR method to be applied. As a practical matter, it is anticipated that life insurers would adopt this approach rather than the formula in subsection (5), except if the actual allocation cannot be accurately calculated or if the compliance costs to do so would be material. The allocation method adopted must be used consistently between income years to prevent artificially maximising the policyholder income exclusion.

**PILF adjustment**

New section EY 43C (1) to (9) prescribes the "PILF adjustment" for assets held in a portfolio investment entity to the extent to which property that the life insurer holds to support actuarial reserves for a portfolio investment-linked life fund is:

*   an attributing interest in a FIF held by the life insurer directly or by a portfolio tax rate entity that the life insurer has invested in directly or indirectly, and for which the life insurer or portfolio tax rate entity uses the FDR; or
*   shares described in section CX 55 (Proceeds from certain disposals by portfolio investment entities or New Zealand Superannuation Fund).

In using the policyholder income formula, the life insurer can choose to calculate the PILF adjustment by either using the formula in subsection (5) or based on adjustments of actual amounts credited. The formula in subsection (5) is:

0.9 x (FIF result - FDR income) + 0.9 excluded shares

The part of the formula (FIF result - FDR income) is effectively the same as discussed earlier. The adjustment factor of 0.9 reflects the typical amount of income included in policyholder income with these products.

Also excluded from the calculation of policyholder income is 0.9 of "excluded shares". These are defined in subsection (9) and include realised gains or losses of New Zealand and listed Australian equities that were excluded from the calculation of tax under the life office base income calculation, in addition to unrealised gains or losses on those equities, but excludes dividends or distributions from these shares other than from a portfolio tax rate entity to which section CX 56 (2) applies.

Life insurers can, using any reasonable method for the information available to the life insurer, use the actual amounts credited to actuarial reserves of the products, after allowing for the FDR method and dividends or distributions from New Zealand and Australian-listed equities other than a distribution from a portfolio tax rate entity to which section CX 56 (2) (Portfolio investor allocated income and distributions of income by portfolio investment entities) applies. The allocation method adopted must be used consistently between income years.

**Other amendments**

Consequential amendments for portfolio investment-linked life funds are contained in sections HL 2(2), HL 3 and HL 11(2B), and to the definitions in section YA 1 for "portfolio investment entity", "portfolio listed company" and "portfolio tax rate entity".

#### Application date

The new sections are treated as coming into force on 1October 2007.

The FDR adjustments and PILF adjustments will be effective from:

*   the beginning of the 2008-09 income year; or
*   on or after 1 October 2007, if an election by the life insurer to do so is received by the Commissioner before 1 April 2008; or
*   an income year beginning on or after 1 April 2007 if an election by the life insurer to do so is received by the Commissioner before 1 April 2008.

However, a life insurer can choose that the adjustments do not apply to them by furnishing a return of income for the 2008-09 tax year that ignores the adjustments.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Companies use an imputation credit account (ICA) to keep track of how much tax they've paid and how much tax they’ve passed on to shareholders or had refunded to them.

The balance of the ICA records how much credit for that tax the company can pass on to shareholders.

An ICA is a memorandum or record keeping account. It's used to complete the company’s imputation returns for each tax year.

Organisations that must keep an ICA
-----------------------------------

Most New Zealand resident companies need to keep an ICA. Any organisation that's treated as a company for income tax purposes also needs to keep one. This includes:

*   unit trusts
*   cooperative companies
*   life insurance companies
*   statutory producer boards
*   group investment funds (except for certain income).

Organisations that do not have to keep an ICA
---------------------------------------------

You do not need to keep an ICA if you're a:

*   company that is not resident in New Zealand
*   company that is resident in New Zealand, but treated as non-resident because of a double tax agreement (with the exception of the Australian double tax agreement from 15 March 2017)
*   trustee company (except any group investment funds deriving category A income)
*   company whose constitution prevents their income or property being distributed to any proprietor, member or shareholder
*   local authority
*   subsidiary company of the Accident Compensation Corporation to which section 266 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 applies
*   Māori authority
*   look-through company (LTC).

### Exceptions to not having to keep an ICA

If you do not have to pay tax on any of your company's income - you're exempt - you generally will not need to keep an ICA. The exception to this is if the income is exempt because it's one of the following:

*   foreign dividends derived by a New Zealand resident-company or trustee of a group investment fund
*   dividends paid before 1 April 1996 to a unit trust manager or a trustee or manager of a group investment fund
*   inter-company dividends between companies in a 100% commonly owned group.

Our system posts imputation financial transactions to a company’s income tax account.

Imputation return – IR4J with a debit balance
---------------------------------------------

We’ll post the further income tax (FIT) assessment value plus the 10% imputation penalty tax to the income tax filing period where the ICA debit balance is.

Our system then synchronises what the company owes for FIT with what it owes for income tax in the following period reducing that liability. For example, provisional tax amounts before terminal tax. Payment for FIT owing also covers any income tax owing. FIT reduces what is owed in the following period using the earliest due date first.

If the company does not owe provisional tax in the following period, then the terminal tax owing reduces when it files the following year’s income tax return.

Example: Reducing what the company owes for FIT

You file the IR4J for year ended 31 March 2022 with a debit closing balance of $3,000. The FIT amount and 10% imputation penalty posts into the 2022  income tax period.

The company has 3 provisional tax instalments of $2,000 each to pay for the 31 March 2023 year.

The first instalment is reduced to $0 ($2,000 provisional tax less $2,000 FIT). The second instalment is reduced to $1,000 ($2,000 provisional tax less $1,000 FIT). The last instalment remains $2,000.

Imputation credits and transfers
================================

2005 amendment covering imputation credits and transfers, and the transfer rules in the Income Tax Act.

**_Section MD 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994_**

### Introduction

Taxpayers can elect that a credit arises to the imputation credit account (ICA) or dividend withholding payment account (DWPA) in certain circumstances when overpaid tax was transferred before the comprehensive transfer rules in the Income Tax Act came into effect.

### Background

The company imputation system ensures that company shareholders are not taxed twice on company income - once in the hands of the company, and again when profits are distributed as dividends.

Briefly, companies keep an ICA which records the tax payments made by the company as credits and amounts allocated to dividends as debits. If a company's ICA has a debit balance at 31 March in any year, the company is liable to pay further income tax. This ensures that imputation credits attached to dividends do not exceed the net amounts of tax paid by the company.

To ensure that imputation credits are associated with whoever owns the company when the tax is paid, there is a "continuity debit" to the ICA whenever there is a significant change in ownership (direct or indirect) of the company. If a company that has suffered a breach in continuity is also due a tax refund for a tax overpayment that arose before the continuity breach, this refund (to the extent of the debit) can still be paid without further affecting the ICA balance.

Similar rules apply to withholding payments.

Section MD 4 (which was repealed in 2003) ensured that a taxpayer could not take undue advantage of the imputation or dividend withholding payment rules when transferring overpaid income tax or dividend withholding payment to another year or to another tax type (such as PAYE or GST) or to another taxpayer. However, where there had been a prior breach in shareholder continuity, section MD 4 did not work appropriately.

##### Example

Company A makes an income tax payment of $100, taking the ICA balance to $100. Subsequently, there is a breach of shareholder continuity, leading to a debit in the ICA. Later it is determined that the $100 is an overpayment and a refund is sought. After the overpaid tax is refunded, the company pays the amount back to Inland Revenue (say, in satisfaction of the next provisional tax payment due).

For the purposes of determining whether a refund can be made, the balance in the ICA can be increased by the breach of continuity debit of $100 under section MD 2(4). Therefore the refund can be made in this case.

A second debit relating to the refund is recorded only if the refund is greater than the breach in continuity debit (section ME 5(1)(e)(iii)). Therefore no further debit will arise to the ICA when the refund is made.

When the refund has been subsequently paid back to Inland Revenue for offset against the next provisional tax liability, a credit will arise in the ICA for the payment.

| Imputation credit account |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **_Transaction_** | **_Debit_** | **_Credit_** | **_Balance_** |
| Payment |     | $100 | $100 Cr |
| Breach in shareholder continuity | $100 |     | Nil |
| Refund | Nil |     | Nil |
| Payment of provisional tax |     | $100 | $100 Cr |
| Before this amendment, section MD 4 denied the second imputation credit if a transfer was made instead of a refund and payment. |     |     |     |

Generic transfer rules introduced in 2002 provide a better result than section MD 4 did, so section MD 4 was repealed by the Taxation, (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. The issue described above, however, continued to exist for transfers made before the section was repealed.

### Key features

The now repealed section MD 4 provided that a credit did not arise to the ICA or DWPA if overpaid tax was transferred. New subsections (2) and (3) have been added to section MD 4 to provide for a credit (a permitted credit) to arise in some circumstances.

Section MD 4(2) provides that section MD 4(1) does not prevent a permitted credit if:

*   the transferred tax could have been refunded instead of transferred; and
*   between the time when the tax which gave rise to the overpayment was paid and the date of the request for the transfer, the company suffered a breach in shareholder continuity and a debit arose accordingly to the ICA or DWPA; and
*   the taxpayer elects that the permitted credit arises.

The permitted credit arises under section ME 4(1)(a) or section MG 4(1)(a) as tax or dividend withholding payment "paid". For the purposes of those sections "paid" includes "distributed, credited, or dealt with in the interest of" and, therefore, includes an amount transferred.

New subsection (3) provides that the amount of the permitted credit is the amount transferred less the amount of the debit that would have arisen under section ME 5(1)(e) if the overpayment had been refunded.

### Application date

The amendment has effect from the start of the 1997-98 year (when section MD 4 was introduced) to the date when section MD 4 was repealed (1 April 2003).

### Detailed analysis

A permitted credit can arise to an ICA if section MD 4(2) is satisfied. Section MD 4(2) is satisfied if:

*   a company was entitled to a refund of overpaid income tax (section MD 2(4)); and
*   the overpaid tax was transferred, either at the taxpayer's request or on Inland Revenue's initiative; and
*   a breach of shareholder continuity occurred between the time when the tax that led to the overpayment was paid and the time the transfer was made; and
*   a credit would have arisen to the ICA if the:
    *   overpayment had been refunded;
    *   and the refunded amount had been repaid in satisfaction of a tax liability; and
*   the company requests that section MD 4(2) and (3) apply to the transfer.

New subsection (3) provides that the amount of the permitted credit is the amount transferred less the amount of the debit that would have arisen under section ME 5(1)(e) if the overpayment had been refunded.

##### Example

Company B's ICA balance at 31 March 2000 is $100. A breach in shareholder continuity occurs on 30 June 2000. As a result, a debit arises to the ICA of $100 and the ICA balance is now nil.

Company B pays tax of $50 on 7 July 2000, bringing the ICA balance to $50.

On 30 April 2001 an income tax overpayment of $150, which arose before the breach in shareholder continuity, is identified. Company B applied to have $150 transferred to 2002 provisional tax. This was done, but under section MD 4, as it applied in 2001, no credit arose to the ICA for the transfer. At that stage there was no provision that allowed a debit to arise relating to a transfer of overpaid tax.

In 2004, Company B requests that subsections MD4(2) and (3) be applied.

Under section MD 4(3) the permitted credit will be the amount transferred less the debit that would have arisen if the amount transferred had been refunded instead of transferred. Section ME 5(1)(e)(iii) provides that a debit arises to the ICA when a refund is made, except to the extent of a debit that arose upon a previous breach in continuity.

In the example, a previous debit of $100 arose upon a breach of continuity. Therefore, had $150 been refunded, the debit that would have arisen to the ICA would have been $50. Accordingly, the permitted credit will be the amount transferred ($150) less the debit that would have arisen under section ME5(1)(e)(iii) if the transferred tax had been refunded ($50). The permitted credit is, therefore, $100. Entries in the ICA would be:

| Imputation credit account |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **_Transaction_** | **_Debit_** | **_Credit_** | **_Balance_** |
| Balance 31 March 2000 |     |     | $100 Cr |
| Breach in shareholder continuity | $100 |     | Nil |
| Payment 7 July 2000 |     | $50 | $50 Cr |
| Transfer | Nil |     | $50 Cr |
| Permitted credit |     | $100 | $150 Cr |
| This is the result that would have occurred had the overpaid tax been refunded and repaid. |     |     |     |

In-work tax credit
==================

Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 amends the Working for Families in-work tax credit.

_Sections MA 7, MD 9 and MD 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Some shareholder employees work full-time for their company but do not pay themselves a wage because, for example, the company has made a loss for that year or has restricted cashflow. Under the previous full-time earner requirements, such a shareholder-employee would not qualify for the in-work tax credit as they did not receive and derive income as set out in section MD 9(1). This is in contrast to other business owners, such as partners in a partnership or a sole trader, in the same situation, who do qualify for the in-work tax credit. Provided their business derives some gross income they will meet the criteria of section MD 9(1) even if they do not pay themselves a wage.

A person can receive weekly compensation as a surviving spouse or partner of a deceased claimant under clause 66 of schedule 1 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001. Section MA 7(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a person receiving weekly compensation as a result of an incapacity is deemed to still be employed for the purpose of claiming the in-work tax credit. It was not clear that this provision applied when a person is a surviving spouse.

Furthermore, the wording in section MD 9 required a person to be receiving income from a work activity and deriving income or compensation as set out in section MD 9(2), (3) or (4). While an injured person receiving weekly compensation would meet this requirement, it was unclear that a surviving spouse would qualify as the weekly compensation they receive is not from their work activity but from the deceased spouse's work activity.

### Key features

The Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to remove the reference to a person having to receive income from a work activity from the requirements of the in-work tax credit in section MD 9(1). A person will qualify for the in-work tax credit when they are a full-time earner, as defined in section MA 7, and they:

*   derive income as set out in subsections (2) and (3) of section MD 9 as a full-time earner; or
*   derive an amount of compensation as described in subsection (4) of section MD 9; or
*   are a major shareholder in a close company in which they are a full-time earner, and the company derives gross income in the income year.

Section MA 7 (definition of full-time earner) has been clarified to ensure that a person who is receiving ACC weekly compensation payments as a surviving spouse or partner of a deceased claimant meets the full-time earner definition if the deceased claimant or the couple together would have qualified before the accident causing death. This will allow the surviving spouse to continue to claim the in-work tax credit if they meet all other requirements.

### Detailed analysis

#### Major shareholder-employee of a close company

Section MD 9(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to allow a major shareholder employed but unpaid by a close company to meet the full-time earner requirement of the in-work tax credit. A major shareholder who is a full-time earner in relation to a close company will not have to meet the requirement to derive income as set out in section MD 9(2). Instead, the close company they are a major shareholder in and work for must derive gross income in the income year. This aligns the treatment of shareholder employees and other business owners, such as partners in a partnership.

The major shareholder will still be required to meet all the other requirements for the in-work tax credit as set out in sections MD 5 to MD 8 relating to age, care of a dependent child, residence and not receiving a benefit. The person will also be required to meet the required hours of a full-time earner as set out in section MA 7. A full-time earner is a person who is normally employed for at least 20 hours a week, if they are a sole parent, or at least 30 hours a week in combination with a spouse, civil union or de facto partner.

The terms "major shareholder" and "close company" are defined in section YA 1. A major shareholder is a person who owns, or has the right to acquire, or power to control, at least 10% of the ordinary shares or voting rights, or control of the company. A close company means a company in which five or fewer natural persons hold more than 50% of the interests; or if a market value circumstance exists, five or fewer natural persons hold more than 50% of the market value interests. All natural persons (individuals) associated at the time are treated as one natural person.

Consequential amendments have been made to section MD 10, which relates to the calculation of the in-work tax credit.

#### ACC survivor spouse

Section MA 7, which defines "a full-time earner", has been amended to provide that a person receiving ACC weekly compensation as a surviving spouse or partner of a deceased claimant is treated as being employed, during the week in which compensation is paid, for the number of hours that the deceased claimant would have been employed previously but for their accident causing death. The deceased spouse's hours are added to the surviving spouse's own hours (if any) to determine if they meet the full-time earner test.

Section MD 9, which contains the full-time earner requirements to qualify for an in-work tax credit, has been amended to remove the requirement for the full-time earner to be receiving income directly from a "work activity". This will allow a surviving spouse to meet the requirements of the section if they derive income as set out in section MD 9(2), which includes ACC weekly compensation payments.

These changes are consistent with the original policy intention of the in-work tax credit. The issue was clearer before the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2007, which is why the clarifying amendment applies from 1 April 2008. A person receiving ACC weekly compensation, including a surviving spouse of a deceased claimant, should continue to receive the in-work tax credit the family previously qualified for, when the person or their spouse is no longer able to work caused by incapacity.

### Application date(s)

The changes relating to an ACC surviving spouse are effective from 1 April 2008.

The changes relating to a major shareholder of a close company are effective from 1 April 2011.

OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework Two-Pillars Solution
=================================================

The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (IF) has agreed  to develop a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. New Zealand is a member of the OECD and IF. Further details on the two-pillar solution can be found on the OECD website.

[Statement on a Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy – 8 October 2021 - OECD](https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/statement-on-a-two-pillar-solution-to-address-the-tax-challenges-arising-from-the-digitalisation-of-the-economy-october-2021.htm "Statement on a Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy – 8 October 2021 - OECD ")

Amount A of Pillar One
----------------------

Amount A of Pillar One co-ordinates a reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions with respect to a share of the profits of the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in their markets, regardless of their physical presence. 

Amount A has not yet been finalised. Further information is available on the OECD website.

[OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework releases new multilateral convention to address tax challenges of globalisation and digitalisation - OECD](https://www.oecd.org/tax/inclusive-framework-releases-new-multilateral-convention-to-address-tax-challenges-of-globalisation-and-digitalisation.htm#:~:text=Amount%20A%20of%20Pillar%20One%20co%2Dordinates%20a%20reallocation%20of,regardless%20of%20their%20physical%20presence. "OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework releases new multilateral convention to address tax challenges of globalisation and digitalisation - OECD")

Amount B of Pillar One
----------------------

Amount B of Pillar One provides an optional simplified and streamlined transfer pricing approach that jurisdictions may opt to apply to in-country baseline marketing and distribution activities for fiscal years commencing on or after 1 January 2025. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS’s report on Amount B of Pillar One is available on the OECD website.

[Report on Amount B of Pillar One - OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/pillar-one-amount-b_21ea168b-en.html)

New Zealand has not opted to apply this approach, as such its introduction does not change our current rules or practice.  Our existing simplification measure for small foreign-owned wholesale distributors remains available, and existing transfer pricing rules apply in all other cases.

[Simplification measures for transfer pricing](/international-tax/business/transfer-pricing/simplification-measures)

### Foreign-owned distributors operating in New Zealand

Arm’s length outcomes for foreign-owned distributors operating in New Zealand must continue to be determined in accordance with existing transfer pricing approaches. 

Consistent with paragraph 6 of the approach, in New Zealand the approach will not be treated as providing an arm’s length outcome (including for the purposes of Article 9 of the Model Tax Convention and by extension Article 25).  Conforming changes to the Model Tax Convention commentary provide tax certainty in this respect. Therefore the application of the approach by foreign-owned distributors operating in New Zealand:

*   will not be considered compliant with New Zealand’s domestic transfer pricing rules
*   will not discharge the taxpayer’s burden of proof in respect of those rules and
*   will expose the taxpayer to shortfall penalties.

To the extent that double taxation arises from a transfer pricing adjustment, relief will not be provided based on the application of the approach consistent with paragraph 77 of the approach and the conforming changes to the Model Tax Convention commentary.

Regard must also be had to paragraph 43 of the approach, which confirms that the approach has no bearing on existing transfer pricing and does not change any existing OECD guidance. The methodology and guidance used in the approach, including all design elements and defined terms, are specific to the approach. No element or term should be construed as implying that it would be acceptable under existing transfer pricing rules. That is, existing transfer pricing rules must be applied without any reference to the approach.

### New Zealand-owned distributors operating offshore

A foreign jurisdiction may opt to apply the approach to distributors operating in its jurisdiction. Where a New Zealand-owned distributor operates in a jurisdiction that applies the approach, it must still apply existing transfer pricing approaches to the relevant transaction in respect of its New Zealand obligations. To the extent New Zealand has a treaty with the relevant jurisdiction, and double taxation arises from a transfer pricing adjustment, relief will not be provided based on the application of the approach consistent with paragraph 77 of the approach and the conforming changes to the Model Tax Convention commentary.

We note that the OECD is continuing work on the development of a political commitment to respect the application of the approach when it is applied by low-capacity jurisdictions. This will include the development of a list of low-capacity jurisdictions. Further information will be provided once the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework’s work is completed.

Pillar Two
----------

The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Act (the Amendment Act) gives legislative effect in New Zealand to Pillar Two (the GloBE rules) through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA) and Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The term used in the ITA to describe New Zealand’s GloBE rules is the ‘applied global anti-base erosion rules’ (applied GloBE rules), and the term used for tax imposed under the applied GloBE rules is ‘multinational top-up tax’. 

The applied GloBE rules consist of an Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) – including a domestic IIR (DIIR) – and an Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR). 

The IIR and UTPR components of the applied GloBE rules apply for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. The DIIR component of the rules applies for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2026.

For more information on the applied GloBE rules, please refer to the Tax Information Bulletin 

[Tax Technical: TIB Vol 25 No 4, May 4 2024](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-36---2024/tib-vol36-no4)

#### Visual

The video title Business Basics Income and provisional tax slides in from the left.

The title slides to the right of the screen and is replaced by a person sitting at a desk with a laptop. File folders, a desk lamp and a mug also appear on the table. A clock ticks on the wall. 3 lights hang from the roof and there is a potted plant on both sides of the desk.

Two circles appear above the person’s head, 1 has a “Income tax” in the middle of it, the other has “Provisional tax”.

#### Audio

**Music**

Easy listening style music plays throughout the entire video.

**Narrator**

Are you in business for yourself?

In this video we’ll explain how income tax works.

You'll also find out if you have to pay provisional tax, a way of paying your income tax throughout the year.

* * *

#### Visual

Carolyn appears with a camera in her hand and photography equipment surrounds her.

A circle appears with $98,000 inside it, the figure is then replaced by an Income tax return. Two circles with dollar symbols appear on the tax return, 1 is smooth and represents gross income, the other is spikey and represents expenses. The expenses are removed from the gross income. Expenses of $32,000 are deducted from the gross income of $98,000, leaving a total net profit of $66,000.

$98,000 turns into “Net profit” and 2 more circles appear, 1 has “salary” in it, the other “wage” showing these are included in your net profit.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Meet Carolyn, she's a photographer who's just started working for herself as a sole trader.

In her first year, Carolyn made gross sales of 98,000 dollars.

Regardless of what business structure is chosen, when you file your income tax return, you record your gross sales then deduct your business expenses.

Carolyn's business expenses for the year came to 32,000 dollars.

After deducting her expenses, Carolyn has made a net profit of 66,000 dollars.

You only pay income tax on your taxable income, that’s your net profit plus any other income you might earn like a salary or wage.

Let's see what this means for Carolyn as a sole trader.

* * *

#### Visual

Carolyn stands next to a graph which ranges from $0 to $66,000. The graph is separated into 3 income tax bands:

1.  Income between $0 and $14,000.  
    In this band the tax rate of 10.5%, and $1,470 (the tax on the first $14,000 of income) are shown.
2.  $14,001 to $48,000.  
    In this band the tax rate of 17.5%, and $5,950 (the tax on the next $33,000 of Carolyn’s income) are shown.
3.  $48,001 to $66,000.  
    In this band the tax rate of 30%, and $5,400 (the tax on the last $18,000 of Carolyn’s income) are shown.

Carolyn’s total income tax for the year of $12,820 is shown.

Carolyn is replaced by an image of a building, and the graph only has 1 band between $0 and $66,000. The tax rate of 28% is shown, which is the flat tax rate for companies. The total income tax for the year of $18,480 is shown.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Carolyn’s taxable income is split into portions taxed at different rates.

The first 14,000 dollars of her 66,000 dollar taxable income is taxed at 10.5%, so she'll pay tax of 1,470 dollars on this part of her income.

Income from 14,001 dollars to 48,000 dollars is taxed at 17.5%.

Carolyn has about $34,000 here so she’ll pay tax of about 5,950 dollars on this part of her income.

The remaining income 48,001 dollars to 66,000 dollars is taxed at 30%.

Carolyn has about 18,000 dollars here so she pays about 5,400 on this part of her income.

Carolyn's total income tax for the year is 12,820 dollars.

That's how income tax works for sole traders.

For companies, it's a bit different.

A company's taxable income is taxed at a flat rate of 28%.

This would work out to be 18,480 dollars in this example, thousands more than what Carolyn pays as a sole trader.

So that's income tax, now let's look at provisional tax.

* * *

#### Visual

A horizontal timeline is shown and separated into 3 segments. A circle with a dollar symbol appears in each segment indicating 3 provisional tax payments. The circles merge together and grow in size, then slide to the right beyond the timeline. This shows how it is easier to pay tax in smaller instalments rather than 1 big bill.

A calendar appears and flicks back from 2019, to 2018, and 2017 before disappearing.

A circle with a question mark appears to ask who has to pay provisional tax. An Income tax return appears to the right of the circle, showing anyone with tax to pay of more than $5,000, after tax credits are deducted from your net proft, has to pay provisional tax the following year.

The question mark is replaced by “Standard option”. A new circle with “Estimation option” slides to the right from behind the first circle. These are the 2 main ways to calculate provisional tax.

A new circle appears on the left with “Accounting Income Method” in it. The words are replaced by a laptop showing a profit and loss graph indicating provisional tax is only paid when a profit is made.

A new circle appears on the right with “GST ratio option” in it. The words are replaced by a laptop showing 2 circles with dollar symbols in them. The circles merge to form a sun suggesting seasonal income during warmer months.

Our web address, ird.govt.nz, slides from left to right.

**Narrator**

Provisional tax isn’t a separate tax, it’s a way of paying your income tax throughout the year, usually across 3 instalments.

Provisional tax helps you spread the load rather than paying all your income tax in one go.

The amount you pay is generally based on earlier years.

Who has to pay provisional tax?

Anyone who has tax to pay of more than 5,000 dollars at the end of the tax year after subtracting most types of tax credits.

There are 2 main ways to calculate provisional tax.

The standard option, and the estimation option.

There’s also the Accounting Income Method, also known as AIM.

It’s the provisional tax option that uses accounting software to work out your payments throughout the year so you only pay tax when you make a profit.

And there’s the ratio option which lets you match your provisional tax payments with your business cashflow, which is useful if your income varies or you have seasonal income.

Go to ird.govt.nz to learn more about the standard option, estimation option, AIM, and the ratio option.

#### Visual

The standard option circle grows, a calendar displaying “Previous year” and “+5%” are shown.

Carolyn appears on the right of the screen with her camera. The equation working out Carolyn’s provisional tax for the following year is displayed. $12,820 + 5% = $13,461.

A timeline is shown under the equation, split into 3 segments. The total provisional tax is then divided by 3 to get the instalment for each provisional tax payment and $4,487 is shown in each segment of the timeline.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

If you choose the standard option, your provisional tax equals your previous year's income tax plus 5%.

Here’s an example of calculating your provisional tax using the standard option.

Carolyn's income tax payable was 12,820 dollars so her provisional tax for this second year is 5% more, 13,461 dollars.

She divides by 3 to give the amount of each instalment.

#### Visual

The estimation option circle replaces the standard option circle. A baby appears in Carolyn’s arms and a new circle with a downward arrow is shown indicating Carolyn will be spending less time on her business next year. The downward arrow is replaced by a dollar symbol and then a calculator.

Carolyn’s estimated income for her 2nd year of $36,000 is displayed. The total tax to pay of $5,320 is shown under the total income. A horizontal timeline is shown and separated into 3 segments. A circle with a dollar symbol appears in each segment indicating 3 provisional tax payments. The first 2 segments display provisional tax instalment payments of $1,773, and the 3rd segment shows $1,774.

The 4 provisional tax options are shown again, Accounting Income Method, standard option, estimation option, and GST ratio option. An exclamation mark is shown to make sure you know to be careful with using the estimation option as penalties and interest can be charged if the estimate is too low.

The ratio option circle pulses and a new circle pops up from behind it with “Must be GST registered” in it.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

If you think your income for the coming year will drop and you don’t want to overpay, you might choose the estimation option instead.

Suppose Carolyn has a baby and she plans to spend less time working in her business during her second year.

She expects her income will drop as a result, so she chooses the estimation method to calculate her provisional tax after preparing a budget.

Carolyn works out her taxable income for year 2 will be 36,000 dollars.

Tax on 36,000 dollars is 5,320 dollars.

Carolyn divides by 3 and sees that for her second year of business she'll need to pay 3 provisional tax instalments. Two provisional tax instalments of 1,773 dollars and 1 instalment of 1,774 dollars.

Estimate your provisional tax carefully.

Interest and penalties may be charged if your estimate is too low.

As mentioned earlier, the ratio option is useful if your income varies or you have seasonal income.

#### Visual

Crosses appear in the standard option, estimation option, and GST ratio option circles as you generally do not need to pay provisional tax in your first year of business. A dollar symbol and upward arrow appear in the Accounting Income Method circle as you may pay provisional tax in your first year if you make a profit.

The scene is split into 2 with year 1 on the left and year 2 on the right. A circle with year 1 tax return is shown in year 1. A calendar showing 7 February is displayed in year 2 indicating this is when the tax for year 1 is usually due to be paid. The year 1 tax return moves to year 2 showing year 1 tax and year 2 provisional tax are being paid in the same year. A big tick appears on the screen as making sure you budget for these payments will help you get tax right from the start.

The year 1 tax return moves back to the year 1 side of the screen, it leaves behind small circles with dollar symbols in them indicating voluntary tax payments are a great way to help ease the pressure of a big tax bill.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

When do you pay provisional tax in instalments?

Paying tax in your first year of business is a bit different.

If you use the standard, estimation or ratio options, you will not need to pay provisional tax during your first year of business.

If you use the accounting income method, or AIM, you’ll only pay provisional tax when you make a profit, even during your first year.

That’s not to say your first year in business is tax free.

Any income tax for your first year in business is usually due by 7 February in your second year of business.

So you could be paying income tax for your first year of business while also having to pay provisional tax for your second year of business.

This is why it’s important to budget for tax right from the start.

To help spread the cost, you can choose to make voluntary payments of tax during your first year of business, you might even be able to get an early payment discount if you do this.

#### Visual

A timeline is displayed, starting with the end of the first tax year on 31 March. The provisional tax instalment due dates are then displayed on the timeline:

1.  28 August.
2.  15 January.
3.  7 May.

A circle with a dollar sign appears from behind each provisional tax payment date to show that Carolyn budgeted for her payments. A big exclamation mark is shown as interest and penalties may be charged if a payment is not made in full or on time.

The exclamation mark is replaced by an envelope as you should contact us before the payment due date if you know you’re going to struggle meeting a payment.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Let's look at a timeline for instalment payments from your second year onwards.

If you have the standard balance date of thirty-first of March, your first instalment each year must be paid by the twenty-eighth of August, your second by the fifteenth of January and your third and final by the seventh of May.

Please include your provisional tax payments in your budget so you can pay in full and on time.

Interest and penalties may be charged on any late payments.

If you’re anticipating difficulty paying, contact us before the due date.

Tatauria tō moniwhiwhi me ō utu rawa whitirangi Working out your cryptoasset income and expenses
================================================================================================

You need to work out your cryptoasset income and expenses before you can work out your [net income (or loss)](/api/glossary/item?id={AFC42BB7-DFA7-4488-8FC4-04554B858ACC})
 for your income tax return.

There are further rules you need to be aware of if your cryptoassets are [trading stock](/api/glossary/item?id={043388F8-C02F-4070-8DE0-A534FFDE8412})
.

Cryptoasset income
------------------

Your cryptoasset income might include income from:

*   mining cryptoassets (such as block rewards and transaction fees, including income from a mining pool)
*   [staking](/api/glossary/item?id={04254A7C-6D31-495D-B22B-B45D668A6DEE})
     cryptoassets or using a [staking-as-a-service](/api/glossary/item?id={34B12419-62AE-4A31-B6B1-CCC7D6D0A674})
     provider
*   lending cryptoassets to another person (including crypto 'interest')
*   selling or exchanging cryptoassets (including mining rewards)
*   getting paid in cryptoassets for goods or services you provide.

Usually these amounts are income in the income year they are received.

If you hold cryptoassets as trading stock, your income also includes the closing value of your trading stock. This is the value of the cryptoassets you hold as trading stock at the end of the income year.

Cryptoasset expenses
--------------------

The type of expenses you can claim will depend on whether you are in business or not. However, you can generally deduct the following expenses from your cryptoasset income.

*   The cost of your cryptoassets. This is the amount you paid for your cryptoassets including any transaction fees.
*   Depreciation of capital assets such as computer hardware or software.
*   Interest charged on money you’ve borrowed to buy your cryptoassets (only if any profit from their sale is taxable).
*   Other expenses in relation to your cryptoasset activity. For example, if you're a miner this could include electricity or rental costs.

If you hold cryptoassets as trading stock, your expenses also include the opening value of your trading stock. This is generally the same as the closing value of your trading stock at the end of the previous year. If it’s your first year in business you may not have opening stock.

You can usually claim a deduction in the income year you incur the expense. Generally this is when you make a payment. If you do not hold cryptoassets as trading stock, the deduction for the cost of cryptoassets is only available when you sell or exchange them.

### The cost of cryptoassets that are not trading stock

If your cryptoassets are not trading stock it can be difficult to determine the cost of your cryptoassets at the time you sell them.

This is because it’s not always possible to separately identify the cryptoassets you sell when you own multiple units of the same type which you received at different times and prices.

If you cannot separately identify your cryptoassets you can use either of these methods to allocate a cost to them:

*   first-in first-out (FIFO)
*   weighted average cost (WAC).

You cannot use the last-in first-out (LIFO) method.

You’ll then be able to work out a cost for the cryptoasset you sold or exchanged. You may need to talk to a tax advisor or accountant to find out how to do this.

You must use the same method consistently from year to year and keep records of the method you use.

### The cost of cryptoassets if you’re a miner or you accept payment in cryptoassets

Sometimes you might have taxable income when you receive cryptoassets and again when you sell those same cryptoassets. This can happen if you are a miner or when you accept payment in cryptoassets.

If your cryptoassets are not [trading stock](/api/glossary/item?id={043388F8-C02F-4070-8DE0-A534FFDE8412})
, the cost you claim when you sell or exchange your cryptoassets is equal to the value of the cryptoassets at the time you received them.

If the cryptoassets you received become your trading stock (for example when you’re in business as a miner) you can claim a deduction for the cost of any mining rewards that are trading stock in the year the rewards are returned as income. This cost will be equal to the value of the cryptoassets at the time you received them.

Applying the trading stock rules is not easy. It’s a good idea to talk to an accountant or tax advisor. They can give you more information about how the rules apply to your situation.

Income - onus on disputant
==========================

2014 case note – decision confirms that where deposits are linked to a particular source, the onus remains on the disputant to prove the deposits are not income.

Case

TRA 26/11 \[2014\] NZTRA 09

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The disputant claimed that apart from wages and interest earned in 2000 and 2001, he had not earned any money since 1988. The disputant gave evidence of having received inheritances and money from friends and family so that he could spend his time on charitable work. He also gave evidence of having withdrawn money from his various banks accounts and deposited it in his Global Plus accounts.

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") found that the disputant had not discharged his onus of proof to satisfy the TRA that the deposits are not income. In addition the TRA found that the disputant knew that he could rely upon gifts to fund his living expenses and to be able to continue his charitable activities. He accepted these gifts and used the funds to live on. On this basis, the TRA considered the amounts were income.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that where deposits are able to be linked to a particular source, the onus still remains on the disputant to prove that those deposits are not income. Further, where a disputant has come to rely upon monetary gifts to live on, those amounts are income.

### Facts

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") investigation into the disputant's tax affairs identified multiple unexplained deposits in the disputant's bank accounts in the 2000-2006 tax years. The Commissioner issued income tax default assessments for the 2000 to 2006 income tax years and registered the disputant for goods and services tax ("GST") with effect from 1999.

The disputant maintained that he had not earned any income from any paid employment or business activity since 1988. He claimed that the multiple deposits were inheritances, savings, gifts, loans and loan repayments from friends. He claimed he was involved in charitable work and did not earn any income in the relevant tax years, apart from some wages and interest earned in 2000 and 2001.

In particular, the disputant also gave evidence that he created a charitable trust ("A Trust"). As part of A Trust's initiatives, he established a martial arts school and with his wife he established a modelling school. He explained that he spent much of his time working on the curriculum for his martial arts school and building websites so that the programmes were available on the internet. He also worked on a business development programme for young people.

The disputant also gave evidence that together with his colleagues he set up the E Group. It was set up to be the commercial division of the A Trust with the intention that income earned would be used to fund the charitable activities of A Trust.

In addition, the disputant gave evidence of particular deposits that he said accounted for the unexplained deposits identified by the Commissioner. In particular, the disputant and his wife gave evidence that it was their practice to withdraw money from their various accounts (CBA account, Paritate Bank and ASB) using ATMs and then deposit the cash into his Global Plus accounts.

### Decision

Judge Sinclair considered the particular withdrawals and deposits that the disputant said accounted for the unexplained deposits identified by the Commissioner. In relation to the cash withdrawals from the CBA account, Judge Sinclair found as follows:

1.  In the 2000 tax year, $6,880 could be matched to withdrawals.
2.  In the 2001 tax year, on a generous approach, there was sufficient linkage between the date and amount of the withdrawal and deposit in the transactions in the period from 4 April 2001 to 3 May 2001 and the further withdrawal and deposit from 5 May 2001. These amounts totalled $12,140.
3.  There was no such linkage for any of the other deposits.

However, Judge Sinclair accepted the Commissioner's submission that it is not a question of simply adding up all the deposits over the course of the income year and setting them off against withdrawals from the CBA account. Evidence is required linking the withdrawal to the deposit and the onus of proof is on the disputant to satisfy the TRA that those deposits are not income. Judge Sinclair was not satisfied on the evidence that the deposits into the disputant's Global Plus account (identified as linked to withdrawals from the CBA account) were not income.

The disputant alleged that Mr LM, an associate, paid his rent and that these amounts were repayment of amounts he had loaned to Mr LM in the 1980s. Judge Sinclair did not consider that any of the unexplained deposits could be linked to any payment by Mr LM and in any event it was unclear whether they were loan repayments or gifts.

Judge Sinclair found that it was possible to identify approximately $13,000 only deposited into the disputant's bank account from withdrawals from the Paritate Bank. Even if it had been possible to identify other deposits as being from this source, Judge Sinclair was of the view that they would still be taxable as income.

The disputant gave evidence he received NZ$246,000 from a friend and he invested $220,000 of it in an offshore investment which failed. He was able to recover NZ$125,000. Judge Sinclair found that there was no evidence as to where the recovered funds were deposited nor in fact any evidence of the investment.

Judge Sinclair found that there was no deposit that matched the purported $5,000 that the disputant claimed had come from his family trust and been deposited into his ASB Moneymaker account.

The disputant gave evidence that he was given money by complete strangers who heard of his charitable work. In cross examination, he said the moneys given to him by friends and others were gifts with no obligation to repay and he told the TRA he had not paid back any of the money received by him over the years. He also told the TRA that some of the deposits were for the repayment of loans and that he neither documented the loans nor kept any repayment schedule. Judge Sinclair found that no loan repayments were specifically identified and linked to any deposit.

The disputant gave evidence of his "money pots" system where money was held in different pots depending upon its usage. Judge Sinclair found the disputant had no way of accounting for the funds he put into or took out of these pots, or how those funds were used.

Judge Sinclair found that some of the amounts assessed were gifts. However, the TRA considered that it was plain on the evidence that the disputant knew that he could rely upon that support to fund his living expenses and to be able to continue his charitable activities. Rather, he accepted these gifts and used the funds to live on. On this basis, Judge Sinclair considered the amounts were income. Judge Sinclair confirmed the Commissioner's assessments for income tax (subject to an adjustment on the incorrect inclusion of reimbursement costs and the reversal of the GST assessments).

Judge Sinclair found that E Group did not trade and she was satisfied on the evidence that in the income years in question, the disputant's activities were focused on his charitable work. Judge Sinclair was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the only income included in the undisclosed deposits had been derived from charitable work. The disputant made supplies in the form of his charitable work. However, there was no consideration for those supplies and therefore no taxable activity. Accordingly, Judge Sinclair was satisfied that the disputant was not liable to account for GST and reversed the GST assessments.

Judge Sinclair confirmed the Commissioner's assessment for shortfall penalties under section 141C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Judge Sinclair found that a reasonable person with the disputant's background and experience would have foreseen that his conduct would have resulted in a tax shortfall occurring. The disputant did not meet the standards of a reasonable man in his position in complying with his tax obligations.

Income tax

Income tax is paid on the net profit (taxable income) from your business.

Example of a business's net profit

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Gross sales/income | $125,000 |
| Less business expenses | $50,000 |
| Net profit (taxable income) | $75,000 |

#### Audio

**Narrator**

We find most people end up in business because they’re good at what they do, not because they’re great bookkeepers or mathematicians.

At the end of each financial year an income tax return is completed, and this is how we work out if there’s any income tax to pay.

Income tax is paid on the net profit, or taxable income, of your business.

The basic calculation is your sales, less your expenses, equals your net profit.

Note, that if you’re registered for GST, you take the GST off your sales and expenses when you do your income tax.

| $0 to $14000 | 10.5% | 28% |
| $14,000 to $48,000 | 17.5% |

| $70,000 upwards | 33% |

**Narrator**

So far in this series we’ve been looking at the income minus sales net profit formula.

We’ve looked at common kinds of expenses and how we treat these if there are business and private use components.

Once we’ve determined our net profit, how do we work out the tax?

New Zealand has progressive tax rates.

The rates increase as your income increases.

These are the tax rate bands.

Each individual or partner in a partnership has a portion of their income taxed at the lower rate.

Companies have a set company tax rate, as they have other ways of making distributions.

The company tax rate is 28 percent.

Let’s look at an example.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

In the original example back at slide 1, we had a sole trader whose gross sales were 125,000 dollars, expenses were 50,000 dollars, which created a net profit, or taxable income, of 75,000 dollars.

Let’s use those same figures here.

The first 14,000 dollars is taxed at 10.5 percent.

The amount between 14 and 48,000 is taxed at 17.5 percent.

The amount between 48 and 70,000 is taxed at 30 percent.

And any amount over 70,000 is taxed at 33 percent.

Based on a taxable income of 75,000 dollars, the tax component is 15,670 dollars.

Provisional tax

Provisional tax is a way of paying your income tax as you go. It applied when your residual income tax (RIT) is more than $5,000.

A choice of 4 options:

*   AIM - pay as you go
*   Standard
*   Estimation
*   Ratio

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Provisional tax is a way of paying your tax throughout the year.

Similar to how a salary and wage earner has PAYE deducted throughout the year.

Once you’ve completed your first tax return, and we’ve calculated how much tax you need to pay, we can also work out if you’ll become a provisional taxpayer.

To become a provisional taxpayer, you need to have a tax bill in the prior year of more than 5,000 dollars.

This was 2,500 dollars but has been increased as part of COVID-19 changes.

If your residual income tax or your tax bill was less than 5,000 dollars, you’ll continue to pay your tax as a single lump sum each year.

If your residual income tax or your tax bill was more than 5,000 dollars, you’ll become a provisional taxpayer.

There are 4 options for provisional tax.

AIM, or the Accounting Income Method, is a pay as you go option and can be done through certain software.

The standard option, which is what we’ll focus on today.

And there is the estimation option, where you can estimate what you think your tax bill will be, and pay instalments based on your estimate.

These can be especially useful if you had a great prior year, but you expect this years’ profits to be much less.

Be aware there may be penalties and interest if your estimate is lower than your end of year bill.

The final option is the ratio option.

You generally would need to have been in business, and GST registered, for 2 years before you can use this, as we use your income tax return and 12 months of GST returns to work out the ratio to apply to determine payment amounts.

Let’s have a look at the standard option example.

**Narrator**

Using our sole trader example, we’ve worked out that the tax for year 1 in this example is 15,670 dollars, and as this is over the 5,000 dollar provisional tax threshold, this sole trader is going to be a provisional taxpayer for year 2 of business.

Provisional tax payments are made in 3 instalments.

They are calculated by taking the residual income tax from the prior year, and multiplying it by 105 percent.

The 5 percent uplift assumes that the business has an increase in profit year after year.

In this scenario we take the year 1 tax due of 15,670 dollars, multiply this by 105 percent, which equals 16,453 dollars.

We then divide this by 3, as there are 3 provisional tax payment dates in each year.

Two payments of 5,484 dollars, and a final payment of 5,485 dollars.

Provisional tax due dates

31 March is displayed underneath the Year 1 and Year 2 border, and again under the Year 2 and Year 3 border. These indicate the end and start of the tax years.

Start of business is shown on the timeline in the Year 1 section, indicating the business started sometime during year 1.

Tax return due 7 July is shown after, but close to, the start of the Year 2 section. This shows that the Year 1 tax return is after the start of Year 2.

Year 1 tax due $15,670 7 February is shown close to, but before the end, of the Year 2 section. This shows that the taxes for Year 1 are due to be paid near the end of Year 2.

Let’s overlap the 3 provisional tax due dates onto our timeline.

You can see our 3 provisional tax due dates of 28 August, 15 January and 7 May.

You’ll often hear the myth that your first year of business is tax free.

Which is technically correct, as you don’t pay tax \[emphasised\]in your first year of business, but you do pay tax \[emphasised\]for your first year of business, but this is paid in year 2.

Provisional tax due dates

Standard option

The same timeline remains

Year 1 tax due $15,670 7 February is shown again near the end of the Year 2 section. It is between the Instalment date 2 and Instalment date 3. This shows the end of year tax for Year 1 is close to Year 2’s second provisional tax instalment date.

**Narrator**

Year 2 is often the hardest as you have a lumpsum to pay for last years’ tax, **and** you are preparing the current year tax by way of provisional tax payments.

This is why it’s very important to plan and budget for tax.

Make sure you are putting amounts aside for these future obligations, and to make the second year of business a bit easier.

You will start to fall into a routine, making your 3 provisional tax payments, then once the return is filed it will work out if you’ve paid too much, or too little for that year

If you have not paid enough, there’ll be a payment due on 7 February each year.

Or if you’ve paid too much, then a refund will be issued.

If you have an accountant, you’ll usually have until 7 April to pay any end of year tax bill.

As a business owner there are a few other responsibilities to be aware of, such as GST.

If your turnover goes over 60,000 dollars, you’ll need to register for GST.

Please note, turnover is your sales, not your net profit.

If you employ staff you’ll need to register as an employer and have responsibilities around leave entitlements, PAYE deductions etcetera.

As mentioned earlier ACC, will bill you directly.

It would pay to make contact with them to get an idea of their levies based on your industry.

Inland Revenue charges penalties and interest if returns are not filed or paid on time.

If you’re having difficulty, please contact us, as we may be able to set up payment plans.

"Income splitting" case held by the High Court not to be tax avoidance
======================================================================

2010 case note - High Court held that amalgamation of medical practice and business into single corporate entity not tax avoidance - structuring, personal services.

Case

Philippa Catherine White v CIR

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

The High Court held that the amalgamation of the disputant’s medical practice and her husband’s business into a single corporate entity did not give rise to an impugned tax avoidance arrangement.

### Impact of decision

The decision of the High Court in _Philippa White v CIR_ is relevant to the course of litigation in the _Penny_ _v CIR_ (\[2010\] NZCA 231) appeal which is currently before the Supreme Court. In the recent _White_ decision, his Honour Justice Heath has found that the disputant's diversion of personal services income through a corporate structure did not amount to tax avoidance.

The same issue (albeit on different facts) is before the Supreme Court in the _Penny_ appeal. The Commissioner remains of the view, notwithstanding the recent _White_ decision, that such arrangements **may** amount to tax avoidance.

The Commissioner has decided that the _White_ case will be appealed. The Commissioner also awaits the final determination of the Courts in the _Penny_ matter. In the meantime, he refers any person inquiring as to his view of such matters to his Revenue Alert 10/01.

### Facts

1.  The Appellant is an anaesthetist in public and private practice. Her husband provided quality assurance services as an employee and privately. On 1 November 2002 the couple restructured their business affairs. One reason for the restructuring was to protect their family after concerns were expressed about exposure to claims which could be made by clients against private professional services being provided.
2.  The restructuring involved an arrangement whereby a family trust owned assets including horticultural land, an avocado orchard and business assets relating to the private services provided by the Appellant and her husband. A company Wharfedale Limited ("Wharfedale") was established and the disputant and her husband each held a 35% share in the company. Wharfedale leased the avocado orchard business from the Trust.
3.  On 1 November 2002 the Appellant ceased being self-employed in her private anaesthetist practice and took up employment in the newly incorporated Wharfedale, which had taken over the running of her private practice. Her services were then provided to the clients of Wharfedale, those services being exactly the same as she had been providing when in private practice. However, instead of receiving a substantial income commensurate with her skills and exertions, she received no salary from Wharfedale for 5 months work in 2003 and only $4,875 in the year ended 31 March 2004 for 12 months work.
4.  The reason given for the lack of salary was that Wharfedale was not making sufficient income to enable her to be remunerated at the same rate as she had been when in private practice. The avocado orchard business which was owned by Wharfedale was operating at a loss. One of the larger overheads for the avocado orchard business was the rental paid for the orchard, which was owned by the family trust. The Appellant claimed that the orchard returns were less than expected due to poor cropping results and lower than expected prices.
5.  As part of his defence in the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) the Commissioner drew the attention of the TRA to the fact that Wharfedale appeared to be paying above normal market rates to lease the orchard. The Appellant claimed that rent was not an issue raised by the Commissioner in his Statement of Position and he was therefore excluded from presenting evidence regarding a market rent.
6.  In the TRA Barber DCJ found that the structures implemented by the Appellant left her "unremunerated in a manner which was artificial and contrived and has no sensible reality" TRA 04/08.

### Decision

7.  In his decision Heath J initially looked at the concerns of Barber DCJ which appeared to be the effective assignment of the Appellant’s income from personal exertion to Wharfedale; that it was not "credible nor commercially acceptable" that an experienced anaesthetist would work for a company for virtually nothing, and that the reduction in income tax was not a "merely incidental purpose" of the arrangement.
8.  Heath J quoted _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited v CIR_ \[2009\] 2NZLR (SC), at \[106\]:
    *   Put at the highest level of generality, a specific provision is designed to give the taxpayer a tax advantage if its use falls within its ordinary meaning. **That will be a permissible tax advantage**. The general provision is designed to avoid the fiscal effect of tax avoidance arrangements having a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance. Its function is to prevent uses of the specific provisions which fall outside their intended scope in the overall scheme of the \[Income Tax Act 2007\]. **Such uses give rise to an impermissible tax advantage which the Commissioner may counteract**. The general anti-avoidance provision and its associated reconstruction power provide explicit authority for the Commissioner and New Zealand courts to avoid what has been done to reconstruct tax avoidance arrangements. \[Emphasis added\]
9.  His Honour noted that by using the rubrics "permissible" and "impermissible" the majority in the Supreme Court were discarding the distinction drawn between "tax avoidance" and "tax mitigation" in _Challenge Corporation Limited v CIR_ \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513 (PC). He then stated that in his view "the terminology signals a need to scrutinise a particular transaction to ascertain whether its purpose fell inside or outside of the intended scope of a specific provision that confers a tax advantage".
10.  He also noted that in _Ben Nevis_ the court indicated that factors which would help determine tax avoidance included:
    *   the manner in which an arrangement is carried out
    *   the role of the relevant parties and their relationship with the taxpayer
    *   the economic and commercial effect of documents and transactions, measured against the actual consequences of implementation of the arrangement
    *   whether the taxpayer gains the benefit of a specific provision "in an artificial or contrived way".

The use made of the specific provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the Act") also needed to be considered "in the light of the commercial reality and economic effect" of their use and were not limited to "purely legal considerations".

11.  Heath J referred to _Glenharrow Holdings Limited_ _v CIR_ \[2009\] 2 NZLR 359 (SC) and acknowledged that the "purpose or effect" of an arrangement was not equated to motive but rather the end result. He acknowledged that the test was objective and indicated that the Court's inability to focus on the intention of the parties was "counter-intuitive".
12.  However, he then referred to the findings of Woodhouse P in _Challenge Corporation v CIR_ \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513 (CA) and Harrison J in _Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR_ (2009) 24 NZTC (HC) and concluded:
    *   ... evidence of a subjective nature from the taxpayer and others may assist the Court in determining issues of avoidance. However, its use must be restricted to providing the context in which the arrangement was brought into being, in order to assist the Court to understand any genuine commercial arrangements involved.
13.  The recent Court of Appeal decision in _CIR v Penny_ \[2010\] NZCA 231 was considered. His Honour distinguished the Appellant’s case by noting that the companies operated by Mr Penny and Mr Hooper "did have sufficient money to pay salaries". He did however refer to the _Penny_ decision and quoted Randerson J at \[126\]:
    *   It will be a matter of assessing all the circumstances including the extent and nature of any artificiality or contrivance in order to determine whether any particular arrangement is within or outside contemplation of Parliament in enacting the tax legislation. **Where there are legitimate reasons such as those discussed at \[98\] above for adopting a salary markedly below commercial levels, a challenge by the Commissioner may be unlikely to succeed. Nor would I expect the Commissioner to interfere in marginal circumstances. The difference here is that salaries were adopted at levels far below ordinary commercial expectations that, in the absence of legitimate reasons for doing so, there is a strong implication of tax avoidance**. \[Emphasis added\]
14.  Heath J concluded that the TRA erred in holding there was a tax avoidance arrangement. He began with the premise that a "rounded" assessment of what occurred was required, in order to determine whether the tax advantages gained were "permissible" or "impermissible". He accepted that the Appellant’s subjective intentions were not determinative in ascertaining the purpose or effect of the arrangement. But he considered it necessary to look at the nature of the arrangement and how it was carried into effect to determine whether the purpose or effect was to obtain an "impermissible tax advantage".
15.  After revisiting the facts and the TRA decision, Heath J concluded that Judge Barber's real concern was with "an injection of personal/exertion professional income into a family company experiencing losses from business activities so that it did not remunerate as an employee in a fair and commercial manner". Justice Heath's response was "... at the time the arrangements were entered into, it was not expected that financial losses would be caused from business activities ... Further the reason that no money was available for Wharfedale to pay a salary to Dr White was because income had to be diverted to pay real (not contrived) debts". He also found that in arranging her affairs the Appellant "did nothing more than obtain the advantage that Parliament intended would flow to someone in her position".
16.  His honour further stated that "the elements of the tax avoidance arrangement on which Judge Barber relied, reveal nothing out of the ordinary". He agreed with Ellen France J who dissented in _Penny,_ noting that the arrangement was an "acceptable business practice and the opposite of artifice or contrivance". He also noted that decision by the Court of Appeal in _Grieve v CIR_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101 (CA) at paragraph 110 which states:
    *   It is not for the Courts or the Commissioner to confine the recognition of businesses to those that are always profitable or to do so only as long as they operate at a profit.
17.  While he acknowledged that _Grieve_ related to a test to determine the ambit of the word "business", Heath J also noted that it also helped provide a more general insight into the scheme and purpose of the Act.
18.  Heath J found that there was not a purpose of "obtaining an impermissible tax advantage" but that even if that conclusion was wrong the purpose or effect of the arrangement was "merely incidental".
19.  Heath J saw no need to decide on the issue of orchard rent, nor was there any need to address the issue of reconstruction.

BR Pub 17/01 and BR Pub 17/02 are reissues of BR Pub 13/03 and BR Pub 13/04, which expire at the end of the 2016/17 income year. The effect of these Rulings is the same as the effect of BR Pub 13/03 and BR Pub 13/04. 2. Many businesses hold money that is owing to another person. In New Zealand, the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (UMA 1971) sets out rules that apply to holders of unclaimed money. Generally, after a certain period, unclaimed money becomes payable to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. However, the amount ceases to be unclaimed money (although the owner of the money may still be entitled to repayment) where the amount of unclaimed money:  does not exceed $100 per owner (the person entitled to the money); and  is applied by the holder for their own benefit (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object) within prescribed timeframes (6 years or 25 years). If the holder does not apply the amount for its own benefit, that amount will continue to be unclaimed money and will be payable to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue after 6 years or 25 years. 3. At issue is the tax treatment of these amounts; in particular, whether and when they can be business income of a taxpayer. 4. For amounts of unclaimed money of $100 or less, it is concluded that while money is held on trust and cannot be (and has not been) applied by the holder for their own benefit (or for the benefit of any other person or for any UNCLASSIFIED 4 purpose or object) it cannot be income of the holder. These amounts remain subject to the UMA 1971 and must be paid to the Commissioner within the specified timeframes. 5. An unclaimed amount (of $100 or less) not held on trust will be derived when it:  has been applied by the holder for its own benefit (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object); and  is probable that the amount will not have to be repaid (this would include situations that mean the amount is not legally recoverable – for example, a contractual term or limitation period). 6. Whether it is probable that an amount will not be repaid will depend on the particular business. Business records and accounting treatment are likely to be relevant to determining this. 7. If a holder has recognised a previously unclaimed amount as income and subsequently returns that amount to the owner, the holder will be entitled to a deduction under s DA 1(b). Background 8. Some doubt exists about the correct tax treatment of unclaimed amounts. BR Pub 13/03 and BR Pub 13/04 were issued to set out the Commissioner’s view on the correct tax treatment of amounts under $100. 9. These current Rulings (BR Pub 17/01 and BR Pub 17/02) are reissues of BR Pub 13/03 and BR Pub 13/04. They are intended to provide on-going certainty, so have been issued for an indefinite period. Application of the legislation 10. The following analysis starts with a summary of the provisions of the UMA 1971. It then considers relevant case law on the timing of derivation of income and a line of United Kingdom (UK) cases that look at when unclaimed money will be trading profits of the holder. Summary of Unclaimed Money Act 1971 11. Section 4(1)(a)–(d) of the UMA 1971 defines amounts that are “unclaimed money”. This section includes specific types of amounts that are unclaimed money and the period (6 years or 25 years) after which the amounts become unclaimed money. 12. Section 4(1)(e) of the UMA 1971 sets out a general catch–all provision. Broadly, any money that has been owing by any holder for 6 years immediately following the date on which the money has become payable by the holder will be “unclaimed money”. 13. The proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 states: Provided that money of any of the kinds referred to in this subsection shall cease to be unclaimed money where— (i) in respect of any one owner it does not exceed $100 in total; and (ii) before the 1st day of June next succeeding the end of the period of 6 years or, as the case may be, 25 years specified in this subsection, that unclaimed money is, without limiting any claim any owner may have thereto, applied by the holder for his own benefit or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object. UNCLASSIFIED 5 14. Consequently, an amount will cease to be unclaimed money where it does not exceed $100 and it is applied for the benefit of the holder (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object) within the prescribed timeframes. However, this does not affect any claim that the owner of the money may have against the holder for repayment. 15. Section 4(2) of the UMA 1971 also excludes certain amounts from being unclaimed money. These amounts include certain dividends, rebates payable by a mutual society, and benefits payable from any pension or superannuation fund. 16. “Holder” is widely defined in s 5 of the UMA 1971. The term includes any company incorporated in New Zealand and any company or bank carrying on business in New Zealand. It also includes certain holders (who are not companies) who are obliged to account for only particular kinds of unclaimed money (for example, auctioneers for the balance of any proceeds of goods sold at auction and real estate agents for money held in the real estate agent’s trust account). 17. Other persons may elect to be holders and comply with the UMA 1971. 18. The UMA 1971 imposes certain obligations on holders of unclaimed money. These obligations include:  keeping a register of unclaimed money in accordance with s 6 of the UMA 1971;  notifying owners and the Commissioner of entries in the unclaimed money register in accordance with s 7 of the UMA 1971;  paying the unclaimed money to the Commissioner in accordance with the period specified in s 8 of the UMA 1971 (at this time the holder is relieved of all further liability to any claimant for the money). Failure to comply with these obligations is an offence (s 13 UMA 1971). 19. At issue is the tax treatment of amounts that come within the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971; in particular, whether these amounts can be business income of a taxpayer. These are amounts that would, in the absence of the proviso, be unclaimed money (and the holder subject to the obligations outlined above). Instead, where an amount does not exceed $100 and it is applied for the benefit of the holder (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object) within the prescribed timeframes, it will cease to be unclaimed money. Therefore, the UMA 1971 will no longer apply to it. When an amount will be business income 20. Section CB 1 provides: CB 1 Amounts derived from business Income (1) An amount that a person derives from a business is income of the person. Exclusion (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an amount that is of a capital nature. 21. An amount will be income where it is “derived” from a business. The following discussion applies where:  a taxpayer is carrying on a business;  the amounts in question are received in the ordinary course of that business; UNCLASSIFIED 6  the amounts are not capital in nature; and  no specific timing regime applies to deem derivation to be at a particular time. 22. Case law has established two main methods of recognising income for tax purposes: the cash or receipts method and the accruals or earnings method. The accruals method is generally the most appropriate one for calculating business income. This usually requires the realisation of income on the basis of ordinary commercial principles (unless a more specific provision of the Act applies). 23. It is possible that derivation could occur on receipt or at some point following receipt or that derivation might never occur. Determining the correct point in time requires consideration of the case law on the meaning of derivation. 24. The leading case in this area is Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314. In Arthur Murray, the taxpayer carried on a business of giving dancing lessons. Courses of tuition were available for 5, 15 or 30 hours of private tuition to be taken within a year. Some students contracted for 1,200 hours of tuition to be taken at any time during the student’s lifetime. Payment for a course of lessons was often made in advance. The students were given no contractual right to a refund (the terms of the contract prohibited it). However, refunds were sometimes given. The taxpayer argued that fees received in advance of tuition were not taxable income at the time of receipt. The court agreed, finding (at 318) as follows: \[Income\] refers to amounts which have not only been received but have “come home” to the taxpayer; and that must surely involve, if the word “income” is to convey the notion it expresses in the practical affairs of business life, not only that the amounts received are unaffected by legal restrictions, as by reason of a trust or charge in favour of the payer-not only that they have been received beneficially-but that the situation has been reached in which they may properly be counted as gains completely made, so that there is neither legal nor business unsoundness in regarding them without qualification as income derived. The ultimate inquiry in either kind of case, of course, must be whether that which has taken place, be it the earning or the receipt, is enough by itself to satisfy the general understanding among practical business people of what constitutes a derivation of income. A conclusion as to what that understanding is may be assisted by considering standard accountancy methods, for they have been evolved in the business community for the very purpose of reflecting received opinions as to the sound view to take of particular kinds of items. ... Likewise, as it seems to us, in determining whether actual earning has to be added to receipt in order to find income, the answer must be given in the light of the necessity for earning which is inherent in the circumstances of the receipt. It is true that in a case like the present the circumstances of the receipt do not prevent the amount received from becoming immediately the beneficial property of the company; for the fact that it has been paid in advance is not enough to affect it with any trust or charge, or to place any legal impediment in the way of the recipient’s dealing with it as he will. But those circumstances nevertheless make it surely necessary, as a matter of business good sense, that the recipient should treat each amount of fees received but not yet earned as subject to the contingency that the whole or some part of it may have in effect to be paid back, even if only as damages, should the agreed quid pro quo not be rendered in due course. The possibility of having to make such a payment back (we speak, of course, in practical terms) is an inherent characteristic of the receipt itself. In our opinion it would be out of accord with the realities of the situation to hold, while the possibility remains, that the amount received has the quality of income derived by the company. For that reason it is not surprising to find, as the parties in the present case agree is the fact, that according to established accountancy and commercial principles in the community the books of a business either selling goods or providing services are so kept with respect to amounts received in advance of the goods being sold or of the services being provided that the amounts are not entered to UNCLASSIFIED 7 the credit of any revenue account until the sale takes place or the services are rendered: in the meantime they are credited to what is in effect a suspense account, and their transfer to an income account takes place only when the discharge of the obligations for which they are the prepayment justifies their being treated as having finally acquired the character of income. \[Emphasis added\] 25. Several New Zealand cases have followed Arthur Murray. Arthur Murray was cited with approval in A Taxpayer v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,350 (CA) in relation to the principle that an amount needs to be received beneficially by the taxpayer before it will be derived. 26. Recently the Court of Appeal in Sovereign Assurance Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2013\] NZCA 652 relied on the principles in Arthur Murray as to when an amount is derived. The Court of Appeal focused narrowly on the aspect of Arthur Murray addressing when income was derived through being “earned” rather than any issues as to beneficial entitlement. 27. Sovereign Assurance is complex and involved insurance and re-insurance. The taxpayer was an insurance company that entered into agreements with well-resourced reinsurers where it ceded or passed on most of its insured risks. The parties also employed a financing mechanism where the reinsurers agreed to make advances to the taxpayer by paying commissions on policies ceded under the treaties, and the taxpayer agreed to pay the reinsurers commission repayments in amounts equal to the commission payments plus an interest component. The Court of Appeal considered the real focus of the taxpayer’s appeal was whether the commission payments the reinsurer made were income in the taxpayer’s hands. 28. The Court of Appeal considered that the contractual obligations between the taxpayer and the reinsurer meant the taxpayer was not entitled to retain the commission as its own without repaying the reinsurer an equivalent amount (together with interest). Accordingly, the court considered the commissions were not “earned” because they were received conditionally and were subject to an obligation to be repaid. Therefore, the commission payments were not derived as income. 29. In CIR v Molloy (1990) 12 NZTC 7,146 (HC) the taxpayer was a life insurance agent. He received commissions in advance subject to terms requiring repayment if the policy was terminated within a certain timeframe. The court found that the commissions were not income at the time of receipt. Thomas J stated at 7,152: In my view the advances made to the agent by the company in this case on account of commission do not have the quality of income derived by the agent at the time of receipt. The possibility or inherent risk that such advances may have to be repaid (only about 5% in the case of the respondent but up to 30% on average for the company's agents as a whole) is significant, and it is an integral part of the advance, or the receipt of the advance, itself. For the very good reason that the company wishes to provide an incentive for the agent to solicit soundly based business and then, if necessary, work to ensure that the policies entered into are sustained for a sufficient period to ensure that they are viable, the arrangement contemplates that he will not have earned his commission unless the policy remains in force for two years. In my opinion, it is these factors which deprive the advances made from having the quality of income earned and derived by the agent at the time they are received. \[Emphasis added\] 30. Bowcock v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062 concerned an employee who took study leave. Under the terms of the arrangement, the taxpayer received his normal salary. If he left his employment within a certain time after finishing his course, some of the money had to be repaid. The taxpayer did leave his employment and had to repay certain amounts. He claimed that these amounts were never part of his income. The court distinguished Arthur UNCLASSIFIED 8 Murray, finding that the amounts became the absolute property of the taxpayer when they were paid. Whether any liability arose in the future to repay any part of the money depended entirely on the course the objector chose to take. 31. The principles from Arthur Murray were also applied in Case N30 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,266 (TRA). The taxpayer in Case N30 carried on a courier business. As part of its business, the taxpayer sold pre-paid books of tickets of varying denominations. The tickets had no expiry date. There was no contractual right to a refund, although the taxpayer would usually give a refund for unused tickets if asked. Some of the tickets were never redeemed. Amounts received were not returned as income when they were received, but were returned as income when they were redeemed. It was agreed that this was generally the appropriate tax treatment. At issue was the treatment of amounts that were never redeemed and whether these should be returned as income. It was accepted that the amount could not be accurately calculated. Judge Bathgate held that when the taxpayer could say as a matter of probability that a ticket would not be redeemed, the amount should be included as income. 32. The taxpayer in A Elson (Inspector of Taxes) v Prices Tailors Ltd \[1963\] 1 All ER 231 (ChD) carried on business as a tailor. When a customer placed an order they were required to pay a deposit. If, subsequently, the customer declined to take the garment, the taxpayer would refund the deposit (although contractually it did not have to do so). However, often neither the garment nor the deposit was claimed. At issue was whether the unclaimed deposits were trading receipts in the year in which they were paid. 33. The court found that the payments were true deposits, rather than part- payments (as the taxpayer had argued). Consequently, the amounts belonged to the taxpayer at the time they were paid (as there was no legal requirement to refund them). The court went on to find that the deposit amounts were trading receipts in the year in which they were received. That the taxpayer would always refund the amounts if asked did not change this. 34. It might be suggested that the decision in Prices Tailors is inconsistent with the decision in Arthur Murray. Prices Tailors concerned a deposit towards a supply of goods, and the court held that the deposit was derived when it was received. On the other hand, Arthur Murray concerned a full payment for the provision of services in the future, and the court held that the amount was not derived until the services had been performed. The cases are consistent in that they both look at the legal obligations (the amounts paid were non-refundable) rather than what happened in practice. However, Prices Tailors did not appear to consider the fact that, at the time the deposit was paid, the taxpayer had not fulfilled the requirements of the contract (that is, making the suit available to the taxpayer). Summary of principles from the cases 35. The following principles can be taken from the above cases:  The word “income” conveys the notion it expresses in the practical affairs of business life. It is necessary to ask whether what has taken place is enough by itself to satisfy the general understanding among practical business people of what is derivation of income.  An amount will be income when the earning process is complete. In the case of prepaid services, this will usually be when the services have been performed. UNCLASSIFIED 9  Where it is probable that the services will not have to be performed and the amount will not have to be repaid, then the amount should be income.  It is necessary to consider the circumstances of receipt. For example, whether the amount is subject to a contingency of repayment is a relevant factor. Similarly, for an amount to be derived it must have been beneficially received by the taxpayer (that is, not be subject to a legal restriction such as a trust or charge that prevents the taxpayer dealing with the amount in their own interests). United Kingdom cases 36. Several UK cases consider whether (and when) amounts received by taxpayers that may be subject to repayment are trading receipts that should be taken into account in calculating the taxpayer’s profits. 37. Lincolnshire Sugar Co Ltd (in liquidation) v Smart (HMIT) \[1937\] 1 All ER 413 (HL) considered “advances” payable by the Government to sugar manufacturers. The advances became repayable in the event of imported sugar rising to a certain price or in certain other events such as a winding- up of the company. The advances were included as a liability in the company’s balance sheet. No part of the advances ever became repayable. The issue was whether the advances were trading receipts of the company in the year they were received. The company contended that the advances were not trading receipts or, if the advances were trading receipts, they could not be brought into account as such, so long as they remained subject to repayment. 38. Lord MacMillan concluded that the amounts were trading receipts. The fact the payments were called advances and were repayable if certain contingencies occurred was not decisive; rather, Lord MacMillan was influenced by the fact the payments were made to the company so the money could be used in its business. 39. Morley (Inspector of Taxes) v Tattersall \[1938\] 3 All ER 296 (CA) involved a firm of auctioneers. Its conditions of sale provided that vendors should receive the purchase money following the sale and that no money would be paid without a written order. As a result of the operation of these conditions, large sums of money sometimes remained unclaimed in the hands of the firm. When a new partner was admitted in 1922, an amount for unclaimed balances for years before 1908 was transferred to the capital account of the old partner. In 1935, when another partner was admitted, an amount for unclaimed balances between 1922 and 1928 was transferred in part to the current accounts and in part to the capital accounts of the former partners. A partnership deed in 1936 provided that such liability as subsisted in respect of those sums should be assumed by the partnership and that such unclaimed balances as first arose six years before the taking of each annual account should be transferred at such account to the credit of the partners in accordance with their shares in the partnership. The partnership deed further provided that all liability in respect of the unpaid amounts should be borne by the partnership. 40. Sir Wilfrid Greene MR noted that the Statute of Limitation had not started to run for the balances. Therefore, the taxpayer was still obliged to make payment to a customer at any time if requested (at 298): Many of those balances have remained unclaimed for a considerable number of years, but the Solicitor-General quite properly admitted that the vendors in question were entitled to claim payment of their money at any time, unaffected by the Statute of Limitation, which has not yet begun to run, owing to the absence of any written order UNCLASSIFIED 10 as required by the conditions. We are dealing, therefore, with obligations which, as a matter of law, are existing obligations, which the firm can be called on to perform at any moment. That is a matter not without importance in the examination of this case. 41. Sir Wilfrid Greene MR went on to further explain the effect of the agreements between the partners. In particular, he noted that the agreements did not affect the legal position between the clients and the partnership; rather, the agreements related to the accounting treatment of the unclaimed amounts as well as what was, in effect, an indemnity between the partners and the partnership in relation to the amounts (at 300): Pausing there for a moment, and eliminating, for the purpose of simplicity, the changes in the partnership agreement, it is of the utmost importance in this case to appreciate the real nature of what was being done. I say that because, in the arguments addressed to us on behalf of the Crown, various metaphorical expressions were used, such as “holding a sum,” “changing the capacity in which a sum is held,” “turning a sum into an asset,” and so forth—expressions which, to my mind, are both inaccurate and misleading. What happened was that the partnership, being indebted to outside persons; in respect of sums which it had received, and which had passed into the general mass of its assets, and having carried in its balance-sheet a proper liability item to express that liability, decided at a certain point, and on certain principles laid down, that that liability item should be written down and diminished. That is what happened in 1921, in 1934, and year by year after the provisions of the new partnership agreement came into operation—merely the alteration of a debit item in the balance-sheet by eliminating from it certain liabilities which had previously gone to make it up. If that matter had stayed there, the only result on the balance-sheet would have been to increase the credit balance. It would have shown a greater surplus of assets over liabilities than it had shown prior to that writing down. It so happened that, for domestic reasons of their own, the partners, instead of leaving the matter in that way, with an increased credit balance, decided that that increase in the credit balance should be carried in the balance sheet to the partners’ accounts. That does not alter the reality of the position one jot. The true position is—and I repeat it, because it is only when that is appreciated that what I, with respect, conceive to be the fallacies underlying the Crown's argument are perceived—that the only thing which was done on these occasions was the elimination from the liabilities side of the balance-sheet of something which had previously appeared as a liability therein. \[Emphasis added\] 42. It was generally agreed between the parties that the money was not a trading receipt at the time it was received. However, it was argued that the amounts became trading receipts at the time the partners treated the amounts as their own. Sir Wilfrid Greene MR rejected this argument, finding that the writing down of the amount in the balance sheet did not convert that amount to income (at 301): It might be more convenient to deal with Mr Hills’s argument first, because that is the one which starts off with the perfectly clear admission that the money, when received from the purchasers, was not a trading receipt. That proposition, I should have thought, was, in any case, quite incontestable. The money received was money which had not got any profit-making quality about it. It was money which, in a business sense, was the clients’ money, and nobody else’s. It was money for which Messrs Tattersall were liable to account to the clients, and the fact that Messrs Tattersall paid it into their own account, as they clearly did, and the fact that it remained among their assets until paid out, do not alter that circumstance. It would have been, for income tax purposes, in my judgment, entirely improper to have brought those receipts into the account at all for the purpose of ascertaining the balance of profits and gains. Indeed, as I have said, the Crown did not suggest that that would have been proper. What was said, however, was this. Mr Hills’s argument was to the effect that, although they were not trading receipts at the moment of receipt, they had at that moment the potentiality of becoming trading receipts. That proposition involves a view of income tax law in which I can discover no merit except that of novelty. I invited Mr Hills to point to any authority which in any way supported the proposition that a receipt which at the time of its receipt was not a trading receipt could by some subsequent operation ex post facto be turned into a trading receipt—not, be it observed, as at the date of receipt, but as at the date of the subsequent operation. It seems to me, with all respect to that argument, that it is based on a complete misapprehension of what is meant by a trading receipt in income tax law. No case has been cited to us in which anything like that proposition appears. It seems to me that the quality and nature of a receipt for income tax purposes is fixed once and for all when UNCLASSIFIED 11 it is received. What the partners did in this case, as I have said, was to decide among themselves that what they had previously regarded as a liability of the firm they would not, for practical reasons, regard as a liability. That does not mean, however, that at that moment they received something, nor does it mean that at that moment they imprinted on some existing asset a quality different from that which it had possessed before. There was no existing asset at all at that time. All that they did, as I have already pointed out, was to write down a liability item in their balance- sheet, and how by effecting that operation it can be said that a sum received years ago has been converted into something which it never was is a thing which, with all respect, passes my comprehension. \[Emphasis added\] 43. Jay’s the Jewellers Ltd v IRC \[1947\] 2 All ER 762 (KB) involved the tax treatment of proceeds from the sale of pledged property. The Pawnbrokers Act 1872 required a pawnbroker to hold a pledge for 12 months and 7 days. If the pledged article had not been redeemed by then and the loan was no more than 10s, the pledge became the property of the pawnbroker, who could sell it and keep the proceeds. If the loan exceeded 10s, the pawnbroker was entitled to sell the pledged article by auction and to take the amount of the loan, the interest due and the cost of the sale out of the amount realised. Subject to the terms of any special contract, which were permitted if the loan exceeded 40s, at any time within three years of the sale the pledgor had the right to inspect the pawnbroker’s books and demand payment of the surplus. After three years, the pledgor lost that right and the surplus became the property of the pawnbroker. Special contracts entered into by pawnbrokers with pledgors sometimes incorporated the three-year period, but in others a pledgor’s rights to redeem were barred only by the ordinary period of limitation, six years. 44. The issue was whether the proceeds from the sales were subject to excess profits tax. The court held that, as a matter of law, the surpluses when received were not the taxpayers’ monies at all; they belonged to their clients. Based on Tattersall, the court found that the surpluses were not trading receipts in the year that they were received. The court then went on to consider whether a surplus could be treated as a trade receipt in a later year when the taxpayer became entitled to retain it. 45. The court held that a new asset was created automatically by operation of law at the end of the three years (in the case of most of the loans) and common sense would seem to demand that that should be entered in the profit and loss account for the year and be treated as taxable. The court distinguished the decision in Tattersall as follows (at 766): It is, however, argued that I cannot give effect to that view because of Tattersall’s case. Is there anything in Tattersall’s case to indicate that that view is wrong? In that case there had been no change whatever in the character and nature of the money held. The Statute of Limitations had not commenced to run, and the court was dealing merely with the effect of a change in the method in which these sums were dealt with in the company’s books. ... Here the position is different. Here, at the end of three years, the money in question, the three-year-old surplus, did attain a totally different quality. I think there was then a definite trade receipt. At the end of the three years a new asset came into existence, an asset which had arisen out of a trade transaction. 46. The court then considered whether the position should be different for pledges that were subject only to the application of a limitation period. The same conclusion was held to apply (at 767): The position is somewhat different as to pledges for over £10, because the only change which takes place at the end of six years is that the customer’s remedy is barred, but, from the business point of view, I think, it ought to be treated as the same. In practice those amounts would be properly dealt with by the taxpayers as their own. They could not get into difficulties by so doing. They cannot be called on to pay. I do not think any distinction ought to be drawn between the three-yearly surpluses and the six- UNCLASSIFIED 12 yearly surpluses, and I am not prepared to differ from the view held by the Special Commissioners. Therefore, both appeals will fail. 47. In holding that the unclaimed deposits were income of the taxpayer in the year received, Prices Tailors (see \[32\]) distinguished Tattersall and Jay’s the Jewellers on the basis that, in those cases, the amounts in question did not belong to the taxpayers (at the time they were received) (at 235): In Morley v Tattersall, the vendors’ unclaimed balances, in the hands of a firm of auctioneers, of proceeds of sale of horses were held not to be trading receipts; and in Jay’s, The Jewellers Ltd v Inland Revenue Comrs; Inland Revenue Comrs v Jay’s, The Jewellers Ltd, a pawner’s unclaimed balance in the hands of a pawnbroker of the proceeds of sale of an unredeemed pledge, after satisfying the amounts due under the pledge, was held not to be a trading receipt until the pawner’s claim was statute- barred. In these cases, the balances in the traders’ hands were not theirs at all but were held for others, and this fact is fundamental to the decisions. The traders had no beneficial interest in them at the relevant time, and, although it was because they were traders that they received them, they were not receipts of their trade at all. \[Emphasis added\] 48. The taxpayer in Pertemps Recruitment Partnership Ltd v HMRC \[2010\] UKFTT 218 carried on business as a recruitment agent. Sometimes it would receive overpayments from customers (that is, payments of amounts that were not owing). Where these amounts could not be refunded or applied against a later liability, the taxpayer kept the payments. The court found that receipt of mistaken payments was an inevitable incident of the taxpayer’s business. The court further found that:  when the overpayments were deposited in the taxpayer’s bank account, the taxpayer did not know that they represented an overpayment;  the taxpayer treated the overpayments as its own money (that is, the overpayments were not kept in a separate account);  the taxpayer did not hold the mistaken payments on trust for the customer (Tattersall and Jay’s the Jewellers were distinguished on this basis);  no limitation period would likely apply to the overpayments; and  the amounts paid belonged to the taxpayer unless the customer made a successful claim in restitution or the claim was settled by agreement. 49. The court held that the payments were profits from the taxpayer’s trade in the year that they were received. The fact the customers had an entitlement to claim the money back did not change this. The tribunal judge stated (at \[43\]–\[44\]): HMRC’s submission, with which we agree, is that an \[sic\] mistaken payment for services has the same characteristic in the hands of the recipient trader as a payment made not in error – if the payment is made because the customer makes a mistake about owing something for services or for a trading transaction, the mistaken payment accrues from the trade of the recipient. This is entirely consistent with the manner in which Pertemps operates its business. At the time payments are deposited into the Pertemps’ bank account, it does not distinguish between overpayments and other receipts. Indeed it could not – as Pertemps banks payments before they are allocated to invoices on ledgers. Even if a receipt is eventually determined to be an overpayment, it will often be applied against other invoices rendered to the customer. ... HMRC submit, and we agree, that the overpayments are a natural consequence of the efficient and lawful way in which Pertemps conducts its business, and that these processes will mean that sometimes it makes more money from the supply of its services than it had anticipated. In doing so, it has supplemented its trading profits, and the receipt is a trading receipt. \[Emphasis added\] 50. In Gower Chemicals v HMRC \[2008\] UKSPC 713, the taxpayer carried on business selling chemicals. Chemicals were sold in reusable containers. UNCLASSIFIED 13 Customers paid a refundable deposit for a container that remained the property of the taxpayer. When a container was returned in good condition and in a reasonable time, the appellant would issue a credit note or refund the deposit. Sometimes containers were returned but the customer never took the credit or refund. 51. At issue was whether the unclaimed deposits were trading income. The Special Commissioners found that the deposits belonged to the taxpayer as soon as they were received and should be brought into income at that point. This was because the taxpayer knew that in the course of its business, 20 percent of the deposits would not have to be repaid. Special Commissioner Dr John Avery Jones stated (at \[7\]): The issue for me turns primarily on the nature of the receipt of the deposit by the Appellant. The Appellant knows that about 20 per cent of deposits will not have to be repaid. In my view this makes it impossible to say that the Appellant is merely holding the deposit for the customer. The straightforward analysis is that the deposit is a trading receipt just as the payment for the goods is a trading receipt but with the difference that about 80 per cent of the deposits will have to be repaid, for which it is right to make a provision. While I agree that factually this distinguishes this case from Prices Tailors, I do not consider that this changes anything. In that case the deposit was security for the completion of the garment that the customer had ordered. Deposits were in fact repaid to customers who did not accept the garment even though there was not contractual obligation to do so. The decision relied on Smart v Lincolnshire Sugar Co 20 TC 643 in which there was a contractual right to repayment of the deposit if a contingency occurred. The need for a provision for this was discussed in the case and it is recorded in Prices Tailors that the same point was raised. In my view the Appellant’s past accounting treatment was correct. The deposit belongs to the Appellant as soon as it is received and should be brought into income at that point. Summary of principles from the United Kingdom cases 52. It may appear that the reasoning in the UK cases is not always consistent. For example, as noted above, in Tattersall, the court found that the nature of a receipt for income tax purposes is fixed at the time it is received. However, the court in Jay’s the Jewellers took the view that a receipt could become income at a later date where its nature was changed by the operation of law. 53. Despite the apparent inconsistencies, it is considered that the above cases can all be reconciled. Where a later case has reached a different view than an earlier case, the later case has refined or expanded the principles set out in the earlier case and adapted them to the facts at issue. Consequently, the following principles can be taken from the above cases:  Where an amount is no longer liable to be repaid (whether by virtue of contractual terms, limitation or other statute), then it will become income (if it was not previously) (Jay’s the Jewellers).  Just because an amount may be subject to repayment does not mean that the amount cannot be income (Lincolnshire Sugar, Pertemps).  When an amount is held on trust for a third party, it will not be income (Tattersall).  Changing the accounting treatment of an amount will not, by itself, make that amount income (Tattersall).  Unsolicited overpayments that a taxpayer treats as their own money belong to the taxpayer unless the customer makes a successful claim (Pertemps).  Unsolicited overpayments and unclaimed refundable deposits are income in the year they are received (Pertemps, Gower Chemicals). UNCLASSIFIED 14 Application to unclaimed amounts of $100 or less in New Zealand 54. As noted above, for an amount to be derived it must be received beneficially by the taxpayer (that is, received free from legal impediments to the taxpayer dealing with the money in its own interests). In the context of unclaimed money, this is most likely to give rise to a question of whether an amount is held on trust or not. Therefore, the treatment of money held on trust is considered next. Money held on trust 55. Most unclaimed money will not be held on trust. For example, where a customer has overpaid an account, the overpayment will not normally be held on trust by the holder. The relationship between a customer and a business will normally be a contractual one. Similarly, the relationship between a bank and depositor will normally be one of debtor–creditor and not trust (see DFC New Zealand Ltd v Goddard \[1992\] 2 NZLR 445). However, in certain circumstances, unclaimed money may be held on trust by the holder. Examples include funds held in a real estate agent’s trust account or a solicitor’s trust account. 56. A trust will often (but not always) be evidenced by the existence of a trust deed. A trust will be present where the holder holds the unclaimed money for the benefit of a third party (the “owner” for unclaimed money purposes) and cannot deal with the money in their own interests. Therefore, to determine whether an amount is held on trust, it is necessary to look at the terms on which the money was originally paid and on which it is currently held. 57. As noted above, money held on trust is unlikely to be able to be applied by the holder for their own benefit without breaching the terms of the trust. Consequently, the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 will not be satisfied and the amounts will be unclaimed money. If s 4(1) is not satisfied, then the amounts cannot be income as they will be subject to the UMA 1971 and must be paid to Inland Revenue within the prescribed timeframes. If, on the other hand, the money is in fact applied by the holder for its own benefit, it is unlikely that the holder will be able to show that the money is held on trust (or otherwise not received beneficially). 58. The conclusion that money held on trust cannot be income of the holder is consistent with the case law considered above. None of the cases found that money held on trust could be income of the holder. 59. However, if money ceases to be held on trust (for example, by virtue of the terms of the trust or the application of a statutory provision) and the holder applies it for their own benefit, then s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 could apply and the amount could become income of the holder. In this case, the amount should be treated the same as amounts not held on trust. Money not held on trust 60. At issue is when (if at all) amounts of unclaimed money applied by the holder for their own benefit will be derived by the holder. As noted above, it is assumed that the amounts are received by the holder in the ordinary course of their business. 61. New Zealand case law on derivation has followed the Australian decision of Arthur Murray. Therefore, in New Zealand, income will be derived when what has taken place is enough to satisfy the general understanding among practical business people of what is derivation of income. The UK case law UNCLASSIFIED 15 may be of assistance in determining this. However, that case law was not considering the meaning of derivation, so care must be taken when applying the decisions in a New Zealand context. 62. In the case of unclaimed money, it could be argued that derivation occurs on receipt or at some point following receipt or that derivation never occurs. As no New Zealand case law is directly on point, it is necessary to consider the principles taken from the case law to determine how a court might apply them to resolve this issue. 63. Where a contractual or statutory provision (such as the Limitation Act 1950 or Limitation Act 2010) applies so that the holder of money will no longer be required to repay it if requested by the owner, then the amount will be income. This is consistent with the UK case law. It is also consistent with Arthur Murray and the New Zealand derivation cases, because the holder has to do nothing further to earn the amount and there is no possibility that the amount will be repayable. However, in many cases of unclaimed money, it is unlikely that the relevant Limitation Act will apply and there will be no contractual terms limiting the holder’s liability to repay. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether these amounts could be income even though they are still subject to the possibility of repayment. 64. As noted above, that an amount may be subject to repayment will not necessarily prevent it being income (see, for example, Lincolnshire Sugar, Pertemps, Gower Chemicals, Case N30, Bowcock). 65. Pertemps is the decision that is closest to the facts being considered. It could be argued that Pertemps should be applied in New Zealand, which would lead to the conclusion that (at least in the case of overpayments) the relevant amounts are income when they are received. However, this is not considered the correct approach for two reasons. First, in New Zealand the UMA 1971 potentially imposes some statutory obligations for the amounts until the proviso to s 4(1) applies to exclude the amount from being unclaimed money. Secondly, Pertemps is arguably inconsistent with the approach taken in Arthur Murray and the subsequent New Zealand cases. This is discussed in more detail from \[66\] onwards. In summary, it is considered that Pertemps provides support for the proposition that the amounts of unclaimed money are in the nature of income. However, it is not considered good authority in New Zealand for when that income is derived. 66. It could be argued that the fact (in many cases) the holder will always be liable to repay the relevant amounts to the owner (if asked) means applying Arthur Murray would lead to the conclusion that the amounts would never be derived. However, it is considered that the principles from Arthur Murray need to be interpreted in the context of the facts in that decision. Arthur Murray was considering prepaid services. This meant its analysis was focused on establishing when an amount would be “earned” where there was a future requirement to perform services on request. No consideration was given to what the position would be where there was no (or no longer an) obligation to perform any services. 67. The same point can be made about the decision in Sovereign Assurance. The Court of Appeal’s reliance on Arthur Murray in that case must also be placed in its proper context. The Court of Appeal was solely concerned with whether income was derived through being “earned”. However, in the case of unclaimed money the holder will not be providing services (or goods) to the customer. The very nature of an unclaimed amount means it cannot be earned. In this instance, derivation is not triggered when the amount is UNCLASSIFIED 16 “earned”. On that basis, Sovereign Assurance is of limited assistance in considering when derivation occurs for unclaimed amounts. 68. Case N30 expanded the scope of the principles from Arthur Murray. In Case N30 income was held to be derived even though the services paid for had not been performed. The earning process was found to be complete once it was probable that the service would not be required to be performed. 69. In the context of an amount of unclaimed money, that amount will not be “earned” in the sense of goods or services being provided for it. However, it is an amount that is received in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business, and it is being treated by the taxpayer as its own money (in the sense of having been applied for the holder’s use). As nothing further needs to be done by the taxpayer to earn the money, the only thing stopping it being derived is the fact it is subject to the contingency of repayment. As time passes, that contingency will become more remote. 70. Once it is probable that the unclaimed amount will not need to be repaid, it should be treated as income. The “probable” threshold is based on the test used in Case N30. A different standard may be more appropriate. For example, it could be argued that it is sufficient for an amount to be treated as income where it is “unlikely” that it will need to be repaid. However, on balance, it is considered that the case law better supports the slightly higher “probable” threshold. Practically, there may not be much difference in any event. 71. When it is probable that an amount will not be repaid will depend on the particular business. Business records and accounting treatment are likely to be relevant to determining this. For example, if business records show that once an amount is applied for the benefit of the holder under the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971, it is probable that it will not be paid back, then this suggests the amount should be returned as income at that time. If, on the other hand, the business records show that even after 10 years, customers still successfully request the return of unclaimed amounts (on more than just isolated occasions), then this may suggest that the amounts should not yet be treated as income. This will be a question of fact to be determined in each case. It is not possible to provide more prescriptive factors. 72. In summary, an unclaimed amount will be derived when it:  has been applied by the holder for its own benefit (that is, the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 applies); and  is probable that the amount will not have to be repaid (which would include situations (described in \[71\]) when the amount is not legally recoverable; for example, under a contractual term or a Limitation Act). Amounts subsequently repaid to owners 73. Section DA 1 sets out the general permission for deductibility. In particular, s DA 1(b) allows a deduction for an amount of expenditure to the extent to which it is incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable or excluded income. 74. The Rulings apply to amounts of unclaimed money that holders receive in the ordinary course of their business. The Commissioner’s view is that repayment of these amounts to their owners is also undertaken in the course of the holder’s business. Consequently, if a holder subsequently returns an amount that has previously been recognised as income, the holder would be entitled to a deduction under s DA 1(b). UNCLASSIFIED 17 Conclusions 75. For amounts of unclaimed money of $100 or less, while money is held on trust and cannot be (and has not been) applied by the holder for their own benefit (or for the benefit of any other person or for any purpose or object), it cannot be income of the holder. These amounts remain subject to the UMA 1971 and must be paid to the Commissioner within the specified timeframes. 76. An unclaimed amount (of $100 or less) not held on trust will be derived when it:  has been applied by the holder for its own benefit (that is, the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 applies); and  is probable that the amount will not have to be repaid (which would include situations when the amount is not legally recoverable; for example, under a contractual term or a Limitation Act). 77. When it is probable that an amount will not be repaid will depend on the particular business. Business records and accounting treatment are likely to be relevant to determining this. 78. If a holder has recognised a previously unclaimed amount as income and subsequently returns that amount to the owner, the holder will be entitled to a deduction under s DA 1(b). Example: Unclaimed money not held on trust 79. This example is included to assist in explaining the application of the law. 80. Supaphone Ltd is carrying on business as a telecommunications company. Many of Supaphone’s clients pay their accounts by monthly automatic payment. Sometimes when clients close their accounts with Supaphone, they forget to cancel their automatic payments straight away. This results in overpayments to Supaphone. Supaphone attempts to contact customers to return these overpayments, but these customers are often impossible to locate. Supaphone also receives payment by cheque. Sometimes, despite its best attempts, Supaphone cannot match the cheque received with a particular customer’s account. In both situations, the amounts received are subject to the UMA 1971. 81. Where unclaimed amounts are $100 or less, Supaphone applies them to its business (within the applicable timeframes) under the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971. At this time, the amounts are no longer subject to the UMA 1971. 82. Supaphone’s business records show that over the past 10 years, repayment requests are made for 50 percent of unclaimed amounts within four years of receipt. However, in the past 10 years only two people have requested the return of unclaimed money more than four years after it was received. Therefore, after four years it is probable that the amount will not have to be repaid. 83. Supaphone asks whether (and when) the unclaimed amounts of $100 or less are business income under s CB 1. 84. The unclaimed amounts are not held by Supaphone on trust. Therefore, the amounts will be income under s CB 1 when they are derived (assuming that no other timing regime applies). The amounts will be derived when: UNCLASSIFIED 18  Supaphone applies the amounts to its business under the proviso to s 4(1) of the UMA 1971 (which occurs around six years after receipt); and  it is probable that Supaphone will not have to repay the amounts (in this case four years after receipt). 85. As the later of these events is the application of the amounts under the proviso to s 4(1), the amounts are derived and should be returned as business income when Supaphone applies these amounts to its business.

### Tax Credit Scheme for Exporters

The Hon. Hugh Templeton, Minister in Charge of the Inland Revenue Department, announced recently that a proposal had been made to introduce a tax credit scheme for exporters who, because of tax losses or insufficient assessable income, were not able to obtain the full benefit of the existing increased exports taxation incentive allowance.

### Features of the Scheme will be:

*   It will be available to true exporters or true export houses who qualify for the deduction of the increased exports incentive allowance but who are unable to benefit either in full or in part from any resultant tax saving because of a loss situation or inadequate assessable income in the income year to which the allowance relates.
*   In these circumstances, to the extent the allowance of the increased exports incentive creates or increases a loss, taxpayers (both individuals and companies) can elect to convert the value of the incentive allowances for the income year to a tax credit at the flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. The credit will then be paid in the same manner as a normal tax refund.
*   Where the incentive deduction is converted to a tax credit, any tax loss otherwise arising from the deduction of the export incentive allowances in that income year will be considered to be finally dealt with and will not be available as a carry forward against future years' profits.
*   The export incentive allowance will be regarded as the final increment of any taxable loss for the purpose of converting to a tax credit. The test is whether the taxpayer receives the full tax saving benefit of the export incentive allowances in the income year.
*   Previous years' tax losses arising from the export incentive allowances will not be available for the purposes of converting to a tax credit but will continue to be available as a carry forward against current and future years' profits in the normal manner.

### Example:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Net profit before deducting incentive allowances |     |     | $100,000 |     |
| Less incentives: |     |     |     |     |
| *   Investment Allowances | $4,000 |     |     |     |
| *   Export Market Development Expenditure | $10,000 |     |     |     |
| *   Increased Export Incentive | $96,000 |     | $110,000 |     |
|     | LOSS |     | $10,000 |     |
| Add Losses brought forward from previous years(includes $50,000 applicable to prior years' export incentive allowances) |     |     | $94,000 |     |
| ACCUMULATED LOSSES |     |     | $104,000 |     |

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Steps in Calculating Tax Credit** |     |     |     |     |
| (1) Reduce current year's profit |     |     |     | $100,000 |
| by  |     |     |     |     |
| *   Investment Allowances |     | $4,000 |     |     |
| *   Export Market Development Expenditure Allowance |     | $10,000 |     |     |
| *   Losses Brought Forward |     | $94,000 |     | $108,000 |
|     |     | BALANCE OF LOSSES |     | $8,000 |

(2) As increased exports incentive allowance ($96,000) does not result in any tax saving for the year, it is converted to a tax credit of 45 cents in the $1, i.e. $96,000 x 4.5% = $43,200

(3) The export tax credit of $43,200 would be refunded to the taxpayer after the annual return of income is furnished.

(4) Balance of loss available for carry forward = $8,000.

**What is the Interpretation of a True Exporter or True Export House?**

_True Exporter_

A true exporter is a person who manufactures or produces the goods and exports on his own account or arranges the export of goods on a commission basis through an agent but at all times he remains the owner of the goods at the point of export.

_True Export House_

This would be regarded as the person or firm that:

*   Purchases goods from the manufacturer or other supplier and directly contracts the sale of those goods with an overseas buyer.
*   The overseas buyer would make payment to and also look to in completing and fulfilling the terms of the contract for the overseas order.
*   Carries all the risks in terms of performance and delivery in relation to the sale of the goods. Generally the question of "risk" would be determined where the recourse lies with the overseas buyer for non-performance or disputed performance of the contract.
*   Is actively engaged in seeking out export opportunities for New Zealand products.

### Third Party Arrangements

These arrangements which have been accepted up to 31 March 1978 will not be recognised for the purpose of incentive allowances in relation to export sales made after that date irrespective of the taxpayers' balance date.

### Export Incentive Allowances that Qualify

These will cover only the following incentive allowances:

*   Increased Exports Incentive Allowance — Section 156 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (includes the Compensatory Export Incentive Allowance)
*   New Markets Exports Incentive Allowance — Section 157 of the Income Tax Act 1976

The new credit scheme does not apply to export market development expenditure or any of the other incentive deductions.

The scheme is subject to legislation and further details will be available only when the legislation is introduced into Parliament.

### New Incentive Allowances For Exporters

### Introduction

The Income Tax Amendment Act 1979, recently passed by Parliament, introduces a new package of incentive allowances for exporters. The new incentive allowances apply to:

*   exporters of goods, manufactured, produced or processed in New Zealand.
*   exporters of certain services, such as architects and consultants.
*   royalties and know-how received from overseas.
*   overseas construction projects.
*   tourism.

The aim of the new incentives is to encourage exports which add to New Zealand's overseas exchange earnings. At the same time they give the greatest incentive benefit to those exporters whose goods or services have a substantial amount of domestic value added. In the case of goods it is to reward the further manufacture and processing of goods in New Zealand, which increases the value of the export product.

### Tax Credits Instead of Deductions from Assessable Income

An important feature of the new incentives is that they are given as a tax credit against tax payable. Any excess credit is refunded if it exceeds the tax otherwise payable. This provides exporters with a guaranteed rate of benefit on each dollar of export sale and allows exporters to immediately determine the quantum of benefit rather than having to wait until the end of the year.

Tax credits will be claimed in the annual return of income and where the tax credit exceeds the tax otherwise payable, refunds will be given priority as soon as the annual return of income is furnished.

### Partnerships

Where an export business is conducted as a partnership the tax credit available will be allocated to the respective partners in the same proportion as their incomes are allocated for tax purposes.

Further details of the new incentives follow:

Export Performance Incentive For Qualifying Goods - Section 156A
----------------------------------------------------------------

An incentive on the total export sales of qualifying goods based upon the domestic value added content of goods exported.

### Who May Claim

Any exporter (including an export merchant) of export goods (as defined) except:

*   Co-operative dairy, milk and pig marketing companies, unless the sale of export goods gives rise to assessable income.
*   Mining companies assessable for tax under section 216.
*   Non-resident mineral development companies - section 42 refers.
*   Organisations exempt from income tax.

The terms "exporter" and "export merchant" have the same meaning as under the existing increased export incentive allowance -refer PIB 94, page 23.

### Export Goods

These are goods specified in the schedule of export goods issued by the Secretary of Trade and Industry as qualifying for the incentive and must be goods which:

*   are sold by the taxpayer to an overseas purchaser, and
*   are owned by the taxpayer at the time of sale.

They do not include goods:

*   exported by way of gift.
*   taken out of New Zealand with the intention that they will be brought back to New Zealand.
*   sold by duty free shops or other stores to persons departing from New Zealand.
*   imported into New Zealand and subsequently exported without some form of processing, grading, or packing in New Zealand.

### How it Works

The incentive allowance is given as a tax credit, the rate of which varies according to the local domestic content of the goods exported. Exporters are not required to work out the domestic value added content for their goods as each export commodity has been assigned to a value added band in the schedule of export goods to be issued by the Secretary of Trade and Industry. It is anticipated that a final version of the schedule will be issued early next year.

All you need do is refer to the schedule and see which value added band has been allocated to your particular product. Each value added band represents a specified rate of tax credit which when multiplied by the fob sales of that product gives the total incentive allowance. Any enquiries regarding the schedule should be referred to the Department of Trade and Industry.

An advantage of the new scheme is that there is no base period sales requirement.

The following table shows the domestic value added bands and rates of incentive allowance.

| Band | Domestic Value Added % | Mid-Point | Specified Tax Credit Rate % |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   | 80-100 | 85  | 11.9 |
| B   | 70-80 | 75  | 10.5 |
| C   | 60-70 | 65  | 9.1 |
| D   | 50-60 | 55  | 7.7 |
| E   | 40-50 | 45  | 6.3 |
| F   | 20-40 | 30  | 4.2 |
| G   | 0-20 | 10  | 1.4 |

The rate of incentive for each band has been arrived at by taking 14 percent of the mid-point of the band. (In Band A the mid-point is set at 85 as in practice there are very few export goods with a domestic value added content exceeding 90 percent.)

**Example**

Assume qualifying goods exported were:

| Band | f.o.b. sales ($) |
| --- | --- |
| A   | 100,000 |
| B   | 200,000 |
| C   | 300,000 |
| D   | 400,000 |

To work out the incentive, multiply:

| $   | $   |
| --- | --- |
| 100,00 x 11.9% = | 11,900 |
| 200,00 x 10.5% = | 21,000 |
| 300,00 x 9.1% = | 27,300 |
| 400,00 x 7.7% = | 30,800 |
|     |     |
| Total incentive tax credit | $91,000 |

### Provision for Individual Assessment

In certain cases where an exporter considers that the domestic value added content allocated to his product is, at the mid-point of the band, too low, he may apply to the Development Finance Corporation for an alternative rate of domestic value added content to be determined.

If the individually assessed rate of domestic value added content is approved, the rate of incentive rebate (referred to as the assigned percentage) will be 14 percent of that individually assessed domestic content.

The individual assessment option will only apply in respect of export goods:

*   where the fob sales in that year or in the previous year in respect of those goods exceeds $100,000 or
*   the domestic value added content in those goods is more than $50,000 on the basis of the schedule.

Any assigned percentage rate determined by the Corporation will apply to the income year in which the application is made and the four succeeding income years unless a further individual assessment is undertaken in the meantime.

If the assigned rate of incentive credit is less than the rate allowable under the schedule, the specified or schedule rate will be reduced by not more than 0.7 in the first year and will be reduced to the assigned rate in the next succeeding year, e.g. schedule rate 9.1 percent; Assigned percentage 8.0 percent; Assigned percentage 1st year 8.4 percent.

Enquiries about the self-assessment procedures should be made direct to the Department of Trade and Industry which has offices in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

### Joint Fishing Ventures with Foreign Boat Owners

The specified rates allocated to each domestic value added band do not apply to goods exported by businesses involved in joint fishing arrangements with foreign boat owners. Parties to these arrangements must apply to the Development Finance Corporation for an individual assessment.

In addition, the option period to move to the new scheme will not apply to joint fishing ventures. These ventures will automatically move to the new incentive scheme in the income year commencing 1 April 1980.

### Goods Imported into New Zealand and Re-exported

In the case of imported goods which are subsequently exported after processing and packing in New Zealand, and the landed cost of those goods is 80 percent or more of the fob export value, the specified rate of tax credit is 1.4 percent as for value added Band G. This is irrespective of the type of goods involved.

### Artificial Trading Arrangements

As with the previous export incentive allowance, special provisions apply to deter artificial arrangements involving third parties.

### How to Claim

Complete form IR320 and attach to your tax return. This form will be available early next year.

### Alternative Incentive Allowance for Certain Multinational Companies

In certain circumstances these companies may lose the benefit of New Zealand export incentive allowances when the tax paid in New Zealand on New Zealand profits is allowed as a credit in the country of residence.

Provision exists in these cases for the export incentive tax credits to be granted by way of customs duty relief.

Application should be made to:

**Comptroller of Customs, Customs Department,Private Bag,Wellington.**

### Commencing Date

This incentive will come into force in the income year commencing 1 April 1980, or corresponding accounting year, although there will be an option period whereby exporters will have until the income year commencing 1 April 1983 to move to the new scheme. Exporters of goods who will be better off under the new scheme will no doubt want to move over to the new scheme as from the income year commencing 1 April 1980 whereas other exporters may want to take advantage of the option period in order to adjust to the new scheme. To allow this the previous increased export incentive scheme will not terminate until the income year ending 31 March 1983.

Once an election is made to move to the new scheme, it is on a "once and for all" basis and is irrevocable.

For details of the previous scheme see pages 23 and 24 of Public Information Bulletin No.94 October 1978.

Export Performance Incentive For Qualifying Services - Section 156B
-------------------------------------------------------------------

An incentive to encourage the supply overseas of certain services.

### Who May Claim

*   Any taxpayer carrying on business in New Zealand who supplies qualifying services to overseas clients in relation to overseas projects.
*   Any taxpayer who receives royalties and know-how payments either directly or indirectly from outside New Zealand.

**Qualifying Services**

These will be set out in a schedule to be issued by the Secretary of Trade and Industry and will include those services that presently qualify under the existing incentive scheme, namely:

*   Architectural (including contract supervision) services, surveying, valuation, design or planning services.
*   Engineering (including contract supervision) services, not being services that qualify under the incentive allowance relating to overseas construction projects.
*   Advisory services relating to the establishment of accounting, auditing, management, organisational, training or other systems including the provision of data processing programs in relation to any such system.
*   Advisory services relating to the establishment or development of any farming, agricultural, horticultural, fishing or forestry project.
*   Royalties and know-how payments in relation to trademarks, copyrights, technical information and assistance that has been developed from work substantially performed in New Zealand.

Additional services may be added from time to time.

### How it Works

Allows a tax credit of 11.9 percent of the net foreign currency earnings which are actually remitted to New Zealand through the banking system in respect of those services, or which are paid in New Zealand from funds held in New Zealand otherwise remittable in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations 1978.

**Example**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Gross fees from qualifying services | $20,000 |
| Less overseas expenditure | $5,000 |
| Net foreign currency earnings | $15,000 |
| Net foreign currency earnings transferred to New Zealand through the New Zealand banking system | $10,000 |
| Tax credit is 11.9% of $10,000 | $1,190 |

### How to Claim

Complete form IR318 and attach it to your return of income. This form will be available early next year.

### Commencing Date

The new incentive will first apply to the income year commencing 1 April 1980 or corresponding accounting year. As it gives a greater incentive benefit than under the existing incentive scheme, the existing scheme will terminate with the income year ending 31 March 1980 or corresponding accounting year.

Export Performance Incentive For Qualifying Overseas Projects - Section 156D
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An incentive to encourage New Zealand firms to undertake engineering, construction and development projects overseas.

### Who May Claim

Any taxpayer carrying on business in New Zealand who derives overseas exchange from a qualifying project.

### Qualifying Projects

These are the same types of overseas projects which qualify under the existing incentive scheme, namely:

*   Construction work such as building, roading, drainage, water reticulation and reclamation.
*   The establishment or development of any farming, agricultural, fishing, or forestry project.

### How it Works

Allows a tax credit of 11.9 percent of the net foreign currency earnings which are actually remitted to New Zealand in respect of that project, or which are paid in New Zealand from funds held in New Zealand otherwise remittable in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations 1978.

Normally the credit is allowed in the income year in which the obligations under all contracts relating to the qualifying project are completed.

However, there is provision to allow an interim tax credit where a qualifying project extends over a period of two or more income years and there are overseas exchange earnings derived in any income year of the project. Any interim allowance is subject to a "square up" at the end of the project.

**Example**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Gross fees from qualifying projects | $1,500,000 |
| Less overseas expenditure | $1,300,000 |
| Net foreign currency earnings | $200,000 |
| Net foreign currency earnings transferred to New Zealand through the New Zealand banking system | $140,000 |
| Tax credit is 11.9% of $140,000 | $16,660 |

### How to Claim

Complete form IR319 and attach it to your return of income. This form will be available early next year.

### Commencing Date

The new incentive comes into force with respect to any qualifying project which COMMENCED on or after the income year commencing 1 April 1980 or corresponding accounting year.

Projects which commenced prior to that date will continue to qualify for the existing incentive deduction under section 158A.

Export Performance Incentive - Tourism - Section 156E
-----------------------------------------------------

A new incentive to encourage foreign exchange earnings through the tourist industry.

### Who May Claim

Any taxpayer carrying on a business in New Zealand as a tourist wholesaler or retailer who sells qualifying tourist services.

### Qualifying Tourist Services

These are services of the following kind supplied within New Zealand to tourists from overseas:

*   accommodation
*   sustenance
*   internal transport
*   admission to or use of tourist facilities, e.g. ski-hire.

The payment for these services must be made in foreign currency PRIOR to the arrival of the tourist in New Zealand.

### How it Works

Allows a tax credit of 10 percent of the net foreign currency earnings which are actually remitted to New Zealand through the banking system in respect of qualifying tourist services, or which are paid in New Zealand from funds held in New Zealand otherwise remittable in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations 1978.

**Example**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Gross fees from qualifying tourist services | $80,000 |
| Less overseas expenditure | $10,000 |
| Net foreign currency earnings | $70,000 |
| Net foreign currency earnings transferred to New Zealand through the New Zealand banking system | $70,000 |
| Tax credit is 10% of $70,000 | $7,000 |

### How to Claim

Complete form IR321 and attach it to the annual return of income. This form will be available early next year.

### Commencing Date

The new incentive will first apply to the income year commencing 1 April 1980, or corresponding accounting year.

Export-Market Development And Tourist-Promotion Incentive - Section 156F
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An incentive to promote:

*   the export of New Zealand goods that have been manufactured, produced, assembled, processed or packed or graded and sorted in New Zealand;
*   tourism;
*   the export of services in relation to construction projects, courses of educational training or the furnishing of technical advice or assistance;
*   the grant or assignment of rights outside New Zealand in connection with patents of:
    *   inventions
    *   trademarks
    *   designs
    *   copyrights.

### Who May Claim

Any taxpayer who has incurred qualifying export-market development expenditure or tourist-promotion expenditure.

### How It Works

The new incentive differs from the existing additional 50 percent deduction incentive in four respects:

*   It redefines the list of qualifying export promotion expenditure. Generally, only those costs which are incurred OUTSIDE New Zealand in promoting exports or tourism qualify - this will include remuneration of New Zealand-based employees while travelling abroad on export promotion. Costs incurred within New Zealand, in promoting exports, including salaries and wages, may however, qualify for an Export Programme Grant administered by the Department of Trade and Industry or a Tourism Export Programme Grant administered by the Tourist and Publicity Department.
*   The incentive allowance is a tax credit of 67.5 percent of qualifying expenditure.
*   Where the incentive tax credit is allowed in respect of qualifying expenditure an ordinary deduction from assessable income is not also allowable in respect of that expenditure.
*   Expenditure in respect of which an Export Programme Grant or Tourism Export Programme Grant has been received will not also qualify for the incentive. However, the proportion of the expenditure not REIMBURSED by the grant will be allowed as an ordinary deduction from assessable income.

To qualify for the incentive the export promotion expenditure must -

*   be of a kind that would, if it had not been for the specific provision in this section disallowing the deduction, in the normal course qualify as an ordinary deduction for tax purposes (i.e. capital expenditure would not be allowed);
*   have been incurred -
    *   primarily and principally for the purposes of seeking markets (including the retention of existing markets) or the obtaining of market information or market research, or creating or increasing demand for the export of goods or services as described above, or
    *   primarily and principally for the purposes of attracting overseas tourists to New Zealand.

### Qualifying and Non-qualifying Expenditure

| Qualifying Expenditure | Non-qualifying Expenditure |
| --- | --- |
| Overseas travel - fares, accommodation and sustenance incurred by the taxpayer himself, or an employee of either the taxpayer or an associated company. | *   Entertainment expenses.<br>*   Holiday expenses, non-working spouse or relatives' travel. |
| Salaries and wages in respect of the time spent outside New Zealand by an employee including an an employee of an associated company. | *   Director's fees.<br>*   Salary and wages in respect of employee's time within New Zealand. |
| Payments to a New Zealand agent in respect of travel undertaken by that agent outside New Zealand. | *   Commissions on sales<br>*   Payments for work carried out in New Zealand. |
| Payments to an overseas agent for the purposes of activities carried on outside New Zealand. | *   Commissions on sales. |
| Expenses outside New Zealand including salaries and wages of a person employed outside New Zealand. | *   Director's fees.<br>*   Entertainment expenses. |
| Expenses (including those incurred in New Zealand) of advertising outside New Zealand. | *   Costs of advertising inside New Zealand. |
| Expenses (including costs of delivery) directly attributable to providing samples or technical information to a person outside New Zealand - reduced by any consideration received in respect of those samples or technical information. |     |
| Expenses in relation to the furnishing of any bid bond, performance bond, or working capital bond, or interest paid on money borrowed for payment of deposits in lieu of such bonds for the purposes of submitting a tender for the supply of qualifying services. |     |
| Expenses of bringing potential customers to New Zealand - includes travel, accommodation and sustenance. | *   Entertainment expenses. |
| Costs incurred outside New Zealand in:— the preparation or submission of tenders or quotations.— sales promotion activities or campaigns. | *   Costs incurred within New Zealand. |
| Expenses of exhibiting at export trade fairs in New Zealand - to be approved by the Secretary of Trade and Industry. | *   Non-approved fairs in New Zealand. |

**Example**

Assume that the taxpayer has received an export programme grant of $12,800 in respect of qualifying expenditure of $20,000.

### Qualifying Expenditure

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Salaries and wages | $17,000 |
| Overseas travel and accommodation | $5,250 |
| Net cost of samples | $750 |
| Advertising overseas | $2,000 |
| Total qualifying expenditure | $25,000 |
| Qualifying expenditure in respect of which grant was made | $20,000 |
| Expenditure which qualifies for tax credit | $5,000 |
| **Tax Credit** |     |
| Tax credit is 67.5% of $5,000 i.e. | $3,375 |

**Note:** Of the total expenditure of $25,000 only $7,200 will be allowable as an ordinary deduction from assessable income. The remainder ($17,800) would not be allowable because:

*   $12,800 was reimbursed by means of an Export Programme Grant.
*   $ 5,000 is eligible for the Export Market Development Incentive.

### Salaries and Wages Paid to Shareholder/Employees

Salaries and wages paid to shareholder/employees, to the extent that they are paid in the circumstances in which wages to normal employees would qualify, (generally when engaged in export promotion work overseas) will, in the main, qualify for the incentive. However, the Department will need to be satisfied that the payments are not excessive, i.e. in excess of what would be paid to an arm's length employee suitably qualified to carry out those functions.

### How to Claim

Complete form IR323 and attach it to your return of income. This form will be available early next year.

### Commencing Date

This incentive will first apply to expenditure incurred in the income year commencing 1 April 1980 or corresponding accounting year.

Export-Market Development Activities Incentive - Self-Employed Taxpayers - Section 156G
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An incentive to promote the supply of services outside New Zealand in relation to construction projects, educational training courses, technical advice or assistance.

### Who May Claim

Any taxpayer (not being a company) who is in business in New Zealand on his own account or as a member of a partnership and has engaged in export-market development activities performed outside New Zealand.

### How It Works

Allows a tax credit of 67.5 percent of the value of time spent on export-market development activities outside New Zealand. The value of time is an assessed rate which is effectively 25 percent of the minimum hourly charge out rate for the particular profession of the taxpayer.

In any case where a person has received an export programme grant or a grant under the existing export-market development grant scheme in respect of the value of time, an adjustment will be required to the tax incentive scheme.

**Example**

Assume:

*   Taxpayer spent 1,000 hours on qualifying export-market development activities.
*   The minimum hourly rate customarily charged out for a principal in this profession is $20.
*   During the year, taxpayer received an Export Programme Grant in respect of the value of time of $1,920.

### Value of Time Calculation

Based on the following formula:

**Tax Credit**

Tax credit is 67.5 percent of $3,500 = $2,362.50

### How To Claim

Complete form IR324 and attach to your return of income. This form will be available early next year.

### Special Point To Note

As with the revised export-market development and tourist-promotion incentive scheme, the export promotion activities relate to work performed outside New Zealand. Although work performed in New Zealand does not qualify under the tax incentive scheme, it is possible for such work to qualify under the Export Programme Grants Scheme briefly discussed below.

### Commencing Date

This new incentive will first apply to the income year commencing 1 April 1980 or corresponding accounting year.

Export Programme Grants Scheme And Tourism Export Programme Grants Scheme
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are new schemes and replace both the new markets development grants and export-market development grants schemes to the extent that they applied in the past. As announced in the Budget, they have been formulated with the specific aim of encouraging thorough and co-ordinated research into the marketing abroad of New Zealand goods and services including tourism.

Grants will be paid at a rate of 64 percent of qualifying expenditure with the balance of expenditure being ordinarily deductible for tax purposes. This gives a level of assistance of just over 80 cents in the dollar.

Expenditure on which a grant has been based will not also qualify for the new export-market development and tourist-promotion incentive.

Expenditure qualifying for grants will generally be of a wider nature than is available under the tax incentive scheme, and will include costs incurred within New Zealand such as salaries and wages and value of time in promoting overseas markets.

To qualify under the grants schemes the overseas markets must have sufficient potential for future development.

Enquiries about the Export Programme Grants Scheme should be directed to:

**_Department of Trade and Industry,Private Bag,Wellington._**

Enquiries about the Tourism Export Programme Grants Scheme should be directed to:

**_Tourist and Publicity Department, PO Box 95,Wellington._**

Termination Of Old Tax Incentive Schemes
----------------------------------------

Because of the introduction of the new range of export taxation incentive schemes, the following existing schemes will automatically terminate with the income year ending 31 March 1980 or corresponding accounting year.

*   Additional 50 percent export-market and tourist-promotion development expenditure allowance - section 154.
*   Export market development incentive for self-employed persons - section 155.
*   Export of Qualifying services - section 158.

As discussed earlier in this Bulletin, there are special provisions relating to the phasing out of the increased export incentive scheme for goods and the previous deduction scheme for qualifying overseas projects.

Terminating Dates Of New Incentive Schemes
------------------------------------------

The Income Tax Amendment Act 1979 introduces a new schedule of Terminating Dates into the principal Act. In terms of that schedule the new export incentives have a terminating date of 31 March 1985 or corresponding accounting year.

Non-Resident Withholding Tax, Royalties and Know-How Payments
-------------------------------------------------------------

1\. We have been asked to set out the changes made by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1980 to the Income Tax Act 1976 dealing with the taxation of royalties and know-how payments and how the new provisions compare with the previous position.

num

**2\. Position up to 31 March 1980**

1.  Royalties and know-how payments were deemed to be assessable income under sections 65(2)(h) and (i) Income Tax Act 1976. These provisions were repealed last year and replaced by the provisions detailed in paragraph 3 below.
2.  Repealed 65(2)(h):"All royalties or other like payments dependent upon production from or the use of any real or personal property, whether or not they are instalments of the purchase price of any property."
3.  Repealed 65(2)(i):"All payments for the supply, in connection with the carrying on of a business, of scientific, technical, industrial, or commercial knowledge, information, or assistance, not being payments which the Commissioner is satisfied constitute wholly reimbursement of expenditure that:
    *   "(i) is of a kind that is deductible under this Act, and
    *   "(ii) is incurred, in relation to the payments, by the person to whom the payments are made."
4.  The repealed section 65(2)(i) dealt with what is generally known as "know-how" payments. The inclusion of the word "assistance" in that section meant that payments which were essentially for services were included in assessable income unless they constituted wholly a reimbursement of expenditure.

**3\. New Position from 1 April 1980**

1.  The term "royalty" is now comprehensively defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 as follows:'Royalty includes a payment of any kind, whether periodical or not and however described or computed, to the extent to which it is derived as consideration for -
    
    1.  The use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right:
    2.  The use of, or the right to use, any mine or quarry:
    3.  The extraction, removal, or other exploitation of, or the right to extract, remove, or otherwise exploit, standing timber or any natural resource:
    4.  The use of, or the right to use:
        1.  Any motion picture film; or
        2.  Any films or videotapes for use in connection with television; or
        3.  Any tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting:
    5.  The supply of scientific, technical, industrial, or commercial knowledge or information:
    6.  The supply of any assistance which is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of anything referred to in any of the paragraphs (a) to (e) of this definition:
    7.  The total or partial forbearance of -
        1.  The use of, or the granting of the right to use, any property or right referred to in any of the paragraphs (a) to (d) of this definition; or
        2.  The supply of any knowledge or information referred to in paragraph (e) of this definition or of any assistance referred to in paragraph (f) of this definition, -
    
    *   whether or not that payment is an instalment of the purchase price of any real or personal property.'
    
    2.  This definition fits in with international practice, New Zealand's double taxation treaties and the policies of the OECD.
    3.  In place of the repealed sections 65(2)(h) and (i) "all royalties" are now deemed to be assessable income by the new section 65(2)(h). Consequential amendments have been made to sections 243(2)(p), 310(2), 317(b) and 318(1) using the newly defined term "royalty" rather than references to sections 65(2)(h) and 65(2)(i) as was done previously.
    4.  To summarise the tax position "royalties" as defined are:
        *   deemed to be assessable income under section 65(2)(h);
        *   deemed to be derived from New Zealand under section 243(2)(p);
        *   defined as non-resident withholding income by section 310(2);
        *   liable to non-resident withholding tax at a flat rate of 15 percent on gross payments which is:
            1.  a final tax (under section 317(b)) for copyright royalties;
            2.  a minimum tax (under section 318) for other royalties, the tax on which is the greater of:
                *   the non-resident withholding tax under section 311, i.e., 15 percent on the gross payments, or
                *   the tax calculated under an annual assessment on the net amount after deducting expenses.

Agreements for the avoidance of double taxation which New Zealand has with other countries may limit the amount of New Zealand tax payable by the residents of these countries. Reference should be made to the particular agreement.

**4\. Know-How**

Paragraph (e) of the definition of royalty refers to "know-how" payments and in contrast to the repealed section 65(2)(i) no longer includes the word "assistance". Payments which are essentially for services are no longer included in assessable income except to the extent that the services are connected with the application or enjoyment of "royalties" in the wider sense of the new definition as provided for in paragraph (f).

num

**5\. Services**

1.  This type of payment may only be taxed in New Zealand to the extent that the services are performed in New Zealand. If the services are performed both in New Zealand and overseas an apportionment will be necessary.
2.  Generally, where an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation is in force a permanent establishment must exist in New Zealand for the services to be taxed here. Reference should be made to the particular agreement.

**6\. Distinction Between Know-How and Services**

*   (1) The distinction between a payment for "know-how" and a payment for "services" is not always an easy one and much, of course, will depend on the facts of a particular case, having regard to the contract or agreement entered into between the parties.
*   (2) The main distinction between know-how and services is that the former is an asset and, as such, it is something which is already in existence and is not brought into being in pursuance of a particular contract. Thus, if a contract is one for the supply, for the use of the "buyer", of what might be broadly termed here a "product" which is already in existence, or substantially so, it is a contract for the supply of know-how and payments under the contract would be royalties.
*   (3) On the other hand, if a contractor is required to supply his special skills and knowledge in order to bring "the product" into existence for the buyer, payments under the contract would be considered to be for services and would not constitute a royalty.

1982 Provisional Tax
====================

In the 1981 IR3 tax guide we pointed out that it is quite acceptable to use the new tax rates which applied from 1 February 1981 in calculating 1982 provisional tax.

num

However, a quick and simple method is to deduct the following amounts from the tax calculated for 1981.

num

**Assessable Income**

$5,500 to $12,600 reduce 1981 tax by $100

num

$12,601 to $17,600 reduce 1981 tax by $200

num

$17,601 and over reduce 1981 tax by $300

Income Tax Amendment Act 1981
=============================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act 1981 from PIB vol 117 June 1982.

.

Recent legislative changes have enabled the introduction of the use of an amalgamated form instead of the previously separate PAYE reconciliation and employer accident compensation levy statements. The following is the text of a letter issued to all employers with the new form in March 1982.

### Annual Paye Reconciliation and Employer Accident Compensation Levy Statement - IR68

**Introduction**

Following legislative changes introduced in 1981, from 1 April 1982 only a single combined form (IR68) will be issued to employers for the purposes of both the annual PAYE reconciliation and the accident compensation (employer's levy) payment. The previous separate PAYE reconciliation (IR68) and accident compensation levy (ACC 501) statements will no longer be required. This note provides an explanation of details of the new procedures in relation to the new combined form. The combined form is enclosed for completion.

### Due Dates

The due date for furnishing the combined IR68 and payment of the employer accident compensation levy is 31 May 1982. A 10% penalty for late payment is charged on any levy not paid by 31 May. In previous years the PAYE reconciliation was due by 15 May and the employer accident compensation levy statement with payment was due by 30 June.

### Permanent Cessation as an Employer

An employer who has permanently ceased paying wages is required to furnish the PAYE reconciliation and accident compensation statements for wages paid from 1 April to the date of cessation. From 1 April 1982 only the new combined form should be used. The IR68 form for the purposes of this final statement is obtainable from any Inland Revenue office. It is due by the 15th day of the second month after employing ceases and should be accompanied by the payment for the accident compensation levy payable.

### Levy Year As the PAYE portion of the combined form relates to wages paid in the year ended 31 March 1982 the employer accident compensation levy to be calculated by reference to those same wages will, for convenience, also be referred to as 1982 levy.

Other Changes Other legislative changes provide for the abolition, from 1 April 1982, of provisional levies payable by new employers and of "cessation" adjustments when ceasing to employ. Transitional adjustments may assist in the following circumstances:

*   If you commenced employing after 1 April 1980 and have made a 1982 provisional levy payment, you will be entitled to deduct that payment from your actual levy liability. Show the payment in the panel provided on the IR68, immediately below the total levy figure.
*   If you were employing at 1 April 1980 and have ceased to employ after 1 April 1982, you may be entitled to a levy adjustment on cessation. If this is the case you should make written application for a cessation adjustment which will be considered under the provisions of section 80(7)(f) of the Accident Compensation Act 1972. Any adjustment will generally be made along similar lines to such adjustments made before the abolition of provisional and cessation procedures.

### Shareholder-Employees

Remuneration determined up to 31 May in respect of the year ended 31 March 1982 for shareholder-employees should be included in the figures for the PAYE reconciliation and the levy paid thereon by 31 May. Where the shareholder-employee's remuneration is determined after 31 May but before 30 November, a form ACC 506 should be furnished by 30 November with the levy payment.

Two further questions have been included on the IR68 (bottom left-hand panel). Your answers to these questions will ensure that you are issued with the correct forms for accident compensation levy purposes.

### Special Arrangements

The Department has special arrangements with a number of large businesses whereby each branch of the business reconciles eparately its PAYE tax deductions and the Head Office accounts for the accident compensation levy. In these cases the individual branches may continue to complete the top part of the reconciliation statement (IR68) in respect of the PAYE tax deductions. The IRD number of the branch which is responsible for the accident compensation levy should be entered in the panel at the bottom left of the form.

It is the responsibility of the employer to ensure that both the PAYE tax deduction and accident compensation levy information is included in the form.

### Completion

After completion, the first two copies of the form should be forwarded to the nearest Inland Revenue office together with the tax deduction certificates and the levy payment. The third copy should be forwarded only in those cases where a receipt for the levy payment is required. The fourth copy should be retained as part of your wage records.

### Enquiries

Further information relating to an employer's responsibilities in respect of PAYE and accident compensation levies are explained in the booklets "Levies on Employers" and "Guide to Employers" from any Inland Revenue office. The changes outlined in this note will be incorporated when the booklets are reprinted.

If you require advice about your PAYE tax or employer accident compensation levy obligations, including the completion of the IR68, the staff in your nearest Inland Revenue office will be pleased to answer any query. Enquiries should be directed to the EV&A Section.

Income Tax Amendment Act 1982, Supplement 1
===========================================

1982 Legislation
----------------

This pubication contains answers to a number of questions which have been raised since Public Information Bulletin Number 120 was printed.

The information contained in these answers was not covered in PIB 120

Income Tax Amendment Act 1982
-----------------------------

Section 8 - Principal Income Earner Rebate (Section 50B of principal Act)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question

When can National Superannuitants claim the principal income earner rebate?

### Answer

The rebate can be claimed in the returns of income filed by or on behalf of National Superannuitants in the year they first receive National Superannuation and the year of death (except where National Superannuation commences on 1 April or death occurs on 31 March). The rebate is calculated in the ordinary way on the income derived during the whole year.

Sections 8 and 13 - Principal Income Earner Rebate (Sections 50B and 53C of the Principal Act)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 1

In grossing up the family income for the purposes of the family rebate, are incomes of both husband and wife grossed up full year equivalents and on what basis are they grossed up?

### Answer

The incomes of both husband and wife are grossed up for the purpose of the rebate. The grossing up is based on the period of time each taxpayer is in the country, not on the basis of the length of time employed.

### Question 2

What is the relationship between grossing up of the principle income earner rebate and the family rebate and section 56?

### Answer

The correct treatment will depend on whether the taxpayer is **"an absentee personally present in New Zealand"** or a **"resident"** during the period he is personally present in New Zealand.

Under section 37 an "absentee" means a person who has not been a "resident" during **any part** of the income year.

Under section 241 a "resident" is defined as a person who, either -

1.  has his permanent place of abode in New Zealand, or
2.  is personally present in New Zealand for a continuous period of 365 days or more.

This means that for a person who enters or departs from New Zealand during the income year and is resident in New Zealand during his presence (eg, he arrives with the intention of taking up permanent residence) the income is grossed up to its annual equivalent under the new sections 50B and 53C of the Act. Section 56 has no application in this case as the taxpayer is not an absentee, by virtue of the fact that for a part of the income year he was **resident** in New Zealand.

On the other hand a person who enters or departs from New Zealand during the income year and was an "absentee" during his stay (eg, a person on a 3 month working holiday in New Zealand) is treated as follows:

1.  Firstly, that person's income is grossed up to its annual equivalent under the provisions of sections 50B and 53C of the Act and the rebate is calculated.
2.  Secondly, section 56 allows this rebate subject to an apportionment **based on the period of time the person was employed in New Zealand.**

Income Tax Amendment Act 1982
=============================

Archived legislative commentary on Income Tax Amendment Act 1982 from PIB vol 120 Mar 1983.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 120, March 1983

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

### Section 1 - Short Title

This provides for the Amendment Act to be read with and form part of the Income Tax Act 1976.

### Section 2 - Application

The provisions of this Amendment Act apply to tax on income derived in the income year which commenced on 1 April 1982, unless otherwise stated in the amendment act.

It is important to check the commencement date when applying any of the amending sections. The commentary which follows will also bring this out.

### Section 3 - Back Pay Rebate

This section amends section 44 of the principal Act by abolishing the back pay rebate with effect from l October 1982.

Any retrospective pay, as defined by section 44(1), received up to and including 30 September 1982 will still qualify for the rebate of 6 cents in the dollar.

Employers should record in the employee's 1983 tax deduction certificate only qualifying back pay paid out during the period 1 April 1982 to 30 September 1982.

### Section 4 - Overtime and Shiftwork Rebate

This section amends section 45 of the principal Act by abolishing the overtime and shiftwork rebate with effect from 1 October 1982. Employers should record in the employee's 1983 tax deduction certificate only overtime hours and qualifying shifts worked during the period 1 April 1982 to 30 September 1982.

Any period of shiftwork which started prior to midnight on 30 September and finished after midnight of the same night will qualify for the rebate.

Where a determination has been made by the Commissioner in terms of subsections (3) or   (5) of section 45, for the full year, the employer should enter half the number of overtime hours and shifts so determined, on the employee's tax deduction certificate.

### Section 5 - First Home Mortgage Interest Rebate

This section gives effect to the Budget announcement that from 1 October 1982 the first home mortgage interest rebate will be calculated at the rate of 31 cents instead of 50 cents for each dollar of qualifying interest.

Because the change applies from 1 October 1982, ie, half way through the 1983 income year, the rate of rebate for the 1983 year will be equal to the aggregate of one-half of each of the old and new rates as the following table shows:

| Income Year Ended 31 March | Amount of Rebate: - Lesser of $1,000 OR: | Maximum Amount of Qualifying Interest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1982 | 50% of qualifying interest paid | $2,000 |
| 1983 | 40.5% of qualifying interest paid | $2,469 |
| 1984 and Subsequent | 31% of qualifying interest paid | $3,225 |

**Note:** The only change in this rebate is to the rate of rebate. The maximum allowable rebate per year remains at $1,000, but the effect of the reduced rate of rebate is to increase the maximum amount of qualifying interest for the 1983 and subsequent years, as shown above.

### Section 6 - Rebate For Interest On Home Vendor Mortgage

This section amends section 49A of the principal Act by abolishing the home vendor mortgage interest rebate as from Budget night, 5 August 1982. Taxpayers holding approvals issued by the Housing Corporation on or before 5 August 1982 will continue to be able to claim the rebate.

### Section 7 - Child Rebate

This section amends section 50A of the principal Act to give effect to the Budget announcement that the rebate of $78 pa available for school children is to be increased to $156 with effect from 1 October 1982.

In the 1983/84 income year (the first full year of application) the rebate will effectively exclude from income tax the first $796 of a qualifying child's income.

**Example**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Gross income | $796 |
| Less Standard Deduction 2 percent | 16  |
|     | $780 |
| Tax at 20 cents | $156 |
| Less Child Rebate | $156 |
| Tax to pay | Nil |

Because the change applies from 1 October 1982 the effective rebate for the 1983 income year will be $117.

In the year a child leaves school and the family benefit ceases to be payable he will have the choice of claiming either the Child Rebate or the Principal Income Earner Rebate (PIER). For the 1983 income year it will be to the advantage of the child to claim the PIER where his income exceeds $4,306.

**Example (1982/83 Income Year)**

|     | Child Rebate | PIER |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gross Income of child | $4,306.00 | $4,306.00 |
| Less standard deduction 2% | 52.00 | 52.00 |
|     | $4,254.00 | $4,254.00 |
| Tax at 17.25 cents | 733.81 | 733.81 |
| Less Rebate | 117.00 | 116.98 |
| Tax Payable | $616.81 | $616.83 |

All other qualifying criteria for the Child Rebate remain unchanged.

### Section 8 - Principal Income Earner Rebate

This section inserts a new section 50B in the principal Act implementing the new Principal Income Earner Rebate. This is one of the "transitional measures" announced in the Budget.

**Who May Claim The Rebate**

The rebate will be available to single adults without children and the Principal Income Earner in a married or de facto household without children. A single adult (or a principal income earner in a married or de facto household) with children will also be eligible for the rebate in cases where it exceeds the amount of the family rebate he would otherwise be eligible for under the Family Rebate, provided in the new section 53C of the Act (inserted by section 13 of the Amendment Act).

Those who will not qualify for the PIER are those who for the full year, have been:

*   Children for whom the family benefit has been payable.
*   Spouses of Principal Income Earners.
*   National Superannuitants.
*   Principal income Earners who have claimed a greater amount by way of "Family Rebate".

This means:

*   If a child leaves school during the year and commences work he will have a choice of claiming either the PIER or Child Rebate, whichever gives the greater advantage.  
    See commentary on section 7.
*   A person who marries or enters a permanent de facto relationship, or is separated during the income year will qualify for the rebate for that year even if he is the secondary earner.
*   A Person who becomes a National Superannuitant during the year will qualify for the rebate.
*   Where a National Superannuitant dies during the income year a PIER will be allowed in the return filed to date of death.

Where a permanent de facto relationship exists, it is to be treated in the same way as a conventional family unit. This means that a de facto spouse will not qualify for the PIER if his or her income is less than that of the other spouse.

**Choice of PIER in Families with Children**

Principal income earners in a family with children have the choice of claiming the PIER if it is to their advantage.

This choice is to be available on a limited pay period basis on the new IR12. Taxpayers are permitted to select tax Code A if their total income is less than $14,600 and the "family income" for the year is expected to exceed $19,160.

In other cases it may be to the advantage of the taxpayer to claim the PIER in preference to the "Family Rebate" (under section 53C) where the family income exceeds $17,080 pa and the principal income earner earns less than $14,600. This choice will be made at the end of the year in the annual tax return.

**Amount of the Rebate**

From the 1983/84 income year, the amount of the rebate for qualifying taxpayers will be:

*   Where taxpayer's income is up to (and including) $5,672, the rebate will be 5.5 cents for each $1 of income;
*   Where taxpayer's income is between $5,672 and $12,001, the maximum rebate will apply, ie, $312;
*   Where taxpayer's income is over $12,000 and up to $14,600, the maximum rebate of $312 will abate at 12 cents for each $1 of income in excess of $12,000.

As the rebate will apply only from 1 October 1982, for the 1982/83 income year one-half of this principal income earner rebate will be available, ie:

*   Where taxpayer's income is up to (and including) $5,672, the rebate will be 2.75 cents for each $1 of income;
*   Where taxpayer's income is between $5,672 and $12,001, the rebate will be $156;
*   Where taxpayer's income is over $12,000 and up to $14,600, the maximum rebate of $156 will abate at 6 cents for each $1 of income in excess of $12,000.

This rebate was incorporated into the PAYE tables effective from 1 October 1982 under an "A" tax code.

**Grossing up of Rebate**

Subsection (3) of the section provides for the grossing up of the principal income earner's income where the taxpayer enters or leaves New Zealand during the income year.

This provision removes an anomaly which affected the former Low Income Family and Young Family Rebates and which would, if not removed, also affect the new Principal Income Earner rebate.

Until now, where a taxpayer has entered or left New Zealand permanently during an income year the family rebates were determined by reference to the income for that part of the year the taxpayer resided in New Zealand. Under this new provision, the taxpayer's income will be grossed up to its annual equivalent for the purposes of calculating the entitlement to the two new rebates. Thus, the underlying intent of the rebate, that the annual rebate be calculated by reference to the annual income, will be met.

**Example**

Taxpayer leaves New Zealand permanently on 31 December. During the period 1 April to 31 December he derives income of $11,250 equivalent to an annual income of $15,000. The following shows his taxation position with and without the grossing up of his income.

|     | Current Treatment | With Grossing up |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | $   | $   |     |
| Taxable Income | 11,250 | 15,000 |     |
| Tax (new scale) on $11,250 | 2,827.50 | 2,827.50 |     |
| Less PIER | 312.00 | Nil | (fully abated at |
|     |     |     | $14,600) |
| Actual tax liability | 2,515.50 | 2,827.50 |     |
| PAYE tax deducted\* | 2,992.50 | 2,992.50 |     |
| Refund | $477.00 | $165.00 |     |
| \* 75 percent of tax liability for full year on $15,000 after deducting PIER. |

Under the proviso to subsection (3) where a taxpayer has or will derive income from New Zealand either before his arrival in or after his departure from New Zealand (for example - self-employment or investment income) the Commissioner has a discretion in determining the income derived in the year by the taxpayer.

### _Sections 9 - Rebate for married man_

### _Section 10 - rebate for married woman_

### _Section11 - young family rebate_

### _Section12 - low income family rebate_

These sections give effect to the Budget announcement that from 1 October 1982 the Spouse, Young Family and Low Income Family rebates are to be replaced in favour of the new Family rebate.

**Family Assistance 1982/83 Year**

The existing spouse, young family and low income family rebates will still apply for the period 1 April 1982 to 30 September 1982. For the 1983 income year, therefore, the annual rebate entitlement will be halved:

|     | Spouse Rebate | Low Income Family Rebate | Young Family Rebate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum Annual Rebate |     |     |     |
| Entitlement | $78 | $234 | $234 |
| Abatement range | $521- | $9,801- | $13,701- |
|     | $1,300 | $13,700 | $17,600 |
| Abatement rate | 10 cents | 6 cents | 6 cents |
| Income against which abatement is calculated: Spouses Income, "Family" Income, Principal Income and Earners income. |     |     |     |

All other qualifying criteria remain unchanged. Subject to the above criteria taxpayers will be entitled to these rebates for the 1982/83 year even if marriage occurs or a child is born between 1 October 1982 and 31 March 1983. The 1983 tax return will have provision to claim half the old rebates and half of the new rebates.

The grossing up provisions in respect of the income of taxpayers arriving in or leaving New Zealand apply only to the new PIER and Family Rebate, not the existing rebates.

### Section 13 - Family Rebate

This section inserts a new section 53C in the principal Act implementing the new Family Rebate. This rebate, announced in the Budget, replaces the existing spouse, young family and low income family rebates.

The qualifying criteria for this rebate are identical to those applying to the present low income family rebate and they are therefore not repeated here.

**POINTS TO NOTE:**

**Amount of Rebate**

From the 1983/84 income year, the amount of the rebate for qualifying taxpayers will be:

*   Where the "family income" is up to $9,800, the rebate will be $1,404.
*   Where the "family income" is over $9,800 and up to $19,160, the rebate will abate at 15 cents for each $1 of income in excess of $9,800.

As the rebate will apply from 1 October 1982, for the 1982/83 income year one half of this family rebate will be available, ie:

*   Where the "family income" is up to $9,800, the rebate will be $702.
*   Where the "family income" is over $9,800 and up to $19,160, the maximum rebate of $702 will abate at 7.5 cents for each $1 of income in excess of $9,800.

**PAYE**

To incorporate the new rebate into the PAYE system, the existing 7 tax codes were replaced from 1 October 1982 by 7 new tax codes including one to cover the PIER. The full range is described in detail in the commentary to section 19.

The new family rebate is allowable (from 1 October 1982) on a pay period basis to:

*   Principal income earners in a married or de facto household with a qualifying child.
*   Solo parents.

The rebate is included in the new tax codes "B" to "F". The appropriate one of these tax codes is selected by totalling the income of the spouse (if any) and personal income from other sources and fitting that total into one of 5 income bands.

**Grossing up of Rebate**

The definition of "family income" contained in subsection   1 of the new section provides that both spouses' incomes are to be grossed up to full year equivalents where they enter or leave New Zealand permanently during the income year.

This grossing up removes an anomaly which affected the former LIFR and YFR and which would, if not removed, also affect the new Family rebates.

Until now, where a taxpayer entered or left New Zealand permanently during an income year the family rebates were determined by reference to the income for that part of the year the taxpayer resided in New Zealand. Under this provision, the taxpayer's income will be grossed up to its annual equivalent for the purposes of calculating his entitlement to the new Family Rebate. Thus, the underlying intent of the rebate, that the annual rebate be calculated by reference to the annual income, will be met.

**EXAMPLE:**

A two income family with one child leaves New Zealand permanently on 30 June. During the period 1 April to 30 June the principal income earner derives income of $8,000 and the spouse derives income of $1,000 - equivalent, on a time basis, to a combined annual income of $36,000. The following shows their respective tax positions, with and without the grossing up of their incomes.

|     |     | Current Treatment | With Grossing UP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Family Income" | $9,000 | $36,000 |     |
| **Principal Income Earner** |     |     |     |
| Tax (new scale) on |     |     |     |
| PIER's income | 1,820 | 1,820 | (fully abated at 19,160) |
| Less Family rebate | 1,404 | Nil |     |
|     |     | 416 | 1,820 |
| PAYE tax deducted\* | 2,652 | 2,652 |     |
| Refund | 2,236 | 832 |     |
| **Spouse** |     |     |     |
| Tax (new scale) on spouse's income | 200 | 200 |     |
| Less rebates | Nil | Nil |     |
|     |     | 200 | 200 |
| PAYE tax deducted\* | 200 | 200 |     |
| Refund | Nil | Nil |     |

\* 25 percent of tax liability for full year (after deducting family rebate in case of principal income earner).

**Choice of PIER in Certain Cases**

As stated in the commentary on section 8, principal income earners in a family with children have the choice of claiming the PIER if it is to their advantage.

This choice is to be available on a limited pay period basis on the new IR12. Taxpayers are permitted to select tax code A if their total income is less than $14,600 and the "family income" for the year is expected to exceed $19,160.

In other cases it may be to the advantage of the taxpayer to claim the PIER in preference to the "Family Rebate" where the family income exceeds $17,080 pa but is less than $19,160, and the principal income earner earns less than $14,600. This choice will be made at the end of the year in the annual tax return.

### Section 14 - Housekeeper Rebate

This section gives effect to the Budget announcement that from 1 October 1982 the housekeeper rebate will be calculated at the rate of 31 cents per dollar of qualifying expenditure up to a new maximum of $310 on expenditure of $1,000 (the current rebate is 40 cents per dollar up to a maximum of $156 on expenditure of $390).

As the change applies from 1 October 1982 the following table shows the position from 1982 onwards.

| Income Year ended 31 March | Rate (Percentage of Qualifying Expenditure) | Maximum Rebate | Maximum Qualifying Expenditure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1982 | 40  | $156 | $390 |
| 1983 | 35.5 | $233 | $656 |
| 1984 onwards | 31  | $310 | $1,000 |

The rebate will now be available on an end-of-year basis only, (although taxpayers may obtain a special tax code if they wish to continue to receive the rebate on a pay period basis). Apart from this, all other criteria remain the same as at present.

### Section 15 - Dependent Relative Rebate

This section gives effect to the Budget announcement that, from 1 October 1982, the dependent relative rebate will be calculated at the new rate of 31 cents per dollar of qualifying expenditure. The maximum level of the rebate will remain at $60 per dependent relative. However, the legislation provides that from the 1983 income year, the maximum number of dependent relatives in respect of whom 8 claim may be made is limited to two. Under no circumstances, therefore, can the total rebate claimed by a taxpayer exceed $120 in respect of any one income year.

The rate change applies from 1 October 1982. The following table illustrates the combined effect of the two changes to this rebate from 1982 onwards:

| Income Year Ended 31 March | Rate (Cents per dollar of Qual Exp) | Maximum Rebate per Relative | Maximum Quail-fying Exp. per Relative | Maximum No. of Relatives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1982 | 40  | $60 | $150 | No limit |
| 1983 | 35.5 | $60 | $169 | 2   |
| 1984 and subsequent | 31  | $60 | $193 | 2   |

Apart from the above, all other criteria remain the same.

### Section 16 - Donations And School Fees Rebate

This section gives effect to the Budget announcement that from 1 October 1982 the donations and school fees rebate will be calculated at the rate of 31 cents instead of 50 cents for each dollar of the amount paid and that the maximum rebate will be increased to $200 pa.

Because the change applies from 1 October 1982, ie, half way through the 1983 income year, the rate and maximum rebate for the 1983 year will be composed of one-half of each of the old and new figures as the following table shows:

| Income Year | Amount of Rebate | Maximum Qualifying Payment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1982 | Lesser of $175 or 50% of qualifying payments. | $350 |
| 1983 | Lesser of $187.50 or 40.5% of qualifying payments. | $463 |
| 1984 | Lesser of $200 or 31% of qualifying payments. | $645 |

Note that the only changes in this rebate are to the maximum rebate and the rate at which the rebate is calculated. All other criteria remain the same.

### Section 17 - Superannuation Contributions By Salary And Wage Earners

This section replaces the existing section 341 of the principal Act with a new section. It restricts the maximum amount of superannuation that may be deducted each pay period, before the calculation of the employee's PAYE tax deductions for the period, to the pay period equivalent of the maximum annual subsidised superannuation level.

**Application Date**

The pay period restriction applies in respect of all pay periods after 1 October 1982. As the maximum special exemption for contributions to subsidised superannuation schemes has been increased from 1 April 1983 the maximum pay period deduction for contributions made in pay periods ending in the period from 1 October 1982 to 31 March 1983 will be based on the present annual exemption level of $800 and from 1 April 1983 on the new annual exemption level of $1,200.

The pay period limitations are therefore:

| Pay Period | Ending in period 1 October 1982 to 31 March 1983 | Ending on or after 1 April 1983 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | $15.38 | $23.07 |
| Fortnightly | $30.76 | $46.14 |
| Three Weekly | $46.14 | $69.21 |
| Four Weekly | $61.52 | $92.28 |
| Monthly | $66.64 | $99.97 |

### Section 18 - Completion Of Withholding Payments Deduction Certificates - IR 13

Section 18 inserts a new section, 343A, which requires that from 1 October any person deriving withholding payments (the payee) must submit a completed Withholding Payments Declaration Certificate (IR13) to the person making the payments (the payer) before any payment is made. If the certificate is given to the payer not fully completed, the new section provides that a penalty rate of deduction of 15 cents in the dollar over and above the rate of withholding tax normally applicable to the payment be made. It should be noted that this penalty deduction, like the existing "no declaration" deduction for salary and wages, does not constitute a final tax liability, but is merely an increased rate of PAYE deduction which will be credited against any end-of-year tax liability.

The format of the new IR13 certificates now in use is significantly different from the format of previous IR13's. The old certificates were to be completed solely by the person making the withholding payment whereas the new certificates, reflecting the change in legislation, contain two panels; one to be completed by the payer after payment is made, the other to be completed by the payee before he receives payment. The person deriving the withholding payment (payee) must enter details of name, address, occupation, IRD number, and spouses name (if applicable) in the panel provided on the new IR13. Failure to provide any of the above details, or failure to hand the completed and signed form to the payer of the withholding payment before any payment is made will result in withholding tax being deducted at the normal rate applicable plus 15 cents in the dollar.

### Section 19 - Application of Tax Codes

Section 19 makes the necessary amendments to section 344 to incorporate the new principal income earner and family rebates into the PAYE system from 1 October 1982.

Subsection (1) sets out the qualifying criteria for each of the new tax codes as follows:

**Tax Code A:** Signifies entitlement to the Principal Income Earner Rebate

Tax codes "B" to "F" signify entitlement to the new family rebate. In order to give taxpayers the maximum benefit of the rebate through the PAYE system, it has been necessary, because of the large size of the rebate and the abatement criteria to "band" the tax codes in order to account for family income other than that derived by the principal income earner from his/her primary employment. For the purposes of a primary tax code, the "other" family income, defined as "extra income of the employee" in the new section 344(1)(a), is the total of:

*   The annual incomes of each other person comprising the "family"; and
*   The income of the employee other than that to which the primary tax code applies.

The choice of one of the tax codes "B" to "F" by the employee not only signifies entitlement to the new family rebate but also signifies a particular level of "other" family income. The amount of this "other" family income is as follows:

*   **Tax Code B:** "Other" family income not exceeding $500.
*   **Tax Code C:** "Other" family income exceeding $500 but not exceeding $2,500.
*   **Tax Code D:** "Other" family income exceeding $2,500 but not exceeding $4,500.
*   **Tax Code E:** "Other" family income exceeding $4,500 but not exceeding $6,500.
*   **Tax Code F:** "Other" family income exceeding $6,500 but not exceeding $8,500.
*   **Tax Code G:** Signifies either:
    *   entitlement to the new family rebate and "other" family income exceeding $8,500; or
    *   entitlement to neither the principal income earner rebate nor the new family rebate.

Subsection (2) substitutes a new subsection 344(1A), authorising lower abatement ranges for the family rebate on a pay period basis in cases of tax codes B to G.

### Section 20 - Cessation Of Tax Codes

Section 20 amends section 346 of the principal Act to provide that a taxpayer using one of the codes "B" to "F" shall cease to be entitled to the use of that code if that taxpayer knows or anticipates that he will not be entitled, for whatever reason, to the family rebate.

Similarly, the section also provides that a taxpayer using an "A" code shall cease to be entitled to the use of that code on becoming aware that he will not be entitled, for whatever reason, to the principal income earner rebate.

### Section 21 - Pay Period Taxpayers

Section 21 amends section 356 of the Act to further restrict the "pay-period taxpayer" concept.

From the income year that commenced on 1 April 1982, only where a taxpayer's annual income does not exceed $11,500 and comprises only income from employment (ie, any combination of salary or wages, national superannuation, or pensions for past services) and neither that taxpayer, nor any other member comprising the family of which that taxpayer is a member, is entitled to claim a family rebate, will the taxpayer not be required to furnish a return of income. In the case of a person who, under these rules, is not obliged to furnish a return, the annual tax liability is determined by the amount of PAYE deducted from that income, the PAYE deductions effectively being a final tax.

However, where a pay period taxpayer considers he is entitled to a refund because of an end-of-year adjustment (such as a life insurance exemption, dependent relative rebate, or housekeeper rebate) he is entitled to furnish a return and claim that refund.

Note: The pay-period provisions do not apply to any of the following taxpayers:

*   absentees,
*   those who derive any income as a shearer,
*   those to whom a special tax code applies,
*   those who have operated an incorrect tax code.

In all of the above cases, those taxpayers will be required to furnish returns.

**Withholding Payments**

Although not covered by this Amendment Act, the "pay period taxpayer" concept with respect to taxpayers in receipt of withholding payments has been amended by way of regulation. Briefly, the existing Withholding Payment Regulations provide that pay-period taxpayers include persons whose only income for the year is from withholding payments, or a combination of income from employment and withholding payments, not exceeding $4,900. The amendment made to the Regulations will mean that the above provision will not apply from the 1982/83 income year, ie, any taxpayer who derives any income from withholding payments after 31 March 1982 will not be a pay period taxpayer and will be required to furnish a return of income.

### Section 22 - Tax Deductions To Be Credited Against Tax Assessed

Section 22 adds to section 362(2) a proviso which removes the possibility of a shareholder employee of a private company, that has failed to account for PAYE tax deductions, being given a credit for those unpaid tax deductions in his annual income tax assessment.

As the detection of the fact that tax deductions shown in an IR12 have not been accounted for may not occur until after an assessment has been issued, a provision has been included, to give the Commissioner the power to recover any unpaid tax deductions which have been credited in the assessment. Accordingly, subsection (2) of section 22 substitutes the existing subsection (5) of section 362 with a new subsection (5). This provides that when a credit of tax deductions has been wrongly given to a shareholder employee, the shortfall in the pay deductions is jointly payable by the employee and the employer, and is to be paid to the department by the 31st day of May in the year after the year to which the tax deduction certificate relates.

### Sections 23 to 25 - Basic Rates of Income Tax

Section 23 inserts into the first Schedule of the principal Act the following composite tax rate scale which applies for the 1983 income year:

| Income Range | Tax (Cents per dollar) Rate |
| --- | --- |
| 0-5,500 | 17.25 |
| 5,501-6,000 | 27.5 |
| 6,001-12,600 | 33.0 |
| 12,601-17,600 | 39.5 |
| 17,601-22,000 | 43.0 |
| 22,001-24,000 | 45.5 |
| 24,001-30,000 | 52.55 |
| 30,001-38,000 | 58.05 |
| 38,001 and over | 63.0 |

This composite rate scale is a combination of the tax rates applying for the half-year from 1 April 1982 to 30 September 1982 and the new rates (including surtax - see note on s 25) applying from l October 1982 to 31 March 1983. This composite scale applies only for the 1982/83 income year.

As the Income Tax Amendment Act 1982 and the Income Tax (Annual) Act 1982 received the Governor-General's assent on 28 September 1982, the composite rate scale must be used for all early 1985 assessments made after that date (including "urgent" refunds for persons departing from New Zealand). Taxpayers who received early 1983 assessments based on the "old" rates who wish to be reassessed on the basis of the new tax structure may have this adjustment made by the Department. Note, however, that any such reassessments must be at the taxpayer's request.

Comments on the provisions of the Income Tax (Annual) Act 1982 are contained in

**_1983 Provisional Tax Re-estimation_**

To take into account the new tax rate scale provisional taxpayers may wish to re-estimate the second instalment of their 1983 provisional tax.

The form IR3P has been reintroduced for this purpose.

The form includes a simplified table of tax adjustments for those who wish to approximate the provisional tax adjustment. It also allows those who wish to use the actual tax rates to make the adjustment taking into account the changes to the family assistance rebates.

The form is to be used by provisional taxpayers and their agents in each case where there is a change to the provisional tax assessed. The form is self-explanatory but the following points should be noted:

*   It is not to be used where the taxpayer has recalculated the first instalment, and
*   It is not to be used where a taxpayer is re-estimating income on which provisional tax is payable. Form IR3E is to be used in this case.

**Sections 24 and   25** insert into the First Schedule of the principal Act the following two tax rate scales, either of which, subject to confirmation by the Income Tax (Annual) Act 1983, will apply for the 1984 and subsequent income years. The two rate scales result from the imposition of a temporary surtax of 10 percent of the marginal rates applying to income over $24,000, announced in the 1982 Budget.

**Basic Tax Scale (no surtax) (Section 24)**

| Income Range | Tax Rate (Cents per dollar) |
| --- | --- |
| 0-6,000 | 20.0 |
| 6,001-24,000 | 31.0 |
| 24,001-30,000 | 41.0 |
| 30,001-38,000 | 51.0 |
| 38,001 and over | 60.0 |

**Basic Tax Scale (including surtax) (Section 25)**

| Income Range | Tax Rate (cents per dollar) |
| --- | --- |
| 0-6,000 | 20.0 |
| 6,001-24,000 | 51.0 |
| 24,001-30,000 | 45.1 |
| 30,001-38,000 | 56.1 |
| 38,001 and over | 66.0 |

Although both the above rate scales have been inserted in the principal Act, neither can be used for any assessments until one has been confirmed by an Income Tax (Annual) Act.

### Section 26 - Basic Tax Deductions

This section makes the amendments necessary to incorporate the new tax rate scale (with surtax) into the PAYE tables for use from 1 October 1982 and also changes the rates of tax in respect of secondary employment income and extra emolument payments.

Subsection (1) substitutes new clauses 2 and   3 of the Second Schedule.

Clause 2, which provides that deductions made from weekly payments shall be made in accordance with the PAYE tables (see note on subsection (5)), has been amended so that payments to shearers are no longer excluded from its provisions.

Clause 3, which sets the "no declaration" rate of tax deduction, has been amended to provide that the income at which the "no declaration" rate transfers to the new "G" tax code is $672 per week. Note that the "no declaration" rate of deduction has not changed, ie, it is 35 cents in the dollar on weekly income not exceeding $672. On incomes over $672 per week the "C" code deduction is to apply. Clause 3 has also been amended so that payments to shearers are no longer excluded from its provisions.

Subsection (2) amends clause 6 of the Second Schedule to change the rate of tax deduction for payment of secondary employment income from 35 cents in the dollar to 31 cents in the dollar.

Subsection (3) completely alters the basis of calculation of tax deductions to be made from daily payments to shearers. The new clause 7 of the Second Schedule provides that the shearers' daily payment is to be multiplied by five, the tax deduction worked out from the weekly PAYE tables at the appropriate tax code, and that amount of deduction then divided by five to arrive at the amount of tax deduction to be made from the shearer's daily payment. In calculating the daily payment to be taxed, a 10 percent comb and cutter allowance should be deducted, and the value of any board and/or meals provided should be added.

A "daily earnings" table for shearers has been provided in the "Three Weekly, Four Weekly, Monthly" tables applying to pay periods ending on or after 1 October 1982.

Subsection (4) amends clause 9 of the Second Schedules to change the rate of tax deduction for payments of extra emoluments from 35 cents in the dollar to 31 cents in the dollar.

Subsection (5) inserts the new weekly PAYE tables into Appendix A of the Second Schedule to the principal Act.

Subsection (6), together with the amendments made by subsection (1), is consequential to the changes in the method of calculation of tax deductions made from daily payments to shearers. The removal of all references to "clause 7" in clauses 2,   3,   4 and   5 of the Second Schedule allows tax deductions from daily payments made to shearers to be calculated using the provisions of those four clauses. Such daily payments were previously excluded from the provisions of those clauses. The removal of all references to "clause 8" in clauses 2,   3,   4 and   5 follows the repeal of clause 8 which occurred in 1980.

### Section 27 - Home Study Expenses

This section amends the Fourth Schedule to the principal Act to provide that where an employee uses a portion of his home in connection with the carrying on of his employment, only those costs directly incurred and related to the use of the room or other defined area for that purpose will be regarded as having been incurred in the production of income from employment, and therefore deductible pursuant to sections 104 and   105 of the Act. The only items of expenditure that will qualify as a deduction from 1 April 1982 will be expenditure incurred on:

*   The repair or maintenance of the interior of that room or other defined area.
*   Electricity, gas, or other fuel consumed in heating and lighting that room or defined area.
*   Insurance on such of the contents of the room as are used wholly, or principally for the purpose of the employee's employment.

Costs, or any portion of the costs, incurred by way of interest, depreciation, rates, insurance, repairs to the structure as a whole, or rent of the property will no longer be deductible.

Income Tax Amendment Act 1983, Supplement 1
===========================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act 1983, Supplement 1 from PIB vol 126, suppl 1 Sep 1984.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 126, Supplement 1, September 1984

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

### Section 1 - Short Title

This section provides that this Amendment Act is to be read with, and as part of, the Income Tax Act 1976.

### Section 2 - Application

This section provides that the Act applies to interest derived from money lent and redemption payments under binding contracts entered into _on or after 29 July 1983_.

The provisions in this Act will not apply to any money lent where a binding contract was entered into on or before 28 July 1983. A binding contract is one where the performance of a party to the contract can be enforced by any other party.

Any interest arising from a loan in respect of which the Government of New Zealand approved the exemption of interest under the terms of section 61(18)(b) (as it was before it was repealed by this Amendment Act) on the recommendation of the Overseas Investment Commission will also be exempt from income tax.

The position of options, renewals or rearrangements of existing loans will depend on the facts of each case, but essentially if any renewal or rearrangement of an existing loan was provided for by a binding contract entered into prior to 29 July 1983 the provisions of this Amendment Act will not apply to the interest arising from any such renewal or rearrangement. For example, if a credit facility was subject to a contract entered into in 1982 and the contract included an option to renew that facility for a further year, the exercise of the option after 29 July 1983 would be considered to be in respect of money lent under a _binding contract entered into before 29 July 1983_.

On the other hand, where an existing contract does not provide for any extension or renewal of a loan, any such extension or renewal after 29 July 1983 will be a new loan.

### Section 3 - Meaning of Expressions

**a. Subsection (1)**

This subsection inserts four new definitions into section 2 of the principal Act.

**"Interest"**

Interest is defined _in relation to the deriving of income or non-resident withholding income_ by any person. This definition is therefore restricted to interest only in the context of income and does not alter the meaning of the term interest in respect of the deduction of interest in the calculation of assessable income. Wherever the term "interest" is used in the principal Act in respect of income or non-resident withholding income, it will now have the meaning of this defined term _unless_ it is expressly provided to be otherwise.

Interest now _means_ every payment received by a lender from and in respect of "money lent" other than the repayment of the principal sum lent or the repayment of a "redemption payment". The effect of this definition is that all returns to the lender, other than the loan capital repayments, will be interest for income tax purposes. This would include any premium received by the lender.

Payments that are interest must be directly related to payments arising from the borrowing of money lent. Interest does not include fees which are paid by the borrower in respect of professional services performed in arranging and/or managing the financial transaction. Examples of such fees would include, legal fees, management fees, procurement fees, brokerage, etc. If there is evidence that fees of this nature are being inflated to avoid income from money lent being taxed as interest, then consideration will be given as to whether section 99 should be applied.

It must be remembered that the imposition of non-resident withholding tax is always subject to the terms of Double Taxation Agreements. Any particular Double Taxation Agreement _may_ exempt certain interest payments or impose a different meaning of the term "interest" for the purpose of the agreement. Before any final decision can be made on the tax treatment of interest paid to a non-resident, both the Income Tax Act 1976 and the relevant Double Taxation Agreement must be taken into account.

**"Money Lent"**

A definition of "money lent" is also inserted in section 2 of the principal Act. "Money lent" is extensively defined, and while the definition covers the generally accepted meanings of the term in respect of money that is advanced, deposited, or otherwise let out and the giving of credit, it also includes any amount paid to a person in return for an agreement or promise to pay back a greater amount.

**Example:**

A pays B $80 and receives a promise from B to pay $100 in, say, three months time. The "money lent" is $80.

It should be noted that where there is an agreement or promise to pay an amount by any person, in consideration of a payment to an associated person the payment to that associated person is also "money lent".

**"Paid"**

The expression "paid" is defined to ensure that interest derived by a person is regarded as paid when it is dealt with for him in the ways set out. "Pay", "payable" and "payment" are correspondingly expanded.

**"Redemption Payment"**

A redemption payment is defined such that it is the amount paid to any person on the redemption of a commercial bill (as defined in section 65(1)(a) of the principal Act) owned by him, to the extent to which that amount exceeds the amount paid by any person for the issue of the bill.

**Example:**

A issues a bill with a face value of $100 to B and receives $80 in return. B then sells the bill to C for $95 who is the holder when it matures and receives $100 from A. The "redemption payment" is ($100 - $80), i.e., $20.

A redemption payment is excluded from the definition of "interest" in section 2 of the principal Act because the income arising from commercial bills is specifically included in assessable income under section 65(2)(k). However, a redemption payment is included in the definition of interest for the purposes of Part IX of the principal Act.

**Subsection (2)**

This subsection inserts a new definition of interest for the purposes of Part IX of the principal Act. This definition only extends the meaning of interest (as defined in section 2 of the principal Act) _for the purposes of non-resident withholding tax_. Furthermore, the meaning of interest includes a redemption payment _which is made_ to a non-resident who is not a person engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (essentially operating a branch in New Zealand). The effect of this definition is expanded in detail in subsection (1), together with its relationship to the other defined terms.

### Subsections (3) and (4)

These subsections are merely two consequential amendments arising from the definition of "money lent" being inserted in section 2 of the principal Act.

### Section 4 - Incomes Wholly Exempt from Tax

1.  **Subsection (1)**
2.  This subsection substitutes a new subsection 61(18) into the principal Act. The new subsection only exempts income (being interest or redemption payments) derived by non-resident lenders, and where that income is payable outside New Zealand, in respect of:
    *   Money lent to the Government of New Zealand.
    *   Money lent to local or public authorities for non-commercial activities, and where the Government of New Zealand has agreed the interest is to be exempt.

2.  **Subsection (2)**
3.  This subsection sets out the transitional measures in respect of exemptions from interest under the previous section 61(18)(b).

### Section 5 - Items Included in Assessable Income

This section inserts a new paragraph (ka) in section 65 of the principal Act, to cover a "redemption payment". A "redemption payment" will be assessable income where the redemption payment is in respect of a commercial bill that:

*   At the time of issue or at any time thereafter is acquired by a non-resident (but not where it is acquired in the carrying on by the non-resident of business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand); and
*   At the time or redemption is owned by a New Zealand resident, or by a non-resident in the course of carrying on by him of a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand.

The new paragraph (ka) will NOT, however, apply where the commercial bill concerned was issued:

*   By a New Zealand resident in relation to the carrying on by him of a business outside of New Zealand through a fixed establishment overseas;
*   By a non-resident UNLESS the commercial bill was issued in relation to the carrying on by him of a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand.

This section also consequentially amends section 65(2)(k) of the principal Act to ensure that subsection (2)(k) will not apply where subsection (2)(ka) applies.

Briefly, the effect of this amendment is that, subject to the two exceptions explained above, where a bill is issued by a New Zealand resident, redeemed from a New Zealand resident and at any time during its existence traded overseas, then the income of the person who holds that bill on maturity will be the "redemption payment", _not_just the difference between the cost of the bill to that holder and the full amount received on redemption.

### Section 6 - Classes of Income Deemed to be Derived from New Zealand

**A. Subsection (1)**

This subsection repeals the definition of "money lent" in section 243(1). This definition was no longer required as the insertion of a similar definition in section 2 of the principal Act also applies to section 243.

**Subsection (2)**

Subsection (2) repeals the existing paragraphs (l) and (m) in section 243(2) and replaces them with two new paragraphs:

1.  Paragraph (l) makes it explicit that income from money lent in New Zealand is "interest" or a "redemption payment" as defined in section 2 of the principal Act. Therefore any return to a lender, where the money is lent in New Zealand, in excess of the money advanced or a redemption payment will now be deemed to be derived from New Zealand.
2.  Paragraph (m) deems that income from money lent outside New Zealand to:
    *   any resident of New Zealand (not where the money lent is used by him in respect of business activities carried out through a fixed establishment overseas); or
    *   any non-resident for use in respect of business activities carried out by him through a fixed establishment in New Zealand,
3.  shall be derived from New Zealand.
    

**Practical Effect of New Definitions**

The definition of interest in the context of income received means that for the first time there is a statutory meaning given to the term. Previously the meaning of "interest" was that which the common law had established over the years. From now on, the meaning of interest in relation to the deriving of income or non-resident withholding income is that defined in the Act. The common law meaning of interest remains in relation to the deductibility of interest in calculating assessable income.

The meaning of interest as defined in this Amendment Act is now discussed in relation to certain financial transactions.

**Commercial Bills**

The changes in this Act will not affect the existing income tax provisions in respect of commercial bills issued, traded and redeemed in New Zealand. However, where commercial bills are redeemed to non-resident holders, the redemption payment (as defined in section 2) will be subject to non-resident withholding tax as it is now included in the meaning of interest in Part IX of the principal Act.

There are several points which must be borne in mind.

*   Any income arising from the _trading_ of a commercial bill outside of New Zealand by a non-resident will not be subject to New Zealand tax _unless_ it is in respect of the business operations carried on in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand.
*   Where the "redemption payment" is received by a non-resident _in relation to the business activities carried on by him through a fixed establishment in New Zealand_, it is _not subject_ to non-resident withholding tax. This is because in this situation a "redemption payment" is _not_ non-resident withholding income (see section 310(2)(b)). The income arising from the redemption of a commercial bill in these circumstances is assessable under section 65(2)(a).
*   A "redemption payment", received by a non-resident holder of a commercial bill, is not subject to New Zealand tax when the funds were used by a New Zealand resident for the purpose of a business carried on by him through a fixed establishment overseas (see section 243(2)(m)(i)).
*   Where a commercial bill is redeemed to a New Zealand resident holder on maturity and that bill is one which was issued to, or held at any time by, a non-resident (other than in the course of carrying on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand), the "redemption payment" will be assessable under section 65(2)(ka) _and the provisions of section 65(2)(k) will not apply_.

Other than when a bill is held overseas and ultimately redeemed in New Zealand, the effect of the amendments on commercial bills can be summarised in general as:

*   If the income arising from the trading and redemption of a commercial bill is taxed in New Zealand under the provisions of section 65(2)(a) or section 65(2)(k) then no further liability will arise from a "redemption payment".
*   Where these sections do not apply, and in general terms this is when the bill has been issued by a New Zealand resident to a non-resident and redeemed overseas, then a "redemption payment" arises and could be subject to non-resident withholding tax.

**Example:**

A is a New Zealand company which, in consideration for $900,000, issues a commercial bill to B (an overseas bank). B then sells the bill to C for $950,000. The bill has a face value of $1M.

**If C is a Non-Resident**

There is no New Zealand tax liability on the sale between B and C but, on redemption, $100,000 is a "redemption payment" and subject to non-resident withholding tax in New Zealand.

**If C is a New Zealand Resident**

There is no New Zealand tax liability on the sale between B and C, but C would be assessable in New Zealand on $100,000 under section 65(2)(ka).

**Other Lending**

A premium can be received by a lender in most financial transactions involving the borrowing of funds. This can take many forms but essentially it is no more than a repayment of an amount in excess of the amount advanced by the lender which is in the nature of interest but may not be interest at common law. A premium is included under the new definition of interest. A premium can also be represented by a discount granted by a borrower or holder of a bill.

The premium that arises from money lent will be assessable when it is derived. This will be a question of fact and regard will be had to the contractual obligations between the parties. A typical example of a premium payment which is now treated as interest is where a mortgagor requires a payment over and above the amount of money advanced to ensure the capital sum maintains its value in real terms, i.e., to compensate for the loss of purchasing power due to the effects of inflations.

The premium or in fact, any amount received by a lender from money lent, over and above the amount of money lent, has a source in New Zealand for income tax purposes under the definition of "interest". This means that where such payments are made to non-resident lenders they are subject to non-resident withholding tax.

Finally, it is essential to remember that these changes do not affect any payments arising from money lent under binding contractual obligations entered into on or after 29 July 1983. The actual lending or issue of a bill may take place after that date but as long as that lending or issue was the subject of a binding contract entered into before 29 July the Income Tax Amendment Act 1983 will have no effect.
